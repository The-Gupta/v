However, FIAU metabolism in tumor cells is largely unknown. Here, the biological characteristics of FIAU in human leukemia and lymphoma cells in vitro and in a xenotransplant severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-mouse model were investigated. METHODS: The susceptibility of FIAU to glycosidic bond cleavage by thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and its phosphorylation by human thymidine kinase 1 (hTK1) were examined. Cellular uptake and DNA-incorporation were determined in the leukemia cell line HL60 and the lymphoma cell line DoHH2. Biodistribution, in vivo stability of FIAU and expression of proliferation marker(67)Ki and thymidylate synthase were assessed in SCID-mice bearing HL60 xenotransplants. Cellular distribution of FIAU was imaged by microautoradiography. RESULTS: FIAU proved to be stable against degradation by TP and was phosphorylated by hTK1. Significant cellular uptake in DoHH2 and in HL60 cells was observed. The majority of intracellular [(131)I]FIAU was DNA incorporated. In vivo, moderate dehalogenation of [(131)I]FIAU was observed. Biodistribution studies showed a tumor uptake of 1.8+/-0.4% ID/g after 30 min. The half-life of [(131)I]FIAU in blood was 43+/-2 min. Microautoradiography showed a modest accumulation of [(125)I]FIAU in proliferating cells of small intestine, spleen and tumor. CONCLUSION: Despite phosphorylation by the hTK, efficient incorporation into the DNA and high in vivo stability, FIAU accumulates only moderately and transiently in proliferating cells, suggesting that FIAU is probably not appropriate for imaging of proliferation.","['Morgenroth, A', 'Deisenhofer, S', 'Neininger, M', 'Vogg, A T J', 'Glatting, G', 'Kull, T', 'Reske, S N']","['Morgenroth A', 'Deisenhofer S', 'Neininger M', 'Vogg AT', 'Glatting G', 'Kull T', 'Reske SN']","['Unit of Nuclear Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080425,Italy,Q J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,"The quarterly journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging : official publication of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) [and] the International Association of Radiopharmacology (IAR), [and] Section of the Society of...",101213861,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', '53T7IN77LC (fialuridine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.4 (Thymidine Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Thymidine Phosphorylase/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",2008/04/25 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/04/25 09:00'],"['2008/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['R39082074 [pii]'],ppublish,Q J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2008 Sep;52(3):305-16.

Familial CLL families have been studied to identify susceptibility genes and other factors that contribute in the etiology of CLL. To date no study has been conducted to evaluate and compare patterns of cell surface antigen expression in familial CLL and sporadic CLL. METHODS: The pattern of cell surface antigen expression was studied in familial and sporadic CLL to determine if unique identifiers of familial CLL could be detected. Survival in familial CLL verses sporadic CLL was compared and the association between prognosis and CD38 expression studied. RESULTS: Familial and sporadic CLL demonstrated the same characteristic immunophenotype (positive for surface immunoglobulin, CD5, CD19, and CD23 with dim CD20, and CD22). CD2 and CD13 expression, however, were more frequent (30% of cases) in familial CLL (P = 0.0003 for CD2, P = 0.006 for CD13) than in sporadic CLL (2-6%). There was no significant difference in survival in the two groups studied. Although the incidence of CD38 expression was similar in familial and sporadic CLL (47% and 44% respectively) the association with prognosis differed. There was a trend to decreased survival in CD38 positive sporadic (P = 0.06) but not familial CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that detection of CD2 or CD13 expression in CLL suggests familial CLL and examination of family history for additional affected members is warranted. Furthermore, CD38 expression does not carry the negative prognosis observed in sporadic CLL.","['Ahmad, Ejaz', 'Steinberg, Seth M', 'Goldin, Lynn', 'Hess, Christopher J', 'Caporaso, Neil', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Wilson, Wyndham', 'White, Therese', 'Marti, Gerald', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice']","['Ahmad E', 'Steinberg SM', 'Goldin L', 'Hess CJ', 'Caporaso N', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Wiestner A', 'Wilson W', 'White T', 'Marti G', 'Stetler-Stevenson M']","['Good Samaritan Hospital, Dayton, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

The mechanisms by which arsenic-containing compounds kill cells and reasons for selective killing of only certain types of cancer cells such as APLs have recently been delineated. This knowledge was gained in parallel with increasing understanding and awareness of the importance of intracellular redox systems and regulation of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by controlling mitochondrial function. Many of the targets for the arsenic-containing compounds are mitochondrial proteins involved in regulating the production of ROS. Inhibition of these proteins by disulfide linkage of vicinal thiol groups often leads to increased production of ROS and induction of apoptotic signalling pathways. Sensitivity or resistance to the actions of arsenic-containing compounds on cancer cells and normal cells depends on the levels of transport systems for their uptake or efflux from the cells as well as their redox defence mechanisms. The exact mechanisms of arsenic toxicity as well as its anticancer properties are likely to be related and these aspects of arsenic metabolism are covered in this review. Greater understanding of the mechanisms of action of arsenic will help determine the risks of human exposure to this chemical. Novel organic arsenic-containing compounds and the lessons learned from studying their selective sensitivity in targeting dividing endothelial cells to inhibit angiogenesis raise the future possibility for designing better targeted antineoplastic arsenic-containing compounds with less toxicity to normal cells.,"['Ralph, Stephen John']",['Ralph SJ'],"['School of Medical Sciences, Griffith University, Parklands Drive, Southport, Queensland 4215, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Met Based Drugs,Metal-based drugs,9505939,,,,2008/04/24 09:00,2008/04/24 09:01,['2008/04/24 09:00'],"['2007/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/24 09:01 [medline]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1155/2008/260146 [doi]'],ppublish,Met Based Drugs. 2008;2008:260146. doi: 10.1155/2008/260146.,,,10.1155/2008/260146 [doi],PMC2292810,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, TMZ may be cytotoxic to BCNU-resistant cancer cells because MMR affects sensitivity to TMZ and BCNU in a converse way. We evaluated TMZ cytotoxicity on BCNU-resistant variant (CEM-R) compared with the parental CCRF-CEM cell line (CEM-S). The mechanisms of its BCNU-resistance involved DNA repairs including nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, alkylguanine alkyltransferase, MMR, and apoptotic and survival pathways. In particular, transcript levels of MMR-related hMLH1 and hMSH2 were enhanced in CEM-R cells. CEM-R cells were 8-fold more BCNU-resistant but surprisingly 9-fold more TMZ-sensitive than were CEM-S cells. Although TMZ-induced adducts include N-alkylated purines and O(6)-alkylguaine, DNA excision repair was enhanced in CEM-R cells, suggesting the efficient repair of N-alkylation adducts. Cotreatment with methoxyamine, a base excision repair inhibitor, did not sensitize CEM-R cells to TMZ, suggesting little or no contribution of N-alkylation to TMZ-induced cytotoxicity. Cotreatment with O(6)-benzylguanine, an alkylguanine alkyltransferase inhibitor, further sensitized CEM-R cells to TMZ, confirming the cytotoxic impact of O(6)-alkylguanine. Cotreatment with cadmium chloride, an MMR inhibitor, disrupted the sensitivity of CEM-R cells to TMZ. The sensitivity to TMZ was reversed in the CEM-R variant clone that had been established by transfecting CEM-R cells with short hairpin hRNA against hMLH1, suggesting the critical role of MMR on sensitization to TMZ. In conclusion, BCNU-resistant CEM-R cells were sensitized to TMZ as a result of enhanced MMR during the development of BCNU resistance.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Ogawa, Masami', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Ogawa M', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Fukui, 23 Shimoaizuki, Matsuoka, Eiheiji, Fukui 910-1193, Japan. tyamauch@u-fukui.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080422,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Hydroxylamines)', '01KC87F8FE (O(6)-benzylguanine)', '0S726V972K (Nimustine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '9TZH4WY30J (methoxyamine)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cadmium Chloride/administration & dosage', 'Carmustine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Mismatch Repair/*drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Guanine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylamines/administration & dosage', 'Nimustine/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Temozolomide']",2008/04/24 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/04/24 09:00'],"['2008/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.107.041988 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.107.041988 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2008 Jul;74(1):82-91. doi: 10.1124/mol.107.041988.

Five-year cumulative survival percentages were 76% for lymphoproliferative disorders and 68% for solid tumours. Survival rates in 1994-1998 significantly improved for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and Wilms' tumour. Gender and age were determinants of survival for some specific types of cancer. Girls with ALL and neuroblastoma exhibited a significant advantage (hazard ratio HR 0.72, 0.62-0.83) and disadvantage (HR 0.73, 0.59-0.90) over boys, respectively. Children with a Wilms' tumour diagnosed above age 3 had a worse prognosis than younger children (HR 2.3, 1.4-4.1).

Limited evidence indicates that it is also expressed, albeit to a lesser extent, in tissues other than thymus and spleen, while, very recently, it was shown that Foxp3 is expressed by pancreatic carcinoma. This study was scheduled to investigate whether expression of Foxp3 transcripts and mature protein occurs constitutively in various tumor types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty five tumor cell lines of different tissue origins (lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, erythroid leukemia, acute T-cell leukemia) were studied. Detection of Foxp3 mRNA was performed using both conventional RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR while protein expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry, using different antibody clones. RESULTS: Foxp3 mRNA as well as Foxp3 protein was detected in all tumor cell lines, albeit in variable levels, not related to the tissue of origin. This expression correlated with the expression levels of IL-10 and TGFb1. CONCLUSION: We offer evidence that Foxp3 expression, characterizes tumor cells of various tissue origins. The biological significance of these findings warrants further investigation in the context of tumor immune escape, and especially under the light of current anti-cancer efforts interfering with Foxp3 expression.","['Karanikas, Vaios', 'Speletas, Matthaios', 'Zamanakou, Maria', 'Kalala, Fani', 'Loules, Gedeon', 'Kerenidi, Theodora', 'Barda, Angeliki K', 'Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos I', 'Germenis, Anastasios E']","['Karanikas V', 'Speletas M', 'Zamanakou M', 'Kalala F', 'Loules G', 'Kerenidi T', 'Barda AK', 'Gourgoulianis KI', 'Germenis AE']","['Cancer Immunology Unit, Department of Immunology and Histocompatibility, School of Medicine, University of Thessaly, University Hospital of Larissa, GR-411 10 Larissa, Greece. vkaran@med.uth.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080422,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/biosynthesis']",2008/04/24 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/04/24 09:00'],"['2007/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1479-5876-6-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-6-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2008 Apr 22;6:19. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-6-19.,,,10.1186/1479-5876-6-19 [doi],PMC2386447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, diagnosis of most IFIs, especially of invasive aspergillosis, is difficult because classic tests have low sensitivity and specificity, and radiology often provides non-specific and transient results. The limited sensitivity and specificity of conventional assays for the detection of IFI and the growing number of immunocompromised patients who are at risk for opportunistic fungal infections have led to the development of new assays. These methods include antigen detection systems, such as ELISAs, and different molecular methods (PCR assays). Serological tests, such as the detection of the carbohydrate galactomannan, are standardised and commercially available. However, they still need to be evaluated in large patient cohorts, especially children. The benefit of antibody detection remains unclear if patients are under immune suppression or are heavily colonised but not infected. A range of different PCR assays (conventional, nested, real-time) have been developed, targeting different gene regions (cytochrome P450, heat-shock proteins, 18S, 5.8S, 28S, internal transcribed spacer), including a variety of amplicon detection methods, such as gel electrophoresis, hybridisation with specific probes, ELISA and restriction fragment length polymorphism. These molecular assays provide high potential in terms of sensitivity and specificity, but vary widely in their feasibility and up to now have not been standardised. Taken together, new non-culture-based diagnostic assays are appropriate as simple and rapid screening tests with high sensitivities and quick turnaround times. Thus, they might help to reduce empirical antifungal therapy and might be valuable tools to allow early initiation and monitoring of pre-emptive antifungal therapy. In this review, we assess the performance of a variety of non-culture-based tests for the detection of IFI in high-risk haematological patients, with emphasis on the impact of the assays on different management strategies.","['Einsele, H', 'Loeffler, J']","['Einsele H', 'Loeffler J']","['Medizinische Klinik II, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,"['0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Aspergillosis/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology', 'Aspergillus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Fungal/chemistry/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Mannans/blood', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'beta-Glucans/blood']",2008/04/24 09:00,2008/08/15 09:00,['2008/04/24 09:00'],"['2008/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1198-743X(14)61615-3 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1469-0691.2008.01980.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 2008 May;14 Suppl 4:37-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2008.01980.x.,72,,10.1111/j.1469-0691.2008.01980.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the usefulness of diagnostic-therapeutic guidelines (DTG) in which specific times for decision making were incorporated. METHODS: Clinical charts of children with acute leukaemia and suspicion of pulmonary involvement were reviewed. Patients were allocated to group I if their diagnostic and therapeutic decisions were in accordance with the DTG, and to group II if not. RESULTS: Children from group I (n=32) and group II (n=28) did not differ with respect to age (9.3+/-0.5 years old, mean+/-SEM), gender, type, risk and stage of leukaemia, anaemia and neutropenia. Total length of hospital stay and hospitalization due to the pulmonary disease were shorter in group I than in group II (14.8+/-2.1 vs. 28.5+/-3.7 days, p=0.0016; and 10.8+/-1.0 vs. 18.4+/-1.8 days, p=0.0003, respectively). Two patients (6.3%) died due to the pulmonary pathology in group I, and nine (32.1%, p=0.016) in group II.

Within one month, he developed painful hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites, and weight gain, and was diagnosed with biopsy-proven SOS. Despite therapy with defibrotide, he continued to deteriorate with the development of progressive renal failure and encephalopathy. The patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. After surgery, he developed cytomegalovirus infection and six wk later presented with a bile leak, hepatic artery thrombosis, and a liver abscess. A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of recurrent disease. Although the patient was listed for re-transplantation, he succumbed prior to an organ becoming available. CONCLUSION: Severe SOS in the setting of bone marrow transplantation portends a poor prognosis. Careful patient selection, timing, and perhaps less immunosuppression should be considered when performing a liver transplantation in the setting of severe SOS.","['Membreno, Fernando E', 'Ortiz, Jorge', 'Foster, Preston F', 'Wright, Francis', 'Ostrower, Victor S', 'Metter, John D', 'Palma-Vargas, Juan', 'LeMaistre, Charles F']","['Membreno FE', 'Ortiz J', 'Foster PF', 'Wright F', 'Ostrower VS', 'Metter JD', 'Palma-Vargas J', 'LeMaistre CF']","['Texas Transplant Institute, Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA. fernando.membreno@mhshealth.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20080421,Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Databases, Factual', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2008/04/24 09:00,2008/12/19 09:00,['2008/04/24 09:00'],"['2008/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['CTR814 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-0012.2008.00814.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2008 Jul-Aug;22(4):397-404. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2008.00814.x.

This results in the expression of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, a constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase. Although there are a few treatment options with Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors, drug resistance is often encountered. One of the major obstacles in overcoming drug resistance in CML is the high endogenous levels of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Resveratrol is a phytoalexin produced by several plants. We studied the chemotherapeutic effects and mode of action of resveratrol on K562 (CML) cells. Resveratrol induced apoptosis in K562 cells in a time-dependent manner. This was established by increased annexin V binding, corroborated with an enhanced caspase-3 activity and a rise in the sub-G(0)/G(1) population. Resveratrol treatment also caused suppression of Hsp70 both in mRNA and protein levels. The downregulation of Hsp70 by resveratrol exposure was correlated with a diminished presence of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in the nucleus, and the downregulation of transcriptional activity of HSF1. High endogenous levels of Hsp70 have been found to be a deterrent for sensitivity to chemotherapy. We show here that resveratrol could considerably enhance the apoptosis induction in K562 cells by 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, an anticancer agent that inhibits Hsp90 but augments Hsp70 levels. We conclude that resveratrol significantly downregulated Hsp70 levels through inhibition of HSF1 transcriptional activity and appreciably augmented the pro-apoptotic effects of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin.","['Chakraborty, Prabir K', 'Mustafi, Soumyajit Banerjee', 'Ganguly, Sudipto', 'Chatterjee, Mitali', 'Raha, Sanghamitra']","['Chakraborty PK', 'Mustafi SB', 'Ganguly S', 'Chatterjee M', 'Raha S']","['Crystallography and Molecular Biology Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, 1/AF Bidhan Nagar, Kolkata-700064, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080421,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Resveratrol', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2008/04/24 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/04/24 09:00'],"['2008/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS809 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00809.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Jun;99(6):1109-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00809.x.

In the present study, we investigated the activity of a novel Aurora kinase inhibitor, VE-465, against leukemia cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL or the T315I mutant form of BCR-ABL. We observed a dose-dependent reduction in the level of BCR-ABL autophosphorylation in VE-465-treated cells. Exposure to the combination of VE-465 and imatinib exerted an enhanced apoptotic effect in K562 cells. Combined treatment with VE-465 and imatinib caused more attenuation of the levels of phospho-AKT and c-Myc in K562 cells. Further, the isobologram indicated the synergistic effect of simultaneous exposure to VE-465 and imatinib in K562 cells. To assess the in vivo efficacy of VE-465, athymic nude mice were injected intravenously with BaF3 cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL or the T315I mutant form. The vehicle-treated mice died of a condition resembling acute leukemia by 28 days; however, nearly all mice treated with VE-465 (75 mg/kg, twice daily; intraperitoneally for 14 days) survived for more than 56 days. Histopathological analysis of vehicle-treated mice revealed infiltration of the spleen. In contrast, histopathological analysis of organs from VE-465-treated mice demonstrated normal tissue architecture. Taken together, the present study shows that VE-465 exhibits a desirable therapeutic index that can reduce the in vivo growth of T315I mutant form and wild-type BCR-ABL-expressing cells in an efficacious manner.","['Akahane, Daigo', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Okabe, Seiichi', 'Nunoda, Kousuke', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Akahane D', 'Tauchi T', 'Okabe S', 'Nunoda K', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080421,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '639089-54-6 (VX680)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",2008/04/24 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/04/24 09:00'],"['2008/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS810 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00810.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Jun;99(6):1251-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00810.x.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate late endocrine and metabolic complications in adult survivors of childhood ALL and NHL, in relation with the different therapeutic schemes received. DESIGN: Endocrine and metabolic parameters were determined in 94 patients (48 men, mean age: 24 +/- 5 years) with a former childhood ALL (n = 78) or NHL (n = 16) and subgrouped according to their previous treatment: chemo only (group I; n = 44), chemo + CI (group II; n = 32) and chemo + BMT/TBI (group III; n = 18). RESULTS: Severe GH deficiency (peak < 3.0 ng/ml after glucagon) was observed in 22% and 50% of patients of groups II and III, respectively, while hypothyroidism was mainly observed in group III (56%). Moreover, 83% of men developed hypogonadism after BMT/TBI, compared to 17% and 8% in groups I and II, respectively (P < 0.05), and all grafted women had ovarian failure, in contrast with other female patients in whom menarche had occurred spontaneously. Patients with BMT/TBI had also an adverse metabolic profile, with insulin resistance in 83% and dyslipidaemia in 61%. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a high prevalence of endocrine and metabolic disorders in young adult survivors of childhood ALL or NHL, this frequency mainly depending on the treatment received. Treatment with BMT/TBI is the most detrimental and many of these patients will develop GHD, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia.","['Steffens, M', 'Beauloye, V', 'Brichard, B', 'Robert, A', 'Alexopoulou, O', 'Vermylen, Ch', 'Maiter, D']","['Steffens M', 'Beauloye V', 'Brichard B', 'Robert A', 'Alexopoulou O', 'Vermylen Ch', 'Maiter D']","['Divisions of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Cliniques Universitaires St Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080421,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Endocrine System Diseases/complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Gonads/physiology', 'Human Growth Hormone/blood/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology/rehabilitation', 'Male', 'Metabolic Diseases/complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*epidemiology/physiopathology/rehabilitation', 'Prevalence', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Thyroid Gland/physiology', 'Young Adult']",2008/04/24 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2008/04/24 09:00'],"['2008/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEN3283 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2265.2008.03283.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2008 Nov;69(5):819-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.2008.03283.x.

METHODS: We used 60-month survival data from the IRIS (International Randomized study of Interferon vs STI571) trial to update previously published cost-effectiveness estimates, based on 19 months of follow-up, of imatinib versus interferon (IFN)-alpha plus low-dose cytarabine in patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. For patients treated with imatinib, we used the 60-month data to calibrate the survival curves generated from the original cost-effectiveness model. We used historical data to model survival for patients randomized to IFNalpha. We updated costs for medical resources using 2006 Medicare reimbursement rates and applied average wholesale prices (AWPs) and wholesale acquisition costs (WACs) to study medications. RESULTS: Five-year survival for patients randomized to imatinib was better than predicted in the original model (89.4% vs 83.2%). We estimated remaining life expectancy with first-line imatinib to be 19.1 life-years (3.8 life-years over the original model) and 15.2 QALYs (3.1 QALYs over the original estimate). Estimates for IFNalpha remained at 9.1 life-years and 6.3 QALYs. When we applied AWPs to study medications, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were $US 51,800-57,500 per QALY. When we applied WACs, ICERs were $US 42,000-46,200 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Although the analysis revealed that the original survival estimates were conservative, the updated cost-effectiveness ratios were consistent with, or slightly higher than, the original estimates, depending on the method for assigning costs to study medications.","['Reed, Shelby D', 'Anstrom, Kevin J', 'Li, Yanhong', 'Schulman, Kevin A']","['Reed SD', 'Anstrom KJ', 'Li Y', 'Schulman KA']","['Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina 27715, USA. shelby.reed@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/04/24 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2008/04/24 09:00'],"['2008/04/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['2657 [pii]', '10.2165/00019053-200826050-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2008;26(5):435-46. doi: 10.2165/00019053-200826050-00007.,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review the clinical course and treatment outcome of 65 children APL. PROCEDURE: Between January 1999 and December 2005, 65 children (<18 years) with newly diagnosed APL were treated. RESULTS: Three groups of patients were identified according to the different induction regimens. Forty patients were given ATRA alone (group 1, G1), 8 patients were given As2O3 alone (group 2, G2), 15 patients (group 3, G3) were treated with combination of ATRA and As2O3. Two patients received cytosine arabinoside and died at days 2 and 4, respectively. The CR rate of G1 was 95% (38/40). The overall CR rate of G2+G3 was 91.3% (21/23). Toxicity of ATRA and As2O3 were minimal and recoverable during induction. Five children had a hematologic relapse and two developed molecular relapse. Five of them were successfully treated with ATRA alone or combined with As2O3. The 5-year estimate of EFS, DFS and OS between G1 and G2+G3 has no difference.

The BCR-ABL fusion occurs in all cases of classical CML and leukaemic cells express a constitutively activated BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Other fusion oncogenes involving tyrosine kinases, including ABL and PDGFRA/B, have been identified, and are associated with leukaemic syndromes that may resemble CML. The discovery and treatment of these related disorders has been facilitated by our detailed understanding of CML. Imatinib mesylate has significantly improved the outcome of patients with CML, but there remains a significant minority of chronic phase CML patients for whom the response to treatment with standard dose imatinib is suboptimal. Cytogenetic and molecular monitoring of the response to treatment provides important prognostic information. Achievement of a major molecular response (MMR) in chronic phase patients treated de novo with imatinib confers near 100% freedom from progression to advanced phase, and MMR is now an important goal of therapy. Standardisation of BCR-ABL molecular monitoring is under way and should enable the accurate and reproducible identification of MMR in laboratories around the world. Point mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL are the most common cause of acquired resistance to imatinib treatment. The susceptibility of a mutation to imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib may help to guide changes in therapy in a patient with resistance. In addition to these established methods of monitoring, there are new tests in development that may assist in determining prognosis and optimising therapy. Among patients receiving the same dose of imatinib, the plasma level of imatinib shows considerable inter-patient variation, and there is emerging evidence that higher levels may be associated with improved response to treatment. The intracellular concentration of imatinib also shows considerable variation, most likely related to differences in influx and efflux transport mechanisms. We discuss how these established and emerging assays might be used to optimise the treatment of CML patients.","['Ross, D M', 'Hughes, T P']","['Ross DM', 'Hughes TP']","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia. david.ross@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",2008/04/23 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0031-3025(16)32384-4 [pii]', '10.1080/00313020801916172 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathology. 2008 Apr;40(3):231-46. doi: 10.1080/00313020801916172.,195,,10.1080/00313020801916172 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incidence and risk factors.,276-80,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy is an integral part of various therapeutic regimens in pediatric and adult oncology. Endocrine dysfunction, neurologic and psychiatric deficits, secondary malignancies and radiation-induced necrosis are well-known possible late effects of cranial irradiation. However, only sporadic cases of radiation-induced cavernous hemangiomas (RICH) have been reported so far. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients who underwent cranial radiation therapy for malignant diseases between January 1980 and December 2003 were retrospectively analyzed. After the end of therapy they entered a detailed follow-up program. RESULTS: Of 171 patients, eight (three patients with medulloblastoma, three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and one patient each with ependymoma and craniopharyngioma) developed intracerebral cavernoma 2.9-18.4 years after irradiation representing a cumulative incidence (according to the Kaplan-Meier method) of 2.24%, 3.86%, 4.95%, and 6.74% within 5, 10, 15, and 20 years following radiation therapy, respectively. In patients treated in the first 10 years of life, RICH occurred with shorter latency and significantly more often (p = 0.044) resulting in an even higher cumulative incidence. CONCLUSION: These findings and previously published cases show that cavernous hemangiomas may occur after irradiation of the brain several years after the end of therapy irrespective of the radiation dose and type of malignancy. Particularly children < 10 years of age at the time of irradiation are at higher risk. Since patients with RICH frequently do not show symptoms but hemorrhage is a possible severe complication, imaging of the central nervous system should be performed routinely for longer follow- ups, particularly in patients who were treated as young children.","['Strenger, Volker', 'Sovinz, Petra', 'Lackner, Herwig', 'Dornbusch, Hans Jurgen', 'Lingitz, Helga', 'Eder, Hans G', 'Moser, Andrea', 'Urban, Christian']","['Strenger V', 'Sovinz P', 'Lackner H', 'Dornbusch HJ', 'Lingitz H', 'Eder HG', 'Moser A', 'Urban C']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Austria. volker.strenger@meduni-graz.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Such situations prevail when testing for differential expression of genes in microarray studies. The Cramer-von Mises two-sample test, based on a certain L-distance between two empirical distribution functions, is a distribution-free test that has proven itself as a good choice. A numerical algorithm is available for computing quantiles of the sampling distribution of the Cramer-von Mises test statistic in finite samples. However, the computation is very time- and space-consuming. An L(1) counterpart of the Cramer-von Mises test represents an appealing alternative. In this work, we present an efficient algorithm for computing exact quantiles of the L(1)-distance test statistic. The performance and power of the L(1)-distance test are compared with those of the Cramer-von Mises and two other classical tests, using both simulated data and a large set of microarray data on childhood leukemia. The L(1)-distance test appears to be nearly as powerful as its L(2) counterpart. The lower computational intensity of the L(1)-distance test allows computation of exact quantiles of the null distribution for larger sample sizes than is possible for the Cramer-von Mises test.","['Xiao, Yuanhui', 'Gordon, Alexander', 'Yakovlev, Andrei']","['Xiao Y', 'Gordon A', 'Yakovlev A']","['Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of Rochester, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol,EURASIP journal on bioinformatics & systems biology,101263720,,,,2008/04/23 09:00,2008/04/23 09:01,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2006/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:01 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1155/BSB/2006/85769 [doi]'],ppublish,EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol. 2006:85769. doi: 10.1155/BSB/2006/85769.,,,10.1155/BSB/2006/85769 [doi],PMC3171322,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we show that Bcr-Abl transformed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines, K562 and Meg-01, express the receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), TrkA, on the cell surface; however, the NGF-mediated signal is not particularly strong. Treatment with imatinib, a potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, downmodulates phosphorylation of downstream molecules. Upon stimulation with NGF, Erk and Akt are phosphorylated to a much greater degree in imatinib-treated cells than in untreated cells. Knockdown of expression of Bcr-Abl using small interfering RNA technique also enhanced NGF-mediated Akt phosphorylation, indicating that Bcr-Abl kinase modifies NGF signaling directly. Imatinib treatment also enhanced NGF signaling in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 that expresses TrkA and c-Abl, suggesting that it is not only restoration of responsiveness to NGF after blocking oncoprotein activity, but also c-Abl tyrosine kinase per se may be a negative regulator of growth factor signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of Abl tyrosine kinase enhanced clearance of surface TrkA after NGF treatment and simultaneously enhanced NGF-mediated signaling, suggesting that as in neuronal cells 'signaling endosomes' are formed in hematopoietic cells. To examine the role of TrkA in CML cells, we studied cell growth or colony formation in the presence or absence of imatinib with or without NGF. We found that NGF treatment induces cell survival in imatinib-treated CML cell lines, as well as colony formation of primary CD34+ CML cells, strongly suggesting that NGF/TrkA signaling contributes to aberrant signaling in CML.","['Koch, A', 'Scherr, M', 'Breyer, B', 'Mancini, A', 'Kardinal, C', 'Battmer, K', 'Eder, M', 'Tamura, T']","['Koch A', 'Scherr M', 'Breyer B', 'Mancini A', 'Kardinal C', 'Battmer K', 'Eder M', 'Tamura T']","['Institut fur Biochemie, OE 4310, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080421,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Silencing/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'PC12 Cells', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptor, trkA/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2008/04/23 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008107 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.107 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Aug 7;27(34):4678-89. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.107.

The late-stage leukemias and disseminated and metastatic sarcomas, melanomas, brain tumors and epithelial cancers are the devastating diseases associated with a high rate of recurrence after treatment with the conventional clinical therapies including surgery, ionizing radiation, hormonal therapy and systemic chemotherapy, which generally lead to the death of patients. Therefore, the establishment of the molecular events underlying cancer initiation and progression into locally invasive and metastatic diseases is of major interest in basic cancer research as well as for the development of new effective clinical therapeutic options against the recurrent and lethal cancers. Recent advances have led to the identification of specific oncogenic products that are implicated in the malignant transformation of adult stem/progenitor cells into leukemic or tumorigenic and migrating cancer stem/progenitor cells during cancer progression. Of therapeutic interest, the molecular targeting of deregulated signaling elements in cancer stem/progenitor cells and their local microenvironment represents a new potential strategy for the development of more effective clinical treatments against aggressive cancers. Particularly, the combined use of chemotherapeutic drugs to eradicate cancer-initiating cells with hematopoietic stem cell or genetically-modified stem cell transplant is emerging as potential cancer treatments that hold great promise in the area of clinical cancer research. These targeting and stem cell-based therapies may offer the ultimate hope for treating and even curing the patients diagnosed with locally advanced cancers at high risk of recurrence, metastatic and/or relapsed cancers in the clinics.","['Mimeault, M', 'Batra, S K']","['Mimeault M', 'Batra SK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5870, USA. mmimeault@unmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,Italy,Panminerva Med,Panminerva medica,0421110,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/therapy', 'Melanoma/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Sarcoma/pathology/therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2008/04/23 09:00,2008/07/25 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Panminerva Med. 2008 Mar;50(1):3-18.,210,,,PMC3828640,,,,,"['R01 CA078590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA111294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA111294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS526856'],,,,,,,,

Application of high (MM) and low (MDS) doses of lenalidomide has been reported to have clinical activity in CLL. Herein, we highlight life-threatening tumor flare when higher doses of lenalidomide are administered to patients with CLL and provide a potential mechanism for its occurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients with relapsed CLL were treated with lenalidomide (25 mg/d for 21 days of a 28-day cycle). Serious adverse events including tumor flare and tumor lysis are summarized. In vitro studies examining drug-induced apoptosis and activation of CLL cells were also performed. RESULTS: Four consecutive patients were treated with lenalidomide; all had serious adverse events. Tumor flare was observed in three patients and was characterized by dramatic and painful lymph node enlargement resulting in hospitalization of two patients, with one fatal outcome. Another patient developed sepsis and renal failure. In vitro studies demonstrated lenalidomide-induced B-cell activation (upregulation of CD40 and CD86) corresponding to degree of tumor flare, possibly explaining the tumor flare observation. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide administered at 25 mg/d in relapsed CLL is associated with unacceptable toxicity; the rapid onset and adverse clinical effects of tumor flare represent a significant limitation of lenalidomide use in CLL at this dose. Drug-associated B-cell activation may contribute to this adverse event. Future studies with lenalidomide in CLL should focus on understanding this toxicity, investigating patients at risk, and investigating alternative safer dosing schedules.","['Andritsos, Leslie A', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Blum, William', 'Kefauver, Cheryl', 'Awan, Farrukh', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'May, Sarah E', 'Raymond, Chelsey A', 'Wang, Da-Sheng', 'Knight, Robert D', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Byrd, John C']","['Andritsos LA', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lozanski G', 'Blum W', 'Kefauver C', 'Awan F', 'Smith LL', 'Lapalombella R', 'May SE', 'Raymond CA', 'Wang DS', 'Knight RD', 'Ruppert AS', 'Lehman A', 'Jarjoura D', 'Chen CS', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080421,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/04/23 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.13.9709 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.13.9709 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 20;26(15):2519-25. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.9709.

We hypothesized that constitutional genetic variation in the p53 pathway would affect t-AML risk. Therefore, we tested associations between patients with t-AML (n = 171) and 2 common functional p53-pathway variants, the MDM2 SNP309 and the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism. Although neither polymorphism alone influenced the risk of t-AML, an interactive effect was detected such that MDM2 TT TP53 Arg/Arg double homozygotes, and individuals carrying both a MDM2 G allele and a TP53 Pro allele, were at increased risk of t-AML (P value for interaction is .009). This interactive effect was observed in patients previously treated with chemotherapy but not in patients treated with radiotherapy, and in patients with loss of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, acquired abnormalities associated with prior exposure to alkylator chemotherapy. In addition, there was a trend toward shorter latency to t-AML in MDM2 GG versus TT homozygotes in females but not in males, and in younger but not older patients. These data indicate that the MDM2 and TP53 variants interact to modulate responses to genotoxic therapy and are determinants of risk for t-AML.","['Ellis, Nathan A', 'Huo, Dezheng', 'Yildiz, Ozlem', 'Worrillow, Lisa J', 'Banerjee, Mekhala', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Allan, James M', 'Onel, Kenan']","['Ellis NA', 'Huo D', 'Yildiz O', 'Worrillow LJ', 'Banerjee M', 'Le Beau MM', 'Larson RA', 'Allan JM', 'Onel K']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080421,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2008/04/23 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60420-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-126508 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 1;112(3):741-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-126508.

In attempt to develop improved vaccination strategies for patients with CLL and other tumors with poorly identified rejection antigens, we tested the ability of ex vivo-generated DCs to cross-present the antigens expressed by CLL cells and to induce CLL-specific, functional CTL responses. Monocyte-derived DCs from CLL patients were induced to mature using a ""standard"" cytokine cocktail (in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and PGE2) or using an alpha-type 1-polarized DC (alphaDC1) cocktail (in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) and were loaded with gamma-irradiated, autologous CLL cells. alphaDC1 from CLL patients expressed substantially higher levels of multiple costimulatory molecules (CD83, CD86, CD80, CD11c, and CD40) than standard DCs (sDCs) and immature DCs, and their expression of CCR7 showed intermediate level. alphaDC1 secreted substantially higher (10-60 times) levels of IL-12p70 than sDCs. Although alphaDC1 and sDCs showed similar uptake of CLL cells, alphaDC1 induced much higher numbers (range, 2.4-38 times) of functional CD8+ T cells against CLL cells. The current demonstration that autologous tumor-loaded alphaDC1 are potent inducers of CLL-specific T cells helps to develop improved immunotherapies of CLL.","['Lee, Je-Jung', 'Foon, Kenneth A', 'Mailliard, Robbie B', 'Muthuswamy, Ravikumar', 'Kalinski, Pawel']","['Lee JJ', 'Foon KA', 'Mailliard RB', 'Muthuswamy R', 'Kalinski P']","['Department of Surgery and Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, 1.46 Hillman Cancer Ctr., 5117 Centre Ave., Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080421,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,['187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)'],IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/radiation effects', '*Cell Differentiation/radiation effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2008/04/23 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1107737 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1107737 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 Jul;84(1):319-25. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1107737.

METHOD: Data gathered: effectiveness, purchase costs and other costs (diagnostic tests, hospitalisation, and second-line antifungal therapy). A total of 107 patients were analysed, 115 invasive fungal infection sub-episodes and 138 empirical treatments. RESULTS: The effectiveness and average cost/treatment were: voriconazole 88% and 20,108.8 euro, caspofungin 68% and 49,067.7 euro, Amphotericin B Lipid Complex (ABLC) 58% and 30,375.2 euro, and Amphotericin B Liposome (AB-L) 50% and 38,234.5 euro. The first tree designed shows voriconazole as the dominant option, although there are few case studies. The second tree selects ABLC in comparison to AB-L and caspofungin, with an average CE of 52,371 euro, the nearest figure to the established availability to pay (50,000 euro). The sensitivity analysis evaluates the most influential parameters. The variation in the cost of purchasing do not modify the sense of the analysis, and the modification of 25% in other costs for caspofungin reverses the ratio, making this the most cost-effective option. The ICE indicates that using voriconazole instead of caspofungin saves 144,794 euro. With regard to caspofungin, ABLC increases the cost by 186,925 euro, a deceptive figure influenced by a level of effectiveness that is not very different; and AB-L increases the cost by 60,184 euro. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis provides relevant information from the perspective of clinical practice in spite of the limitations of the unconsidered costs (nephrotoxicity). This type of analysis contributes to rationalising the use of antifungal agents in the hospital setting and in high-risk patients such as oncohaematological ones.","['Roma-Sanchez, E', 'Poveda-Andres, J L', 'Garcia-Pellicer, J', 'Salavert-Lleti, M', 'Jarque-Ramos, I']","['Roma-Sanchez E', 'Poveda-Andres JL', 'Garcia-Pellicer J', 'Salavert-Lleti M', 'Jarque-Ramos I']","['Servicio de Farmacia, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain. eromas@sefh.es']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Farm Hosp,Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,9440679,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', '*Empirical Research', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*economics/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mycoses/drug therapy/economics/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triazoles/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2008/04/23 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['S1130-6343(08)72804-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Farm Hosp. 2008 Jan-Feb;32(1):7-17.,,Estudio coste-efectividad de la estrategia empirica antifungica en pacientes oncohematologicos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After culture for 10-14 days, phenotypes and function of CML-DCs were evaluated respectively by flow cytometry and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Chromosome of DCs was analyzed by displaying G banding assay. The concentrations of IL-10 and IL-12P70 in supernatants were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that the expressions of CD40, CD83, CD86 and CCR7 and the OD value in allogeneic mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in group with IFN-alpha (300 U/ml) were twice as high as those in group without IFN-alpha. The percentage of Ph1 positive cells and concentrations of IL-10 and IL-12 P70 were reduced in group with IFN-alpha. It is concluded that the defective phenotypes and functions of CML-DCs can be recruited partly by IFN-alpha.

The results indicated that the IL-4 level increased rapidly in 1 week after transplantation in aGVHD group and was higher than that of non aGVHD group (p<0.05), while at 7th week after transplantation IL-4 level increased rapidly in non-GVHD group and was higher than that of aGVHD group (p<0.01). There was a significant difference of IL-6 level between these two groups before transplantation. IL-6 level reached peak at 1st week after transplantation in aGVHD group and was higher than that of non-aGVHD group (p<0.01), while IL-6 level was significantly higher in non-aGVHD group than that of aGVHD group at 4th week after transplantation (p<0.01) and at 5th week after transplantation (p<0.05). It is concluded that the levels of IL-4 and IL-6 had been increased rapidly after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, indicating that aGVHD will occur. The high level of IL-6 before transplantation may be the risk factor of aGVHD occurrence after transplantation. aGVHD may occur later if the blood plasma IL-4 level rises in patients without aGVHD.

The results of real-time PCR indicated that pnas-2 expressions in samples of de novo, non-CR and relapsed patients ware significantly higher than that in CR, tumor tissues and normal tissues. In serial monitoring of 7 AL patients, the expression level of pnas-2 was high at first visit examination, but remarkably decreased after remission, and the pnas-2 expression level increased again when relapsed. It is concluded that the pnas-2 is specifically up-regulated in acute leukemia patients, which might be an oncogene and participate in leukemogenesis.","['Wang, Hai-Rong', 'Zhu, Jian-Yi', 'Gu, Chun-Hong', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Zhong, Ji-Hua', 'Han, Jie-Ying', 'Chen, Fang-Yuan', 'Ouyan, Ren-Rong']","['Wang HR', 'Zhu JY', 'Gu CH', 'Zhong H', 'Zhong JH', 'Han JY', 'Chen FY', 'Ouyan RR']","['Department of Hematology, Renji Hospital & Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200001, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PNAS-2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology']",2008/04/23 09:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2008)02-0282-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Apr;16(2):282-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimal dosage of genistein, quercetin and in combination with chemicals for leukemia cells were determined by experiments. Cell viability, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest were detected by trypan blue staining, MTT assay, optical microscopy, flow cytometry (FCM). The schedule treatment of combination of genistein and chemicals was determined. The results showed that genistein exhibited a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in NB4 and HL-60 cells, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. Quercetin had evident inhibitory effect on the proliferation of K562 and K562/A cells. The combination of genistein and chemicals exerted a synergistic effect on cell growth inhibition. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the synergistic antileukemic effect of genistein with chemotherapeutic drugs on leukemic cells.

Although there have been many studies on the oncogenesis of the viral protein Tax, the precise oncogenic mechanism remains to be elucidated. Recently, a new viral factor, HTLV-1 basic Zip factor (HBZ), encoded from the minus strand mRNA was discovered and the current models of Tax-centered ATL cell pathogenesis are in conflict with this discovery. HBZs consisting of non-spliced and spliced isoforms (HBZ-SI) are thought to be implicated in viral replication and T-cell proliferation but there is little evidence on the HBZ expression profile on a large scale. RESULTS: To investigate the role of HBZ-SI in HTLV-1 provirus-positive cells, the HBZ-SI and Tax mRNA loads in samples with a mixture of infected and non-infected cells were measured and then adjusted by dividing by the HTLV-I proviral load. We show here that the HBZ-SI mRNA level is 4-fold higher than non-spliced HBZ and is expressed by almost all cells harboring HTLV-1 provirus with variable intensity. The proviral-adjusted HBZ-SI and Tax quantification revealed a characteristic imbalanced expression feature of high HBZ and low Tax expression levels in primary ATL cells or high HBZ and very high Tax levels in HTLV-1-related cell lines (cell lines) compared with a standard expression profile of low HBZ and low Tax in infected cells. Interestingly, according to the mutual Tax and HBZ expression status, HTLV-1-related cell lines were subcategorized into two groups, an ATL cell type with high HBZ and low Tax levels and another type with high Tax and either high or low HBZ, which was closely related to its cell origin. CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive study to evaluate the mutual expression profile of HBZ and Tax in provirus-positive cells, revealing that there are quantitative and relative characteristic features among infected cells, primary ATL cells, and cell lines.","['Usui, Tetsuya', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Murata, Ken', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Usui T', 'Yanagihara K', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Murata K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki City, Japan. t-usui@nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080422,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Genome, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*virology', 'Proviruses/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2008/04/23 09:00,2008/05/30 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-34 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-34 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Apr 22;5:34. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-34.,,,10.1186/1742-4690-5-34 [doi],PMC2386809,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have shown decreased levels of zinc in this population. Because children with DS have a 50-fold increased risk of developing acute leukaemia during the first 5 years of life, we explored the relation between child vitamin and herbal supplement use and the risk of leukaemia in a case-control study. During the period 1997-2002, we enrolled 158 children with DS aged 0-18 years that were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n = 97) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n = 61) at participating Children's Oncology Group institutions. We enrolled 173 DS children without leukaemia (controls), selected from the cases' primary care clinic and frequency-matched on age. Data were collected via telephone interviews with mothers of the index child regarding use of multivitamins, zinc, vitamin C, iron and herbal supplements, including age at first use, frequency and duration. Among controls, 57% reported regular multivitamin use (>/=3 times/week for >/=3 months) compared with 48% of ALL cases and 61% of AML cases. We found no evidence of an association between children's regular multivitamin use and ALL or AML (adjusted odds ratios [OR] = 0.94 [95% CI 0.52, 1.70] and 1.90 [0.73, 4.91] respectively). There was a suggestion of an increased risk for AML associated with regular multivitamin use during the first year of life or for an extended duration (ORs = 2.38 [0.94, 5.76] and 2.59 [1.02, 6.59] respectively). Despite being the largest study of DS-leukaemia, our sample size was small, resulting in imprecise effect estimates. Future research should include larger sample sizes as well as a full assessment of diet including vitamin supplementation to adequately examine the relation between nutritional status and childhood leukaemia.","['Blair, Cindy K', 'Roesler, Michelle', 'Xie, Yang', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Olshan, Andrew F', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Blair CK', 'Roesler M', 'Xie Y', 'Gamis AS', 'Olshan AF', 'Heerema NA', 'Robison LL', 'Ross JA']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,['0 (Vitamins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dietary Supplements/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamins/adverse effects']",2008/04/23 09:00,2008/08/21 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['PPE928 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3016.2008.00928.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2008 May;22(3):288-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2008.00928.x.,,,10.1111/j.1365-3016.2008.00928.x [doi],PMC3365502,"[""Children's Oncology Group (COG)""]",,,,"['P30 ES010126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA75169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES10126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS378452'],,,,,,,,

The aberration results from a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, creating a BCR-ABL fusion gene. There are two major forms of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, involving ABL exon 2, but including different exons of BCR gene. The transcript b2a2 or b3a2 codes for a p210 protein. Other fusion gene leads to the expression of an e1a2 transcript, which codes for a p190 protein. Other less common fusion genes are b3a3 or b2a3 (p203) and e19a2 (p230). The incidence of one or other rearrangement in chronic myeloid leukemia patients varies in different reports. In general, fusion transcripts are determined individually, a process which is labor- intensive in order to detect all major fusion transcripts. The objective of this study was to set up a multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection and to determine the frequency of different fusion genes in 75 Iranian patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were analyzed by multiplex RT-PCR from 75 adult Iranian chronic myeloid leukemia patients to detect different types of BCR-ABL transcripts of the t(9;22). RESULTS: All patients examined were positive for some type of BCR/ABL rearrangement. The majority of the patients (83%) expressed one of the p210BCR-ABL transcripts (b3a2, 62% and b2a2, 20%), while the remaining showed one of the transcripts of b3a3, b2a3, e1a2 or co-expression of b3a2 and b2a2. The rate of co-expression of the b3a2 and b2a2 was 5%. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other reports, we did not see any co-expression of p210/p190. Co-expression may be due to alternative splicing or to phenotypic variation, with clinical course different from classic chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardashir', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Jahani, Mohammad', 'Mousavi, Seyed-Asadollah', 'Irvani, Masoud', 'Bahar, Babak', 'Bibordi, Isa']","['Yaghmaie M', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Jahani M', 'Mousavi SA', 'Irvani M', 'Bahar B', 'Bibordi I']","['Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arabs/genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2008/04/23 09:00,2009/01/14 09:00,['2008/04/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['003 [pii]', '08113/AIM.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Iran Med. 2008 May;11(3):247-51. doi: 08113/AIM.003.,,,08113/AIM.003 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first issue deals with how to obtain parsimony in the modeling of the effect of covariates. The standard way of incorporating covariates in multi-state models is by considering the transitions as separate building blocks, and modeling the effect of covariates for each transition separately, usually through a proportional hazards model for the transition hazard. This typically leads to a large number of regression coefficients to be estimated, and there is a real danger of over-fitting, especially when transitions with few events are present. We extend the reduced-rank ideas, proposed earlier in the context of competing risks, to multi-state models, in order to deal with this issue. The second issue addressed in this paper was motivated by the wish to obtain standard errors of the regression coefficients of the reduced-rank model. We propose a model-based resampling technique, based on repeatedly sampling trajectories through the multi-state model. The same ideas are also used for the estimation of prediction probabilities in general multi-state models and associated standard errors. We use data from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation to illustrate our techniques.","['Fiocco, Marta', 'Putter, Hein', 'van Houwelingen, Hans C']","['Fiocco M', 'Putter H', 'van Houwelingen HC']","['Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, P.O.

This activity is due primarily to the peptides' apoptogenic effect. Several reports indicate that cationic residues clustered in two regions of the peptide sequence can be shuffled into one region and thereby increase cytotoxic activity, although the mechanism of this enhanced cytotoxic effect has not been clarified. In this paper, we considered several parameters that determine the mode of cell death after exposure to a native Lf-B derived peptide (Pep1, residues 17-34), and a modified peptide (mPep1) wherein the cationic residues of Pep1 are clustered in a single region of its helical structure. We found that the cytotoxic activity of mPep1 was about 9.6 fold-higher than that of Pep1 against HL-60 cells, as determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethonyphenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. In investigating the expression of phosphatidylserine, we observed that the native peptide (Pep1) caused both apoptotic cell death and necrotic cell death, depending on the concentration of the peptide. In contrast, the action of mPep1 was exclusively characteristic of necrotic cell death. This observation was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, in which clear ladder-like DNA bands were observed from cells exposed to Pep1, whereas DNA from cells treated with mPep1 produced a smeared pattern. We extended the study by investigating the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, and the activation of caspase-3; both peptides caused the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and the activation of caspase-3.These results suggest that Pep1 may kill cancer cells by activating an apoptosis-inducing pathway, whereas mPep1 causes necrotic cell death by destroying cellular membrane structure notwithstanding sharing some cellular events with apoptotic cell death.","['Onishi, Junko', 'Roy, Molay Kumar', 'Juneja, Lekh Raj', 'Watanabe, Yasuo', 'Tamai, Youichi']","['Onishi J', 'Roy MK', 'Juneja LR', 'Watanabe Y', 'Tamai Y']","['Faculty of Agriculture, Ehime University, 3-5-7 Tarumi, Matsuyama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,"['0 (Peptides)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*chemistry', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Necrosis', 'Peptides/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/psc.1039 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Sci. 2008 Sep;14(9):1032-8. doi: 10.1002/psc.1039.,,,10.1002/psc.1039 [doi],,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2008 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

Normally, these factors are transiently activated by specific external signals which induce their dissociation from inhibitors of kappaB (IkappaB) and subsequent translocation to the nucleus where p65 links to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CBP)-p300 and P/CAF coactivators that are essential for its transcriptional activity. The pathogenic potential of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein is partly ascribed to its capacity to constitutively activate NF-kappaB factors because constitutive activity of these factors play an important role in the pathophysiology of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis-HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (TSP-HAM). In assessing the possibility of modulating Tax pathogenic potential by external factors, we focused here on 12-O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) which is a potent protein kinase C (PKC) activator. There are conflicting reports regarding the effect of TPA and PKC on NF-kappaB. Therefore, we reassessed this issue and also investigated their influence on Tax-mediated activation of these factors. We found that TPA promoted NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and the DNA binding of p65 dimers through PKC activation. However, both TPA and ectopically expressed PKC had only a marginal effect on the transcriptional competence of these dimers, indicating that the DNA binding of such dimers is insufficient by itself for gene activation. Notably, however, both TPA and the ectopic PKC displayed strong synergistic enhancement of the Tax-induced activation of the NF-kappaB transcriptional function. In contrast, TPA and the ectopic PKC only slightly elevated the low activation of the NF-kappaB transcriptional capacity by cytoplasmic Tax mutants, indicating that the nuclear translocation of Tax was essential for this synergism. Subsequent experiments suggested that TPA contributed to this synergism by increasing the pool of free p65 which Tax could link to CBP and elevate, thereby, the amount of a p65-Tax-CBP ternary complex that could bind to NF-kappaB-responsive promoters and stimulate their expression. Finally, we demonstrated that this synergism operated also in HTLV-1-infected human T-cells. Earlier reports have shown a close linkage of pathological PKC-activating conditions (e.g., infectious and inflammatory diseases) to certain malignancies. On this ground, the present study suggests that such conditions may enhance the risk for ATL and TSP-HAM in HTLV-1 carriers by increasing the Tax-induced NF-kappaB activation.","['Azran-Shaish, Inbal', 'Tabakin-Fix, Yulia', 'Huleihel, Mahmoud', 'Bakhanashvili, Mary', 'Aboud, Mordechai']","['Azran-Shaish I', 'Tabakin-Fix Y', 'Huleihel M', 'Bakhanashvili M', 'Aboud M']","['Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, 84105, Israel, azron@bgu.ac.il.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080419,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CREB-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00109-008-0335-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2008 Jul;86(7):799-814. doi: 10.1007/s00109-008-0335-1.

Patients were treated in successive cohorts of six until DLT was observed. Once the MTD was determined, an additional cohort of six patients was enrolled at the previous dose level and that dose was considered the recommended phase 2 dose (RPTD). Forty-six patients were treated at dose levels of 1,400, 1,750, 2,200, and 2,750 mg. The DLTs were: mucositis, colitis and hyperbilirubinemia. Reversible myelosuppression was noted at all dose levels. One (2%) of 42 patients achieved a complete remission and five patients (11%) had hematologic improvement. The half-life of the drug was long with a mean value of 48 h. The mean clearance was 206 mL/h with a coefficient of variation of 32%.

When a phenoxazine derivative, 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one (Phx-3) or 2-amino-4,4alpha-dihydro-4alpha-7-dimethyl-3H-phenoxazine-3-one (Phx-1) was added to these cells, pHi rapidly decreased within 20 min, dose-dependently, though the extent of the decrease of pHi was significantly larger for Phx-3 (a decrease of 0.9 units) than for Phx-1 (a decrease of 0.4 units). Phx-3 and Phx-1 caused the proliferative suppression of these cells 24 h after the addition, dose-dependently. The anti-proliferative effects of Phx-3 on KB-3-1 and K562 cells were far greater than those of Phx-1. It was proposed that the proliferative suppression of KB-3-1 and K562 cells caused by Phx-3 and Phx-1, may be preceded by a rapid and extensive decrease in pHi, which possibly influenced the intracellular homeostasis, finally causing the suppressed proliferation and apoptosis of these cancer cells. The present results suggest that the anti-cancer effects of Phx-3 and Phx-1 may be strengthened by the intracellular acidification of cancer cells by these compounds.","['Che, Xiao-Fang', 'Akiyama, Shin-ichi', 'Tomoda, Akio']","['Che XF', 'Akiyama S', 'Tomoda A']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Advanced Therapeutics, Kagoshima University, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima 890-8544, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxazines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'C2ZWT499SG (phenoxazine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'K562 Cells', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oxazines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2008 May;19(5):1253-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different mechanisms of their formation have been described. We report dual colour dual fusion fluorescence in situ hybridisation data in 12 Chinese CML patients with complex translocations. Three previously reported breakpoint hotspots in a third partner chromosome (14q32, 17q25, 1q21) were observed. In 10/12 (83.3%) patients, the abnormality occurred as a single step 3-break event. Only a single abnormal clone harbouring the complex translocation was seen in this group. The remaining 2 cases in the chronic phase showed a 4-break mechanism (2/12, 16.7%). Deletion of 5' ABL at der(9) was not observed in any of the 12 patients, however, the loss of 3' BCR was observed in 1 patient (1/12, 8.3%). Together with previous findings, these data suggest that these variant translocations occur more often as a 3-break single-step process with no reciprocal ABL-BCR fusion. On the other hand, a 4-break event is also regularly seen during the initial stages of leukaemogenesis, which likely predisposes to der(9) deletion. The observed difference in rates of der(9) deletion reported in a series of CML patients with variant translocations may be related to a difference in rates of a 4-break event.","['So, Chi-Chiu', 'Wan, Thomas Shek-Kong', 'Yip, Sze-Fai', 'Chan, Li-Chong']","['So CC', 'Wan TS', 'Yip SF', 'Chan LC']","['Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PR China. scc@pathology.hku.hk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['China', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/ethnology/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2008 May;19(5):1181-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Necrotic cell death is emerging as one of the crucial factors that trigger an inflammatory response since during necrotic death the cell membrane is ruptured and the intracellular constituents including high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are released into the extracellular space, thereby activating an inflammatory response. In contrast, autophagic death is regarded as a form of tumour suppressive cell death, as indicated in tumour suppressors such as beclin 1 in autophagic pathways. To better understand the anti-inflammatory properties of sodium salicylate and its effect on necrotic cell death in A549 cells induced by glucose depletion (GD), a common characteristic of the tumour micro-environment, was examined. While GD induced mostly necrotic death in A549 cells, salicylate suppresssed GD-induced necrosis and HMGB1 release. In addition, salicylate shifted the cell death pattern to autophagy by inhibiting GD-induced Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase release and ROS production. These results indicate that the activity of salicylate to prevent necrotic death may contribute to its anti-inflammatory action and suppress tumour development possibly through switching the cell death mode from tumour-promoting necrotic cell death to tumour-suppressive autophagic cell death.","['Lim, Sung-Chul', 'Kim, Sun Mi', 'Choi, Jeong Eun', 'Kim, Cho Hee', 'Duong, Hong-Quan', 'Han, Song Iy', 'Kang, Ho Sung']","['Lim SC', 'Kim SM', 'Choi JE', 'Kim CH', 'Duong HQ', 'Han SI', 'Kang HS']","['Research Center for Resistant Cells, College of Medicine, Chosun University, Gwangju 501-759, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'WIQ1H85SYP (Sodium Salicylate)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', '*Autophagy', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'HMGB1 Protein/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*embryology', '*Necrosis', 'Sodium Salicylate/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2008 May;19(5):1165-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective study at the Division of Hematology, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo (FMUSP), Sao Paulo. METHODS: All consecutive patients with PV diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria were eligible for this study. Clinical and demographic characteristics, thrombotic events, transformation to acute leukemia, myelofibrosis and survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were evaluated. Thirty-six (54.5%) were females, with a median age at diagnosis of 61 years. At diagnosis, the median hemoglobin concentration was 18.8 mg/dl and the median platelet count was 593,000/mm(3). Fifty-eight patients (88.0%) were treated with hydroxyurea with or without phlebotomy. During a median follow-up of 77 months, 22 patients (33.3%) had new thrombotic events, mainly of arterial type. The overall incidence of leukemia and myelofibrosis was 0.42% per patient-year and 1.06% per patient-year, respectively. Median overall survival was not reached and the seven-year survival rate was 77.8%.

The role of an autologous tumor-specific immune control contributing to the variable length of survival in CLL is poorly understood. We investigated whether humoral immunity specific for the CLL-associated Ag oncofetal Ag/immature laminin receptor (OFA/iLR) has a prognostic value in CLL. Among sera of 67 untreated patients with CLL, 23 (34.3%) had detectable OFA/iLR Abs that were reactive for at least one specific OFA/iLR epitope. Patients with humoral responses compared with patients with nonreactive sera had a longer progression-free survival (p = 0.029). IgG subclass analyses showed a predominant IgG1 and IgG3 response. OFA/iLR Abs were capable of recognizing and selectively killing OFA/iLR-expressing CLL cells in complement-mediated and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays. In the analysis of 11 CLL patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 8 showed high values for OFA/iLR Abs that specifically recognized the extracellular domain of the protein, suggesting a potential role of anti-OFA/iLR-directed immune responses to the graft-vs-leukemia effect in CLL.

We found that human defensins 5 and 6 (HD5 and HD6) promoted HIV infection, and this effect was primarily during viral entry. Enhancement was seen with primary viral isolates in primary CD4(+) T cells and the effect was more pronounced with R5 virus compared with X4 virus. HD5 and HD6 promoted HIV reporter viruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus and murine leukemia virus envelopes, indicating that defensin-mediated enhancement was not dependent on CD4 and coreceptors. Enhancement of HIV by HD5 and HD6 was influenced by the structure of the peptides, as loss of the intramolecular cysteine bonds was associated with loss of the HIV-enhancing effect. Pro-HD5, the precursor and intracellular form of HD5, also exhibited HIV-enhancing effect. Using a cervicovaginal tissue culture system, we found that expression of HD5 and HD6 was induced in response to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC, for gonococcus) infection and that conditioned medium from GC-exposed cervicovaginal epithelial cells with elevated levels of HD5 also enhanced HIV infection. Introduction of small interfering RNAs for HD5 or HD6 abolished the HIV-enhancing effect mediated by GC. Thus, the induction of these defensins in the mucosa in the setting of GC infection could facilitate HIV infection. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the complexity of defensins as innate immune mediators in HIV transmission and warrants further investigation of the mechanism by which defensins modulate HIV infection.","['Klotman, Mary E', 'Rapista, Aprille', 'Teleshova, Natalia', 'Micsenyi, Amanda', 'Jarvis, Gary A', 'Lu, Wuyuan', 'Porter, Edith', 'Chang, Theresa L']","['Klotman ME', 'Rapista A', 'Teleshova N', 'Micsenyi A', 'Jarvis GA', 'Lu W', 'Porter E', 'Chang TL']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

The working hypothesis is that the presence of different alleles in CLL patients marks (or accounts for) some of the clinical heterogeneity. CD38 allele distribution in 248 Italian patients overlapped with that of the controls (n = 232), suggesting that susceptibility to CLL is not influenced by CD38 genotype. Stratification of patients according to markers of unfavorable prognosis constantly resulted in a significantly higher frequency of the rare G allele. Furthermore, analysis of clinical parameters showed that G allele is independently associated with nodal/splenic involvement. The highest G allele frequency was observed in the 16 patients of the cohort that developed Richter syndrome (RS). Five-year cumulative incidence of transformation was significantly higher in G allele carriers than in CC homozygotes. Multivariate analysis on a total of 30 RS patients confirmed that the probability of transformation is strongly associated with G allele, likely representing an independent risk factor for RS development.","['Aydin, Semra', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Bergui, Luciana', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Ferrero, Enza', 'Bonello, Lisa', 'Omede, Paola', 'Novero, Domenico', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Carbone, Antonino', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Aydin S', 'Rossi D', 'Bergui L', ""D'Arena G"", 'Ferrero E', 'Bonello L', 'Omede P', 'Novero D', 'Morabito F', 'Carbone A', 'Gaidano G', 'Malavasi F', 'Deaglio S']","['Department of Genetics, Biology, and Biochemistry, University of Torino Medical School, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080418,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cohort Studies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/physiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47101-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-129726 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jun 15;111(12):5646-53. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-129726.

In this study, we investigated the role of the mitochondrial methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 in the protection against oxidative stress. We report, for the first time, that overexpression of methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 in mitochondria of acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cell line, in which methionine sulfoxide reductase A is missing, markedly protects against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species. The addition of hydrogen peroxide provoked a time-gradual increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species, leading to a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential and to protein carbonyl accumulation, whereas in methionine sulfoxide reductase B2-overexpressing cells, intracellular reactive oxygen species and protein oxidation remained low with the mitochondrial membrane potential highly maintained. Moreover, in these cells, delayed apoptosis was shown by a decrease in the cleavage of the apoptotic marker poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and by the lower percentage of Annexin-V-positive cells in the late and early apoptotic stages. We also provide evidence for the protective mechanism of methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 against protein oxidative damages. Our results emphasize that upon oxidative stress, the overexpression of methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 leads to the preservation of mitochondrial integrity by decreasing the intracellular reactive oxygen species build-up through its scavenging role, hence contributing to cell survival and protein maintenance.","['Cabreiro, Filipe', 'Picot, Cedric R', 'Perichon, Martine', 'Castel, Julien', 'Friguet, Bertrand', 'Petropoulos, Isabelle']","['Cabreiro F', 'Picot CR', 'Perichon M', 'Castel J', 'Friguet B', 'Petropoulos I']","['Laboratoire de Biologie et Biochimie Cellulaire du Vieillissement, EA 3106, Universite Paris Diderot-Paris 7, 2 Place Jussieu, 75251 Paris Cedex 05, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080417,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.8.4.- (MSRB2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.8.4.- (Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidoreductases/*biosynthesis', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/07/25 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)71472-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M708580200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Jun 13;283(24):16673-81. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M708580200.

This capability is widely associated with tumours, and, indeed, the invasive behaviour of both is rather similar. The imposing difference is that trophoblast cell invasion is temporally and locally controlled in contrast to unlimited tumour invasion. It initiates immediately after embryo implantation into the endometrium. Parallel to tumours, trophoblasts secrete proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases, which dissolve the extracellular matrix and the surrounding tissue. Thereby, these proteases prepare and allow true invasion of trophoblasts. The invasive capacities of trophoblasts are positively and negatively regulated by numerous cytokines including leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6, hepatocyte growth factor, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and others. They interact via specific receptors with the trophoblast cells, in which they activate intracellular signalling cascades. These will then induce expression of invasion relevant genes. One of these signalling pathways is the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway. Especially phosphorylated STAT3 enhances invasiveness of tumours and trophoblast cells, where it is mainly activated by LIF. One of its most efficient physiological antagonists is suppressor of cytokine signalling 3. The balance of these two intracellular molecules seems to be a key regulator of tumour and trophoblast invasion.","['Fitzgerald, Justine S', 'Poehlmann, Tobias G', 'Schleussner, Ekkehard', 'Markert, Udo R']","['Fitzgerald JS', 'Poehlmann TG', 'Schleussner E', 'Markert UR']","['Klinik fur Frauenheilkunde und Geburtshilfe, Abteilung fur Geburtshilfe, Placenta-Labor, Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena, Bachstr. 18, 07743 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080417,England,Hum Reprod Update,Human reproduction update,9507614,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Cytokines/metabolism/*physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/physiology', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/*metabolism']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/09/11 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['dmn010 [pii]', '10.1093/humupd/dmn010 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod Update. 2008 Jul-Aug;14(4):335-44. doi: 10.1093/humupd/dmn010.

Exosomes can be purified from cultured cells but to do so effectively, requires maintenance of cells at high density in order to obtain sufficient accumulation of exosomes in the culture medium, prior to purification. Whilst high density cultures can be achieved with cells in suspension, this remains difficult with adherent cells, resulting in low quantity of exosomes for subsequent study. We have used the Integra CELLine culture system, originally designed for hybridoma cultures, to achieve a significant increase in obtainable exosomes from adherent and non-adherent tumour cells. Traditional cultures of mesothelioma cells (cultured in 75 cm(2) flasks) gave an average yield of 0.78 microg+/-0.14 microg exosome/ml of conditioned medium. The CELLine Adhere 1000 (CLAD1000) flask, housing the same cell line, increased exosome yield approximately 12 fold to 10.06 microg+/-0.97 microg/ml. The morphology, phenotype and immune function of these exosomes were compared, and found to be identical in all respects. Similarly an 8 fold increase in exosome production was obtained from NKL cells (a suspension cell line) using a CELLine 1000 (CL1000) flask. The CELLine system also incurred ~5.5 fold less cost and reduced labour for cell maintenance. This simple culture system is a cost effective, useful method for significantly increasing the quantity of exosomes available from cultured cells, without detrimental effects. This tool should prove advantageous in future studies of exosome-immune modulation in cancer and other settings.","['Mitchell, J Paul', 'Court, Jacqueline', 'Mason, Malcolm David', 'Tabi, Zsuzsanna', 'Clayton, Aled']","['Mitchell JP', 'Court J', 'Mason MD', 'Tabi Z', 'Clayton A']","['Department of Oncology & Palliative Medicine, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Velindre Cancer Centre, Whitchurch, Cardiff, UK. paul.mitchell@velindre-tr.wales.nhs.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080403,Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mesothelioma/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural Neoplasms/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Secretory Vesicles/immunology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/07/10 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(08)00092-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2008.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2008 Jun 1;335(1-2):98-105. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2008.03.001.

However, neither the distribution of S1P receptors nor the effects of S1P on multiple myeloma (MM) cells are fully understood. Here, we show that MM cells express the S1P receptors, S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3. Furthermore, S1P protects MM cells against Dex-induced apoptosis. Importantly, S1P upregulates Mcl-1 expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in human MM cell lines. Treatment of MM cells with pertussis toxin (PTX), a pan-S1P receptor inhibitor, results in blockage of S1P-induced upregulation of Mcl-1. These data demonstrate that S1P upregulates the expression of Mcl-1 and protects MM cells from Dex-induced apoptosis, providing the preclinical framework for novel therapeutics targeting at both Mcl-1 and/or S1P to improve the patient outcome in MM.","['Li, Qing-Fang', 'Wu, Chu-Tse', 'Guo, Qiang', 'Wang, Hua', 'Wang, Li-Sheng']","['Li QF', 'Wu CT', 'Guo Q', 'Wang H', 'Wang LS']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, 27 Taiping Road, Beijing 100850, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080425,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Lysosphingolipid)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Lysophospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(08)00688-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.04.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Jun 20;371(1):159-62. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.04.037.

The mechanisms of MDR in leukemic cells have been broadly explored, but they are still unclear. We used proteomic tools to screen MDR-related proteins in vincristine-resistant leukemia cell line K562/VCR, and analyzed the mechanism of MDR in leukemia. METHODS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to extract total proteins from K562/VCR and K562 cells. The proteins expressed differentially between the two cell lines were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) of the protein was transfected into K562/VCR cells; mis-sense oligonucleotide (MSO) of the protein was also transfected as control. The expression of the protein was detected by Western blot. Cell survival was detected by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), a differential expression protein between K562/VCR and K562 cells, was identified. When treated with vincristine, the survival rate of K562/VCR cells was significantly lower in HSP27 ASO group than in HSP27 MSO group (P<0.05). The apoptosis rate of K562/VCR cells was significantly higher in HSP27 ASO group than in HSP27 MSO group (16.37% vs. 3.08%, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: HSP27 is highly expressed in K562/VCR cells, and the suppression of its expression by HSP27 ASO could enhance chemosensitivity of K562/VCR cells to vincristine.","['Zhang, Zhao-Xia', 'Wen, Fei-Qiu', 'Liu, Zhi-Ping', 'Cheng, Ying-Duan']","['Zhang ZX', 'Wen FQ', 'Liu ZP', 'Cheng YD']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Jinan University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518020, PR China. slade1024@163.com""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2008/04/22 09:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000-467X200804348 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2008 Apr;27(4):348-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To further investigate the role of angiogenesis in CLL by evaluating the topography and extent of angiogenesis in a group of CLL bone marrow biopsies, to study the expression of pro and antiangiogenic vascular factors in CLL cells to more precisely document the cell types producing these factors, and to evaluate the role, if any, of localized hypoxia in upregulation of angiogenesis in CLL We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) (n = 21 pts) with antibodies to CD3 and CD20, proangiogenic (VEGF, HIF-1a) and antiangiogenic (TSP-1) factors, and VEGF receptors -1 and -2 to examine pattern/extent of CLL marrow involvement, microvessel density (MVD), and angiogenic characteristics; flow cytometry (FC) was performed on 21 additional cases for VEGF and TSP-1. RESULTS: CLL patients had higher MVD (23.8 vs 14.6, p~0.0002) compared to controls (n = 10). MVD was highest at the periphery of focal infiltrates, was not enhanced in proliferation centers, and was increased irrespective of the presence or absence of cytogenetic/immunophenotypic markers of aggressivity. By IHC, CLL cells were VEGF(+), HIF-1a (+), TSP-1(-), VEGFR-1(+), and VEGFR-2(+). By FC, CLL cells were 1.4-2.0-fold brighter for VEGF than T cells and were TSP-1(-). CONCLUSION: CLL demonstrates enhanced angiogenesis, with increased MVD, upregulated VEGF and downregulated TSP-1. Upregulation of HIF-1a in all CLL cases suggests localized tissue hypoxia as an important stimulant of microvessel proliferation. The presence of VEGF receptors on CLL cells implies an autocrine effect for VEGF.

Few cases of phenotypically normal dispermic chimeras have been reported and most showed abnormalities on blood typing. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old man was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. He clearly typed as group A, D-. No abnormalities of sexual development were identified on multiple physical exams, previous exploratory surgery, or CT scans. Molecular HLA typing (sequence-specific primers) in preparation for stem cell transplant showed the patient to have three HLA-B* and three HLA-Cw* alleles. Initial serologic HLA typing reported two haplotypes, but on subsequent review reactions for a third HLA-B antigen that were initially deemed to be false-positive reactions were identified. Two of 10 microsatellite short tandem repeat (STR) loci also showed three distinct alleles in blood and buccal samples. In all studies the third allele was attributable to a dual paternal contribution. CONCLUSION: This case represents dispermic chimerism, with one maternal and two paternal haplotypes variably distributed throughout body tissues in a phenotypically normal man without abnormalities in blood typing. The presence of additional alleles that may have been undetected or dismissed by serologic typing should be carefully investigated and verified by molecular techniques. Molecular HLA typing may increase the accurate identification of phenotypically normal chimeras and aid in selecting proper donors for transplantation to reduce graft-versus-host disease and transplant rejection in these patients.","['Draper, Nicole L', 'Conley, Cheryl', 'Smith, Clayton', 'Benson, Kaaron']","['Draper NL', 'Conley C', 'Smith C', 'Benson K']","['Department of Pathology, H.

Importantly, the resulting gene fusions can serve as specific therapeutic targets, as exemplified by the development of imatinib (Gleevec), which specifically inhibits the BCR-ABL gene fusion product that defines chronic myeloid leukaemia. Recently, gene fusions involving the prostate-specific gene transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and members of the erythroblastosis virus E26 transforming sequence (ETS) family of transcription factors were identified in most of PSA-screened prostate cancers. In this review, we summarize the identification, characterization and detection of TMPRSS2:ETS gene fusions and their role in prostate cancer development. We also discuss the discovery of additional 5' partners that define distinct classes of ETS gene fusions based on the prostate specificity and androgen responsiveness of the 5' partner. Additionally, we also summarize conflicting reports about associations between gene fusion status and patient outcome. The specificity of ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer suggests that they may have causal roles in prostate cancer and suggest utility in prostate cancer detection, stratification and treatment.","['Morris, David S', 'Tomlins, Scott A', 'Montie, James E', 'Chinnaiyan, Arul M']","['Morris DS', 'Tomlins SA', 'Montie JE', 'Chinnaiyan AM']","['Department of Urology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080416,England,BJU Int,BJU international,100886721,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (TMPRSS2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Fusion/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJU7665 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.07665.x [doi]']",ppublish,BJU Int. 2008 Aug;102(3):276-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.07665.x.

In the present study, to clarify the feasibility of CML66-targeted cancer immunotherapy, we attempted to identify cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes derived from CML66. An immunogenic CML66-derived epitope (amino acid residues 76-84; YYIDTLGRI) capable of inducing human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*2402-restricted CTL specific for this peptide was identified. CML66-derived peptide-specific CTL efficiently lysed human leukemia cells, but not normal cells, in a HLA-A*2402-restricted fashion. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that CML66 mRNA is expressed abundantly in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells, acute lymphoid leukemia cells, and chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in advanced phase, and that the expression level of CML66 mRNA in normal cells is low compared with that in leukemia cells. CML66-specific CTL precursors were detected in the peripheral blood of patients with acute leukemia.

Clonal expansion of HTLV-I-infected cells requires the extension of cell division with telomere maintenance, which is regulated by the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase. However, the roles of Tax in the expression of telomerase activity in T-cells remains controversial. Our previous study indicated that expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT) gene, which determines telomerase activity, is tightly regulated in human T-cells. In the present study, we investigated Tax-mediated regulation of hTERT gene expression by Tax in human T-cells. HTLV-I Tax induced expression of the hTERT gene in human peripheral blood leukocytes. Reporter assays revealed that Tax activated the hTERT promoter in quiescent Kit 225 cells, while the promoter activity was repressed by Tax in proliferating Jurkat cells. Both up-regulation and down-regulation by Tax were mediated through the 43-bp sequences in the promoter, which carried at least two elements that independently functioned as repressors. The two elements bound distinct factors. G1 to S phase transition induced by introduction of either cyclin D2 with cdk4 or p130-specific shRNA also activated the hTERT promoter, implying that activation of the hTERT promoter in quiescent Kit 225 cells is associated with cell cycle progression. Our findings suggest that the cell cycle state critically influences Tax-mediated regulation of hTERT expression.","['Hara, Toshifumi', 'Matsumura-Arioka, Yuuki', 'Ohtani, Kiyoshi', 'Nakamura, Masataka']","['Hara T', 'Matsumura-Arioka Y', 'Ohtani K', 'Nakamura M']","['Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080414,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'G1 Phase/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S Phase/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2008/04/22 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/04/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS798 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00798.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Jun;99(6):1155-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00798.x.

Formaldehyde was categorized into group 3 as the substance not classifiable as to its carcinogenecity to humans because the collected information was not adequate for making a satisfactory assessment. There is some evidence from appropriate animal studies, but it is insufficient to categorize this substance in group 2: probably carcinogenic to humans. In 2006, the International Agency for Research on Cancer categorized formaldehyde in group 1 as the substance carcinogenic to humans. Three types of cancer were assessed: nasopharyngeal cancer, leukemia and sinonasal cancer. There was sufficient evidence that formaldehyde causes nasopharyngeal cancer, strong but not sufficient evidence that the substance induces leukemia and limited evidence for sinonasal cancer. Based on the irritation effect, the value of maximum admissible concentration of formaldehyde in the work environment has been established in Poland at 0.5 mg/m3 as average weighed concentration, and 1 mg/m3 as short-term concentration. In the European Union, the values of 0.2 ppm and 0.4 ppm, respectively are now being considered. It is assumed that the MAC value for formaldehyde in the work environment will be soon verified in Poland and adapted to European Union standards.","['Kupczewska-Dobecka, Malgorzata']",['Kupczewska-Dobecka M'],"['Zaklad Informacji Naukowej, Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof.

Polymorphisms at the C677T and A1298C loci are associated with reduced activity; consequently more folate substrates are shunted toward thymidylate and DNA synthesis. Several studies have reported a reduced risk of developing ALL in children with MTHFR polymorphisms. The objective of this study was to determine the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and ALL in Filipino children. PROCEDURE: We conducted a case control study in children diagnosed with ALL at the Philippine General Hospital from 1/2001 through 12/2005. Bone marrow aspirate slides were reviewed by two expert hematologists to verify the morphologic diagnosis of ALL. DNA was isolated from the slides and MTHFR polymorphisms, C677T and A1298C, were determined using Taqman real-time PCR. Cord blood of healthy Filipino newborns served as control. RESULTS: There were a total of 191 ALL and 394 controls genotyped. The distribution of C677T polymorphisms was similar in the two groups (P = 1.0). However, for A1298C, there was significantly more AC and CC genotypes in the ALL compared to controls (P = 0.02; OR 1.57; CI: 1.08-2.28). The 1298C allele frequency for the control group was 36.8% and 677T allele frequency was 9.9%. CONCLUSION: A1298C polymorphisms is associated with an increased risk for ALL in Filipino children. This may be due to a difference in leukemia biology or to a high prevalence of folate deficiency in Filipinos. Our study reiterates the gene and environment interaction in leukemogenesis.","['Alcasabas, Patricia', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi', 'Goyette, Gerard', 'Haller, Andrew', 'Del Rosario, Luz', 'Lesaca-Medina, Maria Ysabel', 'Darga, Linda', 'Ostrea, Enrique M Jr', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Everson, Richard B']","['Alcasabas P', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Goyette G', 'Haller A', 'Del Rosario L', 'Lesaca-Medina MY', 'Darga L', 'Ostrea EM Jr', 'Taub JW', 'Everson RB']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Philippine General Hospital, Manila, Philippines. tricia_alcas@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2008/04/19 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/04/19 09:00'],"['2008/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21511 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Aug;51(2):178-82. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21511.,,,10.1002/pbc.21511 [doi],,,,,,"['P30 ES06639/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HD0394281/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation may be an adjunctive therapeutic strategy to attenuate some of these adverse effects. PROCEDURE: Nine children with ALL in the maintenance phase of treatment on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) protocol 2000-2001 were treated with CrM (0.1 g/kg/day) for two sequential periods of 16 weeks (16 weeks treat > 6 weeks wash-out > 16 weeks treat). A cohort of children (N = 50) who were receiving the same chemotherapy at the same time served as natural history controls. Measurements included height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD), whole body bone mineral content (WB-BMC), fat-free mass (FFM), and percent body fat (%BF) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Despite the long course of corticosteroid treatment for ALL, children showed significant increases in height, LS-BMD, WB-BMC and FFM over approximately 38 weeks (P < 0.05) during the study. There was an increase in BMI over time, but children taking CrM had a reduction, while the natural history group showed an increase in % BF (P < 0.05 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL treated with corticosteroids as part of a maintenance protocol of chemotherapy showed an increase in % BF that was attenuated by CrM supplementation.","['Bourgeois, Jacqueline M', 'Nagel, Kim', 'Pearce, Erin', 'Wright, Marilyn', 'Barr, Ronald D', 'Tarnopolsky, Mark A']","['Bourgeois JM', 'Nagel K', 'Pearce E', 'Wright M', 'Barr RD', 'Tarnopolsky MA']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. bourjac@hhsc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', 'MU72812GK0 (Creatine)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects', 'Body Composition/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatine/*administration & dosage', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/04/19 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/04/19 09:00'],"['2008/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21571 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Aug;51(2):183-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21571.,,,10.1002/pbc.21571 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To counteract host defenses many viruses have evolved complex apoptosis evasion strategies. The oncogenic human retrovirus HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of adult-T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and the neurodegenerative disease known as HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The poor prognosis in HTLV-1-induced ATLL is linked to the resistance of neoplastic T cells against conventional therapies and the immuno-compromised state of patients. Nevertheless, several studies have shown that the apoptotic pathway is largely intact and can be reactivated in ATLL tumor cells to induce specific killing. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms employed by HTLV-1 to counteract cellular death pathways remains an important challenge for future therapies and the treatment of HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Taylor, John M', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Taylor JM', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3025 Wahl Hall West, 3901 Rainbow Blvd., Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (tof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/physiology', 'Janus Kinases/physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*virology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/drug therapy/virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/physiology', 'STAT Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/physiology']",2008/04/19 09:00,2008/07/10 09:00,['2008/04/19 09:00'],"['2008/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-008-0208-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2008 Jun;13(6):733-47. doi: 10.1007/s10495-008-0208-7.,201,,10.1007/s10495-008-0208-7 [doi],PMC2633601,,,,,"['R01 CA115398-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA115398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106258-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA115398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS81007'],,,,,,,,

In both isolates, the G to T mutation was found in two of six alleles, and no further mutations in the genes coding for 23S rRNA were found.

It is therefore important to understand the molecular pathways that control both the induction of transformation and the treatment of relapsed disease. In this Review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms responsible for disease induction and maintenance.

We evaluated dexamethasone pharmacokinetics in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed 214 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received 418 courses of oral dexamethasone (8 mg/m(2)/d) on days 1 and 8 of reinduction. Extensive asparaginase use preceded reinduction in the 101 children in the standard/high-risk treatment arm but not in the 113 children in the low-risk treatment arm. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and disposition was fit to dexamethasone plasma concentrations by using maximum a posteriori probability estimation; we evaluated covariates by using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Interpatient and intrapatient variabilities in apparent clearance were substantial; they were 46% and 53%, respectively. Variability was explained by the serum albumin concentration (P < .0001), concomitant use of fentanyl (P = .008) and ketoconazole (P = .03), and age (P = .006). Apparent clearance was higher in the low-risk arm (P < .001) and was related to a greater serum albumin concentration (P < .001) and to a lower exposure to asparaginase than in the standard/high-risk arm. Hypoalbuminemia, a biomarker of asparaginase activity, was associated with a lower dexamethasone apparent clearance (P = .04) in patients in the standard/high-risk arm that was more pronounced in those not allergic to asparaginase. Ethnicity or gender did not explain apparent clearance variability. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone pharmacokinetics are highly variable and are related to the concurrent use of particular drugs, age, and treatment intensity. Patients allergic to asparaginase may be doubly disadvantaged: they not only suffer from diminished exposure to asparaginase but also, by maintaining high clearance of dexamethasone, may experience fewer antileukemic effects of dexamethasone.","['Yang, Lei', 'Panetta, John C', 'Cai, Xiangjun', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Kornegay, Nancy', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Yang L', 'Panetta JC', 'Cai X', 'Yang W', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Kornegay N', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N Lauderdale, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/etiology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Risk Factors']",2008/04/19 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2008/04/19 09:00'],"['2008/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/12/1932 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.13.8404 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Apr 20;26(12):1932-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.8404.,,,10.1200/JCO.2007.13.8404 [doi],,,,,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['J Clin Oncol. 2008 Apr 20;26(12):1917-8.

After a 100-mg single p.o. dose of [(14)C]dasatinib to healthy volunteers, the radioactivity was rapidly absorbed (T(max) approximately 0.5 h). Both dasatinib and total radioactivity (TRA) plasma concentrations decreased rapidly with elimination half-life values of <4 h. Dasatinib was the major drug-related component in human plasma. At 2 h, dasatinib accounted for 25% of the TRA in plasma, suggesting that metabolites contributed significantly to the total drug-related component. There were many circulating metabolites detected that included hydroxylated metabolites (M20 and M24), an N-dealkylated metabolite (M4), an N-oxide (M5), an acid metabolite (M6), glucuronide conjugates (M8a,b), and products of further metabolism of these primary metabolites. Most of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the feces (85%). Urine recovery accounted for <4% of the dose. Dasatinib accounted for <1 and 19% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively, suggesting that dasatinib was well absorbed after p.o. administration and extensively metabolized before being eliminated from the body. The exposures of pharmacologically active metabolites M4, M5, M6, M20, and M24 in patients, along with their cell-based IC(50) for Src and Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition, suggested that these metabolites were not expected to contribute significantly toward in vivo activity.","['Christopher, Lisa J', 'Cui, Donghui', 'Wu, Chiyuan', 'Luo, Roger', 'Manning, James A', 'Bonacorsi, Samuel J', 'Lago, Michael', 'Allentoff, Alban', 'Lee, Francis Y F', 'McCann, Betty', 'Galbraith, Susan', 'Reitberg, Donald P', 'He, Kan', 'Barros, Anthony Jr', 'Blackwood-Chirchir, Anne', 'Humphreys, W Griffith', 'Iyer, Ramaswamy A']","['Christopher LJ', 'Cui D', 'Wu C', 'Luo R', 'Manning JA', 'Bonacorsi SJ', 'Lago M', 'Allentoff A', 'Lee FY', 'McCann B', 'Galbraith S', 'Reitberg DP', 'He K', 'Barros A Jr', 'Blackwood-Chirchir A', 'Humphreys WG', 'Iyer RA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Candidate Optimization, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080417,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine']",2008/04/19 09:00,2008/08/12 09:00,['2008/04/19 09:00'],"['2008/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['dmd.107.018267 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.107.018267 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2008 Jul;36(7):1357-64. doi: 10.1124/dmd.107.018267.

Method A descriptive study of MS patients with a documented oncological event was performed. From 1 January 1995 to 30 June 2006, we collected and studied the profile of 7,418 MS patients gathered from nine French MS centers. We evaluated the incidence of cancer in a Cancer Risk In MS Cohort. RESULTS: Thirty one patients (1.75%) with confirmed MS had a history of cancer: mean age at MS diagnosis of 37.9 years and a mean age at cancer diagnosis of 46.4 years. The most frequent cancers were breast (34.5%), gynecological (12.5%), skin (10.2%), acute leukemia and lymphoma (5.9%), digestive (8.8%), kidney and bladder (5.1%), lung (3.4%) and central nervous system (3%). Calculated standardized incidence rates were 0.29 (0.17-0.45) for men and 0.53 (0.42-0.66) for women. The incidence of cancer in this MS population was lower than that expected for the general population. Matched to age, gender and histology, cancers in MS were associated with a young age and exposure to IS treatments. When considering all patients, treated patients had a 3-fold higher risk of developing cancer, if they had a history of IS (P = 0.0035). For treated patients, the cancer sites were more likely the breast, the urinary tract, the digestive system and the skin. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that MS patients do not have an increased risk of cancer. Rather for several types of cancer a significantly reduced risk was observed, except for breast cancer in women treated with IS. The relative increased risk of breast cancer in MS women under IS treatment warrants further attention.","['Lebrun, Christine', 'Debouverie, Marc', 'Vermersch, Patrick', 'Clavelou, Pierre', 'Rumbach, Lucien', 'de Seze, Jerome', 'Wiertlevski, Sandrine', 'Defer, Gilles', 'Gout, Olivier', 'Berthier, Frederic', 'Danzon, Arlette']","['Lebrun C', 'Debouverie M', 'Vermersch P', 'Clavelou P', 'Rumbach L', 'de Seze J', 'Wiertlevski S', 'Defer G', 'Gout O', 'Berthier F', 'Danzon A']","['Service de Neurologie, CHU Pasteur, 06002 Nice, France. lebrun.c@chu-nice.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Mult Scler,"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",9509185,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', '5M691HL4BO (Glatiramer Acetate)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Azathioprine/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/epidemiology', 'Glatiramer Acetate', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Interferon-beta/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Peptides/therapeutic use', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Urologic Neoplasms/epidemiology']",2008/04/19 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/04/19 09:00'],"['2008/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/3/399 [pii]', '10.1177/1352458507083625 [doi]']",ppublish,Mult Scler. 2008 Apr;14(3):399-405. doi: 10.1177/1352458507083625.,,,10.1177/1352458507083625 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail of HER-2 is cleaved by caspases at Asp(1016)/Asp(1019) to release a approximately 47-kDa product, which is subsequently proteolyzed by caspases at Asp(1125) into an unstable 22-kDa fragment that is degraded by the proteasome and a predicted 25-kDa product. Both the 47- and 25-kDa products translocate to mitochondria, release cytochrome c by a Bcl-x(L)-suppressible mechanism, and induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. The 47- and 25-kDa HER-2 cleavage products share a functional BH3-like domain, which is required for cytochrome c release in cells and isolated mitochondria and for apoptosis induction. Caspase-cleaved HER-2 binds Bcl-x(L) and acts synergistically with truncated Bid to induce apoptosis, mimicking the actions of the BH3-only protein Bad. Moreover, the HER-2 cleavage products cooperate with Noxa to induce apoptosis in cells expressing both Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, confirming their Bad-like function. Collectively, our results indicate that caspases activate a previously unrecognized proapoptotic function of HER-2 by releasing a Bad-like cell death effector.","['Strohecker, Anne M', 'Yehiely, Fruma', 'Chen, Feng', 'Cryns, Vincent L']","['Strohecker AM', 'Yehiely F', 'Chen F', 'Cryns VL']","['Cell Death Regulation Laboratory, Departments of Medicine and Cell and Molecular Biology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080417,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2008/04/19 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/04/19 09:00'],"['2008/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)81575-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M802156200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Jun 27;283(26):18269-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M802156200.

To fulfil this goal, we use the HL-60 promyeolocytic cells as our model system and the following experimental procedures: cell growth assay, Hoetsch staining, cell cycle analysis and DNA fragmentation, caspase 3 activity and zymographic assays. Our results show that this compound inhibits proliferation and has potent and specific pro-apoptotic effects on HL-60 promyelocytic cells, inducing their nuclei and DNA fragmentation, as well as caspase 3 activity activation. Furthermore, 8-epipuupehedione strongly inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-2 and urokinase production by HL-60 cells.

Exposures requiring this management are often not recognized. Varicella can be a severe disease when it occurs in immunocompromised children, in spite of antiviral therapy. Varicella exposure and varicella in these children can also disrupt scheduled therapy for their underlying illness. Both postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of varicella are likely to be expensive and use significant medical resources. Numerous trials have been undertaken to vaccinate children who are immunocompromised by a variety of conditions and therapies that depress their immune function. METHODS: Clinical trials of varicella vaccine administration to immunocompromised children that were reported since 1975 were identified in the Ovid medical database. Reports were selected for analysis and discussion on the basis of their completeness and the utility of their conclusions. RESULTS: Vaccination before immune compromise is discussed as a strategy for some settings. The obstacles, potential opportunities, and success in varicella vaccination for immunocompromised children are separately analyzed for (1) children with leukemia and other malignancies, (2) human immunodeficiency virus-infected children, and (3) children with hematopoietic stem cell or solid-organ transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination before immune compromise is often successful, and the vaccine-induced response is usually partially or fully protective. In many treatment settings, it is possible to safely vaccinate once the level of immune suppression has been reduced. Targets for future research are outlined. A consensus conference should be undertaken to develop guidelines for the use of varicella vaccine in immunocompromised children.","['Levin, Myron J']",['Levin MJ'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, USA.

METHODS: From 2001 to 2004, 163 adult patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia at our center: 41 patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 122 patients had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Their charts were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Of these 163 patients, 16 patients (9.8%) developed hepatosplenic fungal infection: three were ALL patients and 13 were AML patients. All of these patients suffered from febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy. Duration of agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count < 500/dl) was 10 to 36 days, with a median of 20 days. Clinical presentations in these patients were fever (94%), diarrhea (50%), abdominal pain (44%), oral mucositis (44%), papular skin lesions (31%) and lower back pain (7%). Fourteen patients (88%) had elevated alkaline phosphatase levels between 197 U/l to 1172 U/l (normal range: 28-94 U/l). The most common infection sites found by computed tomography were the spleen (94%) and the liver (88%). All patients were treated with antifungal agents. No patient died as a result of the fungal infection episode. Nine patients (56%) died due to uncontrolled underlying hematological malignancies. The median duration of follow-up was 15.2 months (range: 2.3-47.4 months). CONCLUSION: Alkaline phosphatase level and computed tomography are useful tools for the diagnosis of hepatosplenic fungal infection. Infection-related mortality is very low with effective treatment.

Protein/DNA array analysis showed that activation of E2F was seen after 6-h exposure to 1 and 10 microM arsenite. In contrast, activation of NF-kappaB took place only at 1 microM arsenite, whereas 10 microM arsenite showed no recognizable effect on this nuclear transcription factor in the protein/DNA array analysis. EMSA using a NF-kappaB consensus probe indicates the functional activation of RelB/p50 in the presence of 1 microM arsenite, confirming the above results. Luciferase reporter assay for NF-kappaB showed activation of NF-kappaB in the presence of 1 microM arsenite. Interleukin (IL)-8 and B-cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) mRNA expression, which have been shown to be regulated through NF-kappaB, were activated in the presence of 1 microM arsenite. These results support the hypothesis that the primary action of nonapoptotic concentrations of arsenite in this cell line is activation of NF-kappaB, signaling as a decision maker for end results such as inflammation disease or cancer. This finding offers the possibility of providing a logical explanation for the observations made by many scientists that chronic exposure of human populations to low doses of arsenic is significantly correlated to clinical signs of inflammation in many tissues.","['Yamamoto, Megumi', 'Hirano, Seishiro', 'Vogel, Christoph F A', 'Cui, Xing', 'Matsumura, Fumio']","['Yamamoto M', 'Hirano S', 'Vogel CF', 'Cui X', 'Matsumura F']","['Environmental Health Sciences Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. yamamoto@nimd.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Arsenites/*toxicity', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'E2F Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/08/15 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.20222 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2008 Mar-Apr;22(2):136-46. doi: 10.1002/jbt.20222.,,,10.1002/jbt.20222 [doi],,,,,"['2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['ES05233/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES05707/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Recent studies in our laboratory indicated that oxidative stress plays a key role in ATO-induced cytotoxicity in human leukemia (HL-60) cells. In the present investigation, we performed the MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion test for cell viability. We also performed the thiobarbituric acid test to determine the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) production in HL-60 cells coexposed to either ascorbic acid (AA) and ATO or to n-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and ATO. The results of MTT assay indicated that AA exposure potentiates the cytotoxicity of ATO in HL-60 cells, as evidenced by a gradual increase in MDA levels with increasing doses of AA. In contrary, the addition of NAC to ATO-treated HL-60 cells resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of MDA production. From these results, we conclude that the addition of the AA to ATO-treated HL-60 cells enhances the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas the addition of NAC under the same experimental condition significantly (p < .05) decreases the level of ROS formation. On the basis of these direct in vitro findings, our studies provide evidence that AA may extend the therapeutic spectrum of ATO. The coadministration of NAC with ATO shows a potential specificity for tumor cells, indicating that it may not enhance the clinical outcome associated with ATO monotherapy in vivo.","['Yedjou, Clement G', 'Rogers, Christian', 'Brown, Erika', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Yedjou CG', 'Rogers C', 'Brown E', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH-RCMI Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39217, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*toxicity']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/08/15 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.20223 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2008 Mar-Apr;22(2):85-92. doi: 10.1002/jbt.20223.,,,10.1002/jbt.20223 [doi],PMC2678234,,,,"['2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['G12 RR013459/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 RR013459-11/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1G12RR13459/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS106191'],,,,,,,,

However, the 12 days of ex vivo culture required for the production of gene-modified cells (GMC), including soluble CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb)-mediated activation and expansion with interleukin (IL)-2, induced a decrease of GMC alloreactivity and a reversal of their CD4/CD8 ratio. Improving the culture protocol in order to maintain the highest alloreactivity is of critical importance in obtaining an optimal graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were activated with soluble CD3 MAb or CD3 and CD28 MAb co-immobilized on beads and expanded for 12 days in the presence of IL-2, IL-7 or IL-15 before analysis of alloreactivity and phenotype. Results Replacing the CD3 MAb by CD3/CD28 beads led to similar in vitro alloreactivity but improved the expansion and in vivo alloreactivity of GMC. Replacing the IL-2 with IL-7, but not IL-15, or decreasing IL-2 or IL-7 concentrations, improved the in vitro alloreactivity of expanded cells but was associated with lower expansion. Indeed, the alloreactivity of expanded cells was negatively correlated with cell expansion and positively correlated with CD4/CD8 ratio and CD8 expression level. Discussion Quantitative (i.e. low CD4/CD8 ratio) and qualitative (e.g. low CD8 expression) defects may account for the decreased alloreactivity of GMC. Using CD3/CD28 beads and/or IL-7 is more beneficial than CD3 MAb and IL-2 for preventing perturbations of the alloreactivity and phenotype of GMC.","['Mercier-Letondal, P', 'Montcuquet, N', 'Sauce, D', 'Certoux, J-M', 'Jeanningros, S', 'Ferrand, C', 'Bonyhadi, M', 'Tiberghien, P', 'Robinet, E']","['Mercier-Letondal P', 'Montcuquet N', 'Sauce D', 'Certoux JM', 'Jeanningros S', 'Ferrand C', 'Bonyhadi M', 'Tiberghien P', 'Robinet E']","['INSERM, Besancon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/05/23 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['791262084 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240801927032 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2008;10(3):275-88. doi: 10.1080/14653240801927032.,,,10.1080/14653240801927032 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed outcome in 61 patients with high-risk leukemia receiving a combination of fludarabine and intermediate-dose cytarabine as induction (n = 11) or salvage therapy (n = 35). Thirty-six patients having a suitable stem cell donor proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Ten patients received fludarabine-based salvage therapy without consecutive allogeneic transplantation and 15 patients received fludarabine/intermediate-dose cytarabine because of disease relapse following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In patients without prior allogeneic HSCT (n = 46) the complete remission rate (CR) was 41% with a CR rate of 46 and 14% in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), respectively. Overall survival for patients achieving a CR was 41 versus 0% for patients not achieving CR (P < 0.0001). The best outcome was observed in patients receiving an allogeneic HSCT in CR following fludarabine/ intermediate-dose cytarabine (47 vs. 0% for patients not in CR at the time of allografting, P = 0.01). All 10 patients receiving fludarabine/intermediate-dose cytarabine without subsequent allogeneic HSCT died within 3 years either of disease relapse/progression or infection. Only 1/15 (7%) patients receiving fludarabine/intermediate-dose cytarabine because of relapse following allogeneic HSCT became a long-term survivor. By multivariate analysis achieving CR, receiving an allogeneic HSCT, and being in first relapse or untreated were the only parameters that significantly determine the outcome. Although preliminary only high-risk AML patients having a stem cell donor are candidates for fludarabine/intermediate-dose cytarabine and only those achieving a CR should be referred to subsequent allogeneic HSCT. All other patients with high-risk leukemia are candidates for experimental therapies within controlled trials.","['Auberger, Jutta', 'Clausen, Johannes', 'Willenbacher, Wolfgang', 'Erdel, Martin', 'Gunsilius, Eberhard', 'Petzer, Andreas', 'Gastl, Gunther', 'Nachbaur, David']","['Auberger J', 'Clausen J', 'Willenbacher W', 'Erdel M', 'Gunsilius E', 'Petzer A', 'Gastl G', 'Nachbaur D']","['Clinical Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck Medical University, Anichstrasse 35, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria. jutta.auberger@i-med.ac.at.', 'Clinical Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck Medical University, Anichstrasse 35, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Clinical Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck Medical University, Anichstrasse 35, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Clinical Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck Medical University, Anichstrasse 35, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Clinical Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck Medical University, Anichstrasse 35, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Clinical Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck Medical University, Anichstrasse 35, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Clinical Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck Medical University, Anichstrasse 35, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2008/04/18 09:00,2009/04/16 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0084-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0084-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 May;87(4):382-386. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0084-5.,,,10.1007/s12185-008-0084-5 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the leukemia stem cells (LSCs) have been phenotypically restricted within the CD34+CD38- fraction. To understand the origin of malignant cells in primary human B-precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL), we established a novel in vivo xenotransplantation model. Purified CD34+CD38+CD19+, CD34+CD38-CD19+ and CD34+CD38-CD19- bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) cells from three pediatric B-ALL patients were intravenously injected into sublethally irradiated newborn NOD/SCID/IL2rgamma(null) mice. We found that both CD34+CD38+CD19+ and CD34+CD38-CD19+ cells initiate B-ALL in primary recipients, whereas the recipients of CD34+CD38-CD10-CD19- cells showed normal human hematopoietic repopulation. The extent of leukemic infiltration into the spleen, liver and kidney was similar between the recipients transplanted with CD34+CD38+CD19+ cells and those transplanted with CD34+CD38-CD19+ cells. In each of the three cases studied, transplantation of CD34+CD38+CD19+ cells resulted in the development of B-ALL in secondary recipients, demonstrating self-renewal capacity. The identification of CD34+CD38+CD19+ self-renewing B-ALL cells proposes a hierarchy of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) distinct from that of AML.

Because Bcr-Abl TK is chaperoned by Hsp90 (90 kDa heat-shock protein), we investigated the effects of novobiocin (NB), an Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitor, on the viability of the Bcr-Abl-positive human leukemia cells HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562, the expression of Bcr-Abl protein and the interaction between Hsp90 and Bcr-Abl TK. Present studies demonstrate that NB is a potent inhibitor of the growth of Bcr-Abl-positive human leukemia cells. NB induces cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, triggering apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells. Treatment of cell lines with NB disrupts Bcr-Abl /Hsp90 and Bcr-Abl /Hsp70 interactions, resulting in a decreased amount of intracellular Bcr-Abl protein levels. Co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl leucyl-leucyl norlucinal increases NB-mediated accumulation of Bcr-Abl in the detergent-insoluble cellular fraction, which demonstrates that NB promotes proteasomal degradation of Bcr-Abl. Moreover, both imatinib-resistant K562/G01 and primary CML CD34(+) cells are sensitive to NB.","['Wu, L X', 'Xu, J H', 'Zhang, K Z', 'Lin, Q', 'Huang, X W', 'Wen, C X', 'Chen, Y Z']","['Wu LX', 'Xu JH', 'Zhang KZ', 'Lin Q', 'Huang XW', 'Wen CX', 'Chen YZ']","['Deparment of Pharmacology, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, PR China. wlx-lisa@126.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20080417,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Novobiocin/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200889 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.89 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jul;22(7):1402-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.89.

To investigate whether HLA-DP-specific T cells could mediate GVL reactivity following HLA-DPB1-mismatched URD-SCT and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), we analyzed the immune response in a patient with leukemic lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma responding to DLI without graft-versus-host disease. The emergence of leukemia-reactive CD4+ T cells during the clinical immune response was demonstrated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot(ELISPOT)analysis. Following clonal isolation of these leukemia-reactive CD4+ T cells, blocking studies, panel studies and retroviral transduction experiments of both mismatched HLA-DPB1 alleles identified HLA-DPB1(*)0201 and HLA-DPB1(*)0301 as the targets of this immune response. The HLA-DPB1-specific CD4+ T-cell clones were capable of recognizing and lysing several HLA-DP-expressing myeloid and lymphoid hematological malignant cells. Since HLA-DP expression is mainly restricted to hematopoietic cells, HLA-DP may be used as a specific target for immunotherapy following T-cell-depleted URD-SCT. Therefore, in patients with HLA class II-expressing hematological malignancies HLA-DP-mismatched SCT may be preferable over fully matched SCT allowing DLI to induce a GVL effect.","['Rutten, C E', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A P', 'Griffioen, M', 'Marijt, E W A', 'Jedema, I', 'Heemskerk, M H M', 'Posthuma, E F M', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H F']","['Rutten CE', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Griffioen M', 'Marijt EW', 'Jedema I', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Posthuma EF', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. c.e.rutten@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080417,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200890 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.90 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jul;22(7):1387-94. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.90.

Subjects were the first 30 consecutive patients from a prospective clinical trial, and seven pilot patients treated identically. Using real-time quantitative-PCR (RQ-PCR) and/or flow-based MRD monitoring (sensitivity >or=10(-4)), five distinct patterns of MRD kinetics could be identified: patients who promptly achieved durable MRD negativity without direct evidence of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects (Group 1) (n=4; no clinical relapse); patients with complete and sustained MRD response after GVL induced by immunosuppression tapering (Group 2) or donor lymphocyte infusions (Group 3) (n=18; one relapse); patients without MRD response due to lack of GVL (Group 4) (n=2; two relapses); patients with incomplete and transient MRD response to GVL (Group 5) (n=4; three relapses). In summary, this study provides a comprehensive map of possible MRD courses and their prognostic implications after T-replete allo-SCT in high-risk CLL, indicating that effective GVL activity is induced virtually in all patients who develop chronic GVHD. However, in a significant proportion of cases, this does not translate into sustained disease control due to development of secondary GVL resistance.","['Ritgen, M', 'Bottcher, S', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Bunjes, D', 'Schubert, J', 'Cohen, S', 'Humpe, A', 'Hallek, M', 'Kneba, M', 'Schmitz, N', 'Dohner, H', 'Dreger, P']","['Ritgen M', 'Bottcher S', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Bunjes D', 'Schubert J', 'Cohen S', 'Humpe A', 'Hallek M', 'Kneba M', 'Schmitz N', 'Dohner H', 'Dreger P']","['Department of Medicine II, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080417,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200896 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.96 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jul;22(7):1377-86. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.96.

Here, we show that human Topo IIIalpha colocalizes with telomeric proteins at ALT-associated promyelocytic bodies from ALT cells. In these cells, Topo IIIalpha immunoprecipitated with telomere binding protein (TRF) 2 and BLM and was shown to be associated with telomeric DNA by chromatin immunoprecipitation, suggesting that these proteins form a complex at telomere sequences. Topo IIIalpha depletion by small interfering RNA reduced ALT cell survival, but did not affect telomerase-positive cell lines. Moreover, repression of Topo IIIalpha expression in ALT cells reduced the levels of TRF2 and BLM proteins, provoked a strong increase in the formation of anaphase bridges, induced the degradation of the G-overhang signal, and resulted in the appearance of DNA damage at telomeres. In contrast, telomere maintenance and TRF2 levels were unaffected in telomerase-positive cells. We conclude that Topo IIIalpha is an important telomere-associated factor, essential for telomere maintenance and chromosome stability in ALT cells, and speculate on its potential mechanistic function.","['Temime-Smaali, Nassima', 'Guittat, Lionel', 'Wenner, Thomas', 'Bayart, Emilie', 'Douarre, Celine', 'Gomez, Dennis', 'Giraud-Panis, Marie-Josephe', 'Londono-Vallejo, Arturo', 'Gilson, Eric', 'Amor-Gueret, Mounira', 'Riou, Jean-Francois']","['Temime-Smaali N', 'Guittat L', 'Wenner T', 'Bayart E', 'Douarre C', 'Gomez D', 'Giraud-Panis MJ', 'Londono-Vallejo A', 'Gilson E', 'Amor-Gueret M', 'Riou JF']","[""Laboratoire d'Onco-Pharmacologie, JE 2428, UFR de Pharmacie, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080417,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (TERF2 protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Bloom syndrome protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/analysis/metabolism', 'Anaphase', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Chromosomal Instability/genetics', 'DNA Helicases/analysis/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Subunits/analysis/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/pharmacology', 'RecQ Helicases', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomere/*metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/analysis/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/analysis/metabolism']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/06/17 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2007/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['emboj200874 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2008.74 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2008 May 21;27(10):1513-24. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2008.74.

Aberration in Notch signaling is associated with tumorigenesis of tissues from various origins. To investigate the role Notch signaling plays in the proliferation of cancer cell lines, the expression profiles of Notch1 in six human cancer cell lines (Jurkat, HepG2, SW620, KATOIII, A375, BT474) were examined. All cell lines differentially expressed Notch1, and only Jurkat and SW620 expressed cleaved Notch1 (Val1744). Among the six cell lines tested, only Jurkat and HepG2 showed a decrease in cell proliferation during 4 days of treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI). This is the first report on the anti-proliferative effects of GSI on a human hepatoma cell line. These two cell lines expressed Notch1-3, Jagged1, Jagged2, Dlk1 and Hes1. GSI treatment led to a decrease in Hes1 expression in both cell lines. Surprisingly, GSI treatment resulted in the accumulation of Notch1 protein upon treatment. During this period, GSI treatment did not induce apoptosis, but caused cell cycle arrest in both cell lines. This was also correlated with decreased c-myc expression. Forced expression of activated intracellular Notch1 completely abrogated GSI sensitivity in both cell lines. These results clearly demonstrate that Notch signaling positively regulates cell proliferation in Jurkat and HepG2 cell lines and that GSI treatment inhibits tumor cell proliferation through the suppression of Notch signaling.","['Suwanjunee, Saipin', 'Wongchana, Wipawee', 'Palaga, Tanapat']","['Suwanjunee S', 'Wongchana W', 'Palaga T']","['Program in Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Receptors, Notch/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282fc6cdd [doi]', '00001813-200806000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2008 Jun;19(5):477-86. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282fc6cdd.,,,10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282fc6cdd [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, to investigate the mechanism of relapse, we analysed clonal populations in 27 pairs of matched diagnosis and relapse ALL samples using PCR-based detection of multiple antigen receptor gene rearrangements. These clonal markers revealed the emergence of apparently new populations at relapse in 13 patients. In those cases where the new 'relapse clone' could be detected in the diagnosis population, there was a close correlation between length of first remission and quantity of the relapse clone in the diagnosis sample. A shorter length of time to first relapse correlated with a higher quantity of the relapsing clone at diagnosis. This observation, together with demonstrated differential chemosensitivity between sub-clones at diagnosis, indicates that relapse in ALL patients may commonly involve selection of a minor intrinsically resistant sub-clone that is undetectable by routine PCR-based methods. From a clinical perspective, relapse prediction may be improved with strategies to detect minor potentially resistant sub-clones early during treatment, hence allowing intensification of therapy. Together with the availability of relevant in vivo experimental models and powerful technology for detailed analysis of patient specimens, this new information will help shape future experimentation towards targeted therapy for high-risk ALL.","['Henderson, Michelle J', 'Choi, Seoyeon', 'Beesley, Alex H', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Venn, Nicola C', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Norris, Murray D']","['Henderson MJ', 'Choi S', 'Beesley AH', 'Sutton R', 'Venn NC', 'Marshall GM', 'Kees UR', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australiafor Medical Research, Experimental Therapeutics Program, PO Box 81 (HighSt), Randwick, Sydney, NSW 2031 Australia. mhenderson@ccia.unsw.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080229,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)']",IM,"['Child', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Receptors, Antigen/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['5885 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.7.10.5885 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2008 May 15;7(10):1315-20. doi: 10.4161/cc.7.10.5885.

Role of treatment with rasburicase.,197-9,"INTRODUCTION: Oral fludarabine is the first oral formulation of a purine analogue available for clinical use which has produced encouraging results in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It has a similar tolerability profile to that of the intravenous formulation. Acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) induced by fludarabine appears to be a fairly unusual complication during the treatment of CLL. CASE REPORT: The present report describes the case of a 78-year-old man who developed acute renal failure associated with TLS following the first course of oral fludarabine. Laboratory investigations fulfilled the TLS typical criteria, including hyperkalemia, marked hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and acute renal failure. Despite the many documented side effects of oral fludarabine, there is only one similar case of oral fludarabine-induced TLS reported to date. Conventional therapy with short-term supportive hemodialysis and a short treatment of rasburicase for 2 days achieved a complete recovery of renal function and a decrease of the urate level to within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be alert to this potentially life-threatening metabolic emergency among CLL patients treated with oral fludarabine.","['Calvo-Villas, Jose Manuel', 'Urcuyo, Basilio Martin', 'Umpierrez, Adelaida Morales', 'Sicilia, Francisco']","['Calvo-Villas JM', 'Urcuyo BM', 'Umpierrez AM', 'Sicilia F']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital General de Lanzarote, Arrecife de Lanzarote, Spain. jmcvillas@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20080320,Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Urate Oxidase/*administration & dosage', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/05/30 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['000118524 [pii]', '10.1159/000118524 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2008 Apr;31(4):197-9. doi: 10.1159/000118524.

We investigated the fractal qualities of normal and malignant hematological cells and their potential as a tool for characterizing cell phenotype and clinical behavior. METHODS: A mathematical algorithm and an optic tool for fractal analysis of nuclei were developed. A total of 4,713 lymphoid cells derived from 66 patients of five distinct diagnostic groups (normal and reactive lymphocytes, low-grade lymphomas and an aggressive lymphoma) were assessed for their fractal dimension. In addition, in 19 patients fractal analysis of leukemia cells was compared to clinical endpoints. RESULTS: After validating our method, hematological cells possessed fractal dimensions corresponding to their clinical entity. There was a highly significant overall difference in fractal dimensions between various types of hematological malignancies. A preliminary correlation was found between the fractal dimension and the clinical outcome of leukemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hematological cells possess fractal dimensions that correlate with their biological properties. Measurement of fractal dimension seems to be a sensitive method to assess the hematological cell phenotype and to define a clinical group. This tool may be potentially useful for the evaluation of clinical behavior of hematological diseases.","['Mashiah, Adi', 'Wolach, Ofir', 'Sandbank, Judith', 'Uziel, Orit', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Lahav, Meir']","['Mashiah A', 'Wolach O', 'Sandbank J', 'Uziel O', 'Raanani P', 'Lahav M']","['Department of Internal Medicine A, Rabin Medical Center-Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20080416,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', '*Fractals', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*pathology', 'Photomicrography/instrumentation/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Pseudolymphoma/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2007/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['000125551 [pii]', '10.1159/000125551 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2008;119(3):142-50. doi: 10.1159/000125551.

However, rest of the FAB subtypes were assigned into high, intermediate and low risk categories without any correlation with the survival and/or leukemic transformation. RARS subtype revealed itself as the better prognostic category according to the cytogenetic findings as well as Mufti's grading system.

B-cell leukemia lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) protects endothelial cells (EC) from apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli. Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated attenuation of postnatal retinal vascular development and retinal neovascularization during oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy in bcl-2-deficient (bcl-2-/-) mice. To gain further insight into the function of bcl-2 in the endothelium, we isolated retinal EC from bcl-2+/+ and bcl-2-/- mice. Retinal EC lacking bcl-2 demonstrated reduced cell migration, tenascin-C expression, and adhesion to vitronectin and fibronectin. The bcl-2-/- retinal EC also failed to undergo capillary morphogenesis in Matrigel. In addition, using an ex vivo angiogenesis assay, we observed reduced sprouting from aortic rings grown in culture from bcl-2-/- mice compared with bcl-2+/+ mice. Furthermore, reexpression of bcl-2 was sufficient to restore migration and capillary morphogenesis defects observed in bcl-2-/- retinal EC. Mechanistically, bcl-2-/- cells expressed significantly less endothelial nitric oxide synthase, an important downstream effecter of proangiogenic signaling. This may be attributed to increased oxidative stress in the absence of bcl-2.

Transfected MA139 ferret cells expressing the mCAT-1 cell surface receptor, with the minCAT-1 substitutions K222Q and V233L, did not restrict AKV MLV. The resistance of M. minutoides cells to AKV MLV was not relieved by inhibitors of glycosylation or by the introduction of NIH 3T3 mCAT-1. Resistance is thus not mediated by receptor sequence variation, expression level, or glycosylation. M. minutoides cells are also infectible with LacZ pseudotypes having AKV Env and Moloney MLV (MoMLV) Gag proteins, further indicating that AKV Env sequence variations do not contribute to the observed block. The pattern of virus resistance in M. minutoides differs from that of the known variants of the Fv1 postentry resistance gene; M. minutoides is equally resistant to N-, B-, and NR-tropic AKV viruses and is equally susceptible to NR- and NB-tropic Friend MLVs. This novel resistance blocks replication before reverse transcription, whereas Fv1 generally restricts replication after reverse transcription; M. minutoides cells produce 2-long-terminal-repeat viral DNA circles and linear viral DNA after infection with MoMLV but not with AKV MLV. Analysis of MoMLV-AKV MLV chimeras determined that the target of resistance is in the virus capsid gene. Mutagenesis demonstrated that restriction is mediated by two amino acid substitutions, H117L and A110R; substitutions at these sites can also be targeted by the resistance genes Fv1 and TRIM5alpha.

Although defects in the interferon antiviral response facilitate VSV oncolysis, other host factors, including translational and growth regulatory mechanisms, also appear to influence oncolytic virus activity. We previously demonstrated that VSV infection induces apoptosis in proliferating CD4(+) T lymphocytes from adult T-cell leukemia samples but not in resting T lymphocytes or primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells that remain arrested in G(0). Activation of primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes with anti-CD3/CD28 is sufficient to induce VSV replication and cell death in a manner dependent on activation of the MEK1/2, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway but not p38. VSV replication is specifically impaired by the cell cycle inhibitor olomoucine or rapamycin, which induces early G(1) arrest, but not by aphidicolin or Taxol, which blocks at the G(1)1S or G(2)1M phase, respectively; this result suggests a requirement for cell cycle entry for efficient VSV replication. The relationship between increased protein translation following G(0)/G(1) transition and VSV permissiveness is highlighted by the absence of mTOR and/or eIF4E phosphorylation whenever VSV replication is impaired. Furthermore, VSV protein production in activated T cells is diminished by small interfering RNA-mediated eIF4E knockdown. These results demonstrate that VSV replication in primary T lymphocytes relies on cell cycle transition from the G(0) phase to the G(1) phase, which is characterized by a sharp increase in ribogenesis and protein synthesis.","['Oliere, Stephanie', 'Arguello, Meztli', 'Mesplede, Thibault', 'Tumilasci, Vanessa', 'Nakhaei, Peyman', 'Stojdl, David', 'Sonenberg, Nahum', 'Bell, John', 'Hiscott, John']","['Oliere S', 'Arguello M', 'Mesplede T', 'Tumilasci V', 'Nakhaei P', 'Stojdl D', 'Sonenberg N', 'Bell J', 'Hiscott J']","['Molecular Oncology Group, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Canada H3T 1E2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080416,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*physiology', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Virus Replication']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02601-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02601-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jun;82(12):5735-49. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02601-07.

The goal of this project is to review the current published literature on this association. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies of benzene exposure and NHL and a meta-analysis of NHL and refinery work, a potential source of benzene exposure. RESULTS: In 22 studies of benzene exposure, the summary relative risk for NHL was 1.22 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.47; one-sided p value = 0.01). When studies that likely included unexposed subjects in the ""exposed"" group were excluded, the summary relative risk increased to 1.49 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.97, n = 13), and when studies based solely on self-reported work history were excluded, the relative risk rose to 2.12 (95% CI 1.11 to 4.02, n = 6). In refinery workers, the summary relative risk for NHL in all 21 studies was 1.21 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.46; p = 0.02). When adjusted for the healthy worker effect, this relative risk estimate increased to 1.42 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.69). CONCLUSIONS: The finding of elevated relative risks in studies of both benzene exposure and refinery work provides further evidence that benzene exposure causes NHL. In addition, the finding of increased relative risks after removing studies that included unexposed or lesser exposed workers in ""exposed"" cohorts, and increased relative risk estimates after adjusting for the healthy worker effect, suggest that effects of benzene on NHL might be missed in occupational studies if these biases are not accounted for.","['Steinmaus, C', 'Smith, A H', 'Jones, R M', 'Smith, M T']","['Steinmaus C', 'Smith AH', 'Jones RM', 'Smith MT']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA. craigs@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20080416,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Bias', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/analysis', 'Petroleum', 'Risk Assessment']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['oem.2007.036913 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2007.036913 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2008 Jun;65(6):371-8. doi: 10.1136/oem.2007.036913.

Although several molecular abnormalities have been associated with melanoma progression, the mechanisms underlying the differential gene expression are still largely unknown and targeted therapies are not yet available. Noncoding small RNAs, termed microRNAs (miR), have been recently reported to play important roles in major cellular processes, including those involved in cancer development and progression. We have identified the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor as a repressor of miR-221 and miR-222 by direct binding to their putative regulatory region. Specifically, PLZF silencing in melanomas unblocks miR-221 and miR-222, which in turn controls the progression of the neoplasia through down-modulation of p27Kip1/CDKN1B and c-KIT receptor, leading to enhanced proliferation and differentiation blockade of the melanoma cells, respectively. In vitro and in vivo functional studies, including the use of antisense ""antagomir"" oligonucleotides, confirmed the key role of miR-221/-222 in regulating the progression of human melanoma; this suggests that targeted therapies suppressing miR-221/-222 may prove beneficial in advanced melanoma.","['Felicetti, Federica', 'Errico, M Cristina', 'Bottero, Lisabianca', 'Segnalini, Patrizia', 'Stoppacciaro, Antonella', 'Biffoni, Mauro', 'Felli, Nadia', 'Mattia, Gianfranco', 'Petrini, Marina', 'Colombo, Mario P', 'Peschle, Cesare', 'Care, Alessandra']","['Felicetti F', 'Errico MC', 'Bottero L', 'Segnalini P', 'Stoppacciaro A', 'Biffoni M', 'Felli N', 'Mattia G', 'Petrini M', 'Colombo MP', 'Peschle C', 'Care A']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MIRN221 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN222 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Zinc Fingers']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/8/2745 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2538 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Apr 15;68(8):2745-54. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2538.,,,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2538 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The marked cells were either directly implanted into the tibialis anterior muscle or introduced into a variety of other tissue sites in immunocompromised mice (NOD/SCID and C.B-17 SCID/beige) to investigate their fates and differentiation potentials. It was observed that the hMSCs survived for up to 12 weeks and showed site-specific morphological phenotypes. hMSCs delivered by intravenous injection were found mainly in the lungs and were detected rarely in other organs. Histomorphometry showed that, after implantation of hMSCs into the tibialis anterior muscle juxtaskeletally, the areas of reactive host callus formation at 1 and 2 weeks and of ectopic human bone formation at 1 week were significantly increased compared with the control group. Expression of eGFP and human RUNX2, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and collagen type I mRNAs were detected in mice implanted with the labelled hMSCs but not in sham-treated samples. Active clearance of the reactive callus and ectopic calcified tissue by osteoclast-like tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells was observed. We conclude that the eGFP-labelled hMSCs can survive and retain the potential to differentiate morphologically into a variety of apparent mesenchymal phenotypes in vivo. Absolute confirmation of differentiation capacity requires further study and is complicated by known possibilities of fusion of donor and host cells or limited transfer of genetic material. Nevertheless, the genetically marked hMSCs are shown to participate extensively in bone formation and turnover. Control of the host osteoclast/macrophage responses resulting in clearance of formed osteogenic tissue warrants further investigation to promote prolonged human osteogenesis in immunocompromised mice. Furthermore, any proposed general cytotherapeutic strategy for enhanced osteogenesis is likely to require supplementation of local bone-forming biological signals.","['Xia, Zhidao', 'Locklin, Rachel M', 'Triffitt, James T']","['Xia Z', 'Locklin RM', 'Triffitt JT']","['Botnar Research Centre, Oxford University Institute of Musculoskeletal Sciences, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080415,Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX2 protein, human)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Ossification, Heterotopic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Osteogenesis', 'Osteopontin/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2007/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-9335(08)00045-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2008.02.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2008 Jun;87(6):353-64. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2008.02.013.

MNP and MDION salts were much less cytotoxic themselves (about 100-fold and 2000-fold compared with DOX and VINC, respectively) against HL60 cells but, in contrast to DOX and VINC, they conserved an important cytotoxic activity towards resistant HL60/VINC and HL60/DOX cells (resistance factor, RF = 2-4.5). It was shown that MNP(+)Cl(-) and MDION(+)Cl(-) increased the cytotoxicity of non-bioreductive antitumour agent VINC towards human promyelocytic leukaemia HL60 cells and its resistant sublines HL60/VINC and HL60/DOX. However, in the case of DOX the decrease in its cytotoxic activity towards all studied cell lines was observed in the presence of MNP(+)Cl(-) and MDION(+)Cl(-). Presented data suggest that the bioreductive drug DOX, in contrast to VINC, could compete with pyridinium salts (MNP(+)Cl(-) and MDION(+)Cl(-)) for NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases and for undergoing cellular reductive activation. This could explain the inefficiency of these salts to increase the cytotoxic activity of DOX against examined leukaemic HL60 cell line and its MDR sublines, HL60/VINC and HL60/DOX.","['Maruszewska, Agnieszka', 'Kostrzewa-Nowak, Dorota', 'Adamus, Jan', 'Czuprynska, Katarzyna', 'Maryniak, Dominika', 'Gebicki, Jerzy', 'Tarasiuk, Jolanta']","['Maruszewska A', 'Kostrzewa-Nowak D', 'Adamus J', 'Czuprynska K', 'Maryniak D', 'Gebicki J', 'Tarasiuk J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Szczecin, 3c Felczaka St, 71-412 Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (1-methyl-3-nitropyridinium)', '0 (3,3,6,6,10-pentamethyl-3,4,6,7-tetrahydro-(1,8(2H,5H)-dion)acridine chloride)', '0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Pyridinium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2008/04/18 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/04/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1211/jpp.60.5.0011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2008 May;60(5):647-53. doi: 10.1211/jpp.60.5.0011.,,,10.1211/jpp.60.5.0011 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, drug resistance is the major cause of treatment failure in children with ALL. The drug methotrexate (MTX), which is widely used to treat many human cancers, is used in essentially all treatment protocols worldwide for newly diagnosed ALL. Although MTX has been extensively studied for many years, relatively little is known about mechanisms of de novo resistance in primary cancer cells, including leukemia cells. This lack of knowledge is due in part to the fact that existing in vitro methods are not sufficiently reliable to permit assessment of MTX resistance in primary ALL cells. Therefore, we measured the in vivo antileukemic effects of MTX and identified genes whose expression differed significantly in patients with a good versus poor response to MTX. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We utilized measures of decreased circulating leukemia cells of 293 newly diagnosed children after initial ""up-front"" in vivo MTX treatment (1 g/m(2)) to elucidate interpatient differences in the antileukemic effects of MTX. To identify genomic determinants of these effects, we performed a genome-wide assessment of gene expression in primary ALL cells from 161 of these newly diagnosed children (1-18 y). We identified 48 genes and two cDNA clones whose expression was significantly related to the reduction of circulating leukemia cells after initial in vivo treatment with MTX. This finding was validated in an independent cohort of children with ALL. Furthermore, this measure of initial MTX in vivo response and the associated gene expression pattern were predictive of long-term disease-free survival (p < 0.001, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data provide new insights into the genomic basis of MTX resistance and interpatient differences in MTX response, pointing to new strategies to overcome MTX resistance in childhood ALL.

A limited number of initiating lesions, such as chromosomal translocations generating fusion genes, are constantly identified in specific forms of leukemia and are critical to leukemogenesis. Leukemia fusion proteins derived from chromosomal translocations can mediate epigenetic silencing of gene expression. Epigenetic deregulation of the DNA methylation status and of the chromatin ""histone code"" at specific gene sites cooperate in the pathogenesis of leukemias. The neutralization of these crucial oncogenic events can revert the leukemia phenotype. Thus, their identification and the study of their molecular and biological consequences is essential for the development of novel and specific therapeutic strategies.

The functional properties of HERG K+ channels are complex and their contribution to the repolarization of the cardiac action potential are well understood. Recent studies revealed that HERG K+ channels are preferentially expressed in different histogenesis of tumor cells. Leukemia is a cancer that originates in the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are critical in the perpetuation of the disease. A better understanding of LSCs and molecular biology will allow the design of more effective therapies. We report in this study that herg was expressed in CD34+/CD38-/ CD123(high) LSCs but not expressed in normal bone marrow CD34+/CD38- HSCs. In addtion, herg is also expressed in leukemia cell lines K562 and HL-60 and almost all the primary leukemia cells whereas not in the normal bone marrow cells. In addition, the expression of herg mRNA was not associated with the clinical and cytogenetic feature of leukemia. Moreover, HERG K+ channels can regulate leukemia cells proliferation and cell cycle. These data provide evidence for the oncogenic potential of HERG K+ channels and it may be a novel, potential pharmacological target for leukemia therapy in the future.","['Li, Huiyu', 'Liu, Liqiong', 'Guo, Linlin', 'Zhang, Jiahua', 'Du, Wen', 'Li, Xiaoqing', 'Liu, Wei', 'Chen, Xiangjun', 'Huang, Shiang']","['Li H', 'Liu L', 'Guo L', 'Zhang J', 'Du W', 'Li X', 'Liu W', 'Chen X', 'Huang S']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiegang Avenue, 430022, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiegang Avenue, 430022, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiegang Avenue, 430022, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiegang Avenue, 430022, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiegang Avenue, 430022, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiegang Avenue, 430022, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiegang Avenue, 430022, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiegang Avenue, 430022, Wuhan, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiegang Avenue, 430022, Wuhan, China. sa2huang@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",2008/04/17 09:00,2009/04/16 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2006/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0056-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0056-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 May;87(4):387-392. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0056-9.,,,10.1007/s12185-008-0056-9 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We herein demonstrate the anti-myeloma effect of a cephalotaxus alkaloid, homoharringtonine (HHT), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, through the induction of apoptosis. HHT significantly reduced Mcl-1, a crucial protein involved in myeloma cell survival, in all three myeloma cell lines examined, whereas certain BH3-only proteins, such as Bim, Bik, and Puma, remained unchanged following HHT treatment, and their expression levels depended on the cell type. HHT also reduced the levels of c-FLIP(L/S), activated caspase-8, and induced active truncated-Bid. Thus, HHT-induced apoptosis appears to be mediated via both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways, and the resultant imbalance between BH3-only proteins and Mcl-1 may be pivotal for apoptosis by HHT. In addition, HHT treatment resulted in reduced levels of beta-catenin and XIAP proteins, which also contribute to disease progression and resistance to chemotherapy in MM. In combination, HHT enhanced the effects of melphalan, bortezomib, and ABT-737. These results suggest that HHT could constitute an attractive option for MM treatment though its ability to simultaneously target multiple tumor-promoting molecules.","['Kuroda, Junya', 'Kamitsuji, Yuri', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Ashihara, Eishi', 'Kawata, Eri', 'Nakagawa, Yoko', 'Takeuichi, Miki', 'Murotani, Yoshihide', 'Yokota, Asumi', 'Tanaka, Ruriko', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Maekawa, Taira']","['Kuroda J', 'Kamitsuji Y', 'Kimura S', 'Ashihara E', 'Kawata E', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Takeuichi M', 'Murotani Y', 'Yokota A', 'Tanaka R', 'Andreeff M', 'Taniwaki M', 'Maekawa T']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan. junkuro@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 448, 1400 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080417,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Harringtonines/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*biosynthesis', 'beta Catenin/*biosynthesis']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0081-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0081-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Jun;87(5):507-515. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0081-8.

It is also used for in vitro neuronal studies to limit the proliferation of non-neuronal cells and thereby select nondividing neuronal cells. We studied the effects of Ara C on human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, especially the expression and sensitivity of the ion channel TRPV1, which responds to noxious heat and capsaicin and is a key mediator of neuropathic pain. METHODS: Human DRG neurons were cultured with or without Ara C for 2 weeks, after which Ara C was discontinued. Double immunostaining for the regenerative neuronal marker Gap43 and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 showed that the normal membrane-bound localisation of TRPV1 was absent in neurons with Ara C treatment, and as expected there was massive diminution of dividing non-neuronal cells. Calcium imaging studies showed that during exposure to Ara C the neurons lost responsiveness to capsaicin, although ionomycin responses were intact, indicating general cell viability and responsiveness. Between 2 days and up to 3 weeks after removal of Ara C, the neuronal responses to capsaicin were regained and were observed to be four times (P = 0.0008, Student's t-test) that of controls, but there was only a gradual recovery of non-neuronal cells. Three to six weeks after Ara C removal, capsaicin responses were comparable to controls. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that Ara C treatment blocked insertion of TRPV1 in the cell membrane, resulting in accumulation of the receptors in the cytoplasm, loss of capsaicin sensitivity, and membrane-bound immunostaining, which was restored with a rebound on withdrawal of Ara C. The observed pattern of loss of capsaicin sensitivity, followed by hypersensitivity and recovery, appears to reflect some of the features observed in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and may provide a model for developing new treatments and prophylaxis.","['Anand, Uma', 'Otto, William R', 'Bountra, Chas', 'Chessell, Iain', 'Sinisi, Marco', 'Birch, Rolfe', 'Anand, Praveen']","['Anand U', 'Otto WR', 'Bountra C', 'Chessell I', 'Sinisi M', 'Birch R', 'Anand P']","['Peripheral Neuropathy Unit, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080415,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Sensory System Agents)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Capsaicin/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'GAP-43 Protein/biosynthesis', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Neurons, Afferent/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/metabolism', 'Sensory System Agents/pharmacology', 'TRPV Cation Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2007/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11060-008-9585-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2008 Aug;89(1):1-7. doi: 10.1007/s11060-008-9585-6.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors have been reported to enhance 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D)-induced monocytic differentiation of promyeloblastic HL60 cells, but the mechanisms of this effect are not fully elucidated, and whether this potentiation can occur in other types of myeloid leukemia is not known. We found that combination treatment with 1,25D and non-specific COX inhibitors acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) or indomethacin can robustly potentiate differentiation of other types of human leukemia cells, i.e., U937, THP-1, and that ASA +/- 1,25D is effective in primary AML cultures. Increased cell differentiation is paralleled by arrest of the cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, and by increased phosphorylation of Raf1 and p90RSK1 proteins. However, there is no evidence that this increase in phosphorylation of Raf1 is transmitted through the ERK module of the MAPK signaling cascade. Transfection of small interfering (si) RNA to Raf1 decreased differentiation of U937 cells induced by a combination of ASA or indomethacin with 1,25D. However, phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, though not of p90RSK, were increased when P-Raf1 levels were decreased by the siRNA, suggesting that in this system the ERK module does not function in the conventional manner. Identification of the strong antiproliferative activity of ASA/1,25D combinations associated with monocytic differentiation has implications for cancer chemoprevention in individuals who have a predisposition to myeloid leukemia.","['Jamshidi, Farnaz', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Harrison, Jonathan S', 'Wang, Xuening', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Jamshidi F', 'Zhang J', 'Harrison JS', 'Wang X', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080114,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Aspirin/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/06/17 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['5620 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.7.7.5620 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2008 Apr 1;7(7):917-24. doi: 10.4161/cc.7.7.5620.

Drug-induced interference with the MDM2 E3 ligase function or with MDM2 protein-protein interactions abrogates tonic suppression and destruction of the p53 protein; consequently, p53 steady state levels rise resulting in the induction of p53-dependent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic genes. Some cancerous cells harboring wild type p53 respond to MDM2 inhibitor-induced elevated p53 protein levels with apoptotic cell death while non-malignant cells, for poorly understood reasons, appear relatively resistant. Deciphering the mechanisms of resistance or susceptibility to MDM2 inhibitor-induced cancer cell death is of significant importance for the clinical development and applications of MDM2 inhibitory compounds and serves to illuminate aspects of MDM2 and p53 biology. Using data from ex vivo MDM2 inhibitor treatment of a large cohort of molecularly highly characterized CLL cases, we were able to demonstrate the central role of p53 status as a determinant of resistance in this common leukemia. In the context of these experimental findings, we summarize pertinent knowledge of the biology of p53, MDM2, p53 target genes and MDM2 binding proteins.

We previously showed that the DNA repair protein Ku interacts at the cell surface of leukaemia cell lines with the 85 Kda pro-form of MMP-9 and these Ku/MMP-9 complexes regulates cell invasion, highlighting their importance in haematological malignancies. We demonstrate here that all samples of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts purified from bone marrow of 16 affected patients express the 85 Kda form of MMP-9. However, only AML that display monocytic lineage markers (AML4/5) express this form at the cell surface with co-expression of the membrane associated form of Ku.

However, the functions of this protein under normal conditions or in the absence of stress, if any, have remained a mystery. In humans, some alleles containing a functional single nucleotide polymorphism in the p53 gene and its negative regulator, the Mdm2 gene, are under positive selection over evolutionary time frames, suggesting that the p53 pathway might have important functions that are optimized and selected for by evolutionary or reproductive pressures. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated a new function for the p53 protein in the regulation of maternal reproduction in mice, through transcriptional regulation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a novel p53 target gene. Sufficient uterine LIF levels are essential for the implantation of blastocysts or early embryos into the uterus. p53 deficient (p53(-/-)) female mice have a reduced pregnancy rate and litter size, due to impaired implantation resulting from decreased uterine LIF levels. Administration of LIF to pregnant p53(-/-) mice restored maternal reproduction by improving implantation. An association has been reported between women carrying the p53 codon 72 polymorphism (a proline to arginine change) with recurrent implantation failure, suggesting a similar function for p53 in humans. These findings of a new function for the p53 protein in reproduction may help to explain the observed evolutionary selection of some alleles of the p53 and Mdm2 genes.

However, most T-ALL cell lines with mutations in NOTCH1 fail to respond to GSI therapy. Using gene expression profiling and mutation analysis we showed that mutational loss of PTEN is a common event in T-ALL and is associated with resistance to NOTCH inhibition. Furthermore, our studies revealed that NOTCH1 induces upregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway via HES1, which negatively controls the expression of PTEN. This regulatory circuitry is evolutionary conserved from Drosophila to humans as demonstrated by the interaction of overexpression of Delta and Akt in a model of Notch-induced transformation in the fly eye. Loss of PTEN and constitutive activation of AKT in T-ALL induce increased glucose metabolism and bypass the requirement of NOTCH1 signaling to sustain cell growth. Importantly, PTEN-null/GSI resistant T-ALL cells switch their oncogene addiction from NOTCH1 to AKT and are highly sensitive to AKT inhibitors.

Because SRC kinases are known to play an important role in physiologic T-cell activation, we analyzed the immunobiological effects of dasatinib on T-cell function. The effect of dasatinib on multiple T-cell effector functions was examined at clinically relevant doses (1-100 nmol/L); the promiscuous tyrosine kinase inhibitor staurosporine was used as a comparator. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Purified human CD3+ cells and virus-specific CD8+ T cells from healthy blood donors were studied directly ex vivo; antigen-specific effects were confirmed in defined T-cell clones. Functional outcomes included cytokine production (interleukin-2, IFN gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha), degranulation (CD107a/b mobilization), activation (CD69 up-regulation), proliferation (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester dilution), apoptosis/necrosis induction, and signal transduction. RESULTS: Both dasatinib and staurosporine inhibited T-cell activation, proliferation, cytokine production, and degranulation in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, this was mediated by the blockade of early signal transduction events and was not due to loss of T-cell viability. Overall, CD4+ T cells seemed to be more sensitive to these effects than CD8+ T cells, and naive T cells more sensitive than memory T-cell subsets. The inhibitory effects of dasatinib were so profound that all T-cell effector functions were shut down at therapeutically relevant concentrations. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that caution is warranted with use of this drug in the clinical setting and provide a rationale to explore the potential of dasatinib as an immunosuppressant in the fields of transplantation and T-cell-driven autoimmune diseases.","['Weichsel, Ralf', 'Dix, Carolin', 'Wooldridge, Linda', 'Clement, Matthew', 'Fenton-May, Angharad', 'Sewell, Andrew K', 'Zezula, Josef', 'Greiner, Elisabeth', 'Gostick, Emma', 'Price, David A', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Seggewiss, Ruth']","['Weichsel R', 'Dix C', 'Wooldridge L', 'Clement M', 'Fenton-May A', 'Sewell AK', 'Zezula J', 'Greiner E', 'Gostick E', 'Price DA', 'Einsele H', 'Seggewiss R']","['Immune Recovery Section, Med.

We hypothesized that MG98, an oligonucleotide antisense to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), could reverse malignant phenotypes by down-regulating DNMT1 and inducing reexpression of hypermethylated genes. This phase I study was conducted to determine a biologically effective dose and describe the safety of MG98 in MDS/AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-three patients with MDS (n = 11) and AML (n = 12) were enrolled. Biologically effective dose was defined as the dose at which > or =50% of patients experienced >50% reduction in DNMT1 expression with acceptable toxicity. Escalating doses of MG98 were administered according to two schedules (2-hour i.v. bolus followed by 5-day continuous i.v. infusion every 14 days, or 14-day continuous i.v. infusion every 21 days). RESULTS: DNMT1 down-regulation was observed in 8 patients. However, biologically effective dose was not reached. Reexpression of target genes (P15, WIT1, and ER) was observed in 12 patients but did not correlate with DNMT1 down-regulation. Escalation was stopped due to dose-limiting toxicities (bone pain, nausea, and fever). No objective clinical response was observed. Disease stabilization occurred in 6 (26%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: No pharmacodynamic or clinical activity was observed at MG98 doses and schedules administered. Despite this, pursuing DNMT1 down-regulation remains a sound approach for targeting aberrant epigenetics in AML/MDS. Future studies with different formulation and/or doses and schedules will be required to ensure efficient MG98 intracellular uptake and fully evaluate its therapeutic potential.","['Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Cataland, Spero', 'Klisovic, Marko I', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Blum, William', 'Green, Margaret', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi', 'Godley, Lucy', 'Burgt, Jennifer Vanden', 'Van Laar, Emily', 'Cullen, Michael', 'Macleod, A Robert', 'Besterman, Jeffrey M', 'Reid, Gregory K', 'Byrd, John C', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Klisovic RB', 'Stock W', 'Cataland S', 'Klisovic MI', 'Liu S', 'Blum W', 'Green M', 'Odenike O', 'Godley L', 'Burgt JV', 'Van Laar E', 'Cullen M', 'Macleod AR', 'Besterman JM', 'Reid GK', 'Byrd JC', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (MG 98 phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Thionucleotides/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/8/2444 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1320 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Apr 15;14(8):2444-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1320.,,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1320 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the statistical probability of therapeutic success is known for larger patient groups from clinical therapy trials, it is difficult to predict the individual response of tumors. The concept of individualized therapy aims to determine in vitro the drug response of tumors beforehand to choose effective treatment options for each individual patient. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed the cross-resistance profiles of different tumor types (cancers of lung, breast, and colon, and leukemia) towards drugs from different classes (anthracyclines, antibiotics, Vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, antimetabolites, and alkylating agents) by nucleotide incorporation and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Hierarchical cluster analysis and COMPARE analyses were applied. RESULTS: Tumors exert broad resistance profiles, e.g., tumors resistant to one drug tend to also be resistant to other drugs, whereas sensitive tumors reveal sensitivity towards many drugs. Interestingly, the broad spectrum resistance phenotype could reliably be predicted by doxorubicin alone. Expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter P-glycoprotein (ABCB1, MDR1) and the proliferative activity of tumors were identified as underlying mechanisms of broad spectrum resistance. To find novel compounds with activity against drug-resistant tumors, a database with 2,420 natural products was screened for compounds acting independent of P-glycoprotein and the proliferative state of tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Tumors exert cross-resistance profiles much broader than the classical multidrug resistance phenotype. Broad spectrum resistance can be predicted by doxorubicin due to the multifactorial mode of action of this drug. Novel cytotoxic compounds from natural resources might be valuable tools for strategies to bypass broad spectrum resistance.","['Efferth, Thomas', 'Konkimalla, V Badireenath', 'Wang, Yi-Fen', 'Sauerbrey, Axel', 'Meinhardt, Silke', 'Zintl, Felix', 'Mattern, Jurgen', 'Volm, Manfred']","['Efferth T', 'Konkimalla VB', 'Wang YF', 'Sauerbrey A', 'Meinhardt S', 'Zintl F', 'Mattern J', 'Volm M']","['German Cancer Research Center, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. t.efferth@dkfz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/8/2405 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4525 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Apr 15;14(8):2405-12. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4525.,,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4525 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up-regulation of HMGA2 protein is observed in many tumors and is associated with advanced cancers with poor prognoses. Although the expression and biochemical properties of HMGA2 protein are regulated by microRNA and phosphorylation, it is unknown whether HMGA2 activity can also be regulated by SUMOylation, and that is what is investigated in this report. We identified HMGA2 as a SUMOylation target and showed that the expression of wild-type HMGA2, but not SUMOylation-defective HMGA2(2K/R), selectively lowered the steady-state level of PML protein. Consequently, the HMGA2-elicited PML down-regulation rendered a reduction in the average number of PML nuclear bodies per cell and the volume of PML assembled per PML nuclear body. Using small interfering RNA to suppress endogenous ubiquitin expression and proteasome inhibitor to repress ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, we showed that HMGA2 confers PML down-regulation through ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent protein degradation. Importantly, arsenic trioxide treatment stimulated HMGA2 SUMOylation, leading to the formation of HMGA2 nuclear foci surrounding PML nuclear bodies and the stimulation of PML degradation. Collectively, our results unveil a previously unrecognized effect by HMGA2 on the modulation of PML protein level, providing a novel mechanism underlying HMGA2 function and underscoring the molecular basis for oncogenic progression by HMGA2.","['Cao, Xuefei', 'Clavijo, Carlos', 'Li, Xu', 'Lin, H Helen', 'Chen, Yuan', 'Shih, Hsiu-Ming', 'Ann, David K']","['Cao X', 'Clavijo C', 'Li X', 'Lin HH', 'Chen Y', 'Shih HM', 'Ann DK']","['Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (HMGA2 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HMGA2 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Parotid Gland/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes', 'Zinc Fingers']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/4/923 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0540 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Apr;7(4):923-34. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0540.,,,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0540 [doi],PMC2862987,,,,,"['P30 DK48522/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE014183/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM086171/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM086171-01A2/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA094595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM074748-01A2/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DE 14183/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK048522/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 94595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE010742/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM074748-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE 10742/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM074748/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS195271'],,,,,,,,

RA treatment can confer PML/RARalpha degradation, overcoming dominant-negative effects of this oncogenic protein. The present study uncovered independent retinoid degradation mechanisms, targeting different domains of PML/RARalpha. RA treatment is known to repress PML/RARalpha and augment ubiquitin-activating enzyme-E1-like (UBE1L) protein expression in NB4-S1 APL cells. We previously reported RA-induced UBE1L and the IFN-stimulated gene, 15-kDa protein ISG15ylation in APL cells. Whether the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 directly conjugates with PML/RARalpha was not explored previously and is examined in this study. Transient transfection experiments with different PML/RARalpha domains revealed that RA treatment preferentially down-regulated the RARalpha domain, whereas UBE1L targeted the PML domain for repression. As expected, ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (UBP43/USP18), the ISG15 deconjugase, opposed UBE1L but not RA-dependent PML/RARalpha degradation. In contrast, the proteasomal inhibitor, N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal, inhibited both UBE1L- and RA-mediated PML/RARalpha degradation. Notably, UBE1L induced ISG15ylation of the PML domain of PML/RARalpha, causing its repression. These findings confirmed that RA triggers PML/RARalpha degradation through different domains and distinct mechanisms. Taken together, these findings advance prior work by establishing two pathways converge on the same oncogenic protein to cause its degradation and thereby promote antineoplastic effects.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of 1R-Chl in the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and identified another polyamide conjugate, 6R-Chl, which targets H4 genes and elicits a similar cellular response. Other polyamide conjugates that do not target the H4 gene do not elicit this response. In a murine model, both 1R-Chl and 6R-Chl were found to be highly effective in blocking K562 xenograft growth with high-dose tolerance. Unlike conventional and distamycin-based alkylators, little or no cytotoxicities and animal toxicities were observed in mg/kg dosage ranges. These results suggest that these polyamide alkylators may be a viable treatment alternative for chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Chou, C James', 'Farkas, Michelle E', 'Tsai, Sherry M', 'Alvarez, David', 'Dervan, Peter B', 'Gottesfeld, Joel M']","['Chou CJ', 'Farkas ME', 'Tsai SM', 'Alvarez D', 'Dervan PB', 'Gottesfeld JM']","['Department of Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nylons)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Histones/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nylons/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/4/769 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0130 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Apr;7(4):769-78. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0130.,,,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0130 [doi],PMC2376757,,,,,"['R01 CA107311/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA107311/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107311-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107311-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107311-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107311-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS47642'],,,,,,,,

High-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization was done on malignant T cells from 20 patients. Expression levels of selected biologically relevant genes residing within loci with frequent copy number alteration were measured using quantitative PCR. Combined binary ratio labeling-fluorescence in situ hybridization karyotyping was done on malignant cells from five patients. Minimal common regions with copy number alteration occurring in at least 35% of patients harbored 15 bona fide oncogenes and 3 tumor suppressor genes. Based on the function of the identified oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, at least three molecular mechanisms are relevant in the pathogenesis of Sz. First, gain of cMYC and loss of cMYC antagonists (MXI1 and MNT) were observed in 75% and 40% to 55% of patients, respectively, which were frequently associated with deregulated gene expression. The presence of cMYC/MAX protein heterodimers in Sezary cells was confirmed using a proximity ligation assay. Second, a region containing TP53 and genome maintenance genes (RPA1/HIC1) was lost in the majority of patients. Third, the interleukin 2 (IL-2) pathway was affected by gain of STAT3/STAT5 and IL-2 (receptor) genes in 75% and 30%, respectively, and loss of TCF8 and DUSP5 in at least 45% of patients. In sum, the Sz genome is characterized by gross chromosomal instability with highly recurrent gains and losses. Prominent among deregulated genes are those encoding cMYC, cMYC-regulating proteins, mediators of MYC-induced apoptosis, and IL-2 signaling pathway components.","['Vermeer, Maarten H', 'van Doorn, Remco', 'Dijkman, Remco', 'Mao, Xin', 'Whittaker, Sean', 'van Voorst Vader, Pieter C', 'Gerritsen, Marie-Jeanne P', 'Geerts, Marie-Louise', 'Gellrich, Sylke', 'Soderberg, Ola', 'Leuchowius, Karl-Johan', 'Landegren, Ulf', 'Out-Luiting, Jacoba J', 'Knijnenburg, Jeroen', 'Ijszenga, Marije', 'Szuhai, Karoly', 'Willemze, Rein', 'Tensen, Cornelis P']","['Vermeer MH', 'van Doorn R', 'Dijkman R', 'Mao X', 'Whittaker S', 'van Voorst Vader PC', 'Gerritsen MJ', 'Geerts ML', 'Gellrich S', 'Soderberg O', 'Leuchowius KJ', 'Landegren U', 'Out-Luiting JJ', 'Knijnenburg J', 'Ijszenga M', 'Szuhai K', 'Willemze R', 'Tensen CP']","['Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aged', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sezary Syndrome/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/pathology']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/8/2689 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6398 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Apr 15;68(8):2689-98. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6398.,,,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6398 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mismatch repair (MMR) is responsible for detecting misincorporated nucleotides, resulting in excision repair before point mutations occur and/or induction of apoptosis to avoid propagation of cells carrying excessive DNA lesions. To assess MMR activity in CML, we used an in vivo assay using the plasmid substrate containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene corrupted by T:G mismatch in the start codon; therefore, MMR restores EGFP expression. The efficacy of MMR was reduced approximately 2-fold in BCR/ABL-positive cell lines and CD34(+) CML cells compared with normal counterparts. MMR was also challenged by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which generates O(6)-methylguanine and O(4)-methylthymine recognized by MMR system. Impaired MMR activity in leukemia cells was associated with better survival, accumulation of p53 but not of p73, and lack of activation of caspase 3 after MNNG treatment. In contrast, parental cells displayed accumulation of p53, p73, and activation of caspase 3, resulting in cell death. Ouabain-resistance test detecting mutations in the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase was used to investigate the effect of BCR/ABL kinase-mediated inhibition of MMR on mutagenesis. BCR/ABL-positive cells surviving the treatment with MNNG displayed approximately 15-fold higher mutation frequency than parental counterparts and predominantly G:C-->A:T and A:T-->G:C mutator phenotype typical for MNNG-induced unrepaired lesions. In conclusion, these results suggest that BCR/ABL kinase abrogates MMR activity to inhibit apoptosis and induce mutator phenotype.","['Stoklosa, Tomasz', 'Poplawski, Tomasz', 'Koptyra, Mateusz', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Basak, Grzegorz', 'Slupianek, Artur', 'Rayevskaya, Marina', 'Seferynska, Ilona', 'Herrera, Larry', 'Blasiak, Janusz', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Stoklosa T', 'Poplawski T', 'Koptyra M', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Basak G', 'Slupianek A', 'Rayevskaya M', 'Seferynska I', 'Herrera L', 'Blasiak J', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', '*Base Pair Mismatch', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*DNA Repair', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', '*Point Mutation', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/8/2576 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6858 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Apr 15;68(8):2576-80. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6858.,,,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6858 [doi],,,,,,['1R01CA89052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Here we cloned two een genes (designated as eena and eenb) in zebrafish, which are assigned to linkage groups 8 and 2, respectively. Whole-mount in situ hybridization assay showed that eena and eenb have overlapping but distinct expression patterns during embryogenesis. Ubiquitous or targeted overexpression of eena, but not eenb, into wild-type or transgenic embryos (green fluorescent protein-labeled myeloid progenitors) induced a significant proliferation and ectopic distribution of myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. Using a morpholino antisense gene knockdown approach, we showed that the number of myeloid progenitors and their downstream mature myelomonocytic cells was significantly decreased in the eena- deficient embryos. Mechanistically, overexpression of eena selectively stimulated ERK phosphorylation and increased the level of transcription factor c-Fos in vitro and in vivo, whereas eena lacking the Src homology 3 domain completely abolished these effects. Furthermore, a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, blocked the eena-induced cell proliferation and activation of ERK signaling.

DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 967 cats from 134 veterinary practices in 30 states. PROCEDURES: Cats with bite wounds or abscesses were evaluated by use of a point-of-care immunoassay for blood-borne FeLV antigen and FIV antibody. Veterinarians were asked to retest cats approximately 60 days later to determine whether seronegative cats had seroconverted after injury. RESULTS: The combined FeLV-FIV status of only 96 (9.9%) cats was known prior to wound treatment. At the time of treatment, 187 (19.3%) cats were seropositive for 1 or both viruses. Age (adult), sex (male), history of cutaneous wounds, and outdoor access were significantly associated with seropositivity. At 73 of 134 (54.5%) veterinary practices, retesting of cats for retrovirus infection status was recommended to owners of 478 cats. Only 64 (13.4%) cats were retested; of these, 3 of 58 (5.2%) cats that were initially seronegative for FIV antibody seroconverted. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A high proportion of cats with abscesses or bite wounds were seropositive for FeLV antigen or FIV antibody. Compliance with recommendations to test cats for retrovirus infection status at acquisition or after treatment for injury was low. The FeLV-FIV infection status of cats with potential fight wounds should be determined at time of treatment and again 60 days later.","['Goldkamp, Carrie E', 'Levy, Julie K', 'Edinboro, Charlotte H', 'Lachtara, Jessica L']","['Goldkamp CE', 'Levy JK', 'Edinboro CH', 'Lachtara JL']","['Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Abscess/veterinary/virology', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cat Diseases/diagnosis/*virology', 'Cats', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Odds Ratio', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Serologic Tests/*veterinary', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'Veterinary Medicine/*standards', 'Wounds and Injuries/veterinary/virology']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/05/20 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/javma.232.8.1152 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2008 Apr 15;232(8):1152-8. doi: 10.2460/javma.232.8.1152.,,,10.2460/javma.232.8.1152 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both thiols degrade all four complexes, mainly by displacing the ancillary ligand and forming a doubly bridged dinuclear complex. The degradation half-life of all the complexes with methionine is >7 days, indicating that these reactions are not biologically relevant. The rate of degradation by glutathione appears to be particularly important and shows an inverse correlation to cytotoxicity. The least active complex, 4 (t 1/2 glutathione: 20 h), degrades fastest, followed by 3 (31 h), 2 (40 h), and 1 (68 h).

Data about recurrent cancer after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in patients with a history of nonhepatic malignancy are very limited. We retrospectively analyzed data from 606 adult OLT recipients and identified 37 patients (6.1%) with a preexisting extrahepatic malignancy. In the same group, 43 patients (7.0%) developed de novo cancer. Preexisting malignancies included 26 solid tumors and 11 hematological malignancies, including 7 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome due to myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs). Patients had been selected for OLT because of the expected good prognosis of their preexisting malignancy. Except for 3 patients, recipients were tumor-free at OLT. The median interval from tumor diagnosis to OLT was 44 months (range, <1-321). After a median follow-up of 66 months post transplantation (range, 4-131), all but 1 recipient with incidental colon carcinoma were free of recurrence. No patient with MPD showed leukemic transformation, whereas a patient with neurofibromatosis experienced growth of skin fibromas. Our data and an included review of published OLT recipients with preexisting malignancies have enabled us to show that recurrence rates are comparable for nontransplanted patients and renal-transplant recipients. In conclusion, cancer recurrence is low if OLT recipients are carefully selected. Therefore, previous extrahepatic malignancy should not be considered a contraindication for OLT per se, but the oncologic/hematologic prognosis should be considered, particularly with respect to the current 5-year survival rate of OLT.","['Benten, Daniel', 'Sterneck, Martina', 'Panse, Jens', 'Rogiers, Xavier', 'Lohse, Ansgar W']","['Benten D', 'Sterneck M', 'Panse J', 'Rogiers X', 'Lohse AW']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. dbenten@uke.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Liver Transpl,Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,100909185,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Colonic Neoplasms/diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/etiology', 'Liver Transplantation/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/lt.21434 [doi]'],ppublish,Liver Transpl. 2008 Jun;14(6):789-98. doi: 10.1002/lt.21434.,,,10.1002/lt.21434 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Birth weight is the most frequently studied perinatal factor in relation to risk of childhood cancers, and results have been inconsistent. We investigated whether the risk of CNS tumors and lymphomas in children was associated with three measures of the appropriateness of intra-uterine growth: proportion of optimal birth weight (POBW), birth length (POBL) and weight for length (POWFL). A cohort of 576,633 infants born in Western Australia in 1980-2004 were followed from birth to diagnosis of a CNS tumor (n = 183) or lymphoma (n = 84) before age 15, death, or December 31, 2005, and analyzed with Cox regression. Overall, there was little evidence of any association between fetal growth and risk of CNS tumors, although risk of ependymoma/choroid plexus tumors was positively associated with POBL and negatively associated with POWFL. The risk of Hodgkin and Burkitt lymphoma increased with increasing fetal growth among boys only, whereas the increased risk observed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma was only in girls. These associations between fetal growth and disease risk were also observed among children not classified as high birth weight, suggesting that accelerated growth is more important than birth weight per se. Results were similar when cases were compared with their unaffected siblings, suggesting that the increased growth associated with cancer risk was not general to the family. The associations we observed are consistent with causal pathways involving fetal growth factors.","['Milne, Elizabeth', 'Laurvick, Crystal L', 'Blair, Eve', 'de Klerk, Nicholas', 'Charles, Adrian K', 'Bower, Carol']","['Milne E', 'Laurvick CL', 'Blair E', 'de Klerk N', 'Charles AK', 'Bower C']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research,The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia.', 'Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research,The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia.', 'Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research,The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia.', 'Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research,The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia.', 'Princess Margaret Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women, Subiaco, Perth, Western Australia.', 'Schools of Paediatrics and Child Health, and Women and Infants Health, University of Western Australia.', 'Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research,The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Birth Weight', 'Body Size', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Fetal Development', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Western Australia/epidemiology']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/06/14 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23486 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Jul 15;123(2):436-443. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23486.,,,10.1002/ijc.23486 [doi],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Its cellular receptors are still under debate; the main candidates are FcR for immunoglobulin G, as CRP was shown to bind specifically to FcgammaRI and FcgammaRIIa. Using ultrasensitive confocal live-cell imaging, we have studied CRP binding to FcgammaR naturally expressed in the plasma membranes of cells from a human leukemia cell line (Mono Mac 6). These macrophage-like cells express high levels of FcgammaRI and FcgammaRII. They were shown to bind fluorescently labeled CRP with micromolar affinity, KD = (6.6 +/- 1.5) microM. CRP binding could be inhibited by pre-incubation with human but not mouse IgG and was thus FcgammaR-specific. Blocking of FcgammaRI by an FcgammaRI-specific antibody abolished CRP binding essentially completely, whereas application of antibodies against FcgammaRII did not have a noticeable effect. In fluorescence images of Mono Mac 6 cells, the intensity patterns of bound CRP were correlated with those of FcgammaRI, but not FcgammaRII. These results provide clear evidence of specific interactions between CRP and FcgammaR (predominantly FcgammaRI) naturally expressed on macrophage-like cells.","['Tron, Kyrylo', 'Manolov, Dimitar E', 'Rocker, Carlheinz', 'Kachele, Martin', 'Torzewski, Jan', 'Nienhaus, G Ulrich']","['Tron K', 'Manolov DE', 'Rocker C', 'Kachele M', 'Torzewski J', 'Nienhaus GU']","['Institute of Biophysics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (FCGR1A protein, human)', '0 (Fc gamma receptor IIA)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive/drug effects', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Macrophages/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2008/04/17 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/04/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200738002 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2008 May;38(5):1414-22. doi: 10.1002/eji.200738002.,,,10.1002/eji.200738002 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until now there is no structural and dynamic information about these interactions. Here we report the NMR structures of the LARG PDZ in the apo form and in complex with the plexin-B1 C-terminal octapeptide. Unobservable resonances of the residues in betaB/betaC and betaE/alphaB loops in apo state were observed in the complex state. A distinct region of the binding groove in the LARG PDZ was found to undergo conformational change compared with other PDZs. Analysis of the (15)N relaxation data using reduced spectral density mapping shows that the apo LARG PDZ (especially its ligand-binding groove) is flexible and exhibits internal motions on both picosecond to nanosecond and microsecond to millisecond timescales. Mutagenesis and thermodynamic studies indicate that the conformation of the betaB/betaC and betaE/alphaB loops affects the PDZ-peptide interaction.

These so-called juxtamembrane expansion (JME) alleles consist of internal duplication insertions in the vicinity of exon 28 of the NOTCH1 gene encoding the extracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor. Notably, structure-function analysis of leukemia-derived and synthetic JME mutants demonstrated that the aberrant activation of NOTCH1 signaling is dependent on the number of residues introduced in the extracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor and not on the specific amino acid sequence of these insertions. JME NOTCH1 mutants are effectively blocked by gamma-secretase inhibitors and require an intact metalloprotease cleavage site for activation.

We set out to examine the expression in human preimplantation embryos of a number of genes known to be critical for early development of the murine embryo. The expression profile of these genes was analysed throughout preimplantation development and in response to growth factor (GF) stimulation. Developmental expression of a number of genes was similar to that seen in murine embryos (OCT3B/4, CDX2, NANOG). However, GATA6 is expressed throughout preimplantation development in the human. Embryos were cultured in IGF-I, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF), all of which are known to stimulate the development of human embryos. Our data show that culture in HBEGF and LIF appears to facilitate human embryo expression of a number of genes: ERBB4 (LIF) and LIFR and DSC2 (HBEGF) while in the presence of HBEGF no blastocysts expressed EOMES and when cultured with LIF only two out of nine blastocysts expressed TBN. These data improve our knowledge of the similarities between human and murine embryos and the influence of GFs on human embryo gene expression. Results from this study will improve the understanding of cell fate decisions in early human embryos, which has important implications for both IVF treatment and the derivation of human embryonic stem cells.","['Kimber, S J', 'Sneddon, S F', 'Bloor, D J', 'El-Bareg, A M', 'Hawkhead, J A', 'Metcalfe, A D', 'Houghton, F D', 'Leese, H J', 'Rutherford, A', 'Lieberman, B A', 'Brison, D R']","['Kimber SJ', 'Sneddon SF', 'Bloor DJ', 'El-Bareg AM', 'Hawkhead JA', 'Metcalfe AD', 'Houghton FD', 'Leese HJ', 'Rutherford A', 'Lieberman BA', 'Brison DR']","['Faculty of Life Sciences Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK. susan.kimber@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (HBEGF protein, human)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Blastocyst/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cleavage Stage, Ovum/metabolism', 'Embryonic Development/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Morula/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Pregnancy', 'Zygote/metabolism']",2008/04/16 09:00,2008/06/12 09:00,['2008/04/16 09:00'],"['2008/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['135/5/635 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-07-0359 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2008 May;135(5):635-47. doi: 10.1530/REP-07-0359.,,,10.1530/REP-07-0359 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although only a weak agonist of established G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for cys-LTs, LTE(4) potentiates airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) by a cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent mechanism and induces bronchial eosinophilia. We now report that LTE(4) activates human mast cells (MCs) by a pathway involving cooperation between an MK571-sensitive GPCR and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, a nuclear receptor for dietary lipids. Although LTD(4) is more potent than LTE(4) for inducing calcium flux by the human MC sarcoma line LAD2, LTE(4) is more potent for inducing proliferation and chemokine generation, and is at least as potent for upregulating COX-2 expression and causing prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) generation. LTE(4) caused phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p90RSK, and cyclic AMP-regulated-binding protein (CREB). ERK activation in response to LTE(4), but not to LTD(4), was resistant to inhibitors of phosphoinositol 3-kinase. LTE(4)-mediated COX-2 induction, PGD(2) generation, and ERK phosphorylation were all sensitive to interference by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 and to targeted knockdown of PPARgamma. Although LTE(4)-mediated PGD(2) production was also sensitive to MK571, an antagonist for the type 1 receptor for cys-LTs (CysLT(1)R), it was resistant to knockdown of this receptor. This LTE(4)-selective receptor-mediated pathway may explain the unique physiologic responses of human airways to LTE(4) in vivo.","['Paruchuri, Sailaja', 'Jiang, Yongfeng', 'Feng, Chunli', 'Francis, Sanjeev A', 'Plutzky, Jorge', 'Boyce, Joshua A']","['Paruchuri S', 'Jiang Y', 'Feng C', 'Francis SA', 'Plutzky J', 'Boyce JA']","[""Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080414,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '73836-78-9 (Leukotriene D4)', '75715-89-8 (Leukotriene E4)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukotriene D4/metabolism', 'Leukotriene E4/*metabolism', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'PPAR gamma/*metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/*metabolism']",2008/04/16 09:00,2008/07/25 09:00,['2008/04/16 09:00'],"['2008/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)71452-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M705822200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Jun 13;283(24):16477-87. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M705822200.

Here, we describe improved methods for characterizing integration site populations from gene transfer studies using DNA bar coding and pyrosequencing. We characterized 160,232 integration site sequences in 28 tissue samples from eight mice, where Rag1 or Artemis deficiencies were corrected by introducing the missing gene with gamma-retroviral or lentiviral vectors. The integration sites were characterized for their genomic distributions, including proximity to proto-oncogenes. Several mice harbored abnormal lymphoproliferations following therapy--in these cases, comparison of the location and frequency of isolation of integration sites across multiple tissues helped clarify the contribution of specific proviruses to the adverse events. We also took advantage of the large number of pyrosequencing reads to show that recovery of integration sites can be highly biased by the use of restriction enzyme cleavage of genomic DNA, which is a limitation in all widely used methods, but describe improved approaches that take advantage of the power of pyrosequencing to overcome this problem.

To determine the clinicopathological significance of gene promoter methylation in monoclonal gammopathies, we analysed the methylation status of 6 tumour suppressor genes and their association with loss of gene function. Methylation status of the genes p14, p15, p16, hMLH1, MGMT, and DAPK was determined by methylation-specific PCR in 52 cases: 30 MM, 13 MGUS, and 9 plasmacytomas, comparing them with their protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and association between methylation status, protein expression, and clinical characteristics was assessed. The methylation frequencies were 50% for p16, 17% for p15, 10% for hMLH1, 23% for MGMT and 30% for DAPK in MM samples, and 38%, 15%, 8%, and 15% for p16, p15, MGMT and DAPK respectively in MGUS samples. In plasmacytomas samples we found methylation of p16 in 55%, p15 in 22%, MGMT in 67% and DAPK in 44%. hMLH1 was unmethylated in all cases of MGUS and plasmacytomas. Immunohistochemistry showed that gene methylation was closely associated with a loss of protein expression. Our study demonstrates that methylation-mediated silencing is a frequent event in monoclonal gammopathies: 83% of MM, 46% of MGUS and 77% of plasmacytomas have at least one gene methylated, affecting different molecular pathways involved in cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis. This high prevalence of aberrant promoter hypermethylation suggests that monoclonal gammopathies carry a CpG island methylator phenotype, therefore the development of new DNA demethylation agents may be a potential therapeutic use in this disease.","['Martin, Paloma', 'Garcia-Cosio, Monica', 'Santon, Almudena', 'Bellas, Carmen']","['Martin P', 'Garcia-Cosio M', 'Santon A', 'Bellas C']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism', 'Paraproteinemias/*metabolism', 'Plasma Cells/*metabolism', 'Plasmacytoma/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/04/16 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/04/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4800(08)00014-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2008.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2008 Jun;84(3):256-61. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2008.02.003.

One approach to reducing alloreactivity is to deplete the graft of alloreactive T cells. Global T cell depletion results in poor immune reconstitution with high mortality from viral infections and disease relapse. Therefore, an approach to selectively deplete alloreactive T cells without compromising other responses would be highly beneficial. We undertook studies to identify an inducible activation marker expressed on alloreactive effector T cells following culture with HLA-mismatched allostimulators. Compared to other markers, CD134 was superior because of its negative baseline expression and rapid upregulation after activation. Depletion of CD134(+) cells from responder populations dramatically reduced specific alloreactivity as determined by reduction of helper T cell precursor frequencies below the threshold predicting development of clinical GVHD while retaining responses to third-party alloantigens. CD134-allodepleted populations retained effectors specific for the Wilms' tumor (WT1) leukemia antigen as determined by WT1 specific pentamers, and CMV-specific effectors as determined by CMV-specific pentamers and CMV-specific ELISpot. Thus, use of CD134-allodepleted grafts may improve allogeneic SCT by reducing GVHD without loss of pathogen-specific and leukemia-specific immunity.","['Ge, Xupeng', 'Brown, Julia', 'Sykes, Megan', 'Boussiotis, Vassiliki A']","['Ge X', 'Brown J', 'Sykes M', 'Boussiotis VA']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Blood Cells', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Models, Biological', '*Receptors, OX40', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/immunology']",2008/04/16 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/04/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(08)00085-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.02.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 May;14(5):518-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.02.010.,,,10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.02.010 [doi],PMC2423190,,,,,"['R01 CA104596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI043552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA104596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI043552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI043552-06/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 43552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI043552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104596-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS47693'],,,,,,,,

The aim of the present work was to assess the HRQOL in terms of physical, emotional and social functioning, to identify some predictors of QOL and to describe the scholastic achievement and nutritional status among school children with cancer in Alexandria. A cross-sectional study of 215 students with cancer who attended the oncology school health insurance clinic of Sporting Student's Hospital in Alexandria governorate within a period of one month (June 2005) was conducted. Every child was subjected to the Pediatric Oncology Quality Of Life scale to assess the quality of life with cancer. Anthropometric measurements including weight and height were measured for each child and BMI was calculated. Review of records of each child was done to take the last heamoglobin level. Lymphoma was the most common tumour (34.9%), followed by leukemia (24.2%), brain tumour (13.0%), osteosarcoma (7.9%), and Wilm's tumour (7%). About one third of the sample (36.7%) reported poor QOL which was more evident in the physical domain (54.4%), as compared to 34.4% in emotional domain and 26% in the social domain. Sex (p<0.05), age (p<0.05), complications (p<0.01), place of treatment (p<0.05), place of diagnosis (p<0.05) and treatment (p<0.05) were all significantly associated with QOL. However after adjustment for other variables, poor QOL was more likely among students of younger age, students with complications, and students whose diagnosis was done at the student hospital. About two thirds of the sample (68.5 %) reported poor scholastic achievement, 25.1% were underweight and 87.4% were anemic. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: HRQOL measurement should be done as a routine for all children with cancer in order to identify specific therapies that require modifications in management. More efforts are needed to improve the health care in the student's hospital, especially for young children with cancer.","['Mounir, Gehan M', 'Abolfotouh, Mostafa A']","['Mounir GM', 'Abolfotouh MA']","['Family Health Department, School Health, High Institute of Public Health, Alexandria University, Egypt. gehanmounir@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Egypt Public Health Assoc,The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,7505602,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/psychology', '*Quality of Life']",2008/04/16 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2008/04/16 09:00'],"['2008/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Public Health Assoc. 2007;82(3-4):219-38.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finding relationships between response variables of interest and variables in such data sets is an important problem akin to finding needles in a haystack. Whilst methods for a number of response types have been developed a general approach has been lacking. RESULTS: The major contribution of this paper is to present a unified methodology which allows many common (statistical) response models to be fitted to such data sets. The class of models includes virtually any model with a linear predictor in it, for example (but not limited to), multiclass logistic regression (classification), generalised linear models (regression) and survival models. A fast algorithm for finding sparse well fitting models is presented. The ideas are illustrated on real data sets with numbers of variables ranging from thousands to millions. R code implementing the ideas is available for download. CONCLUSION: The method described in this paper enables existing work on response models when there are less variables than observations to be leveraged to the situation when there are many more variables than observations. It is a powerful approach to finding parsimonious models for such datasets. The method is capable of handling problems with millions of variables and a large variety of response types within the one framework. The method compares favourably to existing methods such as support vector machines and random forests, but has the advantage of not requiring separate variable selection steps. It is also works for data types which these methods were not designed to handle. The method usually produces very sparse models which make biological interpretation simpler and more focused.","['Kiiveri, Harri T']",['Kiiveri HT'],"['CSIRO Mathematical and Information Sciences, The Leeuwin Center, 65 Brockway Road, Floreat, 6014, Western Australia. harri.kiiveri@csiro.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080415,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Reference Values', '*Research Design', 'Smoking/genetics', '*Software']",2008/04/16 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/04/16 09:00'],"['2007/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-9-195 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-9-195 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2008 Apr 15;9:195. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-9-195.,,,10.1186/1471-2105-9-195 [doi],PMC2390543,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ASO primer was successfully designed for all patients whose frozen diagnosis samples were available. Flow cytometry and ASO-PCR were concordant, i.e. both either positive or both negative, in 78% of the analyses. Flow cytometry did not detect MRD in any of the samples that were PCR-negative cases. In contrast, ASO-PCR detected MRD in samples that were negative for MRD by flow cytometry in 22% of the analyses. In one patient, the immunophenotype but not the IgV(H) gene sequence had changed during a course of the disease, and MRD could not be followed by flow cytometry. In the remaining cases, the discrepancy was due to a higher sensitivity of ASO-PCR. Autologous stem cell transplantation resulted in clinical complete response in 87% (20/23) of the patients. By flow cytometry, 35% (8/23) of autotransplanted patients became MRD-negative, but only 12.5% (2/16) PCR-negative (sensitivity of ASO-PCR <0.001 and <0.01, respectively).

To analyse the role of deregulated PcG genes in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we determined by RQ-PCR the expression of the PcG genes BMI-1, MEL18, SCML2, YY1 and EZH2, and the downstream PcG targets HOXA4, HOXA9 and MEIS1 in diagnostic bone marrow samples from 126 AML patients. There was a general overexpression of the genes in AML patients compared to 20 healthy donors, except of HOXA4 and MEL18, which both displayed a wide range of expression levels within the AML subgroups. Among the AML patients with normal karyotype, a low HOXA4 level was associated with a shorter overall survival (P = 0.005). In addition, expression levels of MEL18 and EZH2 were significantly (P < 0.025) higher in patients with complex karyotype and lower in CBF-mutated patients. The t(8;21) vs. inv(16) positive patients showed significantly different expression of SCML2, BMI-1, YY1, HOXA9 and MEIS1 (P < or = 0.01). Comparisons between the PcG and PcG-regulated genes and a number of clinical and molecular data revealed correlations to genes involved in DNA methylation (DNMT1, DNMT3B), apoptosis (BAX, CASPASE 3) and multidrug-resistance (MDR1, MRP ) (P < 0.01). In conclusion, our data suggest that the role of PcG and PcG-regulated genes in leukaemogenesis varies between, as well as within karyotypic subgroups.","['Grubach, Lykke', 'Juhl-Christensen, Caroline', 'Rethmeier, Anita', 'Olesen, Lene Hyldahl', 'Aggerholm, Anni', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Ostergaard, Mette']","['Grubach L', 'Juhl-Christensen C', 'Rethmeier A', 'Olesen LH', 'Aggerholm A', 'Hokland P', 'Ostergaard M']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080628,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '127609-92-1 (HOXA4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors']",2008/04/16 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/04/16 09:00'],"['2008/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1083 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01083.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Aug;81(2):112-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01083.x.

Results of a phase III trial in untreated AML in the elderly with tipifarnib were also disappointing. Clinical responses were not related to RAS mutations, suggesting additional actions of FTIs on other molecular targets.

Previously, we described LRH-1 as a haematopoietic-lineage restricted MiHA that is capable of eliciting an allogeneic cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response after SCT and donor lymphocyte infusion. Importantly, the gene encoding LRH-1, P2X5, is not expressed in prominent graft-versus-host-disease target tissues such as skin, liver and gut. Here, we investigate whether LRH-1-specific immunotherapy may be exploited for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. We examined P2X5 mRNA expression in a large panel of patient samples and cell lines from different types of lymphoid malignancies by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. P2X5 mRNA was highly expressed in malignant cells from all stages of lymphoid development. Furthermore, all LRH-1-positive lymphoid tumour cell lines were susceptible to LRH-1 CTL-mediated lysis in flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays. However, interferon-gamma production was low or absent after stimulation with some cell lines, possibly due to differences in activation thresholds for CTL effector functions. Importantly, primary cells from patients with lymphoid malignancies were effectively lysed by LRH-1-specific CTL.

WT1 level was determined at diagnosis, during therapy and post-therapy follow-up in 89 patients who reached first complete remission (CR1) (952 samples, median 8 samples/patient, range 2-38). CR1 bone marrow (BM) WT1 level above normal (based on 39 healthy donors) was an independent adverse prognostic factor regarding both disease-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) 4.46, P = 0.001] and overall survival (HR 2.62, P = 0.019). By grouping 34 BM and 99 peripheral blood (PB) complete remission samples in monthly intervals prior to clinical relapse, disease development was delineated and a simple mathematical model constructed, that allowed for the prediction of relapse detection rates (RDRs) as well as median times [t(m)s] from WT1 positivity to clinical relapse. BM sampling was required to obtain RDRs above 93% and t(m)s above 67 d. Acceptable RDRs and t(m)s (81% and 44 d, respectively) could be acquired by bimonthly PB sampling. In conclusion, CR1 WT1 expression is an independent prognostic factor in AML. According to our model, BM is superior for relapse prediction, but PB samples are useful when shorter sampling intervals are possible.","['Ommen, Hans Beier', 'Nyvold, Charlotte Guldborg', 'Braendstrup, Karin', 'Andersen, Bodil Lind', 'Ommen, Ingrid Beier', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Ostergaard, Mette']","['Ommen HB', 'Nyvold CG', 'Braendstrup K', 'Andersen BL', 'Ommen IB', 'Hasle H', 'Hokland P', 'Ostergaard M']","['The Laboratory of Immunohematology, Department of Haematology, Arhus University Hospital, Arhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080410,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism']",2008/04/16 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/04/16 09:00'],"['2008/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7132 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07132.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jun;141(6):782-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07132.x.

A priori, the more times a genome is copied, the greater the average number of replication errors. This principle could be used to 'count' mitotic divisions. Although somatic mutations are rare, cytosine methylation is also copied after DNA replication, but measurably increases with aging at certain CpG rich sequences in mitotic tissues, such as the colon. To further test whether such age-related methylation represents replication errors, these CpG rich 'clock' sequences were measured in leucocytes. Leucocytes within an individual have identical chronological ages (time since birth) but their mitotic ages (numbers of divisions since the zygote) may differ. Neutrophils, B-lymphocytes, and red cell progenitors are produced from relatively quiescent stem cells throughout life, but T-lymphocyte production largely ceases after puberty when the thymus disappears. However, T-lymphocyte genomes may continue to replicate throughout life in response to immunological stimulation. Consistent with this biology, clock methylation significantly increased with aging for T-lymphocyte genomes, but no significant increase was measured in other cell populations. Moreover, this methylation was greater in genomes isolated from their corresponding neoplastic populations. These studies tentatively support the hypothesis that methylation at certain CpG rich sequences in leucocytes could record their mitotic ages.","['Chu, Michelle', 'Siegmund, Kimberly D', 'Hao, Qian-Lin', 'Crooks, Gay M', 'Tavare, Simon', 'Shibata, Darryl']","['Chu M', 'Siegmund KD', 'Hao QL', 'Crooks GM', 'Tavare S', 'Shibata D']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080410,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/genetics/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Replication/*genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/physiology']",2008/04/16 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/04/16 09:00'],"['2008/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7142 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07142.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jun;141(6):862-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07142.x.

Maximal rates were seen in children born in February and August in the simple harmonic regression model for all children diagnosed with ALL. Analysis by gender found evidence of seasonality related to month of birth with peaks in February and August in boys, but different seasonal effects were seen for girls (peak in November, nadir in May).

RARalpha heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRalpha) and transcriptionally regulates myeloid differentiation in response to ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid). Several lines of evidence suggest that APL fusion proteins interact with RXRalpha. To elucidate the role of RXRalpha in APL, we conditionally knocked out RXRalpha in the hCG-NuMA-RARalpha APL mouse model. Phenotype analysis of NuMA-RARalpha+ mice demonstrated that these mice developed a myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid leukemia within 4 months of birth. While hemizygous and homozygous RXRalpha conditional knockout mice were phenotypically normal as late as 12 months of age, we observed that the leukemic phenotype in NuMA-RARalpha+ mice was dependent on the presence of functional RXRalpha. Bone marrow promyelocyte counts were significantly reduced in NuMA-RARalpha+ mice with RXRalpha knocked down. Significant differences in the accumulations of Gr-1+ and Mac-1+ cells were also seen. We further observed that genes previously identified to be cooperating events in APL were also regulated in an RXRalpha-dependent manner. We therefore propose that the APL fusion protein NuMA-RARalpha cooperates with RXRalpha in the development of leukemia in hCG-NuMA-RARalpha transgenic mice and suggest a novel role for RXRalpha in the pathogenesis of APL.","['Sukhai, M A', 'Thomas, M', 'Xuan, Y', 'Chan, L S A', 'Hamadanizadeh, S A', 'Zhang, T', 'Bharadwaj, R R', 'Schuh, A C', 'Wells, R A', 'Kamel-Reid, S']","['Sukhai MA', 'Thomas M', 'Xuan Y', 'Chan LS', 'Hamadanizadeh SA', 'Zhang T', 'Bharadwaj RR', 'Schuh AC', 'Wells RA', 'Kamel-Reid S']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080414,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (NuMa-RARalpha protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2008/04/15 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/04/15 09:00'],"['2008/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008106 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.106 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Aug 7;27(34):4666-77. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.106.

This disease can be treated effectively with arsenic, which induces PML modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) and proteasomal degradation. Here we demonstrate that the RING-domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, RNF4 (also known as SNURF), targets poly-SUMO-modified proteins for degradation mediated by ubiquitin. RNF4 depletion or proteasome inhibition led to accumulation of mixed, polyubiquitinated, poly-SUMO chains. PML protein accumulated in RNF4-depleted cells and was ubiquitinated by RNF4 in a SUMO-dependent fashion in vitro. In the absence of RNF4, arsenic failed to induce degradation of PML and SUMO-modified PML accumulated in the nucleus. These results demonstrate that poly-SUMO chains can act as discrete signals from mono-SUMOylation, in this case targeting a poly-SUMOylated substrate for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.","['Tatham, Michael H', 'Geoffroy, Marie-Claude', 'Shen, Linnan', 'Plechanovova, Anna', 'Hattersley, Neil', 'Jaffray, Ellis G', 'Palvimo, Jorma J', 'Hay, Ronald T']","['Tatham MH', 'Geoffroy MC', 'Shen L', 'Plechanovova A', 'Hattersley N', 'Jaffray EG', 'Palvimo JJ', 'Hay RT']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dow Street, Dundee DD1 5EH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080413,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arsenic/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/04/15 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/04/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncb1716 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb1716 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2008 May;10(5):538-46. doi: 10.1038/ncb1716.

SUMOylation of its PML moiety was previously implicated, but the nature of the degradation pathway involved and the role of PML-RARalpha catabolism in the response to therapy have both remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that arsenic-induced PML SUMOylation triggers its Lys 48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. When exposed to arsenic, SUMOylated PML recruits RNF4, the human orthologue of the yeast SUMO-dependent E3 ubiquitin-ligase, as well as ubiquitin and proteasomes onto PML nuclear bodies. Arsenic-induced differentiation is impaired in cells transformed by a non-degradable PML-RARalpha SUMOylation mutant or in APL cells transduced with a dominant-negative RNF4, directly implicating PML-RARalpha catabolism in the therapeutic response. We thus identify PML as the first protein degraded by SUMO-dependent polyubiquitination. As PML SUMOylation recruits not only RNF4, ubiquitin and proteasomes, but also many SUMOylated proteins onto PML nuclear bodies, these domains could physically integrate the SUMOylation, ubiquitination and degradation pathways.","['Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valerie', 'Jeanne, Marion', 'Benhenda, Shirine', 'Nasr, Rihab', 'Lei, Ming', 'Peres, Laurent', 'Zhou, Jun', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Raught, Brian', 'de The, Hugues']","['Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'Jeanne M', 'Benhenda S', 'Nasr R', 'Lei M', 'Peres L', 'Zhou J', 'Zhu J', 'Raught B', 'de The H']","['Universite de Paris 7/CNRS UMR 7151, Equipe Labellisee N11 Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Hopital St. Louis, 1, Av.

IKZF1 (encoding the transcription factor Ikaros) was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but not in chronic-phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency, expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination is responsible for the deletions.

With current treatment options, Merkel cell carcinoma is associated with a high incidence of recurrence and metastasis. Targeted anticancer therapies such as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides have been found to be a promising new type of treatment for various types of cancer. To evaluate whether the use of targeted therapies is a possible treatment option in Merkel cell carcinoma, we determined the expression of the target molecules c-kit, Mcl-1, Bmi-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-receptor 2 (VEGF-R2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-alpha, PDGF-beta, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Her-2/Neu in a tissue microarray of 32 samples of 29 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. C-kit-positive samples were analyzed for mutations in exons 9 and 11. The tissue microarray was stained immunohistochemically with antibodies directed against the above-mentioned proteins, and an immunoreactivity score was calculated. DNA was extracted from c-kit-positive samples and was analyzed for exon 9 and 11 mutations using direct DNA sequencing. We found that c-kit (7%), Mcl-1 (88%), Bmi-1 (78%), VEGF-A (91%), VEGF-C (75%) VEGF-R2 (88%), PDGF-alpha (72%) and PDGF-beta (13%) were expressed in Merkel cell carcinomas. All samples showed a lack of EGFR and Her-2/Neu expression. Analysis of c-kit revealed no mutations. As VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-R2, PDGFs and c-kit are targets of new cytostatic agents used in the treatment of other cancers, inhibition by a multitargeted chemotherapy could be a very promising treatment option. High expression of Bmi-1 and Mcl-1 warrants further studies on the use of antisense oligonucleotides in Merkel cell carcinoma.","['Brunner, Markus', 'Thurnher, Dietmar', 'Pammer, Johannes', 'Geleff, Silvana', 'Heiduschka, Gregor', 'Reinisch, Christina M', 'Petzelbauer, Peter', 'Erovic, Boban M']","['Brunner M', 'Thurnher D', 'Pammer J', 'Geleff S', 'Heiduschka G', 'Reinisch CM', 'Petzelbauer P', 'Erovic BM']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080411,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Austria/epidemiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/*metabolism/mortality/secondary', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2008/04/15 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/04/15 09:00'],"['2008/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['modpathol200863 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2008.63 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2008 Jul;21(7):876-84. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2008.63.

These proteins, working in concert, enhanced SUMO conjugation to lysine-744 of SATB1. Overexpression of SUMO or PIAS in Jurkat cells, which express high levels of endogenous SATB1, exhibited enhanced caspase cleavage of this MAR-associating protein. Sumoylation-deficient SATB1 (SATB1(K744R)) failed to display the characteristic caspase cleavage pattern; however, fusion of SUMO in-frame to SATB1(K744R) restored cleavage. A SUMO-independent interaction of inactive caspase-6 and SATB1 was noted.

The recent finding that it is formed naturally in foods by heating raises human health concerns. AA is a proven carcinogen in animals and a probable carcinogen in humans, while its mutagenicity detected using in vitro mammalian gene mutation assays is still inconsistent in different cell systems. In the present study, we investigated the mutagenicity of AA in human promyelocytic leukaemia cells, HL-60 and NB4 cells, by examining the mutations at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene locus. In a 6-h treatment without the exogenous activation, AA exerted a weak mutagenic effect at the highest concentration used in the study (700 mg/l) in HL-60 cells (P < 0.01) as well as in NB4 cells (P < 0.05). Molecular analysis of AA-induced mutants revealed a different mutation spectrum, when compared to that of spontaneous mutants. The most frequent spontaneous mutations were point mutations, whereas AA-induced mutations were mainly single exon deletions besides point mutations, and an increase in the proportion of partial deletion was associated with the increase of AA treatment. There was no obvious difference in the mutation spectra observed between the HL-60 and NB4 cell lines. These results showed that AA has a weak mutagenic effect at HPRT gene locus in human promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 and NB4 cell lines and those molecular mutation spectra (single exon deletions and point mutations) may be related to some specific and precise mechanism.","['Ao, Lin', 'Liu, Sheng-Xue', 'Yang, Meng-Su', 'Fong, Chi-Chun', 'An, Hui', 'Cao, Jia']","['Ao L', 'Liu SX', 'Yang MS', 'Fong CC', 'An H', 'Cao J']","[""Department of Hygienic Toxicology, Preventive Medical College, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080411,England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['20R035KLCI (Acrylamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acrylamide/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Exons', 'Gene Deletion', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutation/*drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/04/15 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/04/15 09:00'],"['2008/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['gen016 [pii]', '10.1093/mutage/gen016 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2008 Jul;23(4):309-15. doi: 10.1093/mutage/gen016.

It inhibits the reactive oxygen species formation in monocytes via histamine H2 receptors and protects natural killer and T cells from oxidative damage. Histamine has the potential to optimize cytokine-induced activation of T cells and natural killer cells; therefore, the addition of histamine to cytokine treatment may improve treatment efficacy. Clinical trials in solid tumors and in acute myeloid leukemia have demonstrated the potential to improve treatment outcome when histamine dihydrochloride is combined with immunotherapy. In patients with metastatic malignant melanoma, this strategy improved remission rates and increased survival. On the other hand, less promising results were reported for histamine dihydrochloride added to cytokines in patients with other solid tumors, especially in advanced renal cell carcinoma. A recent international Phase III trial performed in 320 patients showed that maintenance therapy with histamine dihydrochloride and IL-2 was able to improve leukemia-free survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, without an effect on overall survival. The combination of histamine dihydrochloride with IL-2 potentially offers an efficacious and tolerable maintenance strategy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia; however, its impact on survival remains to be explored.","['Perz, Jolanta B', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Perz JB', 'Ho AD']","['University Heidelberg, Department of Medicine V and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany.

However, cats with high enFeLV loads showed higher viral replication (plasma viral RNA and p27 antigen levels) than cats with low enFeLV loads in the early phase of the infection. The enFeLV transcription level varied at different time points, but no clear-cut pattern was observed.

These are mainly one-step or two-step mechanisms, associated or not with deletions adjacent to the translocation junction on der(9) or der(22) chromosomes (or both). Based on the mechanism of genesis, it has been suggested that the complexity may affect the occurrence of ABL1 and BCR deletions (either or both), or may be associated with the CML disease course, and thus could determine the response to imatinib therapy. Through a retrospective molecular cytogenetic study of 41 CML patients with variant Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), we explored the genesis of these variant rearrangements and analyzed the correlation with deletion status and imatinib efficiency. Our results confirmed that the one-step mechanism is the most frequent, evidenced in 30 of 41 patients (73%); 3 patients demonstrated other more complex multistep events and 8 patients (19.5%) harbored ABL1 or BCR deletions that are not significantly associated with the complexity of translocation genesis.

Systemic or locally produced 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) may play a role in modulating cell development processes such as hematopoiesis. The mechanisms by which 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) achieves this are discussed in this review. In particular, data from our laboratories suggest that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) does not provide a deterministic signal for monocyte differentiation. Rather, the hormone acts as a permissive agent for myeloid precursor cells to enter a genetically determined terminal maturation pathway. The effiacy of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in leukemia therapy has been improved by the development of novel vitamin D analogues that have potent antiproliferative activity and low hypercalcemic side effects. Another solution to the problem of side effects is to enhance specifically the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3).

It is expressed at high levels throughout myeloid differentiation and binds to the promoters of multiple myeloid-specific genes at different stages of myeloid maturation. Profound hematopoietic abnormalities occur in mice nullizygous for C/EBP alpha including a selective early block in the differentiation of granulocytes. Mutations in C/EBP alpha are present in a subset of patients with AML presenting with a normal karyotype. These mutations can result in the expression of a 30 kDa dominant negative C/EBP alpha isoform, which contributes to loss of C/EBP alpha function. The molecular basis for this observation remains unknown. In addition to phosphorylation, C/EBP alpha is modified, post-translationally by a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) at a lysine residue (K159), which lies within the growth inhibitory region of the C/EBP alpha protein. Sumoylation at K159 in the C/EBP alpha protein prevents association of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex with C/EBP alpha, thereby hampering transactivation.

Our previous studies demonstrated that MGN-3 sensitizes human leukemia cells to death receptor [CD95]-induced apoptosis [Ghoneum M, Gollapudi S. MGN-3 sensitizes human T cell leukemia cells to death receptor (CD95)-induced apoptosis. Cancer Lett 2003;201:41-9]. In this study, we evaluated the chemo-sensitizing activity of MGN-3 against human breast cancer cells (BCCs) in vitro. METHODS: BCCs (MCF-7 and HCC70 cells) were cultured with different concentrations of daunorubicin (DNR) (from 1x10(-9) to 1x10(-6)M) in the presence or absence of selected concentrations of MGN-3 (100-1000mug/ml) for 3 days. Cancer cell survival was determined by MTT assay and drug accumulation was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment with MGN-3 increased susceptibility of BCCs to DNR (5.5-fold for MCF-7 and 2.5-fold for HCC70 cells) as compared to BCCs treated with DNR alone. The sensitizing effect of MGN-3 was associated with increased accumulation of DNR in cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that MGN-3 is an effective chemo-sensitizer and may represent a potential novel adjuvant for the treatment of breast cancer.","['Gollapudi, Sastry', 'Ghoneum, Mamdooh']","['Gollapudi S', 'Ghoneum M']","['University of California at Irvine, Division of Basic and Clinical Immunology, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080411,England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Xylans)', '0 (polysaccharide MGN3)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Xylans/*therapeutic use']",2008/04/15 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/04/15 09:00'],"['2008/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0361-090X(08)00014-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cdp.2008.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 2008;32(1):1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cdp.2008.02.006.

To address this issue, we analyzed 891 AML patients in first CR. From the data of randomly selected 446 patients (training set), we first established optimal cutoffs for neutrophil and platelet counts and hemoglobin level at CR in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS). Patients whose counts were higher than each optimal cutoff were shown to have significantly better RFS (p<0.01 for neutrophil and platelets, and p=0.02 for hemoglobin). Then we tested whether these cutoffs were, after accounting for better known prognostic covariates, also predictive of RFS in the remaining 445 patients (validation set). Our data revealed that higher neutrophil count was independently predictive of longer RFS in the validation set (hazard ratio 1.38, p=0.02), as was higher platelet count (hazard ratio 1.35, p=0.04). These findings suggest that blood counts at CR, information readily available, are useful in prognostication in AML.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Yanada M', 'Borthakur G', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ravandi F', 'Faderl S', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Estey E']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, United States. myanada@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080410,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Blood Cell Count', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2008/04/15 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00123-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Oct;32(10):1505-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.03.002.

To date, the literature has reported 5 cases of esophageal cancer in adult patients treated for EA. The aim of this study was to find out the incidence of esophageal cancer in adult patients with repaired EA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred two consecutive patients treated for EA from 1949 to 1978 were followed-up for cancer through the files of the population-based countrywide cancer registry from 1967 to 2004. The number of cancer cases observed and person-years at risk were counted, and the expected number of cancer cases estimated from the national cancer incidence rates. The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated by dividing the number of cancer cases observed by the expected numbers. RESULTS: None of the 502 patients were lost to follow-up; 230 patients who died before 1967 younger than the median age of 8 days were excluded from further analysis. The 272 remaining patients (142 males) were eligible for follow-up (median age, 35 years; range, 2 days to 56 years). Three cases of cancer were found (SIR, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-2.8). One was lymphoma in small intestine, 1 was leukemia, and 1 carcinoma of the uterus but no cases of esophageal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is able to exclude long-term risk for esophageal cancer after repair of EA 500-fold higher than that of the normal population. Considering the relatively young age of the survivors, further studies and continued follow-up are warranted to elucidate risk for esophageal cancer and need for endoscopic surveillance after repair of EA.","['Sistonen, Saara J', 'Koivusalo, Antti', 'Lindahl, Harry', 'Pukkala, Eero', 'Rintala, Risto J', 'Pakarinen, Mikko P']","['Sistonen SJ', 'Koivusalo A', 'Lindahl H', 'Pukkala E', 'Rintala RJ', 'Pakarinen MP']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, PO Box 281, FI-00029-HUS, Helsinki, Finland. saara.sistonen@helsinki.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*epidemiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Causality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Esophageal Atresia/*epidemiology/*surgery', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastroesophageal Reflux/epidemiology', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Period', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Uterine Neoplasms/epidemiology']",2008/04/15 09:00,2008/06/14 09:00,['2008/04/15 09:00'],"['2008/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3468(07)00982-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2008 Apr;43(4):602-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.12.002.,,,10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.12.002 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to the authors' knowledge, information regarding risk factors for leukemic transformation in primary myelofibrosis is limited. METHODS: The current retrospective study examined clinical variables at the time of diagnosis and specific treatment modalities for their effect on leukemic transformation in 311 patients with primary myelofibrosis who were seen at the Mayo Clinic. RESULTS: Univariate analysis of parameters at the time of diagnosis revealed a significant association between inferior leukemia-free survival and a peripheral blood blast percentage>or=3 (P<.0001), a platelet count<100x10(9)/L (P=.004), a monocyte count>or=1x10(9)/L (P=.02), the presence of hypercatabolic symptoms (P=.03), a low hemoglobin level (P=.04), and a high leukocyte count (P=.04). The first 2 parameters were found to maintain their statistical significance during multivariate analysis. Neither leukemia-free nor overall survival was found to be affected by the presence of <3% peripheral blood blasts or JAK2V617F mutation. The evaluation of treatment effect on leukemic transformation unexpectedly revealed a significant and independent association with previous therapy with either erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (P=.004) or danazol (P=.007), even when the aforementioned prognostic indicators at the time of diagnosis were added as covariates to the multivariate model. In contrast, leukemia-free survival was not found to be affected by a treatment history with hydroxyurea, thalidomide, or other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: A peripheral blood blast percentage>or=3 and/or a platelet count<100x10(9)/L at the time of diagnosis were found to be strong and independent predictors of leukemic transformation in patients with primary myelofibrosis. The unexpected association between leukemic transformation and a history of treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or danazol requires validation by prospective studies.","['Huang, Jocelin', 'Li, Chin-Yang', 'Mesa, Ruben A', 'Wu, Wentling', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Huang J', 'Li CY', 'Mesa RA', 'Wu W', 'Hanson CA', 'Pardanani A', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'N29QWW3BUO (Danazol)']",IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Danazol/adverse effects', 'Erythropoietin/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications/drug therapy', 'Risk Factors']",2008/04/12 09:00,2008/07/03 09:00,['2008/04/12 09:00'],"['2008/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23505 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Jun 15;112(12):2726-32. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23505.,,,10.1002/cncr.23505 [doi],,,,,['Copyright (c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

A recent study revealed that long-term exposure to relatively low-dose DEHP (0.05%) caused liver tumors including hepatocellular carcinomas, hepatocellular adenomas, and chologiocellular carcinomas at a higher incidence in Ppar alpha-null mice (25.8%) than in wild-type mice (10.0%). Using tissues with hepatocellular adenoma, microarray (Affymetrix MOE430A) as well as, in part, real-time quantitative PCR analysis was conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of the adenoma formation resulting from DEHP exposure in both genotyped mice. The microarray profiles showed that the up- or down-regulated genes were quite different between hepatocellular adenoma tissues of wild-type and Ppar alpha-null mice exposed to DEHP. The gene expressions of apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf1) and DNA-damage-inducible 45 alpha (Gadd45a) were increased in the hepatocellular adenoma tissues of wild-type mice exposed to DEHP, whereas they were unchanged in corresponding tissues of Ppar alpha-null mice. On the other hand, the expressions of cyclin B2 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 were increased only in the hepatocellular adenoma tissues of Ppar alpha-null mice. Taken together, DEHP may induce hepatocellular adenomas, in part, via suppression of G2/M arrest regulated by Gadd45a and caspase 3-dependent apoptosis in Ppar alpha-null mice, but these genes may not be involved in tumorigenesis in the wild-type mice. In contrast, the expression level of Met was notably increased in the liver adenoma tissue of wild-type mice, which may suggest the involvement of Met in DEHP-induced tumorigenesis in wild-type mice.","['Takashima, Kayoko', 'Ito, Yuki', 'Gonzalez, Frank J', 'Nakajima, Tamie']","['Takashima K', 'Ito Y', 'Gonzalez FJ', 'Nakajima T']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,J Occup Health,Journal of occupational health,9616320,"['0 (Apaf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Gadd45a protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PPAR alpha)', '0 (Plasticizers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'C42K0PH13C (Diethylhexyl Phthalate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'G2 Phase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hepatocytes/drug effects', 'Hyperplasia', 'Liver/*drug effects/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'PPAR alpha/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasticizers/toxicity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics']",2008/04/12 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2008/04/12 09:00'],"['2008/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/joh/L7105 [pii]', '10.1539/joh.l7105 [doi]']",ppublish,J Occup Health. 2008;50(2):169-80. doi: 10.1539/joh.l7105.,,,,PMC7217336,,,,,"['Z01 BC005561/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC005562/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC005708/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1584371'],,,,,,,,

These short CUX1 isoforms were reported to be overexpressed in cancer cells, and transgenic mice overexpressing the p75 isoform were found to develop myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid leukemias. In the present study, we report that the neutrophil elastase can also generate a short CUX1 isoform in the MV4;11 acute myeloid leukemia cell line. Proteolytic processing was so efficient that the full-length CUX1 protein was detected only when cells were maintained in the presence of the specific elastase inhibitor III. In agreement with these findings, higher levels of the processed cyclin E isoforms were also detected in MV4;11 cells. Reappearance of full-length cyclin E and CUX1 could be induced upon the treatment of MV4;11 cells with the differentiation inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or, unexpectedly, following overexpression of a short recombinant CUX1 protein. In both cases, the mechanism involved transcriptional repression of the neutrophil elastase gene. This result revealed a negative feedback loop whereby CUX1 shuts down the expression of the protease that cleaves it. Overall, the findings in MV4;11 and other cancer cells suggest that various mechanisms are used in cancer to favor the expression of short CUX1 isoforms.","['Goulet, Brigitte', 'Markovic, Yelena', 'Leduy, Lam', 'Nepveu, Alain']","['Goulet B', 'Markovic Y', 'Leduy L', 'Nepveu A']","['Molecular Oncology Group, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 1A1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin E/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Elastase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2008/04/12 09:00,2008/07/08 09:00,['2008/04/12 09:00'],"['2008/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/4/644 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0268 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2008 Apr;6(4):644-53. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0268.,,,10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0268 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sequence information also makes feasible genome-scale investigation of transgene integration into schistosome chromosomes. Retrovirus-mediated transduction offers a means to establish transgenic lines of schistosomes, to elucidate schistosome gene function and expression, and to advance functional genomics approaches for these parasites. We investigated the utility of the Moloney murine leukemia retrovirus (MLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) for the transduction of Schistosoma mansoni and delivery of reporter transgenes into schistosome chromosomes. Schistosomula were exposed to virions of VSVG-pseudotyped MLV, after which genomic DNA was extracted from the transduced schistosomes. Southern hybridization analysis indicated the presence of proviral MLV retrovirus in the transduced schistosomes. Fragments of the MLV transgene and flanking schistosome sequences recovered using an anchored PCR-based approach demonstrated definitively that somatic transgenesis of schistosome chromosomes had taken place and, moreover, revealed widespread retrovirus integration into schistosome chromosomes. More specifically, MLV transgenes had inserted in the vicinity of genes encoding immunophilin, zinc finger protein Sma-Zic, and others, as well as near the endogenous schistosome retrotransposons, the fugitive and SR1. Proviral integration of the MLV transgene appeared to exhibit primary sequence site specificity, targeting a gGATcc-like motif. Reporter luciferase transgene activity driven by the schistosome actin gene promoter was expressed in the tissues of transduced schistosomula and adult schistosomes. Luciferase activity appeared to be developmentally expressed in schistosomula with increased activity observed after 1 to 2 wk in culture. These findings indicate the utility of VSVG-pseudotyped MLV for transgenesis of S. mansoni, herald a tractable pathway forward toward germline transgenesis and functional genomics of parasitic helminths, and provide the basis for comparative molecular pathogenesis studies of chromosomal lesions arising from retroviral integration into human compared with schistosome chromosomes.","['Kines, Kristine J', 'Morales, Maria E', 'Mann, Victoria H', 'Gobert, Geoffrey N', 'Brindley, Paul J']","['Kines KJ', 'Morales ME', 'Mann VH', 'Gobert GN', 'Brindley PJ']","['Department of Tropical Medicine, and Biomedical Sciences Program, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080410,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Helminth)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.7 (Luciferases, Firefly)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes/genetics/virology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Helminth/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Helminth', 'Genomics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Luciferases, Firefly/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*genetics/growth & development/pathogenicity/virology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",2008/04/12 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/04/12 09:00'],"['2008/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['fj.08-108308 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.08-108308 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2008 Aug;22(8):2936-48. doi: 10.1096/fj.08-108308.

The most common NPM1 mutation type, accounting for 75 to 80% of cases, is referred to as mutation A (NPM1-mutA). These NPM1 alterations have been shown to possess prognostic significance because they appear to identify patients who will benefit from chemotherapy. Given the high prevalence and stability of these mutations over the course of disease, NPM1 mutations may serve as ideal targets for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment in AML. Current detection methods are costly, require sophisticated equipment, and are often not sufficiently sensitive. We report here an allele-specific (ASO)-RT-PCR assay that enables rapid and sensitive detection of NPM1-mutA. A semi-nested ASO-PCR method was also designed to increase the sensitivity of our assay for the monitoring of MRD. We analyzed bone marrow cells collected from 52 patients with AML at presentation. NPM1-mutA was detected in leukemic cells from 21 patients. Assay specificity was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. ASO-RT-PCR and semi-nested ASO-PCR assays could detect NPM1-mutA with sensitivities of 10(-2) and 10(-5), respectively. Results obtained here verify that our ASO-RT-PCR assay is a specific and sensitive method for the routine screening of NPM1-mutA, as well as for MRD monitoring of AML patients with this alteration. This method is convenient and easily applicable in countries with limited resources and no access to real-time quantitative PCR-based technologies.","['Ottone, Tiziana', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Lavorgna, Serena', 'Noguera, Nelida I', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Gianni, Laura', 'Postorino, Massimiliano', 'Federici, Giorgio', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Ottone T', 'Ammatuna E', 'Lavorgna S', 'Noguera NI', 'Buccisano F', 'Venditti A', 'Gianni L', 'Postorino M', 'Federici G', 'Amadori S', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Diagnostica per Immagini, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080410,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/04/12 09:00,2008/07/02 09:00,['2008/04/12 09:00'],"['2008/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-1578(10)60152-3 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2008.070166 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2008 May;10(3):212-6. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2008.070166.

The use of reagents specifically blocking the molecule might provide a new approach for interfering with deleterious growth circuits, therefore increasing the susceptibility of leukemic cells to conventional chemotherapy.","['Deaglio, Silvia', 'Aydin, Semra', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Bergui, Luciana', 'Malavasi, Fabio']","['Deaglio S', 'Aydin S', 'Vaisitti T', 'Bergui L', 'Malavasi F']","['Department of Genetics, Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Biology and Biochemistry and CeRMS, Via Santena 19, 10126 Torino, Italy. silvia.deaglio@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080409,England,Trends Mol Med,Trends in molecular medicine,100966035,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ligands)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*biosynthesis/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Cell Movement', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Ligands', 'Models, Biological', 'Prognosis']",2008/04/12 09:00,2008/08/15 09:00,['2008/04/12 09:00'],"['2007/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1471-4914(08)00081-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molmed.2008.02.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Mol Med. 2008 May;14(5):210-8. doi: 10.1016/j.molmed.2008.02.005.

In the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), although the blastocyst hatching phenomenon is quite interesting and LIF is shown to regulate hatching, information is not available on the embryonic and uterine expression of LIF and hormonal regulation of LIF expression during the peri-implantation period. The present investigation is aimed at studying embryonic and uterine expression of LIF during preimplantation hamster development. We observed embryonic expression of LIF mRNA and protein in the 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stages. In cycling females, uterine LIF mRNA expression was maximal during the oestrogen-dominant phase of the oestrous cycle, i.e. proestrous stage. Interestingly, during pregnancy, both LIF mRNA and protein were highly upregulated on Days 3.5 and 4 ('window of implantation'), implying a role for this cytokine in blastocyst hatching and implantation. Cell type-specific localisation of LIF mRNA and protein was observed predominantly in luminal epithelium and uterine glands with faint staining being detected in the stroma. The hamster uterus encoded a approximately 4.2 kb LIF transcript whose coding region, when cloned and sequenced, showed a high degree of identity to the murine cDNA counterpart. These data demonstrate that: (1) hamster preimplantation embryos show LIF mRNA and protein expression; (2) uterine expression of LIF mRNA and protein was dependent on elevated levels of circulating oestrogen, and (3) there is a possible functional association of LIF with the peri-implantation development in the golden hamster.","['Rao, Rajnish P', 'Fischer, Bernd', 'Seshagiri, Polani B']","['Rao RP', 'Fischer B', 'Seshagiri PB']","['Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560 012, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cricetinae', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', 'Estrous Cycle/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Pregnancy', 'Up-Regulation', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2008/04/12 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/04/12 09:00'],"['2007/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['RD07154 [pii]', '10.1071/rd07154 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 2008;20(3):440-9. doi: 10.1071/rd07154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When complex 1 is dissolved in DMF, complex 2 is obtained as light-green crystals. The reaction of pbt with CuBr 2 in DMF also yields the complex [Cu(pbt)Br 2(dmf)] ( 2) (dmf = dimethylformamide). Complexes 1- 3 were characterized by X-ray crystallography. Complexes 1 and 3 have distorted tetrahedral coordination environments, and complex 2 is constituted of two slightly different copper centers, both exhibiting distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometries. Complexes 1 and 2 cleave phiX174 phage DNA, both in the presence and the absence of reductant. The free ligand pbt does not show any DNA-cleaving abilities. The poor solubility of complex 3 makes it not applicable for biological tests. The occurrence of DNA breaks in the presence of various radical scavengers suggests that no diffusible radicals are involved in the DNA cleavage by complex 1, as none of the scavengers inhibit the cleavage reaction. The DNA-cleavage products are not religated with the enzyme T4 DNA ligase, which is an additional proof that the cleavage is nonhydrolytic. Most probably the cleaving reaction involves reactive oxygen species, which could not be trapped, leading to an oxidative mechanism. An easy oxidation of Cu (II)(pbt)Br 2 to Cu (III) in DMF and the reduction of the same to Cu (I), under similar electrochemical conditions may lead to the in situ activation of molecular oxygen, resulting in the formation of metal solvated nondiffusible radicals able to prompt the oxidative cleavage of DNA.

Despite imatinib's activity, the development of resistance, whether BCR-ABL dependent or independent, is a concern. BCR-ABL-dependent resistance is commonly a result of mutations in the BCR-ABL gene, which can induce a structural predisposition towards the active conformation of the protein, resulting in a shift in the equilibrium of BCR-ABL from inactive, which imatinib binds, to active, which imatinib is unable to bind. BCR-ABL gene amplification may play a role in the development of imatinib resistance in patients with CML. There are a number of BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of imatinib resistance, including the efflux protein multidrug resistance protein-1, of which imatinib is a substrate. Another mechanism may be the development of alternative pathways of disease progression, leading to less reliance on BCR-ABL; indeed, the SRC family tyrosine kinases LYN and HCK have been frequently implicated in treatment resistance and progression of CML. Clearly, imatinib resistance requires the development of other treatment options. Dasatinib, with increased binding potency (325-fold greater potency than imatinib for wild-type BCR-ABL), inhibition of both the active and inactive formation of BCR-ABL, and targeting of SRC family kinases, is the only agent approved for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML and Ph+ ALL. Dasatinib is highly active in all phases of these diseases, and is active in the majority of imatinib-resistant mutations, with the exception of T315I. The development of agents that effectively inhibit T315I mutations suggests that future treatment options will include combination therapy.","['Lee, Francis', 'Fandi, Abderrahim', 'Voi, Maurizio']","['Lee F', 'Fandi A', 'Voi M']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb, 206 Provence Line Road, Princeton, NJ 08543, USA. francis.lee@bms.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/chemistry/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",2008/04/11 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/04/11 09:00'],"['2008/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(07)00320-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2007.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2008;40(3):334-43. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2007.10.001.,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its N-terminal sequence displayed similarity to a short segment of the sequences of the Populus tremula trypsin inhibitor, a putative trypsin inhibitor from Arabidopsis thaliana and sporamin B from sweet potato. The trypsin inhibitor was adsorbed on DEAE-cellulose, unadsorbed on Affi-gel blue gel, and adsorbed on SP-Sepharose. It dose-dependently inhibited trypsin with an IC (50) value of 1.3 microM. There was a stimulatory effect on macrophage production of nitric oxide. Unlike field bean trypsin inhibitor it did not inhibit [methyl-(3)H]thymidine incorporation by leukemia L1210 cells and MBL2 cells when tested up to 100 microM. In contrast to broad bean trypsin inhibitor, there was no inhibitory effect on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase when lily bulb trypsin inhibitor was tested up to 100 microM. The present report is one of the very few on bulbs in contrast to the voluminous literature on seeds.","['Zhang, Xiaoqing', 'Wang, Hexiang', 'Ng, Tzi Bun']","['Zhang X', 'Wang H', 'Ng TB']","['State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology and Department of Microbiology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, P.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of PDCD5 overexpression on drug sensitivity of leukemia cells. K562 cells were treated with idarubicin (IDR) alone or in combination with adenoviral vectors expressing PDCD5 (Ad-PDCD5). As shown by annexin-V-FITC/PI dual labeling, apoptosis rates were markedly increased after combined treatment with Ad-PDCD5 compared to IDR treatment alone. We observed that PDCD5 overexpression significantly improves the antitumor effects of low dose IDR treatment in vivo. Tumor sizes were significantly decreased in combined Ad-PDCD5 and low dose IDR treatment groups compared with single IDR treatment groups. Similar results were obtained with combined systemic treatment of Ad-PDCD5 and low dose IDR, and combined treatment with Ad-PDCD5 local injection and low dose IDR i.p. injection. These results indicate that Ad-PDCD5 may be a promising agent for enhancing chemosensitivity.","['Ruan, Guo-Rui', 'Zhao, Hong-Shan', 'Chang, Yan', 'Li, Jin-Lan', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Chen, Shan-Shan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Ruan GR', 'Zhao HS', 'Chang Y', 'Li JL', 'Qin YZ', 'Liu YR', 'Chen SS', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, 11 Xi-zhi-men South Street, Beijing 100044, China. celiar@public3.bta.net.cn""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD5 protein, human)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",2008/04/11 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/04/11 09:00'],"['2008/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-008-0206-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2008 May;13(5):641-8. doi: 10.1007/s10495-008-0206-9.,,,10.1007/s10495-008-0206-9 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) also occurs. In this retrospective study, we also describe other prolonged haematological sequelae of this regimen. One hundred and twenty-five patients were treated with a median of six hyper-CVAD cycles and followed for a median of 28 months. Follow-up for cytopenias was censored at the next cytotoxic therapy. At 3 months post-therapy, 77 patients were evaluable. Cytopenias persisted in 59% of patients. Requirement for dose attenuation was the only factor significantly associated with persisting cytopenias (p<0.05). The median time to normalisation of counts for those with post-treatment cytopenias in the respective lineages was 9 months (range, 6-12) for anaemia, 6 months (range, 6-30) for neutropenia and 9 months (range, 6-30) for thrombocytopenia. MDS/AML was diagnosed in four patients at 4, 21, 24 and 37 months after therapy with a cumulative incidence rate of 4.43% at 4 years. These results indicate a considerable rate of prolonged haematological toxicity after hyper-CVAD and a modest rate of MDS at this limited follow-up. These findings likely reflect cumulative damage to haematopoietic stem cells.","['Gill, Saar', 'Lane, Steven W', 'Crawford, Julie', 'Cull, Gavin', 'Joske, David', 'Marlton, Paula', 'Mollee, Peter N', 'Prince, H Miles', 'Seymour, John F']","['Gill S', 'Lane SW', 'Crawford J', 'Cull G', 'Joske D', 'Marlton P', 'Mollee PN', 'Prince HM', 'Seymour JF']","[""Department of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Locked Bag 1, A'Beckett St, Victoria 8006, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080410,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2008/04/11 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0488-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Sep;87(9):727-34. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0488-6.

Cytoplasmatic NPM (NPMc+) is associated with responsiveness to chemotherapy and better prognosis. The activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been demonstrated to occur in a subset of AML patients and is thought to induce resistance to many chemotherapeutical agents. In this study, we demonstrate the increased in vitro sensitivity of NPMc+ cells to chemotherapeutical agents and their reduced NF-kappaB activity. Furthermore, we provide evidence of the interaction between NPMc+ and NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm, resulting in the sequestration and inactivation of NF-kappaB. The cytosolic localization and consequent inactivation of NF-kappaB justifies the reduced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity observed in NPMc+ patients. These data, taken together, may provide a possible explanation for the increased rate of chemosensitivity observed among the NPMc+ patients.","['Cilloni, D', 'Messa, F', 'Rosso, V', 'Arruga, F', 'Defilippi, I', 'Carturan, S', 'Catalano, R', 'Pautasso, M', 'Panuzzo, C', 'Nicoli, P', 'Messa, E', 'Morotti, A', 'Iacobucci, I', 'Martinelli, G', 'Bracco, E', 'Saglio, G']","['Cilloni D', 'Messa F', 'Rosso V', 'Arruga F', 'Defilippi I', 'Carturan S', 'Catalano R', 'Pautasso M', 'Panuzzo C', 'Nicoli P', 'Messa E', 'Morotti A', 'Iacobucci I', 'Martinelli G', 'Bracco E', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, Turin, Italy. daniela.cilloni@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20080410,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/04/11 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/04/11 09:00'],"['2008/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200868 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.68 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jun;22(6):1234-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.68.

We screened 29 patients with T cell malignancies for the expression of NUP214-ABL1 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). NUP214-ABL1 was detected in three (10%) patients. These results were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques. We also studied the activity of imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib against the human NUP214-ABL1-positive cell lines PEER and BE-13. All three tyrosine kinase inhibitors decreased the viability of PEER and BE-13 cells, but nilotinib and dasatinib had >1-log lower IC(50) values than imatinib (P<0.001). In contrast, the NUP214-ABL-negative T-ALL cell line Jurkat, was remarkably resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibition. The inhibition of cellular proliferation was associated with time-dependent induction of apoptosis and inhibition of ABL, CrKL and STAT5 phosphorylation. Moreover, dasatinib was active in a NUP214-ABL1-positive leukemia xenograft murine model and in marrow lymphoblasts from a patient with NUP214-ABL1-positive T-ALL. On the basis of these results, ABL1 kinase inhibitors warrant clinical investigation in patients with NUP214-ABL1-positive T-cell malignancies.","['Quintas-Cardama, A', 'Tong, W', 'Manshouri, T', 'Vega, F', 'Lennon, P A', 'Cools, J', 'Gilliland, D G', 'Lee, F', 'Cortes, J', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Garcia-Manero, G']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Tong W', 'Manshouri T', 'Vega F', 'Lennon PA', 'Cools J', 'Gilliland DG', 'Lee F', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080410,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (NUP214-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/04/11 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/04/11 09:00'],"['2008/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200880 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.80 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jun;22(6):1117-24. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.80.

Dasatinib (70 mg) twice daily was administered to patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CP-CML. With median follow-up of 15.2 months (treatment duration, <1-18.4 months), a complete hematologic response was attained or maintained in 91% of patients. A major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was attained or maintained by 59% (52% imatinib resistant and 80% imatinib intolerant); this was complete in 49% of patients (40% imatinib resistant and 75% imatinib intolerant). Of 230 patients achieving an MCyR, 7 experienced disease progression. Fifteen-month progression-free survival was 90% while overall survival was 96%.

Imatinib-sensitive LAMA84-s displayed marked SphK1 inhibition coupled with increased content of ceramide and decreased pro-survival sphingosine-1-phosphate. Conversely, no changes in the sphingolipid metabolism were observed in LAMA84-r treated with imatinib. Overcoming imatinib resistance in LAMA84-r with farnesyltransferase or MEK/ERK inhibitors as well as with cytosine arabinoside led to SphK1 inhibition. Overexpression of SphK1 in LAMA84-s cells impaired apoptosis and inhibited the effects of imatinib on caspase-3 activation, cytochrome c and Smac release from mitochondria through modulation of Bim, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of SphK1 with F-12509a or its silencing by siRNA induced apoptosis of both imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells, suggesting that SphK1 inhibition was critical for apoptosis signaling. We also show that imatinib-sensitive and -resistant primary cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients can be successfully killed in vitro by the F-12509a inhibitor. These results uncover the involvement of SphK1 in regulating imatinib-induced apoptosis and establish that SphK1 is a downstream effector of the Bcr-Abl/Ras/ERK pathway inhibited by imatinib but upstream regulator of Bcl-2 family members.","['Bonhoure, E', 'Lauret, A', 'Barnes, D J', 'Martin, C', 'Malavaud, B', 'Kohama, T', 'Melo, J V', 'Cuvillier, O']","['Bonhoure E', 'Lauret A', 'Barnes DJ', 'Martin C', 'Malavaud B', 'Kohama T', 'Melo JV', 'Cuvillier O']","['CNRS, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, UMR5089, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080410,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (F 12509A)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Benzamides', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/04/11 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/04/11 09:00'],"['2008/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200895 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.95 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 May;22(5):971-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.95.

We performed systematic mutagenesis on this region and found excellent correlation between the amino-acid side chains required for in vitro assembly and those that participate in the p10-CA dimer interface in a previously described crystal structure. We introduced exogenous cysteine residues that were predicted to form disulphide bonds across the dimer interface. Upon oxidation of immature particles, a disulphide-linked Gag hexamer was formed, implying that p10 participates in and stabilizes the immature Gag hexamer. This is the first example of a critical interaction between two different Gag domains. Molecular modeling of the RSV immature hexamer indicates that the N-terminal domains of CA must expand relative to the murine leukaemia virus mature hexamer to accommodate the p10 contact; this expansion is strikingly similar to recent cryotomography results for immature human immunodeficiency virus particles.","['Phillips, Judith M', 'Murray, Paul S', 'Murray, Diana', 'Vogt, Volker M']","['Phillips JM', 'Murray PS', 'Murray D', 'Vogt VM']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080410,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rous sarcoma virus/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/04/11 09:00,2008/06/12 09:00,['2008/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['emboj200871 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2008.71 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2008 May 7;27(9):1411-20. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2008.71.

However, whether these factors are essential for HIV-1 or MLV infection has been questioned. Prior studies in which conflicting results were obtained were highly dependent on RNA interference-mediated gene silencing. To shed light on these contradictory results, we examined whether HIV-1 or MLV could infect primary cells from mice deficient for emerin, LAP2alpha, or both emerin and LAP2alpha. We observed HIV-1 and MLV infectivity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from emerin knockout, LAP2alpha knockout, or emerin and LAP2alpha double knockout mice to be comparable in infectivity to wild-type littermate-derived MEFs, indicating that both emerin and LAP2alpha were dispensable for HIV-1 and MLV infection of dividing, primary mouse cells. Because emerin has been suggested to be important for infection of human macrophages by HIV-1, we also examined HIV-1 transduction of macrophages from wild-type mice or knockout mice, but again we did not observe a difference in susceptibility. These findings prompted us to reexamine the role of human emerin in supporting HIV-1 and MLV infection. Notably, both viruses efficiently infected human cells expressing high levels of dominant-negative emerin. We thus conclude that emerin and LAP2alpha are not required for the early replication of HIV-1 and MLV in mouse or human cells.","['Mulky, Alok', 'Cohen, Tatiana V', 'Kozlov, Serguei V', 'Korbei, Barbara', 'Foisner, Roland', 'Stewart, Colin L', 'KewalRamani, Vineet N']","['Mulky A', 'Cohen TV', 'Kozlov SV', 'Korbei B', 'Foisner R', 'Stewart CL', 'KewalRamani VN']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20080409,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (emerin)', '0 (lamina-associated polypeptide 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism']",2008/04/11 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/04/11 09:00'],"['2008/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00076-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00076-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jun;82(12):5860-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00076-08.

Previously we had shown that, in a p53-dependent model of cell death, ceramide accumulated in a p53-dependent manner [Dbaibo GS, Pushkareva MY, Rachid RA, Alter N, Smyth MJ, Obeid LM, Hannun YA. J Clin Invest 1998;102:329-339]. In the current study, we investigated the biochemical pathways by which ceramide accumulated following p53 up-regulation. In both Molt-4 LXSN leukemia cells exposed to gamma-irradiation and in EB-1 colon cancer cells treated with ZnCl(2), p53 up-regulation led to de novo ceramide synthesis with predominance of N-palmitoylsphingosine (C16-ceramide) synthesis. The activation of the de novo pathway was not associated with increased activity of the key enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) but rather with the increased activity of ceramide synthase. Furthermore, transcriptional up-regulation of the palmitoyl-specific Lass5 ceramide synthase gene was observed in Molt-4 but not in EB-1 cells. The SPT inhibitor ISP-1 or the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 led to substantial inhibition of ceramide accumulation in response to p53 up-regulation.

METHODS: The clinical manifestations, laboratory parameters and treatment were retrospectively analyzed in 287 patients with PV. Univariate analysis of prognostic factors was performed using Log-rank model and multivariate analysis using COX model in term of the incidence of thrombosis, PPMM, hematologic or non hematologic cancers and mortality. RESULTS: Of the 287 patients, the median follow-up time was 46 (8-360) months. 208 thromboses were recorded in 115 patients. Twice or more thrombotic events occurred on 59 patients (51.34%). Most of these episodes occurred either at presentation or in the 2 years before diagnosis. Elder patients, prior thrombosis, poor response to therapy were associated with poor prognosis. With these three adverse prognostic factors, the patients could be separated into different risk groups. The incidence of thrombosis was higher in high risk group. 36 patients progressed to PPMM, the median time to PPMM was 80 (7-190) months. Higher WBC count, splenomegaly and treatment with alkylating agent and hydroxy-carbamide (HU) were associated with poor prognosis. 2 cases progressed to AML. 1 to lymphoma and 1 to nonhematologic cancer. 13 patients died, the cause of death was fatal thrombosis in 9 and AML in 2.

The total kit protein (CD117), phosphorylated kit protein and its downstream signaling molecules were measured by Western blot analysis. Mutated kit protein from control and 17AAG-treated Kasumi-1 cells was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted for associated chaperones. RESULTS: Total kit protein and kit activity were decreased in 17AAG treated cells, but c-kit mRNA level was not. Total AKT protein and phospho-AKT, as well as phospho-STAT3 were rapidly down-regulated in Kasumi-1 cell after treatment with 17AAG. There was no change in total STAT3 protein.

Moreover, these alterations increase cell survival, inhibit apoptosis and are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, the induction of apoptosis by selective inhibition of focal adhesion signaling may represent a novel anti-AML therapy. Here, we have evaluated the antitumor effect and the mechanism of action of celecoxib and E7123, a non-Cox-2 inhibitor derivative, in a panel of human AML cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients. Both compounds induce cell death by inhibiting focal adhesion signaling through p130Cas, FAK and c-Src, leading to caspase-8 dependent apoptosis. This mechanism of action differs from that of classical cytotoxic drugs or of other targeted therapies, and is amenable to rational drug development. Therefore, both drugs could be developed as AML therapeutics; nevertheless, E7123 shows more activity than celecoxib against AML cells, and may not present its Cox-2 dependent cardiovascular toxicity. Finally, our results support the evaluation of celecoxib in AML patients, and the preclinical evaluation of E7123, before its possible clinical testing.","['Casanova, Isolda', 'Bosch, Rosa', 'Lasa, Adriana', 'Parreno, Matilde', 'Cespedes, Maria Virtudes', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F', 'Mangues, Maria Antonia', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Mangues, Ramon']","['Casanova I', 'Bosch R', 'Lasa A', 'Parreno M', 'Cespedes MV', 'Brunet S', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Mangues MA', 'Sierra J', 'Mangues R']","['Networking Research Center on Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0', '(4-(5-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)benzen', 'esulfonamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Celecoxib', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Focal Adhesions/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/06/03 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23516 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Jul 1;123(1):217-26. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23516.,,,10.1002/ijc.23516 [doi],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Expression of sialylated CD176 was evaluated by comparative immunostaining with anti-CD176 antibodies before and after sialidase treatment. While only few cell lines expressed unmasked CD176, sialylated CD176 was present on all hematopoietic cell lines and native lymphocytes examined. CD175 and CD175s are preferentially expressed on erythroblastic leukemia cell lines. CD175s expression in these cells is consistent with the transcription of the gene encoding the key enzyme alpha2,6-sialyltransferase (hST6GalNAc1). The staining intensity was reduced after methanol pretreatment of cells, indicating that these glycans are partially expressed as constituents of glycosphingolipids. Immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blotting revealed a series of distinct high molecular glycoproteins as carriers for these carbohydrate antigens. CD34 was identified as major carrier of CD176 by immunoprecipitation and microsequencing on a KG-1 subline enriched for CD176 expression. Incubation of several CD176-positive cell lines with anti-CD176 antibodies induced apoptosis of these cells, an effect not observed with anti-CD175/CD175s antibodies. Since the presence of naturally occurring anti-CD176 antibodies may represent a mechanism of immunosurveillance against CD176-positive tumor cells, we propose that sialylation of surface-expressed CD176--among other functions--protects against apoptosis.","['Cao, Yi', 'Merling, Anette', 'Karsten, Uwe', 'Goletz, Steffen', 'Punzel, Michael', 'Kraft, Regine', 'Butschak, Gunter', 'Schwartz-Albiez, Reinhard']","['Cao Y', 'Merling A', 'Karsten U', 'Goletz S', 'Punzel M', 'Kraft R', 'Butschak G', 'Schwartz-Albiez R']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tn antigen)', '0 (sialosyl-Tn antigen)', '3554-90-3 (Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (ST6GAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/06/03 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23493 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Jul 1;123(1):89-99. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23493.,,,10.1002/ijc.23493 [doi],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

The original studies in the 1980s used decitabine as a classical anticancer drug, at its maximum clinically tolerated dose, 1500 to 2500 mg/m(2) per course. At these doses, decitabine was found to be active in leukemia, but was associated with delayed and prolonged myelosuppression. After a better understanding of epigenetics in cancer and the role of decitabine in epigenetic (hypomethylating) therapy was gained, it was reevaluated at approximately 1/20th of the previous doses (ie, at 'optimal biologic' doses that modulate hypomethylation). In these dose schedules of decitabine (100 to 150 mg/m(2) per course), the drug was found to be active with manageable side effects in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and other myeloid tumors. Optimizing dosing schedules of decitabine to maximize hypomethylation (low dose, high dose intensity, and multiple cycles) have further improved results, suggesting that decitabine is an active therapy that alters the natural course of MDS. Combination therapies that augment the epigenetic effect of decitabine will likely improve responses and extend its use for the treatment of other malignancies.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Issa JP', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Some authors have suggested that Alu repeats facilitate this process, but supporting analyses have been sparse and often anecdotal. The purpose of this study was to analyze the local structure of t(9;22) translocations and assess the relevance of interspersed repeat elements at breakpoints. Collected data have been further compared with the current models of DNA recombination, in particular the single-strand annealing (SSA) and the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) processes. We developed a protocol for the rapid characterization of patient-specific genomic junctions and analyzed 27 patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. Sequence analysis revealed microhomologies at the junctions of 21 patients of 27, while interspersed repeats were of relevance (P < 0.05) in at least 16 patients. These findings are more frequent than expected and give an indication that the main mechanisms involved in the t(9;22) translocation are the SSA and NHEJ pathways, both playing a role. Furthermore, our report is consistent with microhomologies facilitating the joining of DNA ends in the translocation process, and with both Alu and a variety of other repeat sequences pairing nonhomologous chromosomes during the SSA pathway.","['Mattarucchi, Elia', 'Guerini, Vittoria', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Campiotti, Leonardo', 'Venco, Achille', 'Pasquali, Francesco', 'Lo Curto, Francesco', 'Porta, Giovanni']","['Mattarucchi E', 'Guerini V', 'Rambaldi A', 'Campiotti L', 'Venco A', 'Pasquali F', 'Lo Curto F', 'Porta G']","[""Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, Universita dell'Insubria, Varese, Italy. elia.mattarucchi@uninsubria.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interspersed Repetitive Sequences/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20568 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2008 Jul;47(7):625-32. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20568.,,,10.1002/gcc.20568 [doi],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Growth inhibition was assessed by ATP assay and drug interaction by the combination index and three dimensional methods. Synergy was observed in HL-60 cells for simultaneous combinations of CP-4055 with gemcitabine, irinotecan and topotecan, while combinations with cloretazine (VNP40101M) and idarubicin were additive. In U937 cells, synergy was observed with gemcitabine and additivity for the other drugs. In HL-60, the IC50 concentration of CP-4055 could be reduced 10-fold and that of gemcitabine 3-fold in combination versus the agents alone, an interaction that was independent of drug sequence, ratio and exposure time. In contrast, interactions of CP-4055 with the topoisomerase inhibitors became antagonistic when the drugs were administered 24 h prior to CP-4055 and at certain drug ratios, particularly in U937 cells. In summary, CP-4055 produced additive to synergistic anti proliferative activity when combined simultaneously with drugs from four mechanistic classes in cell culture models of human leukemia and lymphoma.

IgHV1-69 is one of the most frequently rearranged IgHV genes in CLL and the majority of IgHV1-69 cases lack somatic hypermutation and display poor prognosis. However, its independent prognostic impact remains uncertain given reports showing a low proportion of mutated IgHV1-69 cases and stereotyped IgHV1-69 subsets with divergent clinical outcome. We assessed the frequency and clinical significance of IgHV1-69 gene usage in a cohort of 330 CLL patients. Functional IgHV1-69 gene rearrangements were detected in 32 cases (9.7%), 31 of which were characterised further. Seven (22.6%) were found to have undergone somatic hypermutation. This subgroup had shorter and more diverse complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences compared with unmutated IgHV1-69 cases. In addition, mutated IgHV1-69 gene status was associated with lower cell surface CD38 expression and less progressive disease as monitored by Binet staging, lymphocyte doubling time and requirement of chemotherapeutic intervention. To conclude, we present data confirming that IgHV1-69 gene rearrangements in CLL are not exclusively associated with unmutated IgHV status.

We demonstrated that the intracellular and secreted levels of 174 cytokines and cytokine receptors of purified CLL B-cells were not significantly different from those of normal B-cells except for the secreted levels of IL-6 and eotaxin. IL-6 was 3.0 times lower (p = 0.038) whereas eotaxin was 2.2 times higher (p = 0.027) in CLL conditioned medium than in normal B-cell conditioned medium.

There were striking differences in clinical features such as hemoglobin, hematocrit and neutrophils percentages between V617F positive and negative patients with ET.

Imatinib is transported out of cells by the efflux transporter ABCB1 (MDR1, whose product is p-glycoprotein). By contrast, the influx transporter, human organic cation transporter 1 (hOCT1) (also known as SLC22A1), transports imatinib into cells. Recent studies have identified that patients with low expression or activity of hOCT1 have a lower probability of achieving a cytogenetic or molecular remission. Prospective studies are currently investigating whether early trends in transporter expression can be used to guide treatment decisions. Plasma imatinib levels are higher in patients responding well to treatment, and may be useful in patients with suboptimal response or dubious compliance. Uptake of the second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and nilotinib, is less dependent upon hOCT1. These two drugs may therefore achieve adequate intracellular concentrations even in patients with low hOCT1 expression.","['Clark, Richard E', 'Davies, Andrea', 'Pirmohamed, Munir', 'Giannoudis, Athina']","['Clark RE', 'Davies A', 'Pirmohamed M', 'Giannoudis A']","['University Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK. clarkre@liverpool.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Biomarkers', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/analysis/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['792011298 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701858823 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Apr;49(4):639-42. doi: 10.1080/10428190701858823.,13,,10.1080/10428190701858823 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although some clinical and biological findings have been found to be associated with a lower probability of response to imatinib, at present no precise markers allowing to predict outcome for individual patients exist. The most common mechanisms of resistance to imatinib include BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, BCR-ABL amplification and overexpression, and clonal evolution with activation of additional transformation pathways. These mechanisms are caused by the genomic instability, which characterises the Ph-positive clone. Several approaches to overcome resistance have been proposed, including novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that have now reached the clinical or pre-clinical phase of evaluation. Clinical trials with these novel TKIs have shown good rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses that appear also durable in time, but still cases of resistance are also observed, supporting the notion that genomic instability represents the major determinant affecting the final outcome of the CML patients when treated with TKIs. Understanding exactly the mechanisms leading to genomic instability of the Ph-positive cells represents therefore the real challenge for the near future.","['Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Ulisciani, Stefano', 'Bosa, Marco', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna']","['Saglio G', 'Ulisciani S', 'Bosa M', 'Cilloni D', 'Rege-Cambrin G']","['Division of Haematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, Turin, Italy. giuseppe.saglio@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['792014008 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190801896210 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Apr;49(4):625-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190801896210.,15,,10.1080/10428190801896210 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness and value of this drug is limited by the emergence of resistance. Alternative drug targets may be identified by analyzing the downstream signaling network including the Jak/Stat-pathway, Ras-dependent signaling, PI3-kinases (PI3K), or the nuclear transcription factors onto which these pathways impinge. However, several factors limit the possible suitability of a drug target: (i) tissue-specific versus ubiquitous expression of the target; (ii) redundancy within the signaling network; and (iii) off-target effects on the immune system. Although the former two aspects are well appreciated as limiting factors, the latter has not been addressed so far. The advent of genetically engineered mice provides a sophisticated target validation in vivo as well as analysis of interactions between the immune system and tumor cells. Based on studies in such mouse models, we predict that many targeted compounds including PI3Kdelta-inhibitors, could act as double-edged swords because their beneficial action on tumor cells may be neutralized or even overwhelmed by their additional immunosuppressive effects.","['Zebedin, Eva', 'Freissmuth, Michael', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Zebedin E', 'Freissmuth M', 'Sexl V']","['Institute of Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['792012467 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701858872 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Apr;49(4):620-4. doi: 10.1080/10428190701858872.,14,,10.1080/10428190701858872 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) studies evaluating the effect of population covariates on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and its active metabolite have been developed in adults with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). However, this still remains to be described in children. PURPOSE: The objectives of the analysis were to develop a PPK model of imatinib and its active metabolite, CGP74588, to describe exposure in children and young adults and to identify covariates that are predictors of variability in disposition. METHODS: Plasma concentrations from 26 subjects with Philadelphia (Ph+) leukemia (Phase I study) and 15 subjects with refractory solid tumors (Phase II study), who received oral imatinib at doses ranging from 260 to 570 mg/m(2), were available for the PPK analysis in NONMEM. Blood samples were drawn prior to dosing and over 24-48 h on days 1 and 8 of the studies. Covariates studied included weight, age, albumin, alanine aminotransferase and the study population. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of imatinib and CGP 74588 were well described by one and two compartment models, respectively. Total body weight was the only covariate found to significantly affect Cl/F and V/F. The final imatinib-CGP 74588 model is summarized as follows: CL/F (imatinib) (L/h) = 10.8 x (WT/70)(0.75), V/F (imatinib) (L) = 284 x (WT/70) and D1(duration of zero order absorption,imatinib) (h) = 1.67 and CL/F (CGP 74588) (L/h) = 9.65 x (WT/70)(0.75), V1/F (CGP 74588) (L) = 11.6 x (WT/70), Q (CGP 74588) (L/h) = 2.9 x (WT/70)(0.75) and V2/F (CGP 74588) (L) = 256*(WT/70). Model evaluation indicated that the final model was robust and satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Current imatinib dosing guidelines in pediatrics is based on the achievement of exposures consistent with doses known to be safe and efficacious in adults. Dose adjustments in children are guided empirically by the observance of drug-related toxicities. While, the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and its active metabolite, CGP 74588 in children are consistent with prior knowledge in adults, the model will form the basis to support the design of future trials, particularly with a view to managing toxicities and exploring dosing in this population.","['Menon-Andersen, Divya', 'Mondick, John T', 'Jayaraman, Bhuvana', 'Thompson, Patrick A', 'Blaney, Susan M', 'Bernstein, Mark', 'Bond, Mason', 'Champagne, Martin', 'Fossler, Michael J', 'Barrett, Jeffrey S']","['Menon-Andersen D', 'Mondick JT', 'Jayaraman B', 'Thompson PA', 'Blaney SM', 'Bernstein M', 'Bond M', 'Champagne M', 'Fossler MJ', 'Barrett JS']","[""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 34th and Civic Center Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. menond@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20080409,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CGP 74588)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', '*Aging/blood/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/blood/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Piperazines/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2007/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-008-0730-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2009 Jan;63(2):229-38. doi: 10.1007/s00280-008-0730-x.

An individual's response to fludarabine may be influenced by the amount of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte suppression. Fludarabine undergoes cellular uptake and activation to form the cytotoxic metabolite, fludarabine triphosphate (F-ara-ATP). METHODS: We have previously developed a highly sensitive LC-MS method to quantitate intracellular F-ara-ATP concentrations in a leukemic cell line. However, quantitation of F-ara-ATP concentrations within CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes from pharmacokinetic blood samples obtained from patients receiving fludarabine therapy is not feasible because of the limited number of T-lymphocytes that can be isolated from each blood sample. Thus, we sought to determine F-ara-ATP accumulation after ex vivo exposure of freshly isolated human CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-lymphocytes to fludarabine. The method was optimized in T-lymphocytes obtained from healthy volunteers, and proved to be a feasible method to determine F-ara-ATP accumulation in patients undergoing HCT. RESULTS: Considerable variability was observed in F-ara-ATP accumulation in HCT patients (10.5- and 12.5-fold in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, respectively), compared to healthy volunteers (1.6- and 1.9-fold in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, respectively). Larger variability was also observed in gene expression of transporters and enzymes involved in F-ara-ATP accumulation in HCT patients; however, F-ara-ATP accumulation was not correlated with gene expression, which is in agreement with previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitation of F-ara-ATP accumulation in T-lymphocytes provides a novel tool to evaluate patient sensitivity to fludarabine. This tool can be used in future studies to evaluate whether intracellular F-ara-ATP accumulation is associated with efficacy and/or toxicity in patients receiving fludarabine.","['Woodahl, Erica L', 'Wang, Joanne', 'Heimfeld, Shelly', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', ""O'Donnell, Paul V"", 'Phillips, Brian', 'Risler, Linda', 'Blough, David K', 'McCune, Jeannine S']","['Woodahl EL', 'Wang J', 'Heimfeld S', 'Sandmaier BM', ""O'Donnell PV"", 'Phillips B', 'Risler L', 'Blough DK', 'McCune JS']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080409,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use']",2008/04/10 09:00,2009/01/21 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-008-0748-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2009 Feb;63(3):391-401. doi: 10.1007/s00280-008-0748-0.

In this report we have investigated the importance of CR deaminase with respect to the antineoplastic action of inhibitors of DNA methylation, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR) and zebularine. Zebularine has a dual mechanism of action, since it can also inhibit CR deaminase. The objective of our study was to investigate the importance of zebularine as an inhibitor of CR deaminase with respect to the antineoplastic action of 5-AZA-CdR. Using an in vitro clonogenic assay, we investigated the antineoplastic action of 5-AZA-CdR and zebularine, alone and in combination on wild type 3T3 murine fibroblasts and corresponding V5 cells transduced with CR deaminase gene to express a very high level of CR deaminase activity. The V5 cells were much less sensitive to 5-AZA-CdR than the wild type 3T3 cells. The addition of zebularine significantly enhanced the antineoplastic action of 5-AZA-CdR on V5 cells, but not 3T3 cells. Enzymatic analysis on CR deaminase purified from the V5 cells showed that zebularine is a competitive inhibitor of the deamination of 5-AZA-CdR. These in vitro observations are in accord with our in vivo study in mice with L1210 leukemia, which showed that zebularine increased the antileukemic activity of 5-AZA-CdR. Pharmacokinetic analysis also showed that zebularine increased the plasma level of 5-AZA-CdR during an i.v. infusion in mice. Our results indicate that the major mechanism by which zebularine enhances the antineoplastic action of 5-AZA-CdR is by inhibition of CR deaminase. These findings provide a rationale to investigate 5-AZA-CdR in combination with zebularine in patients with advanced leukemia.","['Lemaire, Maryse', 'Momparler, Louise F', 'Raynal, Noel J-M', 'Bernstein, Mark L', 'Momparler, Richard L']","['Lemaire M', 'Momparler LF', 'Raynal NJ', 'Bernstein ML', 'Momparler RL']","['Departement de Pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080409,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '7A9Y5SX0GY (pyrimidin-2-one beta-ribofuranoside)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",2008/04/10 09:00,2009/01/21 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-008-0750-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2009 Feb;63(3):411-6. doi: 10.1007/s00280-008-0750-6.

They are markedly diminished in number in patients who fail to control the virus, but the mechanisms resulting in their depletion remain ill defined. Here, we dissected the defective HBV-specific CD8(+) T cell response associated with chronic HBV infection by gene expression profiling. We found that HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells from patients with different clinical outcomes could be distinguished by their patterns of gene expression. Microarray analysis revealed that overlapping clusters of functionally related apoptotic genes were upregulated in HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells from patients with chronic compared with resolved infection. Further analysis confirmed that levels of the proapoptotic protein Bcl2-interacting mediator (Bim) were upregulated in HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells from patients with chronic HBV infection. Blocking Bim-mediated apoptosis enhanced recovery of HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells both in culture and directly ex vivo. Consistent with evidence that Bim mediates apoptosis of CD8(+) T cells expressing low levels of CD127 (IL-7R), the few surviving HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells were CD127(hi )and had elevated levels of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl1, suggesting they were amenable to IL-7-mediated rescue from apoptosis.

However, methotrexate has been associated with neurological problems such as declines in cognitive and academic abilities. The purpose of this study was to investigate methotrexate-induced changes in beta-oxidation in children with ALL receiving methotrexate for CNS treatment. Specific aims were to investigate effects of methotrexate on beta-oxidation of the two most prevalent fatty acids (palmitic acid and stearic acid) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and correlate the ratio of monounsaturation to saturation of these fatty acids with cognitive and academic abilities. The sample included 12 females and 14 males with low-risk (n = 7), standard-risk ( n = 13), or high-risk (n = 6) ALL. Mean age at diagnosis was 94.1 months (SD = 34.4). CSF samples were obtained in conjunction with diagnostic lumbar punctures; subsequent samples were obtained prior to intrathecal methotrexate administration during the induction, consolidation, and continuation phases of treatment. Fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography. Results showed a significant increase in the ratio of monounsaturation to saturation of both fatty acids, which was greatest during the most intensive phase of treatment. Ratios of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids were negatively correlated with full-scale IQ, verbal IQ, and math calculations. Findings suggest that methotrexate alters beta-oxidation and that the resulting increase in fatty acid monounsaturation is related to declines in some domains of cognitive ability.","['Moore, Ida M Ki', 'Miketova, Petra', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn', 'Krull, Kevin', 'Pasvogel, Alice', 'Carey, Marissa', 'Kaemingk, Kris']","['Moore IM', 'Miketova P', 'Hockenberry M', 'Krull K', 'Pasvogel A', 'Carey M', 'Kaemingk K']","['College of Nursing, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721-0203, USA. kmoore@nursing.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Biol Res Nurs,Biological research for nursing,9815758,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Stearic Acids)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Cognition Disorders/cerebrospinal fluid/*chemically induced/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'NAD/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', '*Palmitic Acid/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', '*Stearic Acids/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['9/4/311 [pii]', '10.1177/1099800407313268 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Res Nurs. 2008 Apr;9(4):311-9. doi: 10.1177/1099800407313268.,,,10.1177/1099800407313268 [doi],,,,,,"['R01 HD037816/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NR004905/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'NR 04905/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 37816/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The ALL-96 protocol was addressed to compare the toxicity and results of a pediatric-based protocol in adolescents (age 15-18 years) and young adults (age 19-30 years) with standard-risk (SR) ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adolescents (n = 35) and young adults (n = 46) received a standard five-drug/5-week induction course followed by two cycles of early consolidation, maintenance with monthly reinforcement cycles up to 1 year in continuous complete remission (CR) and 1 year with standard maintenance chemotherapy up to 2 years in CR. RESULTS: Adolescents and young adults were comparable in the main pretreatment ALL characteristics. The CR rate was 98% and. after a median follow-up of 4.2 years, 6-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 61% (95% CI, 51% to 72%) and 69% (95% CI, 59% to 79%), respectively, with no differences between adolescents and young adults. The hematologic toxicity in consolidation and reinforcement cycles was higher in young adults than in adolescents. Slow response to induction therapy was the only parameter associated with poor EFS (34% v 67%) and OS (40% v 76%). CONCLUSION: The response to the pediatric ALL-96 protocol was identical in adolescents and young adults despite a slight increase in hematologic toxicity observed in adults. This justifies the age-unrestricted use of pediatric regimens to treat patients with SR ALL.","['Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Sanz, Miguel-Angel', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Fernandez-Abellan, Pascual', 'del Potro, Eloy', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Bueno, Javier', 'Parody, Ricardo', 'Bastida, Pilar', 'Grande, Carlos', 'Heras, Inmaculada', 'Bethencourt, Concepcion', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'Ortega, Juan-Jose']","['Ribera JM', 'Oriol A', 'Sanz MA', 'Tormo M', 'Fernandez-Abellan P', 'del Potro E', 'Abella E', 'Bueno J', 'Parody R', 'Bastida P', 'Grande C', 'Heras I', 'Bethencourt C', 'Feliu E', 'Ortega JJ']","[""Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, C/ Canyet S/N, 08916 Badalona, Spain. jribera@iconcologia.net""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Infections/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/11/1843 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.13.7265 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Apr 10;26(11):1843-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.7265.,,,10.1200/JCO.2007.13.7265 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A relationship between expression of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, and resistance to ABT-737 has been reported for various cancers. The synthetic cytotoxic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR) is known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS have been shown to activate c-Jun kinase (JNK), which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits Mcl-1. Thus, we investigated whether 4-HPR-mediated inactivation of Mcl-1 could act synergistically with ABT-737 to promote leukemia cell death. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was determined using the fluorescence-based DIMSCAN assay. Synergy was defined as a combination index (CIN) less than 1. The expression of Bcl-2 family messenger RNAs was measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and caspase activity was measured enzymatically. Changes in Bcl-2 family proteins and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c were detected by immunoblotting. ROS, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and phospho-JNK were measured by flow cytometry. Gene silencing was by small interfering RNA (siRNA). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: ABT-737 decreased Mcl-1 protein expression in ABT-737-sensitive ALL cell lines but not in ABT-737-resistant lines. Using the antioxidant ascorbic acid and siRNA-mediated knockdown of JNK, we showed that 4-HPR decreased Mcl-1 via ROS generation (that phosphorylates JNK) in ABT-737-resistant cell lines. Combining ABT-737 with 4-HPR enhanced the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade (percentage of cells with depolarized mitochondrial membrane at 6 hours, ABT-737 vs ABT-737 plus 4-HPR: 24.5% vs 45.5%, difference = 20.1%, 95% CI = 18.9% to 13.9%; P < .001) and caused caspase-dependent, synergistic multilog cytotoxicity in all seven ALL cell lines examined (mean CIN = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.37 to 0.87), with minimal cytotoxicity for normal lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: An increase of Mcl-1 protein in response to ABT-737 is one mechanism of ABT-737 resistance that can be overcome by 4-HPR, resulting in synergistic cytotoxicity of ABT-737 combined with 4-HPR in ALL cell lines.","['Kang, Min H', 'Wan, Zesheng', 'Kang, Yun Hee', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Reynolds, C Patrick']","['Kang MH', 'Wan Z', 'Kang YH', 'Sposto R', 'Reynolds CP']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, USC-CHLA Institute for Pediatric Clinical Research, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. mkang@chla.usc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080408,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Mitochondrial Membranes', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/05/13 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['djn076 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djn076 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2008 Apr 16;100(8):580-95. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djn076.

Median age was 33 years (range, 16-59 years). A total of 50% had a white blood cell count (WBC) more than 30 x 10(9)/L, 18% extramedullary disease, 42% achieved CR more than 8 weeks from diagnosis, 25% had adverse cytogenetics, and 19% had T-cell leukemia. A total of 41% were HLA well-matched, 41% partially matched with their donors, and 18% were HLA-mismatched. At 54-month median follow-up, incidences of acute grade 2-IV, III to IV, and chronic graft-versus-host disease were 50%, 25%, and 43%, respectively. Five-year treatment-related mortality (TRM), relapse, and overall survival were 42%, 20%, and 39%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, TRM was significantly higher with HLA-mismatched donors and T-cell depletion. Relapse risk was higher if the diagnostic WBC was more than 100 x 10(9)/L. Factors associated with poorer survival included WBC more than 100 x 10(9)/L, more than 8 weeks to CR1, cytomegalovirus seropositivity, HLA mismatching, and T-cell depletion. Nearly 40% of adults with ALL in CR1 survive 5 years after URD transplantation. Relapse risks were modest; TRM is the major cause of treatment failure.

Without detailed biological information on the genes involved, the evaluation of the number of clusters becomes difficult, and we have to rely on an internal measure that is based on the distribution of the data of the clustering result. The Gap statistic has been proposed as a superior method for estimating the number of clusters in crisp clustering. In this study, we proposed a modified Fuzzy Gap statistic (MFGS) and applied it to fuzzy k-means clustering. For estimating the number of clusters, fuzzy k-means clustering with the MFGS was applied to two artificial data sets with noise and to two experimentally observed gene expression data sets. For the artificial data sets, compared with other internal measures, the MFGS showed a higher performance in terms of robustness against noise for estimating the optimal number of clusters. Moreover, it could be used to estimate the optimal number of clusters in experimental data sets.

As more patients have undergone therapy, the development of molecular and clinical resistance to imatinib has raised further therapeutic challenges. The 2 main approaches to overcoming resistance are imatinib dose escalation and the use of alternative more potent TKIs, such as dasatinib or nilotinib. The phase II SRC/ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Activity Research Trials (START) of dasatinib have established dasatinib as potent and effective in overcoming imatinib resistance or intolerance in all phases of CML. The most recent treatment guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network now contain recommendations for using dasatinib in this setting. The issue of when to change from imatinib to an alternative agent in preference to imatinib dose escalation is keenly debated, particularly as new clinical evidence emerges, which highlights the importance of achieving early cytogenetic and molecular responses for a good long-term outcome. Identifying patients in whom a change to dasatinib or nilotinib is more appropriate than imatinib dose escalation is therefore important.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J']","['The University of Texas M.

However, for patients with advanced CML (accelerated and blast phases), the efficacy of all current therapies is reduced. For these patients, allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the preferred treatment if a donor is available, although TKIs play a valuable role as a bridging therapy. For patients with accelerated-phase CML, imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib have been shown to produce meaningful rates of hematologic and cytogenetic response. Imatinib and dasatinib are also approved for blast-phase CML. Studies with the newer agents have involved heavily pretreated patients; however, response rates have been at least comparable to those achieved with imatinib in previous studies. Therefore, these newer, more potent TKIs will probably be more likely to induce a deep response in previously untreated patients. Moreover, because fewer mechanisms appear to exist for secondary resistance to dasatinib and nilotinib, reducing the potential for disease to escape TKI therapy, these agents may result in improved longer-term outcomes. However, BCR-ABL-independent pathways may also become more important, indicating that other therapeutic targets may also have a future role in managing patients with advanced CML.","['Shah, Neil P']",['Shah NP'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143, USA. nshah@medicine.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",2008/08/09 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/08/09 09:00'],"['2008/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2008 Mar;6 Suppl 2:S31-S36.,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dasatinib has been investigated in patients who were resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Switching to dasatinib, 70 mg, twice daily has been shown to be more effective than high-dose imatinib. Another study found that dasatinib, 100 mg, once daily was just as effective as the twice-daily regimen but was better tolerated. Nilotinib is also effective in most patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib and is associated with minimal toxicity. Other inhibitors, such as bosutinib and INNO-406, are being developed with favorable early results. New drugs are still needed, particularly for individuals who are resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors or those with the T3151 mutation.

As a consequence of the success of imatinib, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) has moved from the first-line indication to an option that is usually considered for patients without optimal response to imatinib or those for whom treatment with imatinib has failed. First-line use of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), with or without cytarabine or hydroxyurea, is now rarely considered. Most patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML experience complete cytogenetic responses during imatinib treatment, but continued treatment is necessary to prevent cytogenetic or molecular relapse. Cumulative evidence with imatinib and IFN-alpha show that experiencing early and deep responses is important in preventing progression to more advanced phases of the disease. These features emphasize the need to carefully monitor patients for residual disease and provide guidance on treatment options in the event of imatinib intolerance or failure.

However, functional consequences of the JAK3 mutations in TMD patients remain undetermined. To further understand how JAK3 mutations are involved in the development and/or progression of leukaemia in Down syndrome, additional TMD patients and the DS-AMKL cell line MGS were screened for JAK3 mutations, and we examined whether each JAK3 mutation is an activating mutation. JAK3 mutations were not detected in 10 TMD samples that had not previously been studied. Together with our previous report we detected JAK3 mutations in one in 11 TMD patients. Furthermore, this study showed for the first time that a TMD patient-derived JAK3 mutation (JAK3(I87T)), as well as two novel JAK3 mutations (JAK3(Q501H) and JAK3(R657Q)) identified in an MGS cell line, were activating mutations. Treatment of MGS cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing the JAK3 mutants with JAK3 inhibitors significantly decreased their growth and viability. These results suggest that the JAK3 activating mutation is an early event during leukaemogenesis in Down syndrome, and they provide proof-of-principle evidence that JAK3 inhibitors would have therapeutic effects on TMD and DS-AMKL patients carrying activating JAK3 mutations.","['Sato, Tomohiko', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Kanezaki, Rika', 'Xu, Gang', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu', 'Miura, Masayoshi', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Migita, Masahiro', 'Morinaga, Shingo', 'Nakano, Takahide', 'Endo, Mikiya', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Mano, Hiroyuki', 'Ito, Etsuro']","['Sato T', 'Toki T', 'Kanezaki R', 'Xu G', 'Terui K', 'Kanegane H', 'Miura M', 'Adachi S', 'Migita M', 'Morinaga S', 'Nakano T', 'Endo M', 'Kojima S', 'Kiyoi H', 'Mano H', 'Ito E']","['Department of Paediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080407,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (WHI P131)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7081 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07081.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 May;141(5):681-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07081.x.

The germline origin of UD was demonstrated in one case for which a matched normal sample was available. Overall analysis of LOH showed that identical loci were recurrently targeted in chromosomes 1, 2 and 6. As a whole, however, HCL showed a remarkably stable genome. This finding adds to several other features that are unique to HCL among mature B-cell tumours.","['Forconi, Francesco', 'Poretti, Giulia', 'Kwee, Ivo', 'Sozzi, Elisa', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Rancoita, Paola M V', 'Capello, Daniela', 'Rinaldi, Andrea', 'Zucca, Emanuele', 'Raspadori, Donatella', 'Spina, Valeria', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Bertoni, Francesco']","['Forconi F', 'Poretti G', 'Kwee I', 'Sozzi E', 'Rossi D', 'Rancoita PM', 'Capello D', 'Rinaldi A', 'Zucca E', 'Raspadori D', 'Spina V', 'Lauria F', 'Gaidano G', 'Bertoni F']","['Sezione Ematologia e Trapianti, Universita di Siena, Italy. forconif@unisi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080407,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (FGF12 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Fingerprinting/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2008/04/10 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7106 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07106.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 May;141(5):622-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07106.x.

For this purpose, 10 pregnant bitches were ovariohysterectomized between days 10 and 12 after mating. Four non-pregnant bitches served as controls. Early pregnancy was verified by flushing the uterine horns with PBS solution. The collected embryos (n = 60) were stored deep-frozen (-80 degrees C). Uterine tissue was excised, snaps frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized using TRI Reagent. All embryos from one litter were thawed together and also homogenized in TRI Reagent. RT-PCR was performed to prove mRNA expression of progesterone receptor, key enzymes of the prostaglandin synthesis pathway, selected growth factors, cytokines, immune cell receptors, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP). Only pregnant uteri revealed the presence of mRNA for interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-4 and CD-8, which resembles the milieu in humans and other mammalians. Similarly, in day 10 embryos, mRNA for transforming growth factor-beta, insulin-like growth factor-1,-2, hepatocyte growth factor, leukaemia inhibitor factor, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta,-6,-8, cyclooxygenase-2, CD4(+) cells, and MMP-2 and -9 were detected, but not MHC-I or -II. We therefore suppose that the canine embryo, like its human counterpart, actively initiates measures to prevent attacks from the maternal immune system to prepare its own adhesion, nidation, growth and further development.","['Schafer-Somi, S', 'Beceriklisoy, H B', 'Budik, S', 'Kanca, H', 'Aksoy, O A', 'Polat, B', 'Cetin, Y', 'Ay, S S', 'Aslan, S']","['Schafer-Somi S', 'Beceriklisoy HB', 'Budik S', 'Kanca H', 'Aksoy OA', 'Polat B', 'Cetin Y', 'Ay SS', 'Aslan S']","['Centre for Artificial Insemination and Embryo Transfer, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. sabine.schaefer@vu-wien.ac.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080407,Germany,Reprod Domest Anim,Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,9015668,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Dogs/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/immunology/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hysterectomy/veterinary', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Ovariectomy/veterinary', 'Placentation/immunology/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/genetics', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2008/04/10 09:00,2009/03/26 09:00,['2008/04/10 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['RDA966 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.00966.x [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Domest Anim. 2008 Dec;43(6):656-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.00966.x.

METHODS: ESCALE included all children in France less than 15 years old with a diagnosis of acute leukaemia, lymphoma, malignant CNS tumor, or neuroblastoma (2003-2004). In all, 209 malignant CNS tumor cases (80% of the eligible cases) and 1681 population-based controls (71%) were included using quotas ensuring frequency matching with the cases by age and gender. Case and control mothers were interviewed using a standardised telephone interview, which elicited birth characteristics, congenital malformation, maternal reproductive history, and use of assisted reproductive technologies for the index child. RESULTS: The cases and controls did not differ in terms of gestational age at birth, birth weight, birth order, breastfeeding, or parental age at birth. There was no association between assisted reproduction for the index child and malignant CNS tumor (OR=1.1 [0.6-2.2]). A positive association between a maternal history of one miscarriage and malignant CNS tumor was observed (OR=1.4 [1.0-2.0], p<0.05), especially for glial cell tumors (other glioma: OR=2.0 [1.1-3.6]).

This has raised intense interest in the elucidation of prognostic and predictive markers. A prognostic biomarker provides information about the patients overall cancer outcome, regardless of therapy, whilst a predictive biomarker gives information about the effect of a therapeutic intervention. A predictive biomarker can be a target for therapy. Amongst the genes that have proven to be of relevance are well-known markers such as ER, PR and HER2/neu in breast cancer, BCR-ABL fusion protein in chronic myeloid leukaemia, c-KIT mutations in GIST tumours and EGFR1 mutations in NSCLC. Several reasons for the difficult elucidation of new markers will be addressed including the involvement of cellular pathways in tumour biology instead of single genes and interference in disease outcome as a result of anticancer therapies. Future perspectives for the development of prognostic and predictive markers will be given.","['Oldenhuis, C N A M', 'Oosting, S F', 'Gietema, J A', 'de Vries, E G E']","['Oldenhuis CN', 'Oosting SF', 'Gietema JA', 'de Vries EG']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre Groningen, PO Box 30.001, 9700 RB Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080407,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(08)00233-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2008.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2008 May;44(7):946-53. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2008.03.006.

In many hematological malignancies, VEGF production is increased leading to cell survival responses. Herein, we demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces mRNA expression of VEGF in the multiple myeloma cell line, U266, the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, BJAB, and the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-like cell line, I-83. This increase in mRNA levels of VEGF corresponded with increased luciferase activity of the VEGF promoter in BJAB and I-83 cells and increased protein levels in I-83 cells. Secretion of VEGF was also increased in these cells following LPA treatment. LPA treatment also caused the activation of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. The increase in VEGF expression by LPA is mediated by the activation of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and transcription factor NFkappaB since blocking JNK or NFkappaB activation inhibited LPA induced VEGF expression. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that LPA protects cells from apoptosis and blocking activation of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 using a VEGF receptor kinase inhibitor prevented LPA survival responses. Knocking down expression of VEGFR1 and inhibiting activation of NFkappaB and JNK also blocked LPA induced protection against apoptosis. Taken together, this indicates that LPA contributes to VEGF production in B cell malignancies leading to cell survival.","['Hu, Xiaojie', 'Mendoza, Francisco J', 'Sun, Jinmie', 'Banerji, Versha', 'Johnston, James B', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Hu X', 'Mendoza FJ', 'Sun J', 'Banerji V', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson SB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080219,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'PG6M3969SG (lysophosphatidic acid)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*metabolism', 'Lysophospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/09/30 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(08)00064-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.02.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2008 Jun;20(6):1198-208. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.02.009.

We have demonstrated in this study that dasatinib is able to block the function of normal human T-lymphocytes in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. T-cell functions including proliferation, activation and cytokine production were all uniformly inhibited in the presence of dasatinib. We also demonstrated inhibition of TCR signalling through Src-family kinase LCK, and predicted that inhibition of LCK and other kinases involved in T-cell signalling by dasatinib is responsible for the suppression of T-cell function.

Donor bone marrow and mobilized peripheral stem cells are routinely employed for the reconstitution of immune function in leukemia and lymphoma patients following radiation and/or chemotherapy. Unfortunately, only 30% of patients have an HLA-identical sibling donor and the identification of matched unrelated donors, particularly for minorities, can present an exceptional challenge. The transplantation of umbilical cord blood (UCB) represents the most recent strategy to expand the potential donor pool while maintaining an acceptable level of treatment-related complications. First utilized in children, UCB transplantation permits a higher degree of HLA disparity while demonstrating a reduction in the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) compared to previous transplantation modalities. Despite the apparent decrease in GvHD, relapse rates remain comparable to transplantation with bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood suggesting a strong graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GvL) effect. However, several issues complicate the use of UCB transplantation and its extension to the treatment of adults. Many infections that afflict transplant patients are particularly frequent and more severe in the context of UCB transplantation. UCB T-cells are naive and therefore display less proliferation and IFN-gamma production in response to cognate antigen and also appear to demonstrate defects in signal transduction mechanisms. In addition, UCB contains T regulatory cells (Treg) with more potent suppressor function than adult Treg. Furthermore, adult patients often require more total cells and CD34+ progenitors for transplantation than a single UCB unit can provide. Thus, strategies to expand selected subpopulations from UCB and the use of multi-unit transplantation are areas of active research. This review will provide a condensed summary of the clinical history of UCB transplantation and emphasize the advantages and disadvantages of this approach to hematological malignancies in comparison to other methods of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Subsequently, it will mainly focus on the current challenges to immune reconstitution presented by UCB transplantation, recent research into their cellular and molecular mechanisms, and experimental approaches to overcome them.","['Brown, Julia A', 'Boussiotis, Vassiliki A']","['Brown JA', 'Boussiotis VA']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20080418,United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/07/08 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1521-6616(08)00043-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clim.2008.02.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2008 Jun;127(3):286-97. doi: 10.1016/j.clim.2008.02.008.

Identification of chemicals that trigger allergic asthma is difficult as underlying processes and specific markers have not yet been clearly defined. Moreover, adequate classification of the respiratory toxicity of chemicals is hampered due to the lack of validated in vivo and in vitro test methods. The study of differential gene expression profiles in appropriate human in vitro cell systems is a promising approach to identify selective markers for respiratory allergy. As alveolar macrophages display important immunological and inflammatory properties in response to foreign substances in the lung, we aimed at gaining more insight in changes of human macrophages transcriptome and to identify selective genetic markers for respiratory sensitization in response to hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). In vitro cultures of human THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages and exposed to 55 microg/ml HDI for 6 and 10h. Using human oligonucleotide microarrays, changes were observed in the expression of genes that are involved in diverse biological and molecular processes, including detoxification, oxidative stress, cytokine signaling, and apoptosis, which can lead to the development of asthma. These genes are possible markers for respiratory sensitization caused by isocyanates.","['Verstraelen, S', 'Wens, B', 'Hooyberghs, J', 'Nelissen, I', 'Witters, H', 'Schoeters, G', 'Cauwenberge, P Van', 'Heuvel, R Van Den']","['Verstraelen S', 'Wens B', 'Hooyberghs J', 'Nelissen I', 'Witters H', 'Schoeters G', 'Cauwenberge PV', 'Heuvel RV']","['Centre of Expertise in Environmental Toxicology, Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO NV), Boeretang 200, 2400 Mol, Belgium. sandra.verstraelen@vito.be <sandra.verstraelen@vito.be>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080304,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Cyanates)', '0 (Isocyanates)', '0I70A3I1UF (1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyanates/*toxicity', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isocyanates', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(08)00062-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2008.02.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2008 Jun;22(4):1107-14. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2008.02.015.

We have previously reported that ts1-mediated neuronal degeneration in mice has a multifactorial pathogenesis. Here, we report that in the ts1-infected central nervous system (CNS) activated neural cells showed intense immunoreactivity for pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF), neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75(NTR)), and sortilin in the areas showing spongiform changes. Since recent studies suggested that proNGF is more active than mature NGF in inducing neuronal death after binding to co-receptors p75(NTR)/sortilin, we hypothesized that overexpression of proNGF, sortilin and p75(NTR) play a role in ts1-induced neurodegeneration. We found that proNGF and p75(NTR), but not sortilin, mRNA and protein were significantly elevated in ts1-infected brainstem compared to non-infected control tissue. There was extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of p75(NTR), a marker for its activation, in ts1-infected brainstem with abundance in degenerating neurons. We explored whether the increase in the in vivo proNGF expression also occurs in cultured immortalized C1 astrocytes infected by ts1 virus. The proNGF level was significantly increased in infected C1 cells compared to control cells only after addition of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1). We also showed increased expression of FGF-1 in the CNS of ts1-infected mice. Our findings suggest that the FGF-1 signaling pathway may be responsible for the overexpression of proNGF in neural cells during pathogenesis of ts1-induced neurodegeneration.

The present study sought to design a novel strategy for releasing antibody-bound cells through electrochemical disruption of the underlying antibody (Ab) layer. A microsystem for selective capture and release of cells consisted of an array of individually addressable gold microelectrodes fabricated on a glass substrate. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel photolithography was employed to make the glass regions non-fouling, thus, ensuring selective localization of proteins and cells on the microelectrodes. The gold surfaces were decorated with anti-CD4 Ab molecules using standard alkanethiol self-assembly and carbodiimide coupling approaches. The Ab-functionalized electrodes selectively captured model T-lymphocytes (Molt-3 cells) expressing CD4 antigen while minimal cell adhesion was observed on PEG hydrogel-modified glass substrates. Importantly, application of a reductive potential (-1.2V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode) resulted in release of surface-bound T-cells from the electrode surface. Cyclic voltammetry and fluorescence microscopy were employed to verify that the detachment of captured T-cells was indeed due to the electrochemical disruption of the underlying alkanethiol-Ab layer. In the future, the cell sorting approach described here may be combined with microfluidic delivery to enable Ab-mediated capture of T-lymphocytes or other cell types followed by release of select cells for downstream gene expression studies or re-cultivation.","['Zhu, He', 'Yan, Jun', 'Revzin, Alexander']","['Zhu H', 'Yan J', 'Revzin A']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Davis, 451 East Health Sciences Street #2619, Davis, CA 95616, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080310,Netherlands,Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,"Colloids and surfaces.

MS-275 profoundly induced growth arrest of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) MOLM13 and biphenotypic leukemia MV4-11 cells, which possess internal tandem duplication mutation in the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene (FLT3-ITD), with IC50s less than 1 microM, as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay on day two of culture. Exposure of these cells to MS-275 decreased levels of total, as well as, phosphorylated forms of FLT3, resulting in inactivation of its downstream signal pathways, including Akt, ERK, and STAT5. Further studies found that MS-275 induced acetylation of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in conjunction with ubiquitination of FLT3, leading to degradation of FLT3 proteins in these cells. This was blunted by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, confirming that FLT was degraded via ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Moreover, we found that further inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling potentiated the action of MS-275 in leukemia cells. Taken together, MS-275 may be useful for treatment of individuals with leukemia possessing activating mutation of FLT3 gene.","['Nishioka, Chie', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Yang, Jing', 'Takeuchi, Seisho', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Nishioka C', 'Ikezoe T', 'Yang J', 'Takeuchi S', 'Koeffler HP', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080403,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '1ZNY4FKK9H (entinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genotype', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/07/25 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00097-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.02.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Sep;32(9):1382-92. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.02.018.

Therefore, new agents that act more selectively and more potently are required. In that line, we have recently characterized a novel diterpene ester, called 3-hydrogenkwadaphnin (3-HK), with capability to induce both differentiation and apoptosis in various leukemia cell lines. These effects of 3-HK were mediated through inhibition of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, a selective up-regulated enzyme in cancerous cells, especially leukemia. However, it remains elusive to understand how cells display different fates in response to 3-HK. Here, we report the distinct molecular signaling pathways involved in forcing of 3-HK-treated U937 cells to undergo differentiation and apoptosis. After 3-HK (15 nM) treatment, a portion of U937 cells adhered to the culture plates and showed macrophage criteria while others remained in suspension and underwent apoptosis. The differentiated cells arrested in G(0)/G(1) phase of cell cycle and showed early activation of ERK1/2 pathway (3 h) along with ERK-dependent p21(Cip/WAF1) (p21) up-regulation and expression of p27(Kip1) and Bcl-2. In contrast, the suspension cells underwent apoptosis through Fas/FasL and mitochondrial pathways. The occurrence of apoptosis in these cells were accompanied with caspase-8-mediated p21 cleavage and delayed activation (24 h) of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK. Taken together, these results suggest that distinct signaling pathways play a pivotal role in fates of drug-treated leukemia cells, thus this may pave some novel therapeutical utilities.","['Moosavi, Mohammad Amin', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh']","['Moosavi MA', 'Yazdanparast R']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, P.

Here we reported that STC2 expression was sporadically abrogated in human cancer cells by transcriptional silencing associated with CpG island promoter hypermethylation. Direct sequencing of bisulfite-modified DNA from a panel of seven human cancer cell lines revealed that CpG dinucleotides in STC2 promoter was methylated in human ovarian epithelial cancer (SKOV3, OVCAR3 and CaOV3), pancreatic cancer (BxP3), colon adenoma (HT29), and leukemia (Jurkat cells). STC2 CpG island hypermethylation was accompanied with a low basal STC2 expression level. Treatment of these cancer cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), an inhibitor of DNA methylation significantly induced STC2 expression. Using SKOV3 cells as a model, the link between DNA demethylation and STC2 expression was consistently demonstrated with hydralazine treatment, which was shown to reduce the protein level of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) but stimulated STC2 expression. Two human normal surface ovarian cell-lines (i.e. IOSE 29 and 398) showed no methylation at CpG dinucleotides in the examined promoter region and were accompanied with high basal STC2 levels. Hypoxia stimulated STC2 expression in SKOV3 cells was markedly increased in 5-aza-CdR pretreated cells, showing that DNA methylation may hinder the HIF-1 mediated activation. To elucidate this possibility, RNA interference studies confirmed that endogenous HIF-1 alpha was a key factor for STC2 gene activation as well as in the synergistic induction of STC2 expression in 5-aza-CdR pretreated cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated the binding of HIF-1 alpha to STC2 promoter. The binding was increased in 5-aza-CdR pretreated cells. Collectively, this is the first report to show that STC2 was aberrantly hypermethylated in human cancer cells. The findings demonstrated that STC2 epigenetic inactivation may interfere with HIF-1 mediated activation of STC2 expression.","['Law, Alice Y S', 'Lai, Keng P', 'Ip, Carman K M', 'Wong, Alice S T', 'Wagner, Graham F', 'Wong, Chris K C']","['Law AY', 'Lai KP', 'Ip CK', 'Wong AS', 'Wagner GF', 'Wong CK']","['Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080308,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (STC2 protein, human)', '26NAK24LS8 (Hydralazine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydralazine/pharmacology', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2007/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(08)00114-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2008 May 1;314(8):1823-30. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.03.001.

However, the exact molecular mechanism or mechanisms of the inhibitory effect were unclear. While SAMe is a methyl donor, MTA is an inhibitor of methylation. SAMe can convert to MTA spontaneously, so the effect of exogenous SAMe may be mediated by MTA. The aim of our current work is to examine whether the mechanism of SAMe and MTA's inhibitory effect on proinflammatory mediators might involve modulation of histone methylation. In RAW cells, we found that LPS induced TNFalpha expression by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. SAMe and MTA treatment inhibited the LPS-induced increase in gene transcription. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that LPS increased the binding of trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) to the TNFalpha promoter, and this was completely blocked by either SAMe or MTA pretreatment. Similar effects were observed with LPS-mediated induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). LPS increased the binding of histone methyltransferases Set1 and myeloid/lymphoid leukemia to these promoters, which was unaffected by SAMe or MTA. The effects of MTA in RAW cells were confirmed in vivo in LPS-treated mice. Exogenous SAMe is unstable and converts spontaneously to MTA, which is stable and cell-permeant. Treatment with SAMe doubled intracellular MTA and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels. SAH also inhibited H3K4 binding to TNFalpha and iNOS promoters. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of SAMe's pharmacologic inhibitory effect on proinflammatory mediators is mainly mediated by MTA and SAH at the level of histone methylation.","['Ara, Ainhoa Iglesias', 'Xia, Meng', 'Ramani, Komal', 'Mato, Jose M', 'Lu, Shelly C']","['Ara AI', 'Xia M', 'Ramani K', 'Mato JM', 'Lu SC']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, University of Southern California Research Center for Liver Diseases, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*therapeutic use', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hep.22231 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2008 May;47(5):1655-66. doi: 10.1002/hep.22231.,,,10.1002/hep.22231 [doi],PMC2408693,,,,,"['T32 AA007578/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA012677-05/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'AA12677/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AA007578-07/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AT001576/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK051719/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK48522/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA013847/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA012677/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK051719-11/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK51719/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AA13847/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AA07578/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'AT1576/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA013847-05/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AT001576-05/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK048522-139003/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK048522/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS49821'],,,,,,,,

Induction of p27 (CDKN1B) gene transcription by Forkhead box O proteins such as FOXO3a leads to growth arrest and apoptosis. Previously, we observed that B cell receptor (surface IgM) engagement of WEHI 231 immature B lymphoma cells with an anti-IgM antibody results in activation of FOXO3a, growth arrest and apoptosis. As ectopic c-Myc expression in these cells prevented anti-IgM induction of p27 and cell death, we hypothesized that c-Myc represses FOXO3a-mediated transcription. Here we show that c-Myc inhibits FOXO3a-mediated activation of the p27 promoter in multiple cell lines. The mechanism of this repression was explored using a combination of co-immunoprecipitation, oligonucleotide precipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. The studies demonstrate a functional association of FOXO3a and c-Myc on a proximal Forkhead binding element in the p27 promoter. This association involves the Myc box II domain of c-Myc and the N-terminal DNA-binding portion of FOXO3a. Analysis of publicly available microarray datasets showed an inverse pattern of c-MYC and p27 RNA expression in primary acute myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer and tongue squamous cell carcinoma samples. The inhibition of FOXO3a-mediated activation of the p27 gene by the high aberrant expression of c-Myc in many tumor cells likely contributes to their uncontrolled proliferation and invasive phenotype.","['Chandramohan, Vidyalakshmi', 'Mineva, Nora D', 'Burke, Brian', 'Jeay, Sebastien', 'Wu, Min', 'Shen, Jian', 'Yang, William', 'Hann, Stephen R', 'Sonenshein, Gail E']","['Chandramohan V', 'Mineva ND', 'Burke B', 'Jeay S', 'Wu M', 'Shen J', 'Yang W', 'Hann SR', 'Sonenshein GE']","['Department of Biochemistry, Boston University Medical School, 715 Albany Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*genetics/metabolism', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/10/16 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21765 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Aug 15;104(6):2091-106. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21765.,,,10.1002/jcb.21765 [doi],,,,,,"['P01 ES11624/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA36355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI07309/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We investigated the clinicopathological features of 30 CLCs and their relationship to HPCs. We evaluated the expression of hepatocytic markers (hepatocyte paraffin-1, canalicular polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen, and CD10), biliary/HPC markers (keratin [K]7, K19, and neural cell adhesion molecule), the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporters: multidrug resistance protein 1, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP3, and breast cancer resistance protein, using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. In addition, gene expression profiling of CLC was performed and compared with the profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with or without HPC features (K19 expression). In surrounding nontumoral tissue, K7-positive and K19-positive HPCs/ductular reaction were observed. More than 90% of the tumor was composed of CLC areas that showed small monotonous and/or anastomosing glands, strongly positive for K7 and K19. Especially at the tumor boundary, all cases showed a HCC-like trabecular area characterized by canalicular CD10/polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen expression, and submembranous K7 expression, similar to intermediate hepatocytes. K7-positive/K19-positive HPCs were also seen. Out of 30 cases, 19 showed papillary and/or clear glandular formation with mucin production, representing CC areas. These three different areas showed transitional zones with each other. We observed an increased expression of MRP1, MRP3, and breast cancer resistance protein in the tumor. Electron microscopy findings in HCC-like trabecular areas confirmed the presence of HPCs and intermediate hepatocytes. HPC markers, K7, K19, prominin-1, receptor for stem cell factor c-kit, octamer-4 transcription factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor were upregulated (P < 0.05), while albumin was downregulated in CLC (P = 0.007) toward K19-negative HCCs. Comparison of CLC with K19-positive HCCs indicated a high homology.

This retrospective cohort study was designed to identify risk factors for readmission during induction therapy, to assist with development of discharge guidelines. PROCEDURE: We reviewed the records of 142 consecutive children with newly diagnosed B-precursor ALL and found 129 eligible patients. Chi square, t-test, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to compare differences in absolute neutrophil count (ANC), NCI risk status, age, type of corticosteroid administered, and other potential risk factors for readmission during induction therapy. RESULTS: ANC at initial hospital discharge was the only significant predictor of readmission for fever during induction therapy (P = 0.006) by multivariate analysis. Specifically an ANC <or=200/mm(3) at discharge had the strongest association with readmission for fever (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.422, 7.729). CONCLUSION: An ANC >200/mm(3), in a clinically stable patient, is associated with minimal risk of readmission during induction therapy following the initial diagnosis of ALL.","['Slone, Tamra L', 'Rai, Rachna', 'Ahmad, Naveed', 'Winick, Naomi J']","['Slone TL', 'Rai R', 'Ahmad N', 'Winick NJ']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390-9063, USA. tamra.slone@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neutropenia', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Patient Discharge', '*Patient Readmission', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21553 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Sep;51(3):375-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21553.,,,10.1002/pbc.21553 [doi],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['KL2RR024983/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Sep;51(3):318-9.

METHODS: Conventional cytogenetics (CC) was carried out to detect the karyotypes. Meanwhile, three color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect the t(8;14)(q24;q32) in 17 newly diagnosed BL. RESULTS: The results showed that the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was 41.2% (7/17) by CC technique, including one of each for simple t(8;14)(q24;q32), complex chromosomal abnormality containing t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(8;22)(q24;q11), the complex chromosomal abnormality of t(12;22)(?;?), t(2;13)(?;?) with + 12, and one with two marker chromosomes. FISH method detected eight cases of t(8;14)(q24;q32), including the two detected by CC technique. Five samples (5/8) showed 2A1G1O2F (two blue, one green, one orange and two yellow signals in interphase nuclei), while three samples (3/8) showed 2A1G1O1F(two blue, one green, one orange and one yellow signals in interphase nuclei). CONCLUSION: Two different breakpoints have been identified on the c-Myc locus on 8q24. Interphase FISH was more sensitive in detecting t(8;14)(q24;q32), and it is an important complement to CC. It should be used as a routine method for diagnosis of BL.","['Xie, Xiaoyan', 'Xu, Wei', 'Qiu, Hairong']","['Xie X', 'Xu W', 'Qiu H']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210029 P.

In the present study, the histopathology of 240 layers, including 18 layers with subcutaneous neoplasms and 222 layers kept with the affected layers, was performed to clarify the characteristics of fowl glioma in layers. Microscopically, 103 layers showed non-suppurative encephalitis, and four layers had locally extensive proliferation or multiple nodules of astrocytes. Gliomas concurred in 11 layers with subcutaneous neoplasms and occurred independently in three layers. In addition, two layers had locally extensive proliferation of small, round cells in the cerebrum. The fowl glioma-inducing virus genome was not detected in the affected brains by nested polymerase chain reaction. Ten isolates were obtained from the affected brains. By nucleotide sequencing of the env gene, SU coding regions of these isolates were most closely related to myeloblastosis-associated virus-like viruses, but TM regions showed the highest similarity to endogenous viral (ev) loci. The genome of one isolate mainly consisted of ev loci and contained several parts of other avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses.

Associated downstream signaling events were also investigated. TA-induced cell death was prevented by the non-specific caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and reduced by the presence of the selective caspase inhibitors z-LEHD-fmk (caspase-9), z-DEVD-fmk (caspase-3) and z-VEID-fmk (caspase-6). The apoptotic effect of TA was associated with (i) the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria which was not accompanied by dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), (ii) the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway and (iii) abrogated by the over-expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L). TA-induced cell death was attenuated by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 with U0126 and inhibition of p38(MAPK) with SB203580. In contrast, inhibition of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) by SP600125 significantly enhanced apoptosis. Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased in response to TA, this did not seem to play a pivotal role in the apoptotic process since different anti-oxidants were unable to provide cell protection. The present study demonstrates that TA-induced cell death is mediated by an intrinsic-dependent apoptotic event involving mitochondria and MAPK, and through a mechanism independent of ROS generation.","['Torres, Fernando', 'Quintana, Jose', 'Diaz, Jesus G', 'Carmona, Armando J', 'Estevez, Francisco']","['Torres F', 'Quintana J', 'Diaz JG', 'Carmona AJ', 'Estevez F']","['Department of Biochemistry, Instituto Canario de Investigacion del Cancer (I.C.I.C.), University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, 35016, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (trifolin acetate)', '23627-87-4 (kaempferol-3-O-galactoside)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 6/*physiology', 'Galactosides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kaempferols/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-008-0202-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2008 May;13(5):716-28. doi: 10.1007/s10495-008-0202-0.,,,10.1007/s10495-008-0202-0 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are also the targets of several anticancer agents which indicating their importance in maintaining cell viability. Microtubular reorganization contributing to apoptotic morphology occurs in normal and neoplastic cells undergoing apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drugs. The aim of this study was to correlate the changes in the MT with behavior of the gamma-tubulin in apoptotic cell, and to see if apoptitic MT showed biochemical characteristics of stable MT. METHODS: Apoptosis was induced in the human leukemia cells (HL-60) by treatment with 1 microM of all-trans retinoic acid over a 5-day period. The time course of changes was assessed using flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation and immunocytochemistry in cells labeled for alpha-tubulins, acetylated alpha-tubulin and gamma-tubulin. RESULTS: The results indicated that gamma-tubulin content is increased after cells have gone through the apoptosis with a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern. Alpha-tubulin did not reveal any specific pattern of polymerization in apoptotic cells and acetylated alpha-tubulin content was also decreased in comparison with non-apoptotic cells. CONCLUSION: Our results support the idea that microtubule reorganization is an important factor of the mammalian cells response to apoptosis, and the altered properties of the MT did not reflect changes in function as apoptosis progresses.","['Ahmadian, Shahin', 'Pazhang, Yaghub', 'Shariftabrizi, Ahmad']","['Ahmadian S', 'Pazhang Y', 'Shariftabrizi A']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Iran,Iran Biomed J,Iranian biomedical journal,9814853,"['0 (Tubulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Acetylation', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microtubules/*chemistry', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tubulin/analysis']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Iran Biomed J. 2007 Oct;11(4):209-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Microtubule', 'gamma-tubulin', 'Immunocytochemistry']",

An earlier study discovered an oncogenic AKT1 gene mutation (AKT1 E17K) in breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers. The aim of this study was to see whether the AKT1 E17K mutation is common in breast, colorectal, lung, gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas and acute leukaemias. We analysed the presence of the AKT1 E17K mutation in 731 cancer tissues by a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. In addition, we analysed the corresponding sequences of AKT1 E17K in AKT2 and AKT3 genes. Overall, we detected the four AKT1 E17K mutations in the breast cancers (4/93; 4.3%), but none in other cancers. There was no AKT2 or AKT3 mutation in the cancers. This study demonstrated that the AKT1 E17K mutation occurs in breast cancers at a low frequency, and that it is rare in other common cancers, including colorectal, lung, gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas and acute leukaemias. Despite the confirmed oncogenic function of the AKT1 E17K, the rare incidences of the mutation suggest that it may not play a crucial role in the development of the most common types of human cancers.","['Kim, M S', 'Jeong, E G', 'Yoo, N J', 'Lee, S H']","['Kim MS', 'Jeong EG', 'Yoo NJ', 'Lee SH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080408,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenocarcinoma/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Lysine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['6604212 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604212 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2008 May 6;98(9):1533-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604212.

At both visits, parents completed before and after treatment visual analog scales (VAS) of their child's relaxation, well-being, vitality, anxiety, stress, and depression; patients' heart rates were monitored during treatments to calculate HRV. The 47 patients with complete VAS data and 34 patients with usable HRV data were similar. At baseline, VAS scores for negative states were low (average <2.5 of 10) and positive states were high (average 7> of 10). Relaxation improved more with music than rest (p < 0.01).

As these are potentially immunogenic in man, human proteins are preferred for the long-term treatment of cancer.

The bacterially expressed IT is composed of a humanized anti-CD64 single chain fragment [h22(scFv)] genetically fused to the human RNase angiogenin. As angiogenin lacks a dedicated translocation domain responsible for the higher potency of bacterial and plant-derived toxins, we have incorporated a recombinant adapter that contains a synthetic translocation domain flanked by proteolytically cleavable endosomal and cytosolic consensus sites. Although insertion of the adapter increased the cytotoxicity by up to 20-fold, serum stability was markedly reduced. Therefore, we designed a modified adapter variant with the endosomal-cleavable peptide deleted.

Furthermore, there exists a general lack of consensus as to which measures are best suited to assess changes in HRQL in this population. The purpose of this study is to compare the responsiveness of 3 pediatric HRQL measures: the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), the Child's Health Questionnaire (CHQ), and the Health Utilities Index (HUI). METHODS: Consecutive pediatric oncology patients and their parents completed the questionnaires at 1-week intervals for a total of 4 weeks, starting on the third day of the patient's chemotherapy treatment cycle. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled with the majority (62%) having a diagnosis of leukemia with an average age of 9 years. The parent proxy reports from time 1 to 4 showed a mean change in the PedsQL of 17 for the generic core scale and 12 for the cancer specific module. The mean change in CHQ physical functioning scale was 6, while the psychosocial scale was only 2, while the HUI 2 was 3 (x100), and HUI 3 was 4 (x100). There was significantly more change in the PedsQL generic scores when compared with the HUI 2 and 3 and the CHQ psychosocial scale (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: When measuring HRQL repeatedly in a heterogeneous population, the PedsQL is the measure most responsive to change.","['Banks, Brie Ann', 'Barrowman, Nicholas J', 'Klaassen, Robert']","['Banks BA', 'Barrowman NJ', 'Klaassen R']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Personality Inventory', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181647bda [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2008 Apr;30(4):292-7. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181647bda.,,,10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181647bda [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cranial sensory ganglia, Tlx3 is highly expressed in differentiating neurons during early embryogenesis. To study a role of Tlx3 during neural differentiation, mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were transfected with a Tlx3 expression vector. ES cells stably expressing Tlx3 were grown in the presence or absence of a neural induction medium. In undifferentiated ES cells, there was no significant difference in gene expression in the presence or absence of Tlx3, even after ES cells were cultured for an extensive time period. In contrast, expression levels of Mash1, Ngn1, and NeuroD were significantly higher in Tlx3-expressing cells after neural induction for 4 days compared with those in cells expressing the control vector. At 7 days after neural induction, whereas expression of the proneural genes was down-regulated, VGLUT2, GluR2, and GluR4 were significantly increased in ES cell-derived neurons expressing Tlx3. The sequential and coordinated expression of the proneural and neuronal subtype-specific genes identifies Tlx3 as a selector gene in ES cells undergoing neural differentiation. In addition, the differential effects of Tlx3 overexpression in undifferentiated ES cells compared with ES cell-derived neurons suggest that Tlx3 exerts context-dependent transcriptional signals on its downstream target genes. The context-dependent function of Tlx3 as a selector gene may be used to establish a novel strategy to conditionally generate excitatory glutamatergic neurons from ES cells to cure various types of neurodegenerative disorders.","['Kondo, Takako', 'Sheets, Patrick L', 'Zopf, David A', 'Aloor, Heather L', 'Cummins, Theodore R', 'Chan, Rebecca J', 'Hashino, Eri']","['Kondo T', 'Sheets PL', 'Zopf DA', 'Aloor HL', 'Cummins TR', 'Chan RJ', 'Hashino E']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080407,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Ascl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, AMPA)', '0 (Slc17a6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tlx3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Vesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 2)', '0 (glutamate receptor ionotropic, AMPA 4)', '169238-82-8 (Neurogenic differentiation factor 1)', '182238-50-2 (Neurog1 protein, mouse)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'P6W5IXV8V9 (glutamate receptor ionotropic, AMPA 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Receptors, AMPA/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Vesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 2/genetics']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/06/14 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['0708704105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0708704105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Apr 15;105(15):5780-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0708704105.

However, the mechanisms underlying apoptotic rescue are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that eIF4E overexpression leads to enhanced survival signaling through Akt and that eIF4E requires Akt1 to rescue serum-deprived fibroblasts. Furthermore, a mutant form of eIF4E (W73A), which is messenger RNA (mRNA) export competent but does not promote translation, rescues cells as readily as wild-type eIF4E. We show that eIF4E mediates Akt activation via up-regulation of Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1), a phosphoinositide-3 kinase-Akt pathway upstream activator. Additionally, eIF4E coordinately up-regulates the expression of downstream effectors of the Akt pathway, thereby amplifying Akt signaling effects. A negative regulator of eIF4E, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), suppresses Akt activation and apoptotic rescue. These PML activities likely arise, at least in part, through its inhibition of eIF4E-mediated NBS1 mRNA export. In summary, eIF4E coordinately regulates gene expression to potentiate Akt activation, an activity required for apoptotic rescue.","['Culjkovic, Biljana', 'Tan, Keith', 'Orolicki, Slobodanka', 'Amri, Abdellatif', 'Meloche, Sylvain', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Culjkovic B', 'Tan K', 'Orolicki S', 'Amri A', 'Meloche S', 'Borden KL']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H4M 1J6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Serum/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', '*Up-Regulation']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200707018 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200707018 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2008 Apr 7;181(1):51-63. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200707018.,,,10.1083/jcb.200707018 [doi],PMC2287285,,,,,"['R01 80728/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 98571/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Results from a previous study from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 8541) demonstrated an interaction between ErbB-2 and increasing dose of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) chemotherapy. Other studies have suggested that evaluation of the phosphorylated/activated form of ErbB-2 might be more precise in defining the impact of ErbB-2 in breast cancer. We have evaluated tumor tissue sections from CALGB 8541 patients to determine whether the interaction of ErbB-2 with CAF dose is dependent on ErbB-2 activation state, and whether phosphorylated ErbB-2 is an adverse prognostic factor in patients treated with CAF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to one of three dosing regimens of CAF. Paraffin samples from 992 of 1,572 patients who participated in CALGB 8541 were available. Of the 570 tumors with any staining for ErbB-2, 488 had tissue available for assay for phosphorylated ErbB-2, which was performed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Of 910 total assessable cases, 112 of 488 ErbB-2-positive cases (23%) stained positively for phosphorylated ErbB-2. The previously described interaction of dosing regimen of CAF with ErbB-2 was not dependent on phosphorylation status of ErbB-2. CONCLUSION: Monitoring phosphorylation of ErbB-2 with an antiphospho-ErbB-2 antibody did not add further precision to identifying those patients most likely to benefit from increased dose of anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Favorable outcomes are observed in ErbB-2-overexpressing patients treated with high-dose CAF regardless of ErbB-2 phosphorylation state.","['DiGiovanna, Michael P', 'Stern, David F', 'Edgerton, Susan', 'Broadwater, Gloria', 'Dressler, Lynn G', 'Budman, Daniel R', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Norton, Larry', 'Liu, Edison T', 'Muss, Hyman B', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Hayes, Daniel F', 'Thor, Ann D']","['DiGiovanna MP', 'Stern DF', 'Edgerton S', 'Broadwater G', 'Dressler LG', 'Budman DR', 'Henderson IC', 'Norton L', 'Liu ET', 'Muss HB', 'Berry DA', 'Hayes DF', 'Thor AD']","['Yale University School of Medicine, Section of Medical Oncology, 333 Cedar St, Room WWW 217, New Haven, CT 06510, USA. michael.digiovanna@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080407,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.13.6580 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.13.6580 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 10;26(14):2364-72. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.6580.

RESULTS: The different diagnosis included anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL; n = 27), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS; n = 27), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL; n = 11), hepatosplenic gamma/delta lymphoma (HSL; n = 3), T-cell granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-GLL; n = 1), nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (nasal-NK/L; n = 3) or non-nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (non-nasal-NK/L; n = 2), enteropathy-type T-cell (n = 1), and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 lymphoma (n = 2). Fifty-seven patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched in 70 cases and related in 60 cases. Thirty-one patients were in complete remission (CR) at the time of alloSCT, whereas 26 were in partial response (PR). Five-year toxicity-related mortality (TRM) incidence was 33% (95% CI, 24% to 46%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 57% (95% CI, 45% to 68%) and 53% (95% CI, 41% to 64%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, chemoresistant disease (stable, refractory, or progressing disease) at the time of alloSCT and the occurrence of severe grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) were the strongest adverse prognostic factors for OS (P = .03 and .03, respectively). Disease status at transplantation significantly influenced the 5-year EFS (P = .003), and an HLA-mismatched donor increased TRM (P = .04).

We demonstrate in this study that hematopoietic cells from KLF4(-/-) fetal livers (FL) contained normal numbers of functional hematopoietic progenitor cells, were radioprotective, and performed as well as KLF4(+/+) cells in competitive repopulation assays. However, hematopoietic ""KLF4(-/-) chimeras"" generated by transplantation of KLF4(-/-) fetal livers cells into lethally irradiated wild-type mice completely lacked circulating inflammatory (CD115(+)Gr1(+)) monocytes, and had reduced numbers of resident (CD115(+)Gr1(-)) monocytes. Although the numbers and function of peritoneal macrophages were normal in KLF4(-/-) chimeras, bone marrow monocytic cells from KLF4(-/-) chimeras expressed lower levels of key trafficking molecules and were more apoptotic. Thus, our in vivo loss-of-function studies demonstrate that KLF4, previously shown to mediate proinflammatory signaling in human macrophages in vitro, is essential for differentiation of mouse inflammatory monocytes, and is involved in the differentiation of resident monocytes. In addition, inducible expression of KLF4 in the HL60 human acute myeloid leukemia cell line stimulated monocytic differentiation and enhanced 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induced macrophage differentiation, but blocked all-trans-retinoic acid induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells. The inflammation-selective effects of loss-of-KLF4 and the gain-of-KLF4-induced monocytic differentiation in HL60 cells identify KLF4 as a key regulator of monocytic differentiation and a potential target for translational immune modulation.","['Alder, Jonathan K', 'Georgantas, Robert W 3rd', 'Hildreth, Richard L', 'Kaplan, Ian M', 'Morisot, Sebastien', 'Yu, Xiaobing', 'McDevitt, Michael', 'Civin, Curt I']","['Alder JK', 'Georgantas RW 3rd', 'Hildreth RL', 'Kaplan IM', 'Morisot S', 'Yu X', 'McDevitt M', 'Civin CI']","['Divisions of Immunology and Hematopoiesis, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/07/02 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['180/8/5645 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.180.8.5645 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Apr 15;180(8):5645-52. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.180.8.5645.,,,,PMC3074963,,,,,"['P01 CA070970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA070970-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA070970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS283124'],,,,,,,,

We have used mice infected with Friend virus as a model to study immunotherapeutic approaches to the cure of chronic retroviral infections. In chronic Friend virus infections CD4(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells suppress CD8(+) T cell effector functions critical for virus clearance. In this study, we demonstrate that immunotherapy with a combination of agonistic anti-CD137 Ab and virus-specific, TCR-transgenic CD8(+) T cells produced greater than 99% reductions of virus levels within 2 wk. In vitro studies indicated that the CD137-specific Ab rendered the CD8(+) T cells resistant to Treg cell-mediated suppression with no direct effect on the suppressive function of the Treg cells. By 2 weeks after transfer, the adoptively transferred CD8(+) T cells were lost, likely due to activation-induced cell death. The highly focused immunological pressure placed on the virus by the single specificity CD8(+) T cells led to the appearance of escape variants, indicating that broader epitope specificity will be required for long-term virus control.

Recent reports suggest that these cells have the ability to regain pluripotent properties. Here, we show that expression of the pluripotency marker undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1 (UTF1) is restricted to distinct germ cells within the testis. In embryonic and neonatal testes, all gonocytes were found to strongly express UTF1. During further testicular development, expression of UTF1 was restricted to a subset of A spermatogonia and with the increase in age the number of cells expressing UTF1 decreased even more. Ultimately, in the adult rat testis, only a small subset of the A spermatogonia expressed UTF1. Remarkably, even in testes of vitamin A-deficient rats, in which the early A spermatogonia (A(s), A(pr), and A(al)) are the only type of spermatogonia, only a subset of the spermatogonia expressed UTF1. In the adult rat testis, expression of UTF1 is restricted to a subpopulation of the ZBTB16 (PLZF)-positive early A spermatogonia. Furthermore, the observed distribution pattern of UTF1-expressing cells over the different stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium suggests that the expression of UTF1 is restricted to those A(s), A(pr), and short chains of A(al) spermatogonia that are in the undifferentiated state and therefore maintain the ability to differentiate into A1 spermatogonia in the next round of the epithelial cycle or possibly even in other directions when they are taken out of their testicular niche.","['van Bragt, Maaike P A', 'Roepers-Gajadien, Hermien L', 'Korver, Cindy M', 'Bogerd, Jan', 'Okuda, Akihiko', 'Eggen, Bart J L', 'de Rooij, Dirk G', 'van Pelt, Ans M M']","['van Bragt MP', 'Roepers-Gajadien HL', 'Korver CM', 'Bogerd J', 'Okuda A', 'Eggen BJ', 'de Rooij DG', 'van Pelt AM']","['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080404,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (UTF1 protein, rat)', '0 (ZBTB16 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Aging/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Spermatogonia/*chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Testis/*embryology/growth & development', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/12/30 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['REP-07-0536 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-07-0536 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2008 Jul;136(1):33-40. doi: 10.1530/REP-07-0536.

METHODS: A prospective epidemiological study has been carried out on 1471 AS patients treated with repeated intravenous injections of (224)Ra between 1948 and 1975. These patients have been followed together with a control group of 1324 AS patients not treated with radioactive drugs and/or X-rays. Numbers of malignancies expected in a normal population were computed from German and Danish cancer registry data. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up time of 26 yrs in the exposed group or 25 yrs in the control group, causes of death have been ascertained for 1006 exposed patients and 1072 controls. In particular, 19 cases of leukaemia were observed in the exposure group (vs 6.8 cases expected, P < 0.001) compared to 12 cases of leukaemia in the control group (vs 7.5 cases expected). Further subclassification of the leukaemia cases demonstrated a high increase of myeloid leukaemia in the exposure group (11 cases observed vs 2.9 cases expected, P < 0.001), especially a high excess of acute myeloid leukaemias (7 cases observed vs 1.8 cases expected, P = 0.003), whereas in the controls the observed cases are within the expected range (4 myeloid leukaemias vs 3.1 cases expected). CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced leukaemia incidence in the exposed group is in line with results from experiments in mice injected with varying amounts of the bone-seeking alpha-emitter (224)Ra. In these studies, in animals exposed to lower doses of (224)Ra, i.e. at doses lower than those found to induce osteosarcomas, an increased risk of leukaemia was observed.","['Wick, R R', 'Nekolla, E A', 'Gaubitz, M', 'Schulte, T L']","['Wick RR', 'Nekolla EA', 'Gaubitz M', 'Schulte TL']","['GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Institute of Radiobiology, Ingolstadter Landstr. 1, PO Box 1129, D-85758 Neuherberg, Germany. wick@gsf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20080404,England,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",100883501,"['13233-32-4 (thorium X)', '60YU5MIG9W (Thorium)', 'W90AYD6R3Q (Radium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radium/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/epidemiology/*radiotherapy', 'Thorium']",2008/04/09 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/04/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['ken060 [pii]', '10.1093/rheumatology/ken060 [doi]']",ppublish,Rheumatology (Oxford). 2008 Jun;47(6):855-9. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/ken060.

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine whether the standard measures of toxicity used in clinical trials could be captured from observational Medicare claims data. METHODS: We identified 175 elderly clinical trial patients treated on 2 Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trials (9344, adjuvant breast study and 9730, advanced lung cancer study) and merged participants' CALGB data with their Medicare data. From CALGB data, we identified the most frequent Extended Clinical Toxicity Critieria grade III/IV toxicities. We reviewed diagnostic and procedure codes from Medicare manuals, developed algorithms to measure the toxicities, and then finalized the algorithms after empiric review of patients' codes. We compared results of Medicare algorithms to gold standard CALGB toxicity information to calculate test characteristics. RESULTS: CALGB data documented that 15 grade III/IV chemotherapy-related toxicities occurred in > or =3% of the 175 patients: white blood cell, hemoglobin, platelets, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy, motor or sensory neuropathy, dyspnea, hyperglycemia, infection, and malaise. Vomiting was the only toxicity identified by the Medicare-based algorithm with a sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operator curve of > or =80%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this preliminary study suggest that Medicare diagnostic and procedure codes may be of only limited value in measuring clinically significant chemotherapy-related toxicities in elderly Medicare beneficiaries. Future research includes confirming these findings in a larger and more diverse sample.","['Lamont, Elizabeth B', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Weeks, Jane C', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Lilenbaum, Rogerio', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Christakis, Nicholas A']","['Lamont EB', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Weeks JC', 'Henderson IC', 'Lilenbaum R', 'Schilsky RL', 'Christakis NA']","['Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. elamont@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Aging', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insurance Claim Review/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Medicare/*statistics & numerical data', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",2008/04/05 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/04/05 09:00'],"['2008/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MLR.0b013e31815cecc3 [doi]', '00005650-200803000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Care. 2008 Mar;46(3):303-8. doi: 10.1097/MLR.0b013e31815cecc3.,,,10.1097/MLR.0b013e31815cecc3 [doi],PMC4158032,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,"['U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K07 CA093892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA052784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA071323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA032102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA023318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA074811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA025224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS612805'],,,,,,,,

The molecular pathway that regulates the specification of both cell lineages remains elusive. Here, we show that a lysocardiolipin acyltransferase, lycat, is critical for the establishment of both hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. We isolated lycat from the deletion interval of cloche, a zebrafish mutant that has dramatically reduced hematopoietic and endothelial cell lineages. Reduction of lycat mRNA levels in wild-type zebrafish embryos decreases both endothelial and hematopoietic lineages. Lycat mRNA rescues blood lineages in zebrafish cloche mutant embryos. E165R and G166L mutations in the highly conserved catalytic domain in lycat abolish its function in zebrafish hematopoiesis. Epistasis analysis supports that lycat acts upstream of scl and etsrp in zebrafish hemangioblast development. These data indicate that lycat is the earliest known player in the generation of both endothelial and hematopoietic lineages.","['Xiong, Jing-Wei', 'Yu, Qingming', 'Zhang, Jiaojiao', 'Mably, John D']","['Xiong JW', 'Yu Q', 'Zhang J', 'Mably JD']","['The Nephrology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital-East, Harvard Medical School, 149 13th St, Room 8216, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.

Previous studies have identified distinct PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain splice variants at the mRNA, but not protein, level. Several relatively abundant mRNA isoforms lack exon 15 (Delta15) and would theoretically encode a protein with a truncated cytoplasmic domain and a unique C-terminal sequence. Using a novel rabbit polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes Delta15 PECAM-1, we found that the Delta15 PECAM-1 isoform was expressed in human tissues, including brain, testes and ovary. This isoform was also expressed on the cell surface of human platelets, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the Jurkat T-cell leukemia, human erythroleukemia (HEL) and U937 histiocytic lymphoma cell lines. Furthermore, murine platelets and lung lysates demonstrated abundant amounts of exon-15-deficient PECAM-1. Functional studies revealed that Delta15 PECAM-1 retains both its homophilic binding capacity and its ability to signal by means of its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains. Delta15 PECAM-1 was unable, however, to protect against apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bax or treatment with the chemotherapy agent etoposide. These studies suggest a novel role for the PECAM-1 C-terminus in cytoprotective signaling and highlight a need for further characterization of expression of PECAM-1 isoforms in normal and malignant tissues.","['Bergom, Carmen', 'Paddock, Cathy', 'Gao, Cunji', 'Holyst, Trudy', 'Newman, Debra K', 'Newman, Peter J']","['Bergom C', 'Paddock C', 'Gao C', 'Holyst T', 'Newman DK', 'Newman PJ']","['Blood Research Institute, BloodCenter of Wisconsin, 8727 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, WI 53201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/chemistry/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Signal Transduction']",2008/04/05 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/04/05 09:00'],"['2008/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['121/8/1235 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.025163 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2008 Apr 15;121(Pt 8):1235-42. doi: 10.1242/jcs.025163.,,,10.1242/jcs.025163 [doi],PMC2567807,,,,,"['R01 HL040926/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL040926-20/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-40926/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS71027'],,,,,,,,

Molecular analysis revealed a translocation involving nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) fused to the DNA-binding domain of the hematopoietically expressed homeobox gene (HHEX). Expression of NUP98/HHEX in murine bone marrow cells leads to aberrant self-renewal and a block in normal differentiation that depends on the integrity of the NUP98 GFLG repeats and the HHEX homeodomain. Transplantation of bone marrow cells expressing NUP98/HHEX leads to transplantable acute leukemia characterized by extensive infiltration of leukemic blasts expressing myeloid markers (Gr1(+)) as well as markers of the B-cell lineage (B220(+)). A latency period of 9 months and its clonal character suggest that NUP98/HHEX is necessary but not sufficient for disease induction. Expression of EGFP-NUP98/HHEX fusions showed a highly similar nuclear localization pattern as for other NUP98/homeodomain fusions, such as NUP98/HOXA9. Comparative gene expression profiling in primary bone marrow cells provided evidence for the presence of common targets in cells expressing NUP98/HOXA9 or NUP98/HHEX.

Those analyses raised questions on the incidence and type of selective influences occurring on the tumor B-cell receptor of hairy cell leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: To further investigate this issue, we examined the full IGH and kappa and lambda light chains (IGkappa and IGlambda) variable and constant region transcripts expressed in a large cohort of patients with hairy cell leukemia (n=88). RESULTS: Multiple IgH isotypes were expressed in 46/56 (82%) cases of hairy cell leukemia. Comparison of tumor with normal B-cell repertoires revealed preferential usage of IGHV3-21, IGHV3-30 and IGHV3-33 in hairy cell leukemia (p=0.001, p=0.003 and p=0.001, respectively). Light chain analysis demonstrated preferential Igl use with an inverted IGk:IGl ratio (0.7:1) and universal usage of IGLJ3. Analysis of LCDR3 junctions revealed highly homologous motifs in 40% of IGL. Parallel analysis of IGH and IGL showed selective pairing of IGHV3-21/30/33 segments to specific LCDR3-J3 subsets (p=0.008). Of 40 cases of hairy cell leukemia, 38 had mutated IGHV and/or IGK/LV, with variations in 13/13 cloned cases, while two had 100% unmutated IGHV and IGK/LV. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, biased IGV usage, preference for Iglambda with universal IGLJ3 usage and a high incidence of LCDR3 homologous motifs suggest selective influences on the B-cell receptor of hairy cell leukemia. Ongoing mutations and isotype switching suggest that influences occur on the tumor B-cell receptor at ectopic sites.","['Forconi, Francesco', 'Sozzi, Elisa', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Sahota, Surinder S', 'Amato, Teresa', 'Raspadori, Donatella', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Leoncini, Lorenzo', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Lauria, Francesco']","['Forconi F', 'Sozzi E', 'Rossi D', 'Sahota SS', 'Amato T', 'Raspadori D', 'Trentin L', 'Leoncini L', 'Gaidano G', 'Lauria F']","['DM, Sezione di Ematologia e Trapianti, Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Scienze Immunologiche, Universita di Siena, AOUS, viale Bracci, 53100 Siena, Italy. forconif@unisi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080402,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2008/04/05 09:00,2008/09/25 09:00,['2008/04/05 09:00'],"['2008/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12282 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12282 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 May;93(5):697-705. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12282.

Because cancer stem cells share remarkable phenotypic and functional similarities with normal stem cells, it may be difficult to identify therapeutic approaches to kill cancer stem cells without killing the normal stem cells in the same tissue. Yet in certain tissues, like the hematopoietic system and gut epithelium, this will be critical as regenerative capacity in these tissues is acutely required for life. Components of the PI-3kinase pathway, including Akt, mTor and FoxO are critical regulators of both normal stem cell function and tumorigenesis. Intriguingly, inactivation of some pathway components, like Pten, has opposite effects on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and leukemia-initiating cells. This raises the possibility that drugs targeting this pathway could be more effective at eliminating cancer stem cells while being less toxic against normal stem cells.","['Yilmaz, Omer H', 'Morrison, Sean J']","['Yilmaz OH', 'Morrison SJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Internal Medicine, and Center for Stem Cell Biology, Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109-2216, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080402,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology']",2008/04/05 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/04/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(08)00042-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2008.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Jul-Aug;41(1):73-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2008.02.004.

JWA, a novel retinoic acid-inducible gene, is known to be involved in apoptosis induced by various agents, for example, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, N-4-hydroxy-phenyl-retinamide and arsenic trioxide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying how JWA gene is functionally involved in apoptosis remain largely unknown. Herein, our studies demonstrated that treatment of arsenic trioxide produced apoptosis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner and paralleled with increased JWA expression. JWA expression was dependent upon generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species induced by arsenic trioxide. Knockdown of JWA attenuated arsenic trioxide induced apoptosis, and was accompanied by significantly reduced activity of caspase-9, enhanced Bad phosphorylation and inhibited MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylations. Arsenic trioxide induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was JWA-dependent. These findings suggest that JWA may serve as a pro-apoptotic molecule to mediate arsenic trioxide triggered apoptosis via a reactive oxygen species and mitochondria-associated signal pathway.","['Zhou, Jinhong', 'Ye, Jian', 'Zhao, Xiaojia', 'Li, Aiping', 'Zhou, Jianwei']","['Zhou J', 'Ye J', 'Zhao X', 'Li A', 'Zhou J']","[""Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Toxicology, Institute of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, 140 Hanzhong Road, Nanjing 210029, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080220,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (ARL6IP5 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/radiation effects']",2008/04/05 09:00,2008/07/18 09:00,['2008/04/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(08)00065-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2008.01.041 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2008 Jul 1;230(1):33-40. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2008.01.041.

In the current study, the cellular events and sensitivity to CBD-induced apoptosis between murine thymocytes and EL-4 thymoma cells were compared. Cannabidiol markedly induced apoptosis in a time- and concentration-related manner in both cells. The efficacy of CBD to induce apoptosis was comparable between the 2 types of T cells, whereas CBD induced apoptosis in thymocytes with a slightly greater potency than in EL4 cells. Time-course analyses revealed CBD-mediated apoptosis occurred earlier in EL-4 cells than that in thymocytes. An increased level of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected in both cells with the peak response at 2 h post CBD treatment. Concordantly, CBD triggered a gradual diminishment in the cellular thiols. The presence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a precursor of glutathione, markedly attenuated the induction of apoptosis, and restored the diminished levels of cellular thiols. The results demonstrated that both thymocytes and EL-4 thymoma cells were susceptible to CBD-induced apoptosis and that ROS played a critical role in the apoptosis induction.","['Lee, Chi-Ya', 'Wey, Shiaw-Pyng', 'Liao, Mei-Hsiu', 'Hsu, Wei-Lun', 'Wu, Hsin-Ying', 'Jan, Tong-Rong']","['Lee CY', 'Wey SP', 'Liao MH', 'Hsu WL', 'Wu HY', 'Jan TR']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080214,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '19GBJ60SN5 (Cannabidiol)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cannabidiol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Thymoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology']",2008/04/05 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/04/05 09:00'],"['2007/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(08)00023-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2008.01.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2008 May;8(5):732-40. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2008.01.018.

Exploration of the acting mechanisms involved this event revealed that ergocalciferol induced DNA fragmentation and increased sub-G1 DNA contents in HL-60 cells, both of which are hallmarks of apoptosis. Analysis of the integrity of mitochondria demonstrated that ergocalciferol caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential with release cytochrome c to cytosol, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and depletion of glutathione (GSH), suggesting that ergocalciferol may induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells through a ROS-dependent pathway. Further results show that caspases-2, -3, -6, and -9 were all activated by ergocalciferol, together with cleavage of the downstream caspase-3 targets, DNA fragmentation factor (DFF-45), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. In addition, ergocalciferol led to the increase in pro-apoptotic factor Bax accompanied with the decrease in anti-apoptotic member Mcl-1, and the reduced Mcl-1 to Bax ratio may be a critical event concerning mitochondrial decay by ergocalciferol. Furthermore, ergocalciferol also led to induction of Fas death receptor closely linked to caspase-2 activation, suggesting the involvement of a Fas-mediated pathway in ergocalciferol-induced apoptosis. Totally, these findings suggest that ergocalciferol causes HL-60 apoptosis via a modulation of mitochondria involving ROS production, GSH depletion, caspase activation, and Fas induction. On the basis of anticancer activity of ergocalciferol, it may be feasible to develop chemopreventive agents from edible mushrooms or hop.","['Chen, Wei-Jen', 'Huang, Yu-Ting', 'Wu, Mei-Li', 'Huang, Tzou-Chi', 'Ho, Chi-Tang', 'Pan, Min-Hsiung']","['Chen WJ', 'Huang YT', 'Wu ML', 'Huang TC', 'Ho CT', 'Pan MH']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Chung Shan Medical University, No. 110, Section 1, Chien-Kuo N.

He was transferred to our hospital due to severe paralytic ileus. Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) was found in the duodenal stained tissue of a biopsy specimen. Ivermectin applied both orally and through enema were ineffective because of severe ileus and intestinal bleeding. Nine mg (200 microg/kg) of ivermectin solution was administered subcutaneously every other day for five days (total amount 45 mg). The S. stercoralis burden in the stool decreased and paralytic ileus gradually resolved. Three weeks after the resolution of S. stercoralis infection, purulent meningitis developed and acute obstructive hydrocephalus appeared. The hydrocephalus improved by ventricular drainage. Approximately three months after drainage, he died of incidental aspiratory pneumonia. Autopsy showed neither eggs nor larvae of S. stercoralis in the organs. In this case, the fourth reported case in the world, subcutaneous ivermectin injection was dramatically effective.

The objective of this study was to assess its expression in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and to evaluate its biological and clinical significance. The in vitro effects of 17-AAG, a selective inhibitor of HSP90, was also evaluated. Cells from 65 patients with newly diagnosed AML were studied. The expression of HSP90 correlated with that of CD34, p170, and bcl-2 proteins but not with white cell counts, FAB or WHO subtype, or cytogenetics. HSP90 levels were also higher in samples exhibiting an autonomous growth in liquid culture or forming spontaneous colonies. A concomitant constitutive activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways was observed in a majority of samples and was significantly correlated with HSP90 expression. All patients received induction chemotherapy. The percentages of HSP90-, CD34-, bcl-2-, and p170-positive cells were higher in patients who did not attain complete remission. Survival was also shorter in patients with high levels of HSP90. In vitro exposure of leukemic cells to 17-allylamino-demethoxy geldanamycin (17-AAG) resulted in inhibition of growth in liquid and clonogeneic cultures and in apoptosis, at concentrations which in most cases were not toxic for normal CD34-positive or progenitor cells. The concentration inhibiting 50% growth at 72 h in liquid culture correlated with HSP90 expression. Our study suggests that HSP90 is overexpressed in poor-prognosis AML cells and plays a role in cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Targeted therapy with 17-AAG represents a promising antileukemic strategy in adult AML.","['Flandrin, Pascale', 'Guyotat, Denis', 'Duval, Amelie', 'Cornillon, Jerome', 'Tavernier, Emmanuelle', 'Nadal, Nathalie', 'Campos, Lydia']","['Flandrin P', 'Guyotat D', 'Duval A', 'Cornillon J', 'Tavernier E', 'Nadal N', 'Campos L']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Nord, CHU de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne Cedex 02, France. pascale.flandrin-gresta@chu-st-etienne.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080403,Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Survival Rate']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12192-008-0035-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2008 Sep;13(3):357-64. doi: 10.1007/s12192-008-0035-3.

The zinc-deficient patients had severe immune dysfunctions, inasmuch as they died of intercurrent infections by the time they were 25 years of age. In our studies in an experimental human model of zinc deficiency, we documented decreased serum testosterone level, oligospermia, severe immune dysfunctions mainly affecting T helper cells, hyperammonemia, neurosensory disorders, and decreased lean body mass. It appears that zinc deficiency is prevalent in the developing world and as many as two billion subjects may be growth retarded due to zinc deficiency. Besides growth retardation and immune dysfunctions, cognitive impairment due to zinc deficiency also has been reported recently. Our studies in the cell culture models showed that the activation of many zinc-dependent enzymes and transcription factors were adversely affected due to zinc deficiency. In HUT-78 (T helper 0 [Th(0)] cell line), we showed that a decrease in gene expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor alpha(IL-2Ralpha) were due to decreased activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in zinc deficient cells. Decreased NF-kappaB activation in HUT-78 due to zinc deficiency was due to decreased binding of NF-kappaB to DNA, decreased level of NF-kappaB p105 (the precursor of NF-kappaB p50) mRNA, decreased kappaB inhibitory protein (IkappaB) phosphorylation, and decreased Ikappa kappa. These effects of zinc were cell specific. Zinc also is an antioxidant and has anti-inflammatory actions. The therapeutic roles of zinc in acute infantile diarrhea, acrodermatitis enteropathica, prevention of blindness in patients with age-related macular degeneration, and treatment of common cold with zinc have been reported. In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8. We have reported recently that in both young adults and elderly subjects, zinc supplementation decreased oxidative stress markers and generation of inflammatory cytokines.","['Prasad, Ananda S']",['Prasad AS'],"['Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, United States of America. prasada@karmanos.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Zinc/deficiency/pharmacology/*physiology']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/08/12 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2119/2008-00033.Prasad [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med. 2008 May-Jun;14(5-6):353-7. doi: 10.2119/2008-00033.Prasad.,39,,10.2119/2008-00033.Prasad [doi],PMC2277319,,,,,['5 R01 A150698-04/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Restriction of HIV-1 is enhanced by binding of the viral capsid to cyclophilin A (CypA) in target cells, although CypA is not absolutely required for restriction in rhesus macaque cells. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is not restricted by rhesus macaque TRIM5alpha and its capsid does not bind to CypA. Here, the effect of lentiviral CypA dependence on restriction in different tissues was examined by engineering an HIV-1 capsid quadruple mutant (V(86)P/H(87)Q/I(91)V/M(96)I) lentiviral vector (HIV(quad)) that is CypA-independent. Whereas HIV-1 was restricted in rhesus macaque and owl monkey epithelial cells, infection with the HIV(quad) vector was efficient at high viral concentrations. In contrast, HIV(quad) was largely restricted in primary rhesus macaque CD34(+) cells. Human epithelial and primary CD34(+) cells were permissive for HIV-1, HIV(quad) and SIV, whereas transduction of human T cells by HIV(quad) or SIV was impaired. The restrictive human cells did not express increased levels of TRIM5alpha, and restriction was not relieved by abolishing CypA, consistent with HIV(quad) and SIV being CypA-independent. Pseudotyping of lentiviral vectors with the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope altered their sensitivity to perturbations of the virus-CypA interaction compared to pseudotyping with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins, suggesting that the viral entry pathway modulates restriction. Together, these studies reveal that an HIV-1 capsid quadruple mutant can partially overcome lentiviral restriction in non-human primate epithelial cells, but not in hematopoietic cells.

In this disease, initial haemoglobin level is the most important prognostic factor, whereas age, constitutional symptoms, low or high leukocyte counts, blood blast cells and cytogenetic abnormalities are also of value. Several prognostic systems have been proposed to identify subgroups of patients with a different risk, which is especially important in younger individuals, who may benefit from therapies with curative potential. Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) affects the patients' quality of life more than the survival, due to the high occurrence of thrombosis, whereas polycythaemia vera (PV) has a substantial morbidity derived from thrombosis but also a certain reduction in life expectancy. Therefore, in the latter disorders, prognostic studies have focused primarily on prediction of the thrombosis, with age and a previous history of thrombosis being the main prognostic factors of such complication. The importance of higher leukocyte counts in thrombosis development has been recently pointed out in ET and PV, where a role for mutated JAK2 allele burden has also been noted. With regard to PMF, the possible association of the mutation with shorter survival and higher acute transformation rate is currently being evaluated.","['Cervantes, F', 'Passamonti, F', 'Barosi, G']","['Cervantes F', 'Passamonti F', 'Barosi G']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. fcervan@clinic.ub.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080403,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Humans', 'Life Expectancy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*diagnosis/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombosis/etiology']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200872 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.72 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 May;22(5):905-14. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.72.

The T315I mutation is clinically significant since CML cells harboring this mutation are insensitive to Gleevec and other Bcr-Abl-targeted drugs. Identification of new agents capable of effectively killing CML cells with T315I mutation would have important therapeutic implications in Gleevec-resistant CML. Here, we showed that beta-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a natural compound found in vegetables, is effective in killing CML cells expressing T315I BCR-ABL. Treatment of leukemia cell lines harboring wild-type or mutant Bcr-Abl with 10 microM PEITC resulted in an elevated ROS stress and a redox-mediated degradation of the BCR-ABL protein, leading to massive death of the leukemia cells. Antioxidant NAC attenuated the PEITC-induced oxidative stress in CML cells and prevented the degradation of BCR-ABL, caspase-3 activation and cell death. We further showed that the ROS-induced degradation of BCR-ABL was mediated partially by caspase-3 and the proteasome pathway. The ability of PEITC to effectively kill T315I-positive CML cells was further confirmed using primary leukemia cells isolated from CML patients. Our results suggest that PEITC is a promising compound capable of killing Gleevec-resistant CML cells through a ROS-mediated mechanism and warrants further investigations.","['Zhang, H', 'Trachootham, D', 'Lu, W', 'Carew, J', 'Giles, F J', 'Keating, M J', 'Arlinghaus, R B', 'Huang, P']","['Zhang H', 'Trachootham D', 'Lu W', 'Carew J', 'Giles FJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080403,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isothiocyanates/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200874 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.74 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jun;22(6):1191-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.74.

Also, upregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-signaling pathway is known to play an important role in drug resistance, and has been implicated in the aggressiveness of a number of different cancers, including T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We have investigated the therapeutic potential of the novel Akt inhibitor, perifosine (a synthetic alkylphospholipid), on human T-ALL CEM cells (CEM-R), characterized by both overexpression of P-gp and constitutive upregulation of the PI3K/Akt network. Perifosine treatment induced death by apoptosis in CEM-R cells. Apoptosis was characterized by caspase activation, Bid cleavage and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The proapoptotic effect of perifosine was in part dependent on the Fas/FasL interactions and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, as well as on the integrity of lipid rafts. Perifosine downregulated the expression of P-gp mRNA and protein and this effect required JNK activity. Our findings indicate that perifosine is a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of T-ALL cases characterized by both upregulation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway and overexpression of P-gp.","['Chiarini, F', 'Del Sole, M', 'Mongiorgi, S', 'Gaboardi, G C', 'Cappellini, A', 'Mantovani, I', 'Follo, M Y', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Martelli, A M']","['Chiarini F', 'Del Sole M', 'Mongiorgi S', 'Gaboardi GC', 'Cappellini A', 'Mantovani I', 'Follo MY', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Universita, di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080403,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200879 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.79 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jun;22(6):1106-16. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.79.

While cell contact-dependent Eph activation frequently leads to cell-cell repulsion, also the diametrically opposite response, cell-cell adhesion, is a probable outcome. However, the molecular principles regulating such disparate functions have remained controversial. We have examined cell-biologic mechanisms underlying this switch by analyzing ephrin-A5-induced cell-morphologic changes of EphA3-positive LK63 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Their exposure to ephrin-A5 surfaces leads to a rapid conversion from a suspended/nonpolarized to an adherent/polarized cell type, a transition that relies on EphA3 functions operating in the absence of Eph-kinase signaling. Cell morphology change and adhesion of LK63 cells are effectively attenuated by endogenous protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity, whereby PTP inhibition and productive EphA3-phosphotyrosine signaling reverse the phenotype to nonadherent cells with a condensed cytoskeleton. Our findings suggest that Eph-associated PTP activities not only control receptor phosphorylation levels, but as a result switch the response to ephrin contact from repulsion to adhesion, which may play a role in the pathology of hematopoietic tumors.","['Wimmer-Kleikamp, Sabine H', 'Nievergall, Eva', 'Gegenbauer, Kristina', 'Adikari, Samantha', 'Mansour, Mariam', 'Yeadon, Trina', 'Boyd, Andrew W', 'Patani, Neill R', 'Lackmann, Martin']","['Wimmer-Kleikamp SH', 'Nievergall E', 'Gegenbauer K', 'Adikari S', 'Mansour M', 'Yeadon T', 'Boyd AW', 'Patani NR', 'Lackmann M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080402,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ephrin-A5)', '0 (Ephrins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Eph Family)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Shape', 'Ephrin-A5/physiology', 'Ephrins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Receptor, EphA3/physiology', 'Receptors, Eph Family/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60418-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-121681 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 1;112(3):721-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-121681.

During lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, blood concentrations of LIF increase, correlating with lethality of sepsis. Circulating LIF crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by a saturable transport system. Here we determine how this transport system is regulated in neuroinflammation. Using transport assays that quantify the influx rate and volume of distribution of LIF in mice, we show that LPS facilitated the permeation of LIF from the blood to the brain without compromising the paracellular permeability of the BBB as determined by coadministration of fluorescein. Concurrently, gp130 (shared by the interleukin-6 family of cytokines), but not gp190 (the specific receptor for LIF) or cilliary neutrophic factor (CNTF-Ralpha, a unique receptor for cilliary neurotrophic factor that also uses gp130 and gp190), showed increased levels of mRNA and protein expression in cerebral microvessels from the LPS-treated mice. The upregulation of gp130 by LPS was at least partially mediated by vascular tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)1 and TNFR2. This was shown by elevated TNFR1 and TNFR2 mRNA and protein in cerebral microvessels after LPS and by the absence of the LPS effect on gp130 in knockout mice lacking these receptors. The results show that neuroinflammation by LPS induces endothelial signaling and enhances cytokine transport across the BBB.","['Pan, Weihong', 'Yu, Chuanhui', 'Hsuchou, Hung', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Kastin, Abba J']","['Pan W', 'Yu C', 'Hsuchou H', 'Zhang Y', 'Kastin AJ']","['Blood-Brain Barrier Group, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA 70808, USA. weihong.pan@pbrc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080402,United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

However, in contrast, our knowledge of the adhesion molecules operant under lymphatic flow conditions is incomplete. Among human malignancies, head and neck squamous cell cancer displays a marked predilection for locoregional lymph node metastasis. Based on this distinct tropism, we hypothesized that these cells express adhesion molecules that promote their binding to lymphoid tissue under lymphatic fluid shear stress. Accordingly, we investigated adhesive interactions between these and other cancer cells and the principal resident cells of lymphoid organs, lymphocytes. Parallel plate flow chamber studies under defined shear conditions, together with biochemical analyses, showed that human head and neck squamous cell cancer cells express heretofore unrecognized L-selectin ligand(s) that mediate binding to lymphocyte L-selectin at conspicuously low shear stress levels of 0.07-0.08 dynes/cm(2), consistent with lymphatic flow. The binding of head and neck squamous cancer cells to L-selectin displays canonical biochemical features, such as requirements for sialylation, sulfation, and N-glycosylation, but displays a novel operational shear threshold differing from all other L-selectin ligands, including those expressed on colon cancer and leukemic cells (e.g. HCELL). These data define a novel class of L-selectin ligands and expand the scope of function for L-selectin within circulatory systems to now include a novel activity within shear stresses characteristic of lymphatic flow.","['Resto, Vicente A', 'Burdick, Monica M', 'Dagia, Nilesh M', 'McCammon, Susan D', 'Fennewald, Susan M', 'Sackstein, Robert']","['Resto VA', 'Burdick MM', 'Dagia NM', 'McCammon SD', 'Fennewald SM', 'Sackstein R']","['Department of Otolaryngology and the Sealy Center for Cancer Cell Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080401,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['*Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymph/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Squamous Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Shear Strength']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)46118-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M708899200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Jun 6;283(23):15816-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M708899200.

We successfully amplified specific gene fragments using 16 pairs of primers in one PCR reaction tube with minimal spurious amplification products using TotalPlex amplification coupled to a multiplexed bead array detection system. The genotypes of 16 loci from 34 different genomic DNA (gDNA) samples derived using the TotalPlex system were consistent with the results of several standard genotyping methods, including automatic sequencing, PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, PCR, and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). Thus, the TotalPlex system represents a useful method of amplification that can improve the time, cost, and sample size required for high-throughput pharmacogenetic analysis of SNPs.","['Kang, Hyoung Jin', 'Oh, Yongtaek', 'Chun, Sung-Min', 'Seo, Young Jin', 'Shin, Hee Young', 'Kim, Chul Woo', 'Ahn, Hyo Seop', 'Han, Byoung-Don']","['Kang HJ', 'Oh Y', 'Chun SM', 'Seo YJ', 'Shin HY', 'Kim CW', 'Ahn HS', 'Han BD']","['Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. kanghj@snu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080221,England,Mol Cell Probes,Molecular and cellular probes,8709751,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['DNA Primers/*chemistry', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/08/07 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0890-8508(08)00020-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcp.2008.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Probes. 2008 Jun;22(3):193-200. doi: 10.1016/j.mcp.2008.02.001.

As key mediators of T cell dependent immunity, DCs are considered primary targets for initiating immune responses in infectious diseases and cancer. Conversely, DCs can also play an important role in the induction of tolerance in organ transplantation, autoimmune disorders and allergy. While DCs have been used in clinical trials worldwide during the past decade, many of the highly specialized cell biological characteristics of DCs remain poorly understood. Small numbers of DCs can be isolated as terminally differentiated, post-mitotic cells form either blood or spleen. Alternatively, DC-precursors, such as monocytes or bone marrow-derived stem cells, can be isolated and differentiated into DCs in vitro. The relative low numbers of cells that can thus be obtained, combined with difficulties manipulating these terminally differentiated primary cells in vitro and in vivo, have seriously hampered studies aimed at exploring the cell biology of DCs. Good model cell lines therefore provide invaluable tools to study DC biology. So far most DC models are myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines that can be differentiated in vitro towards a DC phenotype. Here, we compared the phenotypical and functional characteristics of frequently used mouse and human DC-model cell lines. We conclude that, although none of these cell lines fully recapitulates all cell biological or immunological features of primary DCs, some of these cell lines provide valuable tools to study specific aspects of DC biology.","['van Helden, Suzanne F G', 'van Leeuwen, Frank N', 'Figdor, Carl G']","['van Helden SF', 'van Leeuwen FN', 'Figdor CG']","['Department of Tumor Immunology, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Geert Grooteplein Zuid 28, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080311,Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', '*Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Species Specificity']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2478(08)00044-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imlet.2008.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2008 May 15;117(2):191-7. doi: 10.1016/j.imlet.2008.02.003.

The mRNA expressions of KIS were successfully reduced in all cell lines. On the other hand, the mRNA expressions of p27(Kip1) in CEM, MOLT4 and SUP-B15 cells were not affected by the transduction with siRNA KIS gene. We showed that KIS protein directly interacted with p27(Kip1) protein, and reduction of KIS inhibited the S10 phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) in leukemia cells. On these cells transfected with siRNA KIS, the inhibition of S10 phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) was strongly suppressed cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, the inhibition of S10 phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) increased a significant population in G0/G1 fraction. These data demonstrated that the KIS activity was induced during G0/G1, and it promotes cell cycle progression by phosphorylation of S10 on p27(Kip1). We showed that KIS mRNA expression was increased in primary leukemia specimens (acute myelogenous leukemia (AML); 37, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); 72, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); 23), and the mean ratios of KIS to G3PDH in AML, MDS and ALL specimens were 3.62+/-0.68, 3.27+/-0.73 and 3.17+/-0.58, respectively.

Due to the potential relapse and non-specificity of current treatments, immunotherapy promises to be more specific and may induce long-term immunity in patients. The pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG-1) has been shown to be a novel oncogene, expressed in the testis, thymus, colon, lung and placenta (undetectable in most other tissues). Furthermore, it is over expressed in many tumors such as the pituitary adenoma, breast, gastrointestinal cancers, leukemia, lymphoma, and lung cancer and it seems to be associated with tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and cancer progression. The purpose was to investigate the presence/rate of expression of PTTG-1 in multiple myeloma patients. METHODS: We analyzed the PTTG-1 expression at the transcriptional and the protein level, by PCR, immunocytochemical methods, Dot-blot and ELISA performed on patient's sera in 19 multiple myeloma patients, 6 different multiple myeloma cell lines and in normal human tissue. RESULTS: We did not find PTTG-1 presence in the normal human tissue panel, but PTTG-1 mRNA was detectable in 12 of the 19 patients, giving evidence of a 63% rate of expression (data confirmed by ELISA). Four of the 6 investigated cell lines (66.6%) were positive for PTTG-1. Investigations of protein expression gave evidence of 26.3% cytoplasmic expression and 16% surface expression in the plasma cells of multiple myeloma patients. Protein presence was also confirmed by Dot-blot in both cell lines and patients. CONCLUSION: We established PTTG-1's presence at both the transcriptional and protein levels. These data suggest that PTTG-1 is aberrantly expressed in multiple myeloma plasma cells, is highly immunogenic and is a suitable target for immunotherapy of multiple myeloma.","['Chiriva-Internati, Maurizio', 'Ferrari, Raffaele', 'Prabhakar, Madhavi', 'Yu, Yuefei', 'Baggoni, Luigi', 'Moreno, Jorge', 'Gagliano, Nicoletta', 'Portinaro, Nicola', 'Jenkins, Marjorie R', 'Frezza, Eldo E', 'Hardwicke, Fred', ""D'Cunha, Nicholas"", 'Kast, Wmartin', 'Cobos, Everardo']","['Chiriva-Internati M', 'Ferrari R', 'Prabhakar M', 'Yu Y', 'Baggoni L', 'Moreno J', 'Gagliano N', 'Portinaro N', 'Jenkins MR', 'Frezza EE', 'Hardwicke F', ""D'Cunha N"", 'Kast W', 'Cobos E']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and Southwest Cancer Treatment and Research Center, Lubbock, TX, USA. maurizio.chiriva@ttuhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080402,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Securin)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (pituitary tumor-transforming protein 1, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Securin', 'Trans-Activators']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/06/26 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['1479-5876-6-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-6-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2008 Apr 2;6:15. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-6-15.,,,10.1186/1479-5876-6-15 [doi],PMC2323366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Corona ions are emitted by powerlines, forming a plume that is carried away from the line by the wind. The plume generates highly variable disturbances in the atmospheric electric field of tens to a few hundred V/m on time scales from seconds to minutes. Such disturbances can be seen up to several hundred meters from powerlines. It is hypothesized that these random disturbances result in the disruption of nocturnal melatonin synthesis and related circadian rhythms, in turn leading to increased risk of a number of adverse health effects including leukemia. In support of the hypothesis, it is noted that melatonin is highly protective of oxidative damage to the human hemopoietic system. A review of electric field studies provides evidence that (i) diurnal variation in the natural atmospheric electric field may itself act as a weak Zeitgeber; (ii) melatonin disruption by electric fields occurs in rats; (iii) in humans, disturbances in circadian rhythms have been observed with artificial fields as low at 2.5 V/m.

However, the clinical significance of the inhibition and its relevance to 2D6 polymorphisms have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of imatinib have been well studied in Caucasians, but not in a Chinese population. Metoprolol, a CYP2D6 substrate, has different clearances among patients with different CYP2D6 genotypes. It is often used as a CYP2D6 probe substrate for clinical drug-drug interaction studies. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Co-administration of imatinib at 400 mg twice daily increased the plasma AUC of metoprolol by approximately 23% in 20 Chinese patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), about 17% increase in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs) (n = 6), 24% in extensive metabolizers (EMs) (n = 13), and 28% for the subject with unknown 2D6 status (n = 1) suggesting that imatinib has a weak to moderate inhibition on CYP2D6 in vivo. * The clearance of imatinib in Chinese patients with CML showed no difference between CYP2D6 IMs and EMs, and no major difference from Caucasian patients with CML based on data reported in the literature. AIMS To investigate the effect of imatinib on the pharmacokinetics of a CYP2D6 substrate, metoprolol, in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The pharmacokinetics of imatinib were also studied in these patients. METHODS: Patients (n = 20) received a single oral dose of metoprolol 100 mg on day 1 after an overnight fast. On days 2-10, imatinib 400 mg was administered twice daily. On day 8, another 100 mg dose of metoprolol was administered 1 h after the morning dose of imatinib 400 mg. Blood samples for metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol measurement were taken on study days 1 and 8, and on day 8 for imatinib. RESULTS: Of the 20 patients enrolled, six patients (30%) were CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs), 13 (65%) extensive metabolizers (EMs), and the CYP2D6 status in one patient was unknown. In the presence of 400 mg twice daily imatinib, the mean metoprolol AUC was increased by 17% in IMs (from 1190 to 1390 ng ml(-1) h), and 24% in EMs (from 660 to 818 ng ml(-1) h). Patients classified as CYP2D6 IMs had an approximately 1.8-fold higher plasma metoprolol exposure than those classified as EMs. The oral clearance of imatinib was 11.0 +/- 2.0 l h(-1) and 11.8 +/- 4.1 l h(-1) for CYP2D6 IMs and EMs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of a high dose of imatinib resulted in a small or moderate increase in metoprolol plasma exposure in all patients regardless of CYP2D6 status. The clearance of imatinib showed no difference between CYP2D6 IMs and EMs.","['Wang, Yanfeng', 'Zhou, Li', 'Dutreix, Catherine', 'Leroy, Elisabeth', 'Yin, Qi', 'Sethuraman, Venkat', 'Riviere, Gilles-Jacques', 'Yin, Ophelia Q P', 'Schran, Horst', 'Shen, Zhi-Xiang']","['Wang Y', 'Zhou L', 'Dutreix C', 'Leroy E', 'Yin Q', 'Sethuraman V', 'Riviere GJ', 'Yin OQ', 'Schran H', 'Shen ZX']","['Oncology Clinical Pharmacology, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Florham Park, NJ, USA. yanfeng.wang@novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080401,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)', 'GEB06NHM23 (Metoprolol)']",IM,"['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Asians/genetics', 'Benzamides', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metoprolol/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Statistics as Topic']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/10/11 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['BCP3150 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03150.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2008 Jun;65(6):885-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03150.x.

The identification of modifiable characteristics related to CLL-specific survival may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The absolute number of T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cells was calculated for 166 consecutive patients with CLL evaluated by flow cytometry at Mayo Clinic < or = 2 months of diagnosis. The size of the T-cell/NK-cell compartment relative to the size of the malignant monoclonal B-cell (MBC) compartment was evaluated by calculating NK:MBC and T:MBC ratios. Patients exhibited substantial variation in the absolute number of T- and NK-cells as well as T:MBC and NK:MBC ratios at diagnosis. Higher T:MBC and NK:MBC ratios were observed among patients with early stage and mutated IGHV genes (all P < or = 0.0003). As continuous variables, both T:MBC ratio (P-value = 0.03) and NK:MBC ratio (P-value = 0.02) were associated with time to treatment (TTT). On multivariate Cox modelling including stage, CD38, absolute MBC count, NK:MBC ratio and T:MBC ratio, the independent predictors of TTT were stage, T:MBC ratio and NK:MBC ratio. These findings suggest that measurable characteristics of the host immune system relate to the rate of disease progression in patients with newly diagnosed CLL. These characteristics can be modified and continued evaluation of immunomodulatory drugs, vaccination strategies and cellular therapies to delay/prevent disease progression are warranted.","['Palmer, Shanique', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Porrata, Luis F', 'Laplant, Betsy', 'Geyer, Susan M', 'Markovic, Svetomir N', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Bowen, Deborah A', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Palmer S', 'Hanson CA', 'Zent CS', 'Porrata LF', 'Laplant B', 'Geyer SM', 'Markovic SN', 'Call TG', 'Bowen DA', 'Jelinek DF', 'Kay NE', 'Shanafelt TD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080401,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7070 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07070.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 May;141(5):607-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07070.x.

Nevertheless, most of these patients develop RA resistance and relapse. In an attemp to mimic clinical conditions for the treatment of leukemia, a stably RA-resistant subclone of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 (HL60-R) was developed to study the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect of the retinoid IIF (6-OH-11-O-hydroxyphenantrene) in comparison with RA. Moreover whether the inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, valproic acid (VPA), could enhance sensitivity to retinoids in HL60-R cells was evaluated. Finally, the effect of IIF on the expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was evaluated. It was found that IIF strongly suppressed cell proliferation (as measured by growth curves) and induced apoptosis (as measured by DNA fragmentation and Annexin V detection assays), while RA was practically ineffective. The addition of VPA to IIF accentuated the antiproliferative effect of IIF alone and increased apoptosis; the combination of VPA with RA allowed growth arrest. Moreover IIF caused a reduction of transmembrane transporter expression, particularly of P-gp, as shown by Western blotting.

CDBA showed slightly higher cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines, as compared to normal cells, with a tumor-specificity index of 2.2. Human myelogenous leukemia cell lines (HL-60, ML-1, KG-1) were the most sensitive to CDBA, followed by human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4) and human glioblastoma (T98G, U87MG). Human normal cells (gingival fibroblasts, pulp cells, periodontal ligament fibroblasts) were the most resistant. CDBA induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells and caspase-3, -8, -9 activation, but to a much lesser extent than that attained by UV irradiation or actinomycin D. On the other hand, CDBA did not induce DNA fragmentation, nor caspase activation in HSC-2, HSC-4 or T98G cells. Electron microscopy demonstrated that CDBA induced the destruction of mitochondrial structure and digestion of broken organelles by secondary lysosomes in all of these cells. CDBA also increased the number of acidic organelles as judged by acridine orange staining. The present study suggests that CDBA induces autophagic cell death in cancer cell lines.","['Liu, Yu', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Hashimoto, Ken', 'Kikuchi, Hirotaka', 'Amano, Osamu', 'Ishihara, Mariko', 'Kanda, Yumiko', 'Kunii, Shiro', 'Kochi, Mutsuyuki', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Yu, Guangyan']","['Liu Y', 'Sakagami H', 'Hashimoto K', 'Kikuchi H', 'Amano O', 'Ishihara M', 'Kanda Y', 'Kunii S', 'Kochi M', 'Zhang W', 'Yu G']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing, China. liuyu4145@sina.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Benzaldehydes)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '64691-57-2 (beta-cyclodextrin-benzaldehyde)']",IM,"['Benzaldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mouth/cytology', 'Mouth Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'beta-Cyclodextrins/*pharmacology']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2008 Jan-Feb;28(1A):229-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the vitamin K2 derivatives, MK-2 (n = 2) showed the greatest cytotoxicity, followed by MK-1 (n = 1) and MK-3 (n = 3). MK-1, MK-2 and MK-3 showed the highest tumor-specific index (TS= > 2.0, 2.0 and > 1.7, respectively). Among the prenylalcohols, geranylgeraniol (GG) (n = 4) showed the highest cytotoxicity, followed by farnesol (n = 3) and geranylfarnesol (GF) (n = 3). GG showed the highest tumor-specificity (TS = 1.8), followed by farnesol (TS = > 1.4), GF (TS= > < 1.3). However, the tumor-specificity of MK-2 and GG was much lower than that of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The human leukemic cell lines were the most sensitive, whereas the human glioblastoma cell lines were the most resistant to MK-2 and GG. MK-2 did not induce internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in either the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 or the human squamous cell carcinoma HSC-4 cell lines. GG induced marginal internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the HL-60 cells, but not in the HSC-4 cells. Both MK-2 and GG did not induce the formation of autophagosomes, nor did they clearly change the intracellular concentration of three polyamines. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy showed that only MK-1 (n = 1), as well as GGF (n = 7) and GFF (n = 8) which had lower cytotoxicity, produced radicals, suggesting the lack of connection between cytotoxicity and radical production. The present study demonstrates that the presence of 1,4-naphtoquinone structure (including alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones) in vitamin K2 derivatives confers on them the ability to induce non-apoptotic cell death.","['Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Hashimoto, Ken', 'Suzuki, Fumika', 'Ishihara, Mariko', 'Kikuchi, Hirotaka', 'Katayama, Tadashi', 'Satoh, Kazue']","['Sakagami H', 'Hashimoto K', 'Suzuki F', 'Ishihara M', 'Kikuchi H', 'Katayama T', 'Satoh K']","['Division of Pharmacology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan. sakagami@dent.meikai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', '0 (Hemiterpenes)', '0 (Pentanols)', '0 (Vitamins)', '11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)', '55MY0HM445 (prenol)']",IM,"['Biogenic Polyamines/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hemiterpenes', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Pentanols/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin K 2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vitamins/*pharmacology']",2008/04/04 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2008/04/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2008 Jan-Feb;28(1A):151-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3 kinase inhibitors are actually in clinical trials, thus it is critical to develop a reproducible and standardized method for screening of FLT3 activation and for monitoring its inhibition in response to drug in AML patients. We developed a flow cytometry method to analyse phosphorylated FLT3 (P-FLT3) in samples with <10(5) cells. The method was first validated in FLT3 wild-type (HL60/WT) and mutant (MV4-11/ITD(+)) as well as FLT3 negative (K562) cell lines. The method also proved to be reproducible in AML patient samples. Analysis was performed after exposure to drugs (CEP-701 and SU11657), in vitro and in vivo. In response to increasing drug concentrations, there was a linear reduction in P-FLT3. Intracellular flow cytometry analysis correlated with Western blot and XTT assays; flow cytometry data also correlated with FLT3 mutational status. The results highlight a rapid method to detect P-FLT3 protein at the single cell level by flow cytometry which enables an accurate assessment of FLT3 kinase activity in blast cells in response to novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Grafone, Tiziana', 'Palmisano, Michela', 'Nicci, Chiara', 'Martelli, Alberto Maria', 'Emanuela, Ottaviani', 'Storti, Sergio', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Grafone T', 'Palmisano M', 'Nicci C', 'Martelli AM', 'Emanuela O', 'Storti S', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G']","[""Institute of Hematology 'John Paul II' Centre for High Technology Research and Education in Biomedical Sciences, Catholic University, Campobasso, Italy. tiziana.grafone@rm.unicatt.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2008/04/03 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/04/03 09:00'],"['2008/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.854 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2008 Sep;26(3):159-66. doi: 10.1002/hon.854.,,,10.1002/hon.854 [doi],,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

Myoepithelial neoplasms of soft tissue including myoepitheliomas, mixed tumors, and parachordomas are diagnoses that have been increasingly recognized the last few years. It is still debated which neoplasms should be included in these morphologically heterogeneous entities, and the boundaries between them are not clear-cut. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind myoepithelial tumors are unknown. Only five parachordomas and one mixed tumor have previously been karyotyped, and nothing is known about their molecular genetic characteristics. We present a mesenchymal tumor classified as a myoepithelioma that had a balanced translocation t(1;22)(q23;q12) as the sole karyotypic change. A novel EWSR1-PBX1 fusion gene consisting of exons 1-8 of the 5'-end of EWSR1 and exons 5-9 of the 3'-end of PBX1 was shown to result from the translocation. Both genes are known to be targeted also by other neoplasia-specific translocations, PBX1 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and EWSR1 in several solid tumors, most of which are malignant.

When anticipated this syndrome is typically manageable, however this adverse reaction recently became headline news when a massive and unexpected cytokine release syndrome occurred within a few hours of dosing six healthy volunteers with a therapeutic antibody, putting their lives at risk due to multiple organ failure. Preclinical studies did not predict this adverse event, emphasising the need to compare the relative potency of the product in man and the chosen toxicology species, so that additional margins of safety can be applied when conducting first in man (FIM) studies if there is uncertainty over the predictability of the toxicology species. In vitro human PBMC and whole blood cultures may be useful for predicting cytokine release.

Membrane Hsp70 has been found to serve as a prognostic indicator of overall patient survival in leukemia, lower rectal and non small cell lung carcinomas. Why tumors, but not normal cells, present Hsp70 on their cell surface and the impact of membrane Hsp70 on cancer progression remains to be elucidated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Although Hsp70 has been reported to be associated with cholesterol rich microdomains (CRMs), the partner in the plasma membrane with which Hsp70 interacts has yet to be identified. Herein, global lipid profiling demonstrates that Hsp70 membrane-positive tumors differ from their membrane-negative counterparts by containing significantly higher amounts of globotriaoslyceramide (Gb3), but not of other lipids such as lactosylceramide (LacCer), dodecasaccharideceramide (DoCer), galactosylceramide (GalCer), ceramide (Cer), or the ganglioside GM1. Apart from germinal center B cells, normal tissues are Gb3 membrane-negative. Co-localization of Hsp70 and Gb3 was selectively determined in Gb3 membrane-positive tumor cells, and these cells were also shown to bind soluble Hsp70-FITC protein from outside in a concentration-dependent manner. Given that the latter interaction can be blocked by a Gb3-specific antibody, and that the depletion of globotriaosides from tumors reduces the amount of membrane-bound Hsp70, we propose that Gb3 is a binding partner for Hsp70. The in vitro finding that Hsp70 predominantly binds to artificial liposomes containing Gb3 (PC/SM/Chol/Gb3, 17/45/33/5) confirms that Gb3 is an interaction partner for Hsp70. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data indicate that the presence of Gb3 enables anchorage of Hsp70 in the plasma membrane of tumors and thus they might explain tumor-specific membrane localization of Hsp70.","['Gehrmann, Mathias', 'Liebisch, Gerhard', 'Schmitz, Gerd', 'Anderson, Robin', 'Steinem, Claudia', 'De Maio, Antonio', 'Pockley, Graham', 'Multhoff, Gabriele']","['Gehrmann M', 'Liebisch G', 'Schmitz G', 'Anderson R', 'Steinem C', 'De Maio A', 'Pockley G', 'Multhoff G']","['Department of Radiotherapy and Radiooncology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080402,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '126550-86-5 (globotriaosyl lysosphingolipid)']",IM,"['Biotinylation', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycolipids/*metabolism', 'Glycosphingolipids/*chemistry', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Membrane Microdomains/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism']",2008/04/03 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/04/03 09:00'],"['2008/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0001925 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Apr 2;3(4):e1925. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0001925.,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0001925 [doi],PMC2271151,,,,,['R01 GM050878/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Almost 20% of visceral cancers worldwide have proven infectious causes. There is substantial histologic, molecular genetic, and epidemiologic evidence that infections and inflammation are also important in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. The R462Q allelic variant in RNASEL, an antiviral gene important in the innate immune response to viral infections, increases susceptibility to prostate cancer while resulting in vitro in deficient antiviral defenses, suggesting that prostate cancer could be caused by a virus. The study of R462Q carriers led to the discovery and biologic characterization of a novel retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus, isolated and cloned from prostate tissue of affected men. Biologic studies of this virus show that it is sensitive to inhibition by interferon and its downstream mediator, RNaseL, and that its DNA has integrated into the DNA of some men with prostate cancer. SUMMARY: Inflammation triggered by infection and other causes underlies the development of prostate cancer, and xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus is a candidate etiologic agent. Ongoing studies seek to define its oncogenic potential and pathogenesis.","['Klein, Eric A', 'Silverman, Robert']","['Klein EA', 'Silverman R']","['Glickman Urologic and Kidney Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. kleine@ccf.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Urol,Current opinion in urology,9200621,,IM,"['Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infections/*pathology', 'Inflammation/*pathology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology/*virology']",2008/04/03 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/04/03 09:00'],"['2008/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOU.0b013e3282f9b3b7 [doi]', '00042307-200805000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Urol. 2008 May;18(3):315-9. doi: 10.1097/MOU.0b013e3282f9b3b7.,16,,10.1097/MOU.0b013e3282f9b3b7 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy-five patients with newly diagnosed AML were divided into 2 groups: 34 were treated with priming induction regimen CAG and the other 41 were treated with 2 classic routine chemotherapy regimens including pirarubicin+cytarabine (TA) and homoharringtonine+cytarabine (HA). All patients had a 14 day interval between the 2 courses of chemotherapy. RESULTS: The complete remission rate after 2 courses of induction therapy in patients with the priming induction regimen CAG and the total efficacy rate was significantly higher than that of the routine chemotherapy patients(67.6% vs. 39%; 82.4% vs. 56.1%). Patients with unfavorable karyotypes had poor chemotherapy efficacy. The 3-year disease-free-survival (DFS) time was longer in patients with AML treated with priming induction regimen CAG than in patients treated with 2 classic routine chemotherapy regimens. Except for the muscular soreness, the hematological and non-hematological side effects in the CAG priming induction group were significantly fewer than those in the routine chemotherapy group. CONCLUSION: The priming induction regimen of CAG has a significantly higher complete remission rate and an efficacy rate, fewer side effects, milder chemotherapy intensity and is more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs than those of the routine chemotherapy. It can shorten the duration of agranulocytosis and decrease infectious complications and increase the sensitivity of leukemia blast cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Chen, Yi-jian', 'Zhang, Li-qun', 'Li, Xiao-lin', 'Zhao, Xie-lan', 'Wu, Deng-shu', 'Shu, Yi-gang', 'Chen, Fang-ping']","['Chen YJ', 'Zhang LQ', 'Li XL', 'Zhao XL', 'Wu DS', 'Shu YG', 'Chen FP']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Gene expression is dependent on receptor levels which are tightly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Previous studies have shown that proteasome inhibition increases GR, but decreases ER-mediated gene expression. At the gene expression level this divergent role of the proteasome in receptor-dependent transcriptional regulation is not well understood. We have used a genomic approach to examine the impact of proteasome activity on GR- and ER-mediated gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with dexamethasone (DEX) or 17beta-estradiol (E2), the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (MG) or MG132 and either hormone (MD or ME2) for 24 h. Transcript profiling reveals that inhibiting proteasome activity modulates gene expression by GR and ER in a similar manner in that several GR and ER target genes are upregulated and downregulated after proteasome inhibition. In addition, proteasome inhibition modulates receptor-dependent genes involved in the etiology of a number of human pathological states, including multiple myeloma, leukemia, breast/prostate cancer, HIV/AIDS, and neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, our analysis reveals that a number of transcripts encoding histone and DNA modifying enzymes, prominently histone/DNA methyltransferases and demethylases, are altered after proteasome inhibition. As proteasome inhibitors are currently in clinical trials as therapy for multiple myeloma, HIV/AIDS and leukemia, the possibility that some of the target molecules are hormone regulated and chromatin modifying enzymes is intriguing in this era of epigenetic therapy.","['Kinyamu, H Karimi', 'Collins, Jennifer B', 'Grissom, Sherry F', 'Hebbar, Pratibha B', 'Archer, Trevor K']","['Kinyamu HK', 'Collins JB', 'Grissom SF', 'Hebbar PB', 'Archer TK']","['Chromatin and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Molecular Carcinogenesis, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics']",2008/04/03 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/04/03 09:00'],"['2008/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.20440 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2008 Nov;47(11):845-85. doi: 10.1002/mc.20440.,,,10.1002/mc.20440 [doi],PMC2863309,,,,,['Z01 ES071006-09/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS87946'],,,,,,,,

In CEM/4xAraC cells, independent mutations were identified at each allele of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1; SLC29A1), one corresponding to a single-nucleotide change in exon 4, the other being a complex intronic mutation disrupting splicing of exon 13. In contrast to CEM/20xAraC cells, CEM/4xAraC cells did not bind the hENT1/SLC29A1 ligand nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside and lacked detectable hENT1/SLC29A1 protein. In CEM/20xAraC cells, independent intronic mutations impairing splicing of exons 2 and 3 were found at each allele of the deoxycytidine kinase gene. These studies point to at least two distinct mechanisms of AraC resistance in leukemic cells.","['Cai, Jie', 'Damaraju, Vijaya L', 'Groulx, Normand', 'Mowles, Delores', 'Peng, Yunshan', 'Robins, Morris J', 'Cass, Carol E', 'Gros, Philippe']","['Cai J', 'Damaraju VL', 'Groulx N', 'Mowles D', 'Peng Y', 'Robins MJ', 'Cass CE', 'Gros P']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology']",2008/04/03 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/04/03 09:00'],"['2008/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/7/2349 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5528 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Apr 1;68(7):2349-57. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5528.,,,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5528 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on RIT's efficacy and safety profile, many investigators have evaluated its use in transplant conditioning regimens with the goal of improving long-term disease control with limited toxicity. In lymphoma, two basic transplant approaches targeting CD20 have emerged: (1) myeloablative doses of RIT with or without chemotherapy, and (2) standard nonmyeloablative doses of RIT combined with high-dose chemotherapy. Myeloablative RIT has been shown to be feasible and efficacious using escalated doses of iodine 131-tositumomab, yttrium 90-ibritumomab tiuxetan, and (131)I-rituximab with or without chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). The second approach predominantly has used standard doses of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or (131)I-tositumomab plus BEAM chemotherapy (carmustine [BCNU], etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) followed by ASCT. RIT targeting CD45, CD33, and CD66 prior to allogeneic transplantation also has been evaluated for the treatment of acute leukemia.

Phase II studies demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to fludarabine-based chemotherapy improves complete response (CR) rates and prolongs progression-free survival (PFS), but a long-term survival benefit has not been shown. Alemtuzumab is less commonly used, due to the greater likelihood of infusion toxicity, as well as hematologic and immune toxicities. Subcutaneous (SC) administration significantly reduces infusion toxicity, but hematologic and infectious complications, most notably cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, still occur with SC dosing. Alemtuzumab's unique clinical properties include its clinical activity in relapsed CLL patients with del(17p13) and its ability to eradicate minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow. Its use as consolidation therapy to eradicate MRD after nucleoside analog therapy is under active study.

There is strong evidence that the NT MW biological effects depend on several physical parameters and biological variables, which must be controlled in replication studies. Apart from the fundamental importance, the development of comprehensive mechanisms for the NT MW effects is socially important. The effects of MW of mobile communications are of major concern because of the increased exposure in many countries. It has been shown that adverse effects of NT MW from GSM/UMTS mobile phones on human lymphocytes from healthy and hypersensitive to EMF persons depend on carrier frequency and modulation. Further investigations with human primary cells, animals and volunteers are needed to elucidate possible adverse effects of MW signals that are used in wireless communication. Identification of those types and frequency channels/bands for mobile communication, which do not affect human cells, is urgently needed as the high priority task for the development of safe mobile communication. Numerous data on the NT MW effects clearly indicate that the SAR-concept alone cannot underlie the safety guidelines for chronic exposures to MW from mobile communication and other approaches are needed. However, there is not enough research information to set exposure MW standards. Various genetic and epigenetic effects of signals used in mobile communication should be studied.

SETTING: Two Paediatric Oncology Centres in the UK. METHODS: A semi-structured questionnaire was developed in consultation with professionals working within paediatric oncology. Questionnaires were administered in face-to-face interviews with parents of patients attending clinic appointments. Responses to questions were coded and entered into a database for descriptive and inferential analyses. Responses to open questions were coded using simple thematic analysis whereby codes and themes emerged from the data and were compared and contrasted between respondents. Findings were further validated by quotes from interviewees to open questions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Awareness and knowledge of medicines, information needs and handling procedures. RESULTS: Fifty-five interviews were conducted. Most interviewees viewed oral and intravenous chemotherapy as equally important and potent. Three-quarters of parents were aware of the adverse effects chemotherapy could have on them, worryingly three-quarters of the same group of parents did not use all the handling precaution methods advised by health care professionals. Knowledge of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia maintenance treatment was assessed in 47 interviewees; 31 parents were able to explain the reasons for maintenance chemotherapy. Interviewees felt well informed by the hospital and found it easy to access information they needed. The data suggest the majority of parents had a great interest in understanding the disease and treatment, with 91% using the internet to access further information. Three-quarters of parents faced some kind of difficulty when dealing with oral chemotherapy, including problems with the patient not taking the drug, technical and supply problems and problems following the drug regimen. Self-reported compliance in this study was high with 69.1% of interviewees stating they never forgot a single dose. 72.2% of interviewees used a reminder method, of which 81.6% were written reminders. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that although the support systems offered by the paediatric oncology centres were good, certain areas need improvement, specifically the manner in which parents/carers are educated and informed.","['Christiansen, Nanna', 'Taylor, Kevin M G', 'Duggan, Catherine']","['Christiansen N', 'Taylor KM', 'Duggan C']","['Pharmacy Department, Royal London Hospital, Pathology and Pharmacy Building, 80 Newark Street, E1 2ES London, UK. nanna.christiansen@bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080401,Germany,Pharm World Sci,Pharmacy world & science : PWS,9307352,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Caregivers/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence/psychology', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2008/04/02 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11096-008-9208-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm World Sci. 2008 Oct;30(5):550-5. doi: 10.1007/s11096-008-9208-5.

We report that the pathogenesis of this disease is associated with distinct subnuclear structures known as promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). Postmortem brain tissues from 5 patients with the disease were examined. Affected cells with enlarged nuclei contained distinct dot-like subnuclear PML-NBs that were immunopositive for PML protein and nuclear body protein Sp100. Major and minor viral capsid proteins and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, an essential component for DNA replication, colocalized with PML-NBs. By in situ hybridization, viral genomic DNA showed dot-like nuclear accumulation, and by electron microscopy, virus-like structures clustered in subnuclear domains, indicating that PML-NBs are the site of viral DNA replication and capsid assembly. Molecules involved in the ubiquitin proteosome pathway (i.e. ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-like modifier 1) did not accumulate in the nuclei with viral inclusions, indicating that cell degeneration may not be dependent on this pathway. When viral progeny production was advanced, PML-NBs were disrupted. These data suggest that: 1) PML-NBs allow for efficient viral propagation by providing scaffolds, 2) disruption of PML-NBs is independent of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and 3) this disruption probably heralds oligodendrocyte degeneration and the resulting demyelination.","['Shishido-Hara, Yukiko', 'Higuchi, Kayoko', 'Ohara, Sinji', 'Duyckaerts, Charles', 'Hauw, Jean-Jacques', 'Uchihara, Toshiki']","['Shishido-Hara Y', 'Higuchi K', 'Ohara S', 'Duyckaerts C', 'Hauw JJ', 'Uchihara T']","['Department of Neurology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, Tokyo. shishido-hara@y6.dion.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'COS Cells/ultrastructure/virology', 'Capsid Proteins/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism/pathology', 'JC Virus/pathogenicity/*physiology/ultrastructure', '*Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/etiology/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ultrasonography', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/06/13 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/NEN.0b013e31816a1dd3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2008 Apr;67(4):299-308. doi: 10.1097/NEN.0b013e31816a1dd3.,,,10.1097/NEN.0b013e31816a1dd3 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of results from studies of childhood brain cancer and childhood leukemia may also help to assess the potential for selection bias in childhood leukemia studies. METHODS: We included results from 13 studies. Using an inverse variance-weighted method, summary effect estimates were calculated separately for distance, wire codes, and measured and calculated magnetic fields. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the influence of individual studies, the potential for selection bias, and the possibility of publication bias. RESULTS: With the exception of wire-code studies, results were compatible with homogeneity across studies. The summary odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.88 (0.57-1.37) for distance <50 m and 1.14 (0.78-1.67) for calculated or measured magnetic fields above 0.2 microT. For measured or calculated exposures above 0.3 or 0.4 microT, the summary odds ratio was 1.68 (0.83-3.43), with no differences by method of exposure assessment. No single study had a substantial effect on the summary estimates. There was no indication of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of high cut-point analyses (0.3/0.4 microT), where the possibility of a moderate risk increase cannot be excluded, no increase in childhood brain cancer risk was evident for any of the exposure metrics.","['Mezei, Gabor', 'Gadallah, May', 'Kheifets, Leeka']","['Mezei G', 'Gadallah M', 'Kheifets L']","['Environment Division, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. gmezei@epri.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Risk Assessment']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181690715 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiology. 2008 May;19(3):424-30. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181690715.,,,10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181690715 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Absence of expression of the p16INK4a gene product is exhibited in virtually all mesothelioma tumors and cell lines examined to date. Loss of p16INK4a expression has also been frequently observed in more common neoplasms such as lung cancer as well. In a wide variety of these malignancies, including lung cancer, p16INK4a expression is known to be inactivated by hypermethylation of the first exon. This project (CALGB 159904) intended to test the hypothesis that in mesothelioma loss of p16INK4a via methylation would correlate with response to the cytidine analog and methylation inhibitor dihydro-5-azacytidine (DHAC). METHODS: Using tissue samples from CALGB 8833 and 9031, two clinical studies which used DHAC based therapy in mesothelioma, this study tested the hypothesis that tumors possessing methylation of p16INK4a would have a better response and survival following DHAC treatment than their nonmethylated counterparts. RESULTS: Methylation of p16INK4a was identified in 4 of the 20 specimens. Although there was a trend towards improved survival the result was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant correlation between the presence of p16INK4a methylation and response to DHAC therapy or overall survival.","['Kratzke, Robert A', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Wong, Long', 'Kratzke, Marian G', 'Green, Mark R', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Kindler, Hedy L', 'Kern, Jeffrey A']","['Kratzke RA', 'Wang X', 'Wong L', 'Kratzke MG', 'Green MR', 'Vokes EE', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Kindler HL', 'Kern JA']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology-Transplant, The University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. kratz003@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0627D8VG1C (5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e318168da0a [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)31441-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2008 Apr;3(4):417-21. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e318168da0a.,,,10.1097/JTO.0b013e318168da0a [doi],,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],"['Cooper MR', 'Canellos G', 'Crawford J', 'Rai K', 'Carey R', 'Cooper B', 'Holland J', 'Duggan D', 'Omura G', 'Green M', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Berkowitz I', 'Aisner J', 'Peterson B']","['Cooper, M Robert', 'Canellos, George', 'Crawford, Jeffery', 'Rai, Kanti', 'Carey, Robert', 'Cooper, Bernard', 'Holland, James', 'Duggan, David', 'Omura, George', 'Green, Mark', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Berkowitz, Irving', 'Aisner, Joseph', 'Peterson, Bruce']",,"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA83689/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have observed previously that superinfection by MCF13 MLV of certain cell types, such as preleukemic thymic lymphocytes and cultured mink epithelial cells, results in the accumulation of the viral envelope precursor polyprotein, leading to the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, we demonstrate that the induction of ER stress by MCF13 MLV infection results in an increase in the phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2. In cells in which this occurs, we have detected an up-regulation of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (c-IAP1). The results of real-time RT-PCR quantification of message levels and protein turnover assays indicate that up-regulation of c-IAP1 occurs at the translational level. Elevation of c-IAP1 levels at a posttranscriptional step was detectable in MCF13 MLV-induced thymic lymphomas and chronically infected mink epithelial cells.

We analyzed BAALC expression in 172 primary CN-AML patients younger than 60 years of age, treated similarly on CALGB protocols. High BAALC expression was associated with FLT3-ITD (P = .04), wild-type NPM1 (P < .001), mutated CEBPA (P = .003), MLL-PTD (P = .009), absent FLT3-TKD (P = .005), and high ERG expression (P = .05). In multivariable analysis, high BAALC expression independently predicted lower complete remission rates (P = .04) when adjusting for ERG expression and age, and shorter survival (P = .04) when adjusting for FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, and white blood cell count. A gene-expression signature of 312 probe sets differentiating high from low BAALC expressers was identified. High BAALC expression was associated with overexpression of genes involved in drug resistance (MDR1) and stem cell markers (CD133, CD34, KIT). Global microRNA-expression analysis did not reveal significant differences between BAALC expression groups.

There are no studies investigating individual physician practice variation in HCT. METHODS: An international Internet-based survey of transplant physicians collected data on medical decisions made by adult and pediatric HCT physicians. Multivariable analyses identified practitioner and transplant center characteristics predictive of medical decision making. RESULTS: Analysis of 526 assessable respondents showed a wide variation in management approaches to specific clinical scenarios. Pediatric and adult transplant physicians differed significantly in their management strategies for chronic myeloid leukemia, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and choice of graft source for patients with aplastic anemia. Among adult transplant physicians, there was little agreement on the patient factors favoring reduced intensity conditioning or myeloablative conditioning. CONCLUSION: These results emphasize the heterogeneity of worldwide transplant practices. Local preferences or biases likely result in similar patients being offered different transplant and treatment procedures. The degree of practice variation also highlights the need for clinical trials to clarify areas of controversy. Where clinical trials are not feasible, data from observational studies may be the best available evidence to guide practice.","['Lee, Stephanie J', 'Joffe, Steven', 'Artz, Andrew S', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Jagasia, Madan', 'Kernan, Nancy A', 'Loberiza, Fausto R Jr', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Eapen, Mary']","['Lee SJ', 'Joffe S', 'Artz AS', 'Champlin RE', 'Davies SM', 'Jagasia M', 'Kernan NA', 'Loberiza FR Jr', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Eapen M']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D5-290, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. sjlee@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080331,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*surgery', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/surgery', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Disparities', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Internet', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Selection', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'/standards/statistics & numerical data"", 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.15.0169 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.0169 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 1;26(13):2162-70. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.0169.

We planned to revisit the theme by using a nation-wide population of RA patients. METHODS: An RA research database was constructed by identifying hospitalized RA patients from the Hospital Discharge Register and cancer patients from the Cancer Registry. Earlier studies from Sweden have shown that some 75% of RA patients have been hospitalized at some time point. Follow-up of 42,262 RA patients was carried out from year 1980 to 2004 including separate follow-ups for shorter intervals. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for cancer in RA patients by comparing with subjects without RA. RESULTS: Many cancers were in excess in RA patients, especially Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and squamous cell skin cancer; a novel association was found for non-thyroid endocrine tumours. Colon, rectal and endometrial cancers were decreased in RA patients. When RA patients were first hospitalized after 1999, the SIRs for melanoma, squamous cell skin and upper aerodigestive tract cancers and for leukaemia were increased compared with previous periods. CONCLUSIONS: This study, the largest so far published, quantified the increased and decreased site-specific risks of cancer in RA patients. The recent increases in the risks of squamous cell skin and upper aerodigestive tract cancers, melanoma and leukaemia call for continuous vigilance and recording of changes in treatment.","['Hemminki, K', 'Li, X', 'Sundquist, K', 'Sundquist, J']","['Hemminki K', 'Li X', 'Sundquist K', 'Sundquist J']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. k.hemminki@dkfz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080330,England,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",100883501,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications', 'Databases, Factual', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Melanoma/complications', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications', 'Sweden']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['ken130 [pii]', '10.1093/rheumatology/ken130 [doi]']",ppublish,Rheumatology (Oxford). 2008 May;47(5):698-701. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/ken130.

METHODS: The study cohort included 300 patients diagnosed with primary SS in our department between 1984 and 2002. The outcomes measured after the first laboratory evidence of neutropenia (<2.5 x 10(9)/L) were first hospital admission caused by infection, development of systemic manifestations, neoplasia, and death. RESULTS: Ninety-nine (33%) patients had neutropenia during the follow-up, which was related to neoplasia or drugs in 9 (3%) patients and was considered idiopathic in the remaining 90 (30%). Patients with neutropenia had a lower mean age at diagnosis of SS (51.9 versus 59.4 years, P < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of anti-Ro/La antibodies (53% versus 22%, P < 0.001), rheumatoid factor (49% versus 32%, P = 0.009), and low C4 levels (17% versus 8%, P = 0.044) than those without neutropenia. Patients with neutropenia had a higher incidence of hospital admission caused by infection (24% versus 9%, P = 0.002), especially those with neutropenia <1 x 10(9)/L (50% versus 9%, P = 0.002), and a higher rate of admission (log rank = 0.0023) in comparison with those without neutropenia. Agranulocytosis was found in 7 (2%) patients, predominantly related to neoplasia (5 cases). One (1%) of the 90 patients with SS-related neutropenia developed large granular lymphocyte T-cell leukemia. CONCLUSION: Neutropenia should be considered a relevant hematologic finding of primary SS, due both to its elevated prevalence and to its clinical significance (close association with anti-Ro/La antibodies, coexistence with other cytopenias, and development of severe infections).","['Brito-Zeron, Pilar', 'Soria, Natalia', 'Munoz, Sandra', 'Bove, Albert', 'Akasbi, Miriam', 'Belenguer, Rafael', 'Siso, Antoni', 'Ramos-Casals, Manuel']","['Brito-Zeron P', 'Soria N', 'Munoz S', 'Bove A', 'Akasbi M', 'Belenguer R', 'Siso A', 'Ramos-Casals M']","[""Laboratory of Autoimmune Diseases Josep Font, Department of Autoimmune Diseases, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080418,United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infections/immunology/mortality', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*immunology/*mortality', 'Prevalence', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/*immunology/*mortality"", 'Young Adult']",2008/04/02 09:00,2009/05/19 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2007/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-0172(08)00037-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semarthrit.2008.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2009 Apr;38(5):389-95. doi: 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2008.01.014.

Accordingly, the introduction of HoxB7 in the breast cancer line SkBr3 (SkBr3/B7), strongly increases its tumorigenic properties. Here we show that in SkBr3/B7 cells, HoxB7 regulates the expression of TALE Hox cofactors by increasing Pbx2 and Prep1 and decreasing Pbx1. The functional requirement of Hox cofactors in the oncogenic activity of HoxB7 was proven with a dominant-negative Pbx1 mutant, Pbx1NT, which sequesters Prep1 in the cytoplasm. The less aggressive phenotype of the SkBr3/B7/PbxNT cells, evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo, correlated well with increased apoptosis, decreased cycling and up-regulation of p16 and p53. Tumor cell-type specific functional effects of Pbx1NT were observed, possibly related to the presence of different Hox genes in melanoma or breast adenocarcinoma DNA-protein ternary complexes.","['Fernandez, Luis C', 'Errico, M C', 'Bottero, L', 'Penkov, D', 'Resnati, M', 'Blasi, F', 'Care, A']","['Fernandez LC', 'Errico MC', 'Bottero L', 'Penkov D', 'Resnati M', 'Blasi F', 'Care A']","['IFOM, FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, via Adamello 16, 20126 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080402,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (PBX2 protein, human)', '0 (PKNOX1 protein, human)', '0 (PKNOX2 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2007/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(08)00153-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.02.042 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Aug 8;266(2):144-55. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.02.042.

In the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), SVZ-derived NTS were propagated and maintained for more than 6 months with a cell population doubling time of 21.5 days. The replacement of EGF by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) resulted in a cell population doubling time of 19.8 days, corresponding to a 10-fold increase in estimated cell numbers over a period of 70 days, at which point these NTS ceased to grow. In the presence of FGF2 and LIF, VM-derived NTS displayed a cell population doubling time of 24.6 days, which was maintained over a period of more than 200 days. However, when LIF was replaced by EGF, the cell numbers only increased 1.2 fold over 50 days. Using different immunohistochemical markers, we observed a distinct compartmentalization of cells within the spheres. In SVZ-derived NTS an outer compartment of proliferating (nestin(+)/Ki67(+)), preferentially neurogenic (beta-tubulin III(+)/MAP2(+)) cells, surrounded by an inner compartment of glial (GFAP(+)/CNPase(+)) cells. The inner compartment of long-term propagated VM-derived NTS contained GFAP(+) cells as well as cells immunoreactive for the precursor cell marker nestin, even where minimal cell proliferation was observed. Our results demonstrate that tissues from rat SVZ and VM can be propagated as NTS. However, the cellular organization of the NTS and the need for mitogens to maintain long-term proliferative capacity differ with the origin of the tissue.","['Andersen, Rikke K', 'Zimmer, Jens', 'Wahlberg, Lars U', 'Meyer, Morten']","['Andersen RK', 'Zimmer J', 'Wahlberg LU', 'Meyer M']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Institute of Medical Biology, University of Southern Denmark, 5000 Odense C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080229,United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Indoles', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Lateral Ventricles/*cytology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mesencephalon/*cytology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Neurons/drug effects', 'Prosencephalon/*anatomy & histology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/07/31 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4886(08)00069-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.expneurol.2008.02.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 2008 May;211(1):301-10. doi: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2008.02.007.

Previous evidence in animal models implicates the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4R) in the development of cancer cachexia. In humans, MC4R mutations that lead to an impaired receptor function are associated with obesity; in contrast, the most frequent polymorphism (Val103Ile, rs2229616; heterozygote frequency approximately 2%) was shown to be negatively associated with obesity. We tested if cancer patients that are homo-/heterozygous for the Val103Ile polymorphism are more likely to develop cachexia and/or a loss of appetite than non-carriers of the 103Ile-allele. METHODS: BMI (body mass index in kg/m2) of 509 patients (295 males) with malignant neoplasms was determined; additionally patients were asked about premorbid/pretherapeutical changes of appetite and weight loss. Cachexia was defined as a weight loss of at least 5% prior to initiation of therapy; to fulfil this criterion this weight loss had to occur independently of other plausible reasons; in single cases weight loss was the initial reason for seeing a physician. The average age in years (+/- SD) was 59.0 +/- 14.5 (males: 58.8 +/- 14.0, females 59.2 +/- 14.0). Blood samples were taken for genotyping of the Val103Ile by PCR- RFLP. RESULTS: Most of the patients suffered from lymphoma, leukaemia and gastrointestinal tumours. 107 of the patients (21%) fulfilled our criteria for cancer cachexia. We did not detect association between the Val103Ile polymorphism and cancer cachexia. However, if we exploratively excluded the patients with early leucaemic stages, we detected a trend towards the opposite effect (p < 0.05); heterozygotes for the 103Ile-allele developed cancer cachexia less frequently in comparison to the rest of the study group. Changes of appetite were not associated with the 103Ile-allele carrier status (p > 0.39). CONCLUSION: Heterozygotes for the 103Ile-allele are not more prone to develop cancer cachexia than patients without this allele; possibly, Ile103 carriers might be more resistant to cancer cachexia in patients with solid tumors. Further studies of the melanocortinergic system in cachexia of patients with solid tumors are warranted.","['Knoll, Susanne', 'Zimmer, Sabiene', 'Hinney, Anke', 'Scherag, Andre', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Hebebrand, Johannes']","['Knoll S', 'Zimmer S', 'Hinney A', 'Scherag A', 'Neubauer A', 'Hebebrand J']","['Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. susanneknoll@gmx.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080331,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (MC4R protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4)']",IM,"['Cachexia/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/complications', 'Gene Frequency', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*complications', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4/*genetics']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-8-85 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-85 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2008 Mar 31;8:85. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-8-85.,,,10.1186/1471-2407-8-85 [doi],PMC2359760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I is endemic in Khorasan, with a frequency of 2.3% in the general population. As specific cutaneous manifestations of lymphoma may occur in a significant number of patients, we studied these manifestations in ATLL patients admitted to the Hematology and Dermatology Departments of Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, during 1995-2004. METHODS: In this descriptive study, demographic and clinical information was obtained from 23 patients suffering from ATLL with specific cutaneous lesions (atypical lymphocytes on histopathology of cutaneous lesions), and was analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Of the 23 patients, 11 were male and 12 were female. The mean age was 48.17 +/- 14.1 years. The birth place in over 85% of cases was the north of Khorasan. The most common type of specific skin lesion was a maculopapular eruption (11 cases; 47.8%); papular lesions were seen in four cases (17.4%). Other lesions included plaques, ichthyosis-like lesions, erythroderma, tumors, papules, and nodular lesions. In most patients (56.5%), the skin lesions were generalized. CONCLUSION: The most common type of specific skin lesion in ATLL was maculopapular eruption, especially with a generalized distribution. Other types of specific skin lesion, in order of frequency, were papules, plaques, ichthyosis-like skin lesions, nodules, tumors, and erythroderma.","['Pezeshkpoor, Fakhralzaman', 'Yazdanpanah, Mohammad Javad', 'Shirdel, Abbas']","['Pezeshkpoor F', 'Yazdanpanah MJ', 'Shirdel A']","['Department of Dermatology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. fn-pezeshkpoor@mums.ac.ir']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/*pathology']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['IJD3526 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.03526.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2008 Apr;47(4):359-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.03526.x.,,,10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.03526.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulating evidence suggests the aberrant activation of NF-kappaB to be a causative factor mediating the abnormal proliferation of leukemic cells, thus resulting in the development of ATL. A rearranged NF-kappa B2/p100 gene was isolated from an ATL-derived cell line, which was generated by a chromosomal translocation. The isolated NF-kappa B2 mutant is fused with the with no (lysine) deficient protein kinase 1 gene, coding for a 58 kDa protein that retains the DNA binding Rel homology domain, but it lacks the entire ankyrin repeat inhibitory domain, thus suggesting its constitutive activation. This rearranged NF-kappa B2 gene product (p58) was localized in the nucleus, and formed a complex with NF-kappaB p65 or RelB. Moreover, a T-cell line expressing p58 increased the amount of an NF-kappa B2-inducible gene, NF-kappa B2/p100 by itself. These results suggest that such NF-kappa B2 gene rearrangement may therefore be a factor in the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in ATL, and thereby playing a role in the ATL pathogenesis.","['Isogawa, Masato', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Mori, Naoki', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Aoyagi, Yutaka', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Isogawa M', 'Higuchi M', 'Takahashi M', 'Oie M', 'Mori N', 'Tanaka Y', 'Aoyagi Y', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelB/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/05/13 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS750 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00750.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Apr;99(4):792-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00750.x.,,,10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00750.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the effect of wogonin on differentiation induction of leukemic cells. Here we investigate the potential role of wogonin in the proliferation and differentiation of NB4, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Our results indicated that wogonin significantly suppressed the proliferation and efficiently induced the differentiation of NB4 cells. NB4 cell growth was inhibited by 55-60% after treatment with 50 microM wogonin for a period of 5 days. The results of the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test (with 67.13% positive cells by 50 microM wogonin for 5 days), Giemsa staining (with 67.24% positive cells by 50 microM wogonin for 5 days), and the expression of mature-related cell-surface differentiation antigens CD11b and CD14 (with 70.94% CD11b(+) and 5.82% CD14(+) cells by 50 microM wogonin for 5 days) demonstrated an increase in the differentiation-inducing action of wogonin on the NB4 cells, which was accompanied by an increase in mRNA and protein expression of phospholipids scramblase 1 (PLSCR1). Meanwhile, the level of phosphorylated PKC delta (Ser643) was dramatically increased in wogonin treated NB4 cells. Interestingly, wogonin treatment displayed little effect on the apoptosis of NB4 cells. Taken together, the results reported here demonstrated that wogonin could promote the granulocytic differentiation of NB4 cells by up-regulating the expression of PLSCR1 gene.","['Zhang, Kun', 'Guo, Qing-Long', 'You, Qi-Dong', 'Yang, Yong', 'Zhang, Hai-Wei', 'Yang, Li', 'Gu, Hong-Yan', 'Qi, Qi', 'Tan, Zi', 'Wang, Xiaotang']","['Zhang K', 'Guo QL', 'You QD', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang HW', 'Yang L', 'Gu HY', 'Qi Q', 'Tan Z', 'Wang X']","['Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (PLSCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', 'POK93PO28W (wogonin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flavanones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'RNA Interference']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/05/13 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS728 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00728.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Apr;99(4):689-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00728.x.,,,10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00728.x [doi],,,,,,['S06GM-008205/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

HHT exerts its activity through inhibition of protein synthesis and promotion of apoptosis. METHODS: The authors reviewed the most relevant preclinical and clinical studies involving patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) receiving therapy with either natural HHT or omacetaxine mepesuccinate (Ceflatonin, Myelostat, CGX-653), a semisynthetic subcutaneously bioavailable form of HHT presently under development for the treatment of CML. RESULTS: Prior to the advent of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesilate, controlled clinical studies established HHT as the most active therapy in CML after failure of IFN-a for patients who were not candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Preliminary results from Phase II studies suggest that omacetaxine mepesuccinate is active in patients with imatinib-resistant CML, including those carrying the T315I mutation, which renders imatinib and second-generation TKIs ineffective. CONCLUSION: These encouraging results have propelled the development of several Phase II/III trials both in Europe and in the US to further delineate the activity of omacetaxine mepesuccinate in patients with CML who are resistant to TKI therapy.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 428, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA. aquintas@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Harringtonines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy']",2008/04/02 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2008/04/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14656566.9.6.1029 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2008 Apr;9(6):1029-37. doi: 10.1517/14656566.9.6.1029.,51,,10.1517/14656566.9.6.1029 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 364 children from MC who were included in this study, immunophenotyping had been performed for 81.6%. The frequency of B-cell precursor ALL was 76.1%, whereas T lineage ALL showed a frequency of 23.6%. Peak age for ALL was 2 to 3 years of age. B-cell precursor ALL was the major contributor to peak age; T lineage ALL showed a peak among 1 and 3 years of age.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether families of children with acute leukemia prefer propofol alone or propofol plus fentanyl for lumbar puncture (LP) sedation. We conducted a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, crossover study. Each patient was studied twice, once with propofol/placebo and once with propofol/fentanyl. Data collected included the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Score (M-YPAS) at baseline and after placebo or fentanyl, Induction Compliance Checklist, recovery excitement, recovery time, and adverse events. After the study, families were asked which sedative regimen they preferred for future LPs. Twenty-two patients received 44 LP sedations: propofol 22, propofol/fentanyl 22. The average age was 6.4+/-4.2 years (mean+/-SD). There were no significant differences between groups in M-YPAS, Induction Compliance Checklist or recovery excitement. Adverse events occurred in 11/22 patients (50%) propofol and 4/22 (18.2%) propofol/fentanyl (P=0.0196). Average recovery time (mean+/-SD) was 36.86+/-17.1 minutes propofol versus 26.36+/-16.4 minutes propofol/fentanyl (P=0.047). Sixteen families (72.7%) chose propofol with fentanyl for future LP sedations (P=0.05). In conclusion, most families prefer propofol and fentanyl for LPs. Propofol with fentanyl was also associated with fewer adverse events and faster recovery.","['Cechvala, Meredith M', 'Christenson, Devon', 'Eickhoff, Jens C', 'Hollman, Gregory A']","['Cechvala MM', 'Christenson D', 'Eickhoff JC', 'Hollman GA']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin Children's Hospital, Madison, WI, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives)', 'UF599785JZ (Fentanyl)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Anxiety/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Fentanyl/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedatives/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Propofol/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sample Size', 'Spinal Puncture/*methods']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31815d8953 [doi]', '00043426-200802000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2008 Feb;30(2):142-7. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31815d8953.,,,10.1097/MPH.0b013e31815d8953 [doi],,,,,,['M01RR03186/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

HL-60bcl-2 cells, which are derived from a stable transfectant clone of the human bcl-2 gene into the HL-60 leukemia cell line, show 5-fold greater expression of the Bcl-2 protein compared with HL-60neo cells, a control clone transfected with vector alone. VK2 induces apoptosis in HL-60neo cells, whereas HL-60bcl-2 cells are resistant to apoptosis induction by VK2 but show inhibition of cell growth along with an increase of cytoplasmic vacuoles during exposure to VK2. Electron microscopy revealed formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in HL-60bcl-2 cells after exposure to VK2. An increase of acid vesicular organelles (AVOs) detected by acridine orange staining for lysosomes as well as conversion of LC3B-I into LC3B-II by immunoblotting and an increased punctuated pattern of cytoplasmic LC3B by fluorescent immunostaining all supported induction of enhanced autophagy in response to VK2 in HL-60bcl-2 cells. However, during shorter exposure to VK2, the formation of autophagosomes was also prominent in HL-60neo cells although nuclear chromatin condensations and nuclear fragments were also observed at the same time. These findings indicated the mixed morphologic features of apoptosis and autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by either addition of 3-methyladenine, siRNA for Atg7, or Tet-off Atg5 system all resulted in attenuation of VK2-incuded cell death, indicating autophagy-mediated cell death in response to VK2. These data demonstrate that autophagy and apoptosis can be simultaneously induced by VK2.

The present study evaluates the association between plasma levels of homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Plasma levels of homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 were compared between cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and age and sex matched normal controls. Homocysteine levels were measured by solid immunoassay, while folate and vitamin B12 levels were determined by radioassay. RESULTS: Folate levels were significantly among cases as compared to control group (8.56 +/- 4.35) vs (14.04 +/- 2.62) ng/ml, P< 0.001). Although individually vitamin B12 and homocysteine were not significant different between cases and controls, the combined effect of all three parameters was significantly different (P< 0.001), with 83.3% of correct classification of cases and controls was obtained by discriminate function analysis.

Growing evidence suggests that quiescence is not merely a basal state but is regulated by active mechanisms. To understand the molecular programme that governs reversible cell cycle exit, we focused on quiescence-related gene expression in a culture model of myogenic cell arrest and activation. Here we report the identification of quiescence-induced genes using a gene-trap strategy. Using a retroviral vector, we generated a library of gene traps in C2C12 myoblasts that were screened for arrest-induced insertions by live cell sorting (FACS-gal). Several independent gene- trap lines revealed arrest-dependent induction of betagal activity, confirming the efficacy of the FACS screen. The locus of integration was identified in 15 lines. In three lines,insertion occurred in genes previously implicated in the control of quiescence, i.e. EMSY - a BRCA2--interacting protein, p8/com1 - a p300HAT -- binding protein and MLL5 - a SET domain protein. Our results demonstrate that expression of chromatin modulatory genes is induced in G0, providing support to the notion that this reversibly arrested state is actively regulated.","['Sambasivan, Ramkumar', 'Pavlath, Grace K', 'Dhawan, Jyotsna']","['Sambasivan R', 'Pavlath GK', 'Dhawan J']","['Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,J Biosci,Journal of biosciences,8100809,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EMSY protein, human)', '0 (EMSY protein, mouse)', '0 (Macf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nupr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Genes/*physiology', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Myoblasts/cytology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis/metabolism']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12038-008-0019-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biosci. 2008 Mar;33(1):27-44. doi: 10.1007/s12038-008-0019-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms responsible for the dysregulated innate host response leading to enhanced IL-23 gene expression in IL-10(-/-) mice are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Bcl3 in controlling LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) isolated from IL-10(-/-) mice. We report higher IL-23p19 mRNA accumulation and protein secretion in LPS-stimulated BMDC isolated from IL-10(-/-) compared with WT mice. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced B cell leukemia 3 (Bcl3) expression was strongly impaired (90% decrease) in IL-10(-/-) BMDC compared with WT BMDC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated enhanced RelA binding to the IL-23p19 promoter in IL-10(-/-) compared with WT BMDC. Bcl3 overexpression decreased LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in IL-10(-/-) BMDC, which correlated with enhanced NF-kappaB p50 binding and decreased RelA binding to the gene promoter. Conversely, Bcl3 knockdown enhanced LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in WT BMDC. Moreover, LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression was significantly enhanced in Bcl3(-/-) BMDC compared with WT BMDC. In conclusion, enhanced LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in IL-10(-/-) mice is due to impaired Bcl3 expression leading to diminished p50 and enhanced RelA recruitment to the IL-23p19 promoter.","['Muhlbauer, Marcus', 'Chilton, Paula M', 'Mitchell, Thomas C', 'Jobin, Christian']","['Muhlbauer M', 'Chilton PM', 'Mitchell TC', 'Jobin C']","['Department of Medicine, Pharmacology and Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080328,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (Bcl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-23)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Interleukin-10/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-23/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptors/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)54283-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M709029200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 May 23;283(21):14182-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M709029200.

Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocol 9840 was initiated to address this question. Subsequently trastuzumab was demonstrated to improve outcomes of paclitaxel therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive patients, and was therefore incorporated. Because inhibition of HER-family signaling had potential efficacy even without HER-2 overexpression, we randomly assigned for trastuzumab in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or 80 mg/m(2) weekly. After the first 171 patients, all HER-2-positive patients received trastuzumab; HER-2 nonoverexpressors were randomly assigned for trastuzumab, in addition to paclitaxel schedule. A total of 577 patients were treated on 9840. An additional 158 patients were included in analyses, for combined sample of 735. The primary end point was response rate (RR); secondary end points were time to progression (TTP), overall survival, and toxicity. Primary comparisons were between weekly versus every-3-weeks paclitaxel, and trastuzumab versus no trastuzumab in HER-2 nonoverexpressors. RESULTS: In the combined sample, weekly paclitaxel was superior to every-3-weeks administration: RR (42% v 29%, unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75; P = .0004), TTP (median, 9 v 5 months; adjusted HR = 1.43; P < .0001), and survival (median, 24 v 12 months; adjusted HR = 1.28; P = .0092). For HER-2 nonoverexpressors, trastuzumab did not improve efficacy. Grade 3 neuropathy was more common with weekly dosing (24% v 12%; P = .0003). CONCLUSION: Weekly paclitaxel is more effective than every-3-weeks administration for MBC. Trastuzumab did not improve efficacy for HER-2 nonoverexpressors. Neurotoxicity is a treatment-limiting toxicity for weekly paclitaxel.","['Seidman, Andrew D', 'Berry, Donald', 'Cirrincione, Constance', 'Harris, Lyndsay', 'Muss, Hyman', 'Marcom, P Kelly', 'Gipson, Grandella', 'Burstein, Harold', 'Lake, Diana', 'Shapiro, Charles L', 'Ungaro, Peter', 'Norton, Larry', 'Winer, Eric', 'Hudis, Clifford']","['Seidman AD', 'Berry D', 'Cirrincione C', 'Harris L', 'Muss H', 'Marcom PK', 'Gipson G', 'Burstein H', 'Lake D', 'Shapiro CL', 'Ungaro P', 'Norton L', 'Winer E', 'Hudis C']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA. seidmana@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*biosynthesis', 'Trastuzumab']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/10/1642 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.11.6699 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Apr 1;26(10):1642-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.6699.,,,10.1200/JCO.2007.11.6699 [doi],,,,,,"['CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['J Clin Oncol. 2008 Apr 1;26(10):1585-7.

The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the logistic regression parameters are usually computed using the iterative Newton-Raphson method. It is well known that these estimates are biased. Several methods are proposed to correct the bias of these estimates. Among them Firth (1993) and Cordeiro and McCullagh (1991) proposed two promising methods. The conditional exact method (CMLE) is popular for small-sample estimates, and is available in many software packages. In this article we compare these methods in terms of their bias. In general, our extensive simulations show that the methods proposed by Cordeiro and McCullagh and by Firth work well, though Cordeiro and McCullagh is slightly better in our simulations. In case of separation, Firth or CMLE can be used; however, a judicious approach is required when there is a wide variation in results. Two real data analyses are given exhibiting these properties.

By using Tax, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-1, CREB-2, and their mutants, we further showed that Tax repressed ZNF268 through the CREB/activating transcription factor pathway.

With an efficient procedure that we had developed for the aminolysis of hindered steroidal epoxides, we synthesized a series of 2beta-amino-5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol N-derivatives structurally similar to 1. Hence, the opening of 2,3alpha-epoxy-5alpha-androstan-17beta-diol with primary and secondary amines allowed the synthesis of aminosteroids with diverse length, ramification, and functionalization of the 2beta-side chain. Sixty-four steroid derivatives were tested for their capacity to inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells; thus obtaining first structure-activity relationship results.

This region includes PU.1, a critical candidate gene for initiation of leukemogenesis. To identify novel cooperative genes with PU.1, relevant to radiation-induced leukemogenesis, we analyzed the copy number alterations of tumor-related gene loci by array CGH, and their expressions in primary and transplanted AMLs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the induction of AMLs, C3H/He Nrs mice were exposed to 3 Gy of x-rays or gamma-rays. The genomic alterations of 35 primary AMLs and 34 transplanted AMLs obtained from the recipient mice transplanted the primary AMLs were analyzed by array CGH. According to the genomic alterations and mutations of the 235th arginine of PU.1 allele, we classified the radiogenic AMLs into three types such as Chr2(del) PU.1(del/R235-) AML, Chr2(del) PU.1(del/R235+) AML and Chr2(intact) PU.1(R235+/R235+) AML, to compare the expression levels of 8 tumor-related genes quantitatively by real-time polymerase chain reaction and cell-surface antigen expression. Results. In addition to well-known loss of PU.1 with hemizygous deletion of chromosome 2, novel genomic alterations such as partial gain of chromosome 6 were recurrently detected in AMLs. In this study, we found similarity between cell-surface antigen expressions of bone marrows and those of spleens in AML mice and significantly higher expressions of c-myc and PU.1 expression, especially in the PU.1-deficient (Chr2(del) PU.1(del/R235-)) AML and Chr2(del) PU.1(del/R235+) compared to Chr2(intact) PU.1(R235+/R235+) AMLs. CONCLUSION: The new finding on upregulation of c-myc and PU.1 in both and hemizygous PU.1-deficient AMLs and different genomic alterations detected by array CGH suggests that the molecular mechanism for development of radiation-induced AML should be different among three types of AML.","['Hirouchi, Tokuhisa', 'Takabatake, Takashi', 'Yoshida, Kazuko', 'Nitta, Yumiko', 'Nakamura, Masako', 'Tanaka, Satoshi', 'Ichinohe, Kazuaki', 'Oghiso, Yoichi', 'Tanaka, Kimio']","['Hirouchi T', 'Takabatake T', 'Yoshida K', 'Nitta Y', 'Nakamura M', 'Tanaka S', 'Ichinohe K', 'Oghiso Y', 'Tanaka K']","['Department of Radiobiology, Institute for Environmental Sciences, Hacchazawa, Takahoko, Rokkasho, Aomori, Japan.

Those lectins are expressed on dendritic cells (DC) and/or on liver-sinusoidal endothelial cells. Both cell types modulate immune responses. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), aberrant glycosylation of blast cells can alter their interaction with the C-type lectins DC-SIGN and L-SIGN, thereby affecting their immunological elimination. We investigated whether recombinant DC-SIGN and L-SIGN bind to blood or bone marrow cells from B- and T-ALL patients and compared that with binding of peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors. It was found that increased binding of ALL cells to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN was observed compared to cells from healthy donors. Furthermore, L-SIGN bound a higher percentage of leukemic and normal cells than DC-SIGN. B-ALL bone marrow cells showed the highest binding to L-SIGN. DC-SIGN bound equally well to B-ALL and T-ALL cells. Within ALL subtypes, DC-SIGN binding was higher with mature T-ALL. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that increased binding of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN to peripheral leukemic cells from B-ALL patients is associated with poor survival. These data demonstrate that high binding of B-ALL peripheral blood cells to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN correlates with poor prognosis. Apparently, when B-ALL cells enter the blood circulation and are able to interact with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN the immune response is shifted toward tolerance. Additional studies are necessary to ascertain the possible role of these results in terms of disease pathogenesis and their potential as target to eradicate leukemic cells.","['Gijzen, Karlijn', 'Raymakers, Reinier A P', 'Broers, Karin M', 'Figdor, Carl G', 'Torensma, Ruurd']","['Gijzen K', 'Raymakers RA', 'Broers KM', 'Figdor CG', 'Torensma R']","['Department of Tumor Immunology, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080402,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CLEC4M protein, human)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Carbohydrates/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Endothelial Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Lectins, C-Type/*immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Liver/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*immunology', 'Survival Rate']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00069-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Jul;36(7):860-70. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.02.003.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To further resolve these mechanisms, we conducted a structure-function analysis of MEIS1 and gene-expression profiling, in the context of NUP98-HOXD13 (ND13) leukemogenesis. RESULTS: We show, in a murine bone marrow transplantation model, that the PBX-interaction domain, the homeodomain, and the C-terminal domain of MEIS1, are all required for leukemogenic collaboration with ND13. In contrast, the N-terminal domain of MEIS1 is dispensable for collaboration with ND13, but is required for Flt3 upregulation, indicating additional roles for MEIS1 in induction of leukemia independent of alterations in Flt3 expression. Gene-expression profiling of a cloned ND13 preleukemic cell line transduced with wild-type or Meis1 mutant forms revealed deregulation of multiple genes, including a set not previously implicated as MEIS1 targets. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the in vivo occupancy of MEIS1 on regulatory sequences of Trib2, Flt3, Dlk1, Ccl3, Ccl4, Pf4, and Rgs1. Furthermore, engineered overexpression of Trib2 complements ND13 to induce AML while Ccl3 potentiates the repopulating ability of ND13. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Meis1-induced leukemogenesis with ND13 can occur in the absence of Flt3 upregulation and reveals the existence of other pathways activated by MEIS1 to promote leukemia.","['Argiropoulos, Bob', 'Palmqvist, Lars', 'Yung, Eric', 'Kuchenbauer, Florian', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Sly, Laura M', 'Wan, Adrian', 'Krystal, Gerald', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Argiropoulos B', 'Palmqvist L', 'Yung E', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Heuser M', 'Sly LM', 'Wan A', 'Krystal G', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080402,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Ccl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (tribbles 2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Genetic Complementation Test', '*Genetic Linkage', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Retroviridae', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00096-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.02.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Jul;36(7):845-59. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.02.011.

To test whether SMS1 overexpression-related effects after PDT can be reversed, in this study SMS1 was downregulated in Jurkat T lymphoma/leukemia cells using small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) for SMS1. Compared to scrambled (control) siRNA-transfectants, in SMS1 siRNA-transfected cells the activity of SMS at rest was downregulated with concomitant decrease in sphingomyelin mass. In SMS1 siRNA-transfected cells increases in ceramides were higher than in control siRNA-transfectants after PDT. Similar findings were obtained for dihydroceramides suggesting the involvement of de novo ceramide pathway. PDT-induced DEVDase (caspase-3-like) activation was enhanced in SMS1 siRNA-transfected cells compared to their control counterparts. The data show that RNA interference-dependent downregulation of SMS1 is associated with increased accumulation of ceramide and dihydroceramide with concomitant sensitization of cells to apoptosis after photodamage. Similarly, in SMS2 siRNA-transfected cells, downregulation of SMS activity was accompanied by potentiated DEVDase activation post-photodamage.

Amyloid beta protein 25-35 elicited neuronal death as determined by calcein/ethidium homodimer-1 staining. 10 microM amyloid beta protein 25-35 caused cell death at a level of 41.5+/-3.8% by MTT reduction. 50 microM TAB attenuated the amyloid beta protein 25-35-induced cell death by 49.7+/-11.1%. TAB also abrogated amyloid beta protein-induced activation of caspases 8 and 9 by about 50-60%. Furthermore, TAB significantly diminished the amyloid beta protein 25-35-induced elevation of calcium level in mitochondria, whereas it did not affect the calcium level in cytosol or endoplasmic reticulum. TAB markedly retarded the amyloid beta protein-mediated release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Amyloid beta protein 25-35 elevated mitochondrial truncated BH3 interacting domain death agonist (tBid) and decreased the level of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2alpha (Bcl-2alpha) in mitochondria.

Vitamin K2-mediated apoptosis proceeds much more slowly than the apoptosis induced by conventional anticancer agents. Thus, it is possible to analyze the underlying mechanism in detail. In this chapter, we focus on the pro-apoptotic effects of vitamin K2 on mitochondrial physiology with particular emphasis on changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Upon treatment of ovarian cancer TYK-nu cells with vitamin K2, superoxide is produced after two to three days, followed shortly thereafter by release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. This is accompanied by other apoptotic features such as characteristic morphological changes and DNA fragmentation by day four. Data suggest that superoxide production might cause damage to mitochondrial membranes, open permeability transition pores, and result in disruption of DeltaPsim with subsequent release of cytochrome c. Both vitamin K2-induced production of superoxide and reduction of DeltaPsim are completely inhibited by alpha-tocopherol such that cell viability is retained. Thus, we propose that the loss of DeltaPsim caused by superoxide might be the major cause of apoptosis following exposure to vitamin K2. However, other pathways may be involved since cyclosporin A failed to completely inhibit vitamin K2-induced apoptosis.","['Shibayama-Imazu, Toshiko', 'Aiuchi, Toshihiro', 'Nakaya, Kazuyasu']","['Shibayama-Imazu T', 'Aiuchi T', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Hatanodai, Shinagawaku, Tokyo 142-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Vitam Horm,Vitamins and hormones,0413601,['11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Vitamin K 2/*pharmacology']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0083-6729(07)00010-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0083-6729(07)00010-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Vitam Horm. 2008;78:211-26. doi: 10.1016/S0083-6729(07)00010-6.,83,,10.1016/S0083-6729(07)00010-6 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is likely that homing is a multistep process, encompassing a sequence of highly regulated events that mimic the migration of leukocytes to inflammatory sites. In leukocyte biology, this process includes an initial phase of tethering and rolling of cells to the endothelium via E- and P-selectins, firm adhesion to the vessel wall via integrins that appear to be activated in an ""inside-out"" fashion, transendothelial migration, and chemotaxis through the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the inflammatory nidus. For HSC/P, the cells appear to migrate to the endosteal space of the bone marrow. A second phase of engraftment involves the subsequent interaction of specific HSC/P surface receptors, such as alpha(4)beta(1) integrin receptors with vascular cell-cell adhesion molecule-1 and fibronectin in the ECM, and interactions with growth factors that are soluble, membrane, or matrix bound. We have utilized knockout and conditional knockout mouse lines generated by gene targeting to study the role of Rac1 and Rac2 in blood cell development and function. We have determined that Rac is activated via stimulation of CXCR4 by SDF-1, by adhesion via beta(1) integrins, and via stimulation of c-kit by the stem cell factor-all of which involved in stem cell engraftment. Thus Rac proteins are key molecular switches of HSC/P engraftment and marrow retention. We have defined Rac proteins as key regulators of HSC/P cell function and delineated key unique and overlapping functions of these two highly related GTPases in a variety of primary hematopoietic cell lineages in vitro and in vivo. Further, we have begun to define the mechanisms by which each GTPase leads to specific functions in these cells. These studies have led to important new understanding of stem cell bone marrow retention and trafficking in the peripheral circulation and to the development of a novel small molecule inhibitor that can modulate stem cell functions, including adhesion, mobilization, and proliferation. This chapter describes the biochemical footprint of stem cell engraftment and marrow retention related to Rho GTPases. In addition, it reviews abnormalities of Rho GTPases implicated in human immunohematopoietic diseases and in leukemia/lymphoma.","['Williams, David A', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Cancelas, Jose A']","['Williams DA', 'Zheng Y', 'Cancelas JA']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Methods Enzymol,Methods in enzymology,0212271,"['0 (RAC3 protein, human)', '0 (RhoH protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rac2 GTP-binding protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/physiopathology', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/deficiency/physiology', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/deficiency/physiology', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/physiology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/physiology']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0076-6879(07)00427-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0076-6879(07)00427-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Enzymol. 2008;439:365-93. doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)00427-2.,153,,10.1016/S0076-6879(07)00427-2 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, functional activation of the RAS pathway can occur in leukemias, either due to mutations in genes that code for proteins upstream of RAS or due to inactivation of negative regulators of RAS. However, despite this prominent association of RAS activation with human leukemias, its precise role in leukemogenesis is not known. Previous studies have met with limited success in developing relevant animal models for leukemogenesis by oncogenic NRAS, the most frequently mutated RAS gene in human leukemias, and have suggested that oncogenic RAS might only act as a secondary event in leukemogenesis. This chapter describes an efficient and relevant murine model for myeloid leukemias initiated by oncogenic NRAS using an improved bone marrow transduction/transplantation system. This model provides a system for further studying the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies and for testing targeted therapies.","['Parikh, Chaitali', 'Ren, Ruibao']","['Parikh C', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Methods Enzymol,Methods in enzymology,0212271,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, ras/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0076-6879(07)00402-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0076-6879(07)00402-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Enzymol. 2008;439:15-24. doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)00402-8.,,,10.1016/S0076-6879(07)00402-8 [doi],,,,,,"['CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL083515/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In contrast, there are truncated proviral sequences that have the capacity to retrotranspose, causing insertional mutagenesis in the xenograft and in infected human cells. To estimate this risk we have investigated the potential of PERV to retrotranspose. Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMLV), a gamma type retrovirus and close relative to PERV, which has been described as able to retrotranspose, was implemented as a control.

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that is frequently used by cancer cells to stabilise mutant oncoproteins. Mutant FLT3 is chaperoned by Hsp90 in primary AML blasts whereas unmutated FLT3 is not, making Hsp90 inhibitors potentially useful therapeutically. The present study showed that inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) was cytotoxic to primary AML cells expressing mutant FLT3. Inhibition of Hsp90 results in altered downstream signalling effects in primary AML cells with disruption of Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3/AKT signalling pathways. Co-treatment of blasts with 17-AAG and cytarabine resulted in a synergistic or additive effect in approximately 50% of AML cases tested.

All CLL patients seen in the Division of Hematology at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2004 (n = 1750) were evaluated for cytopenia, aetiology of cytopenia and clinical outcome. Cytopenia occurred in 423 (24.2%) patients and was attributable to CLL in 303 (17.3%) cases, with 228 (75%) of these having bone marrow (BM) failure and 75 (25%) having autoimmune disease (AID). Survival from onset of cytopenia was significantly better for patients with AID (median 9.1 years) compared to patients with BM failure (median 4.4 years, P < 0.001). Patients with AID diagnosed within 1 year of the diagnosis of CLL (n = 35) had similar survival from diagnosis compared to patients without CLL-related cytopenia (median 9.3 vs. 9.7 years, P = 0.881). Although cytopenia caused by BM failure predicted a poorer prognosis in CLL, cytopenia caused by AID was not an adverse prognostic factor. These findings suggest that patients with cytopenia due to AID cannot be meaningfully classified by the current clinical staging systems. Revisions of the National Cancer Institute Working Group 96 criteria should consider the aetiology of cytopenia in staging CLL patients.","['Zent, Clive S', 'Ding, Wei', 'Schwager, Susan M', 'Reinalda, Megan S', 'Hoyer, James D', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Tschumper, Renee C', 'Bowen, Deborah A', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Slager, Susan L']","['Zent CS', 'Ding W', 'Schwager SM', 'Reinalda MS', 'Hoyer JD', 'Jelinek DF', 'Tschumper RC', 'Bowen DA', 'Call TG', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE', 'Slager SL']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. zent.clive@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080327,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7086 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07086.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 May;141(5):615-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07086.x.

The effects of TEL/PDGFRB were assessed using the multipotent haemopoietic cell line FDCP-Mix. In the absence of growth factors, TEL/PDGFRB expression increased survival that was associated with elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3). Whilst TEL/PDGFRB had subtle effects on the growth factor requirements it had a profound effect on differentiation. The cells became refractory to cytokine-stimulated development, showing limited maturation but failing to produce fully mature cells. We have previously identified the spliceosome protein THOC5 as a target in macrophage colony-stimulating factor signalling and a protein involved in the regulation of transcription factor expression. TEL/PDGFRB expression increased the expression and phosphorylation of THOC5. Elevated expression of THOC5 increased PIP3 levels and decreased apoptosis. Mass spectrometry was used to identify a site for TEL/PDGFRB-mediated phosphorylation on THOC5, which was shown to be a target for a number of other leukaemogenic tyrosine kinases. Thus, THOC5 is a novel target for modulation of signal transduction with a potential role in leukaemogenesis.","['Pierce, Andrew', 'Carney, Louise', 'Hamza, Hajja G', 'Griffiths, John R', 'Zhang, Liqun', 'Whetton, Beth A', 'Gonzalez Sanchez, M Belen', 'Tamura, Teruko', 'Sternberg, David', 'Whetton, Anthony D']","['Pierce A', 'Carney L', 'Hamza HG', 'Griffiths JR', 'Zhang L', 'Whetton BA', 'Gonzalez Sanchez MB', 'Tamura T', 'Sternberg D', 'Whetton AD']","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080327,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)', '0 (THOC5 protein, human)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate)', '4L6452S749 (Inositol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2008/04/01 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/04/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7090 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07090.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 May;141(5):641-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07090.x.

Studies show that more than half of P-TEFb in cells is associated with HEXIM1, which results in the inactivation of P-TEFb. Here, we identify a nucleolar protein, nucleophosmin (NPM), as a HEXIM1-binding protein. NPM binds to HEXIM1 in vitro and in vivo, and functions as a negative regulator of HEXIM1. Over-expression of NPM leads to proteasome-mediated degradation of HEXIM1, resulting in activation of P-TEFb-dependent transcription. In contrast, an increase in HEXIM1 protein levels and a decrease in transcription are detected when NPM is knocked down. We show that a cytoplasmic mutant of NPM, NPMc+, associates with and sequesters HEXIM1 in the cytoplasm resulting in higher RNA Pol II transcription. Correspondingly, cytoplasmic localization of endogenous HEXIM1 is detected in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line containing the NPMc+ mutation, suggesting the physiological importance of HEXIM1-NPMc+ interaction. Over-expression of NPM has been detected in tumors of various histological origins and our results may provide a possible molecular mechanism for the proto-oncogenic function of NPM. Furthermore, considering that 35% of AML patients are diagnosed with NPMc+ mutation, our findings suggest that in some cases of AML, RNA Pol II transcription may be disregulated by the malfunction of NPM and the mislocation of HEXIM1.","['Gurumurthy, Meera', 'Tan, Chuan Hao', 'Ng, Raymond', 'Zeiger, Lisa', 'Lau, Joanne', 'Lee, Jialing', 'Dey, Anwesha', 'Philp, Robin', 'Li, Qintong', 'Lim, Tit Meng', 'Price, David H', 'Lane, David P', 'Chao, Sheng-Hao']","['Gurumurthy M', 'Tan CH', 'Ng R', 'Zeiger L', 'Lau J', 'Lee J', 'Dey A', 'Philp R', 'Li Q', 'Lim TM', 'Price DH', 'Lane DP', 'Chao SH']","['Expression Engineering Group, Bioprocessing Technology Institute, 20 Biopolis Way, #06-01 Centros, Singapore 138668, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080304,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (HEXIM1 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2008/03/29 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(08)00254-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2008.02.055 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2008 Apr 25;378(2):302-17. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.02.055.

In about 40% of the patients the decline in plasma concentrations was >/=80%, while 17% of the population did not experience any decline. On day 7 of cycle 1, the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 2.6 times the corresponding value on day 1. After 1 week without tretinoin, the mean AUC on day 1 of cycle 2 was lower (down 15%) but not statistically different from the corresponding value observed on day 1 of cycle 1; 62% of patients showed an increase in the AUC, which was 40% higher than the corresponding value on day 7 of cycle 1. On day 1 of cycle 6, the AUC and CL/F of tretinoin during a dosage interval were not statistically different from those observed on day 1 of cycle 1 and cycle 2. On all occasions the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) was strongly correlated to the corresponding AUC. No significant change in the time to observed C(max) (t(max)) and in the elimination half-life (t((1/2))) was observed during the whole study. These results confirmed that the metabolism of tretinoin is rapidly up-regulated in CML patients, with significant declines in plasma drug exposure during the first week of drug administration. After tretinoin was discontinued, a return to the noninduced state followed a mean time-cycle similar to the induction. The strong decrease in the apparent oral drug clearance and the absence of significant variations in the drug half-life demonstrated that the presystemic extraction of tretinoin is the main cause of the marked decline in plasma drug exposure. CONCLUSION: The favourable pharmacokinetic profile of tretinoin obtained by an intermittent regimen, 1 week on/1 week off therapy (vs continuous administration), suggests that such a therapeutic schedule is the most appropriate for the assessment of clinical efficacy in those pathologies in which its use is suitable.","['Regazzi, M B', 'Russo, D', 'Iacona, I', 'Sacchi, S', 'Visani, G', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Avvisati, G', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Dastoli, G', 'Grandi, C', 'Spreafico, S', 'Grattoni, R', 'Galieni, P', 'Rupoli, S', 'Maiolo, A M', 'Guerra, E', 'Liberati, A M']","['Regazzi MB', 'Russo D', 'Iacona I', 'Sacchi S', 'Visani G', 'Lazzarino M', 'Avvisati G', 'Pelicci PG', 'Dastoli G', 'Grandi C', 'Spreafico S', 'Grattoni R', 'Galieni P', 'Rupoli S', 'Maiolo AM', 'Guerra E', 'Liberati AM']","['Gruppo Ematologico Retinoidi (GER), Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,,,,2008/03/29 09:00,2008/03/29 09:01,['2008/03/29 09:00'],"['2008/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/29 09:01 [medline]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['160104 [pii]', '10.2165/00044011-199816010-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 1998;16(1):25-33. doi: 10.2165/00044011-199816010-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response was evaluable in 94 patients (47 in each group). 75 (80%) patients had an absolute granulocyte count lower than 100/mm(3) at the onset of fever or during the first week of antibiotic therapy. 61 (64.9%) were affected by acute leukaemia.

The level of proviral expression of HTLV-1 differs significantly among infected people, even at the same proviral load (proportion of infected mononuclear cells in the circulation). A high level of expression of the HTLV-1 provirus is associated with a high proviral load and a high risk of the inflammatory disease of the central nervous system known as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). But the factors that control the rate of HTLV-1 proviral expression remain unknown. Here we show that proviral integration sites of HTLV-1 in vivo are not randomly distributed within the human genome but are associated with transcriptionally active regions. Comparison of proviral integration sites between individuals with high and low levels of proviral expression, and between provirus-expressing and provirus non-expressing cells from within an individual, demonstrated that frequent integration into transcription units was associated with an increased rate of proviral expression. An increased frequency of integration sites in transcription units in individuals with high proviral expression was also associated with the inflammatory disease HAM/TSP. By comparing the distribution of integration sites in human lymphocytes infected in short-term cell culture with those from persistent infection in vivo, we infer the action of two selective forces that shape the distribution of integration sites in vivo: positive selection for cells containing proviral integration sites in transcriptionally active regions of the genome, and negative selection against cells with proviral integration sites within transcription units.","['Meekings, Kiran N', 'Leipzig, Jeremy', 'Bushman, Frederic D', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Meekings KN', 'Leipzig J', 'Bushman FD', 'Taylor GP', 'Bangham CR']","['Department of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080321,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/blood', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genome, Human', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/blood/*virology', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2008/03/29 09:00,2008/04/29 09:00,['2008/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000027 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2008 Mar 21;4(3):e1000027. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000027.,,,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000027 [doi],PMC2265437,,,,,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 AI052845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We first found that most GISTs expressed KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by protooncogene c-kit and that approximately 90% of the sporadic GISTs had somatic gain-of-function mutations of the c-kit gene. Since both GISTs and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) were double-positive for KIT and CD34, GISTs were considered to originate from ICCs or their precursor cells. We also found that germline gain-of-function mutations of the c-kit gene resulted in familial and multiple GISTs with diffuse hyperplasia of ICCs as the preexisting lesion. Moreover, we found that about half of the sporadic GISTs without c-kit gene mutations had gain-of-function mutations of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene that encodes another receptor tyrosine kinase. Imatinib which is known to inhibit constitutively activated BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia also inhibits constitutive activation of mutated KIT and PDGFRA, and is now being used for metastatic or unresectable GISTs as a molecular target drug. Mutational analyses of c-kit and PDGFRA genes are considered to be significant for prediction of effectiveness of imatinib and newly developed/developing other agents on GISTs.

As MSC constitute part of BM stroma, we examined their properties in children with hematologic diseases. METHODS: BM MSC from children with non-malignant hematologic disorders and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were isolated and expanded. MSC were immunophenotypically characterized and their functional characteristics were assessed by CFU-F assay and cell doubling time calculation. Their ability for trilineage differentiation was verified by molecular and histochemical methods. Apoptosis was evaluated and clonal analysis was performed. RESULTS: MSC were isolated from BM of all groups. They acquired the mesenchymal-related markers from the first passage, with a simultaneous decrease of hematopoietic markers. A very low percentage of apoptotic cells was detected in all passages. The proliferative and clonogenic capacity did not differ among groups, with the exception of ALL at diagnosis, in which they were defective. Histochemical and molecular analysis of differentiated MSC yielded characteristics for adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Clonal analysis in a number of BM samples revealed a highly heterogeneous population of cells within each clone. DISCUSSION: MSC from BM of children with hematologic disorders, with the exception of ALL at diagnosis, can be isolated in sufficient number and quality to serve as a potential source for clinical applications.","['Dimitriou, H', 'Linardakis, E', 'Martimianaki, G', 'Stiakaki, E', 'Perdikogianni, C H', 'Charbord, P', 'Kalmanti, M']","['Dimitriou H', 'Linardakis E', 'Martimianaki G', 'Stiakaki E', 'Perdikogianni CH', 'Charbord P', 'Kalmanti M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion University of Crete Medical School, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. lena@med.uoc.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chondrocytes/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematologic Diseases/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mesoderm/*pathology', 'Osteocytes/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['790200929 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240701851332 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2008;10(2):125-33. doi: 10.1080/14653240701851332.,,,10.1080/14653240701851332 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The beneficial effect of donor lymphocytes, however, is often accompanied by graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). Adoptive transfer of antigen (Ag)-specific T-cell lines may eradicate the relapsed hematological malignancy, and may separate the anti-leukemic effect from GvHD. The main drawback of adoptive therapy of defined T-cell populations is the difficulty in producing sufficient quantities of these Ag-specific T cells. In addition, the specificity of the infused T cells is difficult to control. As the T-cell receptor (TCR) solely determines the specificity of T cells, transfer of relevant TCR genes into appropriate T-cell populations may provide a potent therapeutic reagent. With this strategy, donor-derived T-cell populations would be equipped with a TCR of defined specificity in short-term in vitro procedures, and infusion of the redirected cells would result in T-cell reactivity against the defined Ag. In this review we discuss the current status of TCR gene transfer for the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Heemskerk, M H M', 'Griffioen, M', 'Falkenburg, J H F']","['Heemskerk MH', 'Griffioen M', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. mhmheemskerk@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Genetic Therapy/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/genetics/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['790495996 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240701883087 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2008;10(2):108-15. doi: 10.1080/14653240701883087.,56,,10.1080/14653240701883087 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The obtained results suggest its possible glycosylation that was further suggested by finding N-glycosylation sequon in the signal peptide of AMID protein (in silica), and by predicting transmembrane localization of its N-terminal part.

Molecularly based treatment stratifications could help improve outcome. The prognostic impact of HOX11 and HOX11L2 expression has been an area of controversy. We have investigated 286 adult T-ALL patients enrolled into the German Multicenter ALL (GMALL) therapy protocols by comparative real-time RT-PCR. High HOX11 expression and HOX11L2 expression were predominantly seen in thymic T-ALL (P<or=0.031). In a multivariate analysis HOX11L2 expression proved to be an independent adverse risk factor for relapse-free survival (RFS) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.02 (P=0.023) and an HR for overall survival (OS) of 1.81 (P=0.021), both adjusted for the immunophenotype. HOX11 expression was found to have a favorable impact on RFS (HR 0.51; P=0.048) but did not exhibit a significant impact on OS. A subgroup analysis for thymic T-ALL revealed a more pronounced negative correlation of HOX11L2 expression with RFS (HR 3.26; P=0.002) and OS (HR 2.38; P=0.009). Although the prognostic impact of HOX11 in T-ALL is less clear, HOX11L2 expression identifies a small subset of high-risk patients, who are so far classified as standard-risk group. Thus, patients with aberrant HOX11L2 expression should be considered early as candidates for intensified treatment regimes.","['Baak, U', 'Gokbuget, N', 'Orawa, H', 'Schwartz, S', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Thiel, E', 'Burmeister, T']","['Baak U', 'Gokbuget N', 'Orawa H', 'Schwartz S', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E', 'Burmeister T']","['Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin, Medizinische Klinik III, Berlin, Germany. baaku@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20080327,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TLX3 protein, human)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200852 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.52 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jun;22(6):1154-60. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.52.

We applied RNA interference (RNAi) to specific killing of p190(+) cells, and determined the optimal sequences for gene silencing in the BCR, junctional and ABL regions of p190, respectively. Then, p190(+) and p210(+) cells were infected with lentiviral vectors encoding these shRNAs, resulting in efficient killing of p190(+) cells, while p210(+) cells were only sensitive to shBCR and shABL. In p190-transformed Ba/F3 cells, silencing of p190 specifically inhibited tyrosine phospohorylation of Stat5 prior to their death, but did not affect phosphorylation of Jak2, Akt or MEK1/2. In contrast, downregulation of p190 by their treatment with 17-allylamino-17-demetoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) was associated with reduced protein levels of Jak2, Akt and MEK1/2. shRNA targeting p190 collaborated additively with imatinib and 17-AAG in growth inhibition of Ba/F3-p190wt and imatinib-resistant Ba/F3-p190Y253 H cells.

High-dose therapies were avoided, anthracycline use was limited and CNS radiation therapy only foreseen in high-risk patients (about 30%). This was randomized against a modified BFM protocol.

The second-line inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib are effective in patients with imatinib resistance resulting from Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations. Bcr-Abl(T315I), however, is resistant to all Abl kinase inhibitors in clinical use and is emerging as the most frequent cause of salvage therapy failure. SGX393 is a potent inhibitor of native and T315I-mutant Bcr-Abl kinase that blocks the growth of leukemia cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells expressing Bcr-Abl(T315I), with minimal toxicity against Bcr-Abl-negative cell lines or normal bone marrow. A screen for Bcr-Abl mutants emerging in the presence of SGX393 revealed concentration-dependent reduction in the number and range of mutations. Combining SGX393 with nilotinib or dasatinib preempted emergence of resistant subclones, including Bcr-Abl(T315I).

The tumor suppressor Fbxw7 (F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7), a subunit of an SCF-type ubiquitin ligase complex, induces the degradation of positive regulators of the cell cycle. We demonstrate that inactivation of Fbxw7 in hematopoietic cells causes premature depletion of HSCs due to active cell cycling and p53-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, Fbxw7 deletion also confers a selective advantage to cells with suppressed p53 function, eventually leading to development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

The v-Abl oncoprotein encoded by Ab-MLV contains MA, p12, and a portion of CA sequences derived from the gag gene of Mo-MLV. Previous studies indicated that alteration of MA sequences affects the biology of Mo-MLV and Ab-MLV. To understand the role of these sequences in Ab-MLV transformation more fully, alanine substitution mutants that affect Mo-MLV replication were examined in the context of Ab-MLV. Mutations affecting Mo-MLV replication decreased transformation, while alanine mutations in residues dispensable for Mo-MLV replication did not. The altered v-Abl proteins displayed aberrant subcellular localization that correlated to transformation defects. Immunofluorescent analyses suggested that aberrant trafficking of the altered proteins and improper interaction with components of the cytoskeleton were involved in the phenotype. Similar defects in localization were observed when the Gag moiety containing these mutations was expressed in the absence of abl-derived sequences. These results indicate that MA sequences within the Gag moiety of the v-Abl protein contribute to proper localization by playing a dominant role in trafficking of the v-Abl molecule.","['Yi, Chae-ryun', 'Rosenberg, Naomi']","['Yi CR', 'Rosenberg N']","['Molecular Microbiology Graduate Program, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080326,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oligosaccharides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/06/12 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00089-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00089-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jun;82(11):5307-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00089-08.

Our objective was to search for genomic features that allow a better molecular identification of the different types of lymphoma studied. DESIGN AND METHODS: We selected a panel of 87 low-grade B-cell lymphoma tumor samples that were unambiguously diagnosed (clinically and cytogenetically) as: follicular, splenic marginal zone, nodal marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic, mantle cell, extranodal marginal zone MALT-type lymphoma or B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. All samples were subjected to the same high-resolution genomic DNA analysis (array-based comparative genomic hybridization): a whole genome platform that contained 44000 probes distributed across the genome. Genomic imbalances were recorded, compiled and analyzed. RESULTS: Eighty percent of analyzed cases showed genomic imbalances (deletions and gain/amplifications) but the frequency of these imbalances ranged from 100% in mantle cell lymphomas to 33% in MALT lymphomas. A total of 95 new genomic imbalances affecting all lymphoma subtypes, were defined. We evaluated the extension of the genomic instability, detecting distinct patterns of genomic instability within subtypes. Specific pathways, such as nuclear factor kB (gains of REL and BCL11A, and losses of COMMD3, BIRC1, IKK1 and NFKB2), Polycomb group proteins (gain of BMI1 and deletion of PCGF6), DNA repair checkpoint pathways (deletion of 16q24 involving CDT1), or miRNA with a role in B-cell lymphoma pathogenesis (MIRN15A, MIRN16-1), were targeted by this genomic instability. CONCLUSIONS: Although all subtypes of lymphomas showed gains and losses of DNA, the analysis of their genomic profiles indicated that there are specific aberrations in almost every subtype as well as frequent aberrations that are common to a large number of lymphoma types. These common aberrations target genes that are important in B-cell lymphomagenesis.","['Ferreira, Bibiana I', 'Garcia, Juan F', 'Suela, Javier', 'Mollejo, Manuela', 'Camacho, Francisca I', 'Carro, Angel', 'Montes, Santiago', 'Piris, Miguel A', 'Cigudosa, Juan C']","['Ferreira BI', 'Garcia JF', 'Suela J', 'Mollejo M', 'Camacho FI', 'Carro A', 'Montes S', 'Piris MA', 'Cigudosa JC']","['Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Centro Nacional Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), Melchor Fernandez Almagro, 3, 28029 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080326,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/09/25 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12221 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12221 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 May;93(5):670-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12221.

Small-molecule inhibition of the aurora kinases has been shown to result in inhibition of cell division, phosphorylation of histone H3 and the induction of apoptosis in a number of cell systems. These characteristics have led aurora kinase inhibitors to be considered as potential therapeutic agents. DESIGN AND METHODS: Aurora kinase gene expression profiles were assessed in 101 samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Subsequently, aurora kinase inhibitors were investigated for their in vitro effects on cell viability, histone H3 phosphorylation, cell cycle and morphology in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia samples. RESULTS: The aurora kinase inhibitors AZD1152-HQPA and ZM447439 induced growth arrest and the accumulation of hyperploid cells in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia cultures. Furthermore, both agents inhibited histone H3 phosphorylation and this preceded perturbations in cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis. Single cell cloning assays were performed on diploid and polyploid cells to investigate their colony-forming capacities. Although the polyploid cells showed a reduced capacity for colony formation when compared with their diploid counterparts, they were consistently able to form colonies. CONCLUSIONS: AZD1152-HQPA- and ZM447439 are effective apoptosis-inducing agents in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia cultures. However, their propensity to induce polyploidy does not inevitably result in apoptosis.","['Walsby, Elisabeth', 'Walsh, Val', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Burnett, Alan', 'Mills, Ken']","['Walsby E', 'Walsh V', 'Pepper C', 'Burnett A', 'Mills K']","['Dept. of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, South Glamorgan, CF14 4XN, Wales, UK. walsbyej@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080326,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0', '(2-((3-((4-((5-(2-((3-fluorophenyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino)quina', 'zolin-7-yl)oxy)propyl)(ethyl)amino)ethyl dihydrogen phosphate)', '0', '(4-(4-(N-benzoylamino)anilino)-6-methoxy-7-(3-(1-morpholino)propoxy)quinazoline)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '29P8LWS24N (AZD 1152-HQPA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Organophosphates/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Ploidies', 'Polyploidy', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/09/25 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12148 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12148 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 May;93(5):662-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12148.

In the current study we describe the design, synthesis and biological properties of an imatinib analog with a chlorine-substituted benzamide, namely compound 584 (cmp-584). DESIGN AND METHODS: To increase the potency, we rationally designed cmp-584, a compound with enhanced shape complementarity with the kinase domain of Abl. cmp-584 was synthesized and characterized in vitro against a panel of 67 serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases using radioactive and enzyme-linked immunosorbent kinase assays. We studied inhibitory cellular activity using Bcr/Abl-positive human cell lines, murine transfectants in proliferation experiments, and a murine xenotrans-planted model. Kinase assays on isolated Bcr/Abl protein were also performed. Finally, we used a wash-out approach on whole cells to study the binding kinetics of the inhibitor. RESULTS: cmp-584 showed potent anti-Abl activity both on recombinant protein (IC(50): 8 nM) and in cell-based assays (IC(50): 0.1-10 nM). The drug maintained inhibitory activity against platelet-derived growth factor receptors and c-KIT and was also active against Lyn (IC(50): 301 nM). No other kinase of the panel was inhibited at nanomolar doses. cmp-584 was 20- to 300-fold more active than imatinib in cells. This superior activity was evident in intact cells, in which full-length Bcr-Abl is present. In vivo experiments confirmed the activity of cmp-584. Wash-out experiments showed that short exposure to the drug impaired cell proliferation and Bcr-Abl phosphorylation for a substantially longer period of time than imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest a slower off-rate (dissociation rate) of cmp-584 compared to imatinib as an explanation for the increased cellular activity of the former.","['Puttini, Miriam', 'Redaelli, Sara', 'Moretti, Loris', 'Brussolo, Stefania', 'Gunby, Rosalind H', 'Mologni, Luca', 'Marchesi, Edoardo', 'Cleris, Loredana', 'Donella-Deana, Arianna', 'Drueckes, Peter', 'Sala, Elisa', 'Lucchini, Vittorio', 'Kubbutat, Michael', 'Formelli, Franca', 'Zambon, Alfonso', 'Scapozza, Leonardo', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo']","['Puttini M', 'Redaelli S', 'Moretti L', 'Brussolo S', 'Gunby RH', 'Mologni L', 'Marchesi E', 'Cleris L', 'Donella-Deana A', 'Drueckes P', 'Sala E', 'Lucchini V', 'Kubbutat M', 'Formelli F', 'Zambon A', 'Scapozza L', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, Quai Ernest-Ansermet 30, 1211 Geneve 4, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080326,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0', '(3-chloro-4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-N-(4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-ylpyrimidin', '-2-ylamino)phenyl)benzamide)', '0 (Anilides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Anilides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/09/25 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12212 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12212 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 May;93(5):653-61. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12212.

Bcl-2 has been shown to repress cell death triggered by a diverse array of stimuli, including chemotherapy and gamma irradiation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine feline Bcl-2 expression level in feline lymphoma cells using an immunoblot assay with anti-human and anti-canine Bcl-2 monoclonal antibodies. METHODS: About 708 base pairs containing the coding sequence of the feline Bcl-2 gene were transformed into Escherichia coli. The recombinant Bcl-2 was used as a positive control for an immunoblot assay using mouse monoclonal antibodies against human and canine Bcl-2. An immunoblot assay using the monoclonal antibodies was carried out to determine the level of feline Bcl-2 expression in lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: The recombinant feline Bcl-2 protein produced in E. coli had a molecular weight of about 26 kDa and was detected by immunoblot assay by using anti-human Bcl-2 mouse monoclonal antibody. Feline Bcl-2 expression was high in lymphoma cell lines (FL-74-UDC-1 and FT-1) and low in the cell line from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy cat (FeTJ-1) but not low in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy cat. The anti-human Bcl-2 mouse monoclonal antibody was found to cross-react with feline Bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the expression of Bcl-2 in T-cell lymphoma cell lines and indicate that it is suitable to detect feline Bcl-2 using an immunoblot assay. Pending further evaluation, Bcl-2 expression might be useful in the differential diagnosis of feline tumors.","['Kano, Rui', 'Sato, Eimi', 'Okamura, Tomotaka', 'Watanabe, Shinichi', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko']","['Kano R', 'Sato E', 'Okamura T', 'Watanabe S', 'Hasegawa A']","['Department of Pathobiology, Nihon University School of Veterinary Medicine, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan. kano@brs.nihon-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/*veterinary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/10/29 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['VCP13 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1939-165X.2008.00013.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2008 Mar;37(1):57-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165X.2008.00013.x.,,,10.1111/j.1939-165X.2008.00013.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These transforming viruses encode viral oncoproteins that interact with cellular proteins to enhance viral replication. The transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of these viral oncoproteins ultimately result in cellular transformation. Historically, viral research has been vital to the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressors with more current research aiding in unraveling some mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Interestingly, since transforming viruses affect some of the same pathways that are dysregulated in human cancers, their study enhances our understanding of the multistep process of tumorigenesis. This review will examine the cellular mechanisms targeted by oncogenic human viruses and the processes by which these effects contribute to transformation. In particular, we will focus on three transforming viruses, human T-cell leukemia virus type-I, hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus. These viruses all encode specific oncogenes that promote cell cycle progression, inhibit DNA damage checkpoint responses and prevent programmed cell death in an effort to promote viral propagation. While the transforming properties of these viruses are probably unintended consequences of replication strategies, they provide excellent systems in which to study cancer development.","['Dayaram, Tajhal', 'Marriott, Susan J']","['Dayaram T', 'Marriott SJ']","['Interdepartmental Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogenes', '*Oncogenic Viruses/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.21439 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2008 Aug;216(2):309-14. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21439.,58,,10.1002/jcp.21439 [doi],PMC4160108,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['R01 CA055684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS623319'],,,,,,,,

BCR/ABL exhibits an aberrant ABL-tyrosine kinase activity. The treatment of advanced Ph+ leukemia with selective ABL-kinase inhibitors such as Imatinib, Nilotinib and Dasatinib is initially effective but rapidly followed by resistance mainly because of specific mutations in BCR/ABL. Tetramerization of ABL through the N-terminal coiled-coil region (CC) of BCR is essential for the ABL-kinase activation. Targeting the CC-domain forces BCR/ABL into a monomeric conformation reduces its kinase activity and increases the sensitivity for Imatinib. We show that (i) targeting the tetramerization by a peptide representing the Helix-2 of the CC efficiently reduced the autophosphorylation of both unmutated and mutated BCR/ABL; (ii) Helix-2 inhibited the transformation potential of BCR/ABL independently of the presence of mutations; and (iii) Helix-2 efficiently cooperated with Imatinib as revealed by their effects on the transformation potential and the factor-independence related to BCR/ABL with the exception of mutant T315I. These findings support earlier observations that BCR/ABL harboring the T315I mutation have a transformation potential that is at least partially independent of its kinase activity. These data provide evidence that the inhibition of tetramerization inhibits BCR/ABL-mediated transformation and can contribute to overcome Imatinib-resistance.","['Beissert, Tim', 'Hundertmark, Alena', 'Kaburova, Velina', 'Travaglini, Lorena', 'Mian, Afsar A', 'Nervi, Clara', 'Ruthardt, Martin']","['Beissert T', 'Hundertmark A', 'Kaburova V', 'Travaglini L', 'Mian AA', 'Nervi C', 'Ruthardt M']","['Med.

It was subsequently found that angiopoietins, the natural ligands of Tie2, modulate Tie2-dependent signaling, which in turn regulates the survival and apoptosis of endothelial cells, controls vascular permeability, and regulates the capillary sprouting that occurs during normal angiogenesis such as through development and ovarian remodeling. Tie2 also seems to play a crucial role in several vascular abnormalities, such as familial venous malformations. Beyond its critical role in angiogenesis, Tie2 also appears to maintain the long-term population and quiescent status of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow stem cell niche. In cancer, Tie2 was originally found to be overexpressed in tumoral vessels. More recently, our laboratory and others have found that Tie2 is also expressed outside the vascular compartment in several types of cancer, including leukemia and solid neoplasms such as gastric tumors, breast tumors, and gliomas. The role of Tie2 in these tumoral cells is currently being explored. In this regard, our group reported the importance of Tie2-expressing glioma cells in their adhesion to the tumoral microenvironment. Because cancer may be considered as a complex organ with several cellular lineages coexisting in the same tumor, the expression of Tie2 by different tumoral compartments makes this cellular receptor an attractive target for cancer therapy.","['Martin, V', 'Liu, D', 'Fueyo, J', 'Gomez-Manzano, C']","['Martin V', 'Liu D', 'Fueyo J', 'Gomez-Manzano C']","['Department of Neuro-Oncology, Brain Tumor Center, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*blood supply', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*physiology', 'Receptor, TIE-2/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/04/18 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-23.773 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2008 Jun;23(6):773-80. doi: 10.14670/HH-23.773.,58,,10.14670/HH-23.773 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best survival was observed for Hodgkin lymphoma among young patients, and the worst survival was observed among cases with plasma cell neoplasms, particularly plasma cell leukemia, in all racial groups. Being diagnosed at a lower stage without B-symptoms and a non-HIV/AIDS status favored survival for each type of lymphoma. Males typically had lower survival rates than females, but the opposite was observed for Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia among non-whites and multiple myeloma among non-Hispanic whites. Non-Hispanic whites typically had higher survival rates than blacks with the exception of multiple myeloma. Survival rates decline with age at diagnosis among elders, while the patterns were diverse by subtype among younger cases. The differences in lymphoma survival patterns suggest that distinct prognostic risk factors impact survival by subtype and that future research and public health interventions should address racial disparities in lymphoma survivorship.","['Han, Xuesong', 'Kilfoy, Briseis', 'Zheng, Tongzhang', 'Holford, Theodore R', 'Zhu, Cairong', 'Zhu, Yong', 'Zhang, Yawei']","['Han X', 'Kilfoy B', 'Zheng T', 'Holford TR', 'Zhu C', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhang Y']","['Yale University School of Epidemiology and Public Health, 60 College Street, LEPH 440, P.O.

Gene expression, cytosine methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation were measured using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays in primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) specimens. We found that DNA methylation and H3K9 acetylation distinguished these leukemias of distinct cell lineage, as expected, but that an integrative analysis combining the information from each platform revealed hundreds of additional differentially expressed genes that were missed by gene expression arrays alone. This integrated analysis also enhanced the detection and statistical significance of biological pathways dysregulated in AML and ALL.

For example, STASIS (stress or aberrant signaling-induced senescence) is affected by the exposure to free radicals and conditions that cause an increased cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during normal life span. In addition, progressive telomere erosion and telomeric dysfunction contribute to a cellular feature termed replicative or cellular senescence. To focus on distinct cellular pathways that contribute to these different forms of senescence, we investigated the reversible differentiation and aging process of the human U937 leukemia cell line. This was compared to cellular senescence that occurred in normal primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). These two cell systems revealed an important role of the proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome and its activation by the nuclear protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) during ""retrodifferentiation"" and rejuvenation of the leukemic cells.

The resistance process is multifactorial. To realize the total factors involved in multidrug resistance, we analyzed the differentially expressed proteins of K562 and K562/ADM cells and we investigated one of the up-regulated proteins (CRKL) using siRNA to determine its role in K562/ADM cells. METHODS: Altered protein expressions between K562/S (K562 ADM-sensitive cell line) and K562/ADM (K562 multidrug resistant cell line induced by adriamycin) were identified by 2D-DIGE coupled with mass spectrometry. Meanwhile, we confirmed the differential expression of CRKL and Stathmin in both K562 and K562/ADM cells by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, we used RNA interference to silence the CRKL gene expression. RESULTS: Among the 9 differentially expressed proteins, 3 were up-regulated in K562/ADM cells, while 6 were down-regulated in the K562/ADM cells compared with its parent cell line. The expression of CRKL was up-regulated significantly in K562/ADM cells, and it can be decreased by recombinant lentivirus. Moreover, the multidrug resistance of K562/ADM cells was efficiently reversed by silence of CRKL gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: The data provided the differentially expressed proteins in K562 and its resistant cell line and highlights the power of 2D-DIGE for the discovery of resistance markers in cancer. We found CRKL may be a new protein involved in the multidrug resistance of leukaemia cells.","['Shen, Shao-hua', 'Gu, Long-jun', 'Liu, Pei-qing', 'Ye, Xin', 'Chang, Wei-shan', 'Li, Ben-shang']","['Shen SH', 'Gu LJ', 'Liu PQ', 'Ye X', 'Chang WS', 'Li BS']","[""Shanghai Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', '*Proteomics', 'Stathmin/analysis']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2008 Mar 5;121(5):463-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD16+ CD56- NK cells isolated from the patient became CD16+CD56+NKG2D+ when they were cultured in the presence of IL-2. Although cultured CD16+CD56- NK cells retained the killer-cell immunoglobulin receptor (KIR)-ligand (KIR-L) specificity and the patient's leukemic cells expressed corresponding KIR ligands, they killed patient's leukemic cells expressing ULBP2. The cytotoxicity by cultured CD16+CD56- NK cells was abrogated by anti-ULBP2 antibodies. When leukemic cells obtained at relapse after CBT were examined, both the ULBP2 expression and susceptibility to the cultured NK cells decreased in comparison to leukemic cells obtained before CBT. An increase in the CD16+CD56- NK cell count (0.5 x 10(9)/L or more) in PB was observed in seven of 11 (64%) CBT recipients but in none of 13 bone marrow (BM) and eight peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant recipients examined during the similar period after transplantation. These findings suggest an increase in CD16+CD56- NK cells to be a phenomenon unique to CBT recipients and that mature NK cells derived from this NK cell subset may contribute to the killing of leukemic cells expressing NKG2D ligands in vivo.","['Lu, Xuzhang', 'Kondo, Yukio', 'Takamatsu, Hiroyuki', 'Ohata, Kinya', 'Yamazaki, Hirohito', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Akatsuka, Yoshiki', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Lu X', 'Kondo Y', 'Takamatsu H', 'Ohata K', 'Yamazaki H', 'Takami A', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Nakao S']","['Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080319,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (ULBP2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Blood Cells', '*CD56 Antigen', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/*cytology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', '*Receptors, IgG']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/07/30 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1073 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01073.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Jul;81(1):18-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01073.x.

Efforts to understand how these transcription factors function have shown that they have a special property in common. Small changes in the expression of any one of these factors dramatically alter the self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells. In this way, each functions as a molecular rheostat to control the behaviour of ES cells. Recent studies have begun to examine the molecular mechanisms that regulate the levels of these transcription factors. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Mullin and co-workers report that Nanog can self-associate to form dimers. Importantly, they also show that the domain responsible for dimerization is also needed for Nanog to sustain the self-renewal of ES cells in the absence of the cytokine LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor). On the basis of their studies, they propose a novel mechanism for regulating the interactions between Nanog and other nuclear proteins.","['Rizzino, Angie']",['Rizzino A'],"['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 986805 Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-6805, USA. arizzino@unmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article']",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20080479 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20080479 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2008 Apr 15;411(2):e5-7. doi: 10.1042/BJ20080479.,,,10.1042/BJ20080479 [doi],,,,,,,,,,['Biochem J. 2008 Apr 15;411(2):227-31.

To understand the effect of N-ethylation upon PAT selectivity, ethyl groups were appended onto a PAT-selective N (1)-anthracenenylmethyl homospermidine derivative, 1b. Bioevaluation in L1210 murine leukemia cells and in two Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (PAT-active CHO and PAT-deficient CHO-MG) revealed a dramatic decrease in PAT targeting ability upon N (1) or N (5) ethylation of the pharmacophore 1b. Experiments using the amine oxidase inhibitor, aminoguanidine (AG, 2 mM), revealed that the N (9)-ethyl and N (9)-methyl analogues were able to retain their PAT selectivity and cytotoxicity properties in the presence or absence of AG. In contrast, the lead compound 1b (containing a terminal NH 2 group) revealed a dramatic reduction in both its PAT-targeting ability and cytotoxicity in the absence of AG.

This involves diagnosing diseases, predicting disease progression and monitoring the efficacy of treatment modalities. While efforts to identify specific disease biomarkers using a variety of technologies has increased the number of biomarkers or augmented information about them, the effective use of disease-specific biomarkers is still scarce. Here, we report that a high expression of protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), a transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase-like molecule, was discovered in a series of leukemia cell lines using whole cell aptamer selection. With the implementation of a two-step strategy (aptamer selection and biomarker discovery), combined with mass spectrometry, PTK7 was ultimately identified as a potential biomarker for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Specifically, the aptamers for T-ALL cells were selected using the cell-SELEX process, without any prior knowledge of the cell biomarker population, conjugated with magnetic beads and then used to capture and purify their binding targets on the leukemia cell surface. This demonstrates that a panel of molecular aptamers can be easily generated for a specific type of diseased cells. It further demonstrates that this two-step strategy, that is, first selecting cancer cell-specific aptamers and then identifying their binding target proteins, has major clinical implications in that the technique promises to substantially improve the overall effectiveness of biomarker discovery. Specifically, our strategy will enable efficient discovery of new malignancy-related biomarkers, facilitate the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches to cancer, and markedly improve our understanding of cancer biology.","['Shangguan, Dihua', 'Cao, Zehui', 'Meng, Ling', 'Mallikaratchy, Prabodhika', 'Sefah, Kwame', 'Wang, Hui', 'Li, Ying', 'Tan, Weihong']","['Shangguan D', 'Cao Z', 'Meng L', 'Mallikaratchy P', 'Sefah K', 'Wang H', 'Li Y', 'Tan W']","['Department of Chemistry, Shands Cancer Center, UF Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080326,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Aptamers, Peptide)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PTK7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aptamers, Peptide/*chemistry', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'SELEX Aptamer Technique/*methods']",2008/03/28 09:00,2008/09/23 09:00,['2008/03/28 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/pr700894d [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2008 May;7(5):2133-9. doi: 10.1021/pr700894d.

Cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers were treated with imatinib or dasatinib before gamma-irradiation. Inhibition of c-Abl caused an enhanced irradiation-induced mutation frequency and slowdown of DNA repair, whereas imatinib was ineffective in cells expressing a T315I variant of c-Abl. Mutation frequency and repair kinetics were also studied in c-Abl-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) retransfected with wild-type c-Abl (wt-Abl) or a kinase-defect variant of Abl (KD-Abl). Enhanced mutation frequency as well as delayed DNA repair was observed in cells expressing KD-Abl.

Here we report that treatment of Jurkat and U937 leukemia cells with the pan-sphingosine kinase (SphK) inhibitor N,N-dimethylsphingosine to block S1P formation surprisingly caused a large increase in expression of SphK1 concomitant with induction of apoptosis. Another SphK inhibitor, D,L-threo-dihydrosphingosine, also induced apoptosis and produced dramatic increases in SphK1 expression. However, up-regulation of SphK1 was not a specific effect of its inhibition but rather was a consequence of apoptotic stress. The chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, a potent inducer of apoptosis in these cells, also stimulated SphK1 expression and activity and promoted S1P secretion. The caspase inhibitor ZVAD reduced not only doxorubicin-induced lethality but also the increased expression of SphK1 and secretion of S1P. Apoptotic cells secrete chemotactic factors to attract phagocytic cells, and we found that S1P potently stimulated chemotaxis of monocytic THP-1 and U937 cells and primary monocytes and macrophages. Collectively, our data suggest that apoptotic cells may up-regulate SphK1 to produce and secrete S1P that serves as a ""come-and-get-me"" signal for scavenger cells to engulf them in order to prevent necrosis.","['Gude, David R', 'Alvarez, Sergio E', 'Paugh, Steven W', 'Mitra, Poulami', 'Yu, JiaDe', 'Griffiths, Rachael', 'Barbour, Suzanne E', 'Milstien, Sheldon', 'Spiegel, Sarah']","['Gude DR', 'Alvarez SE', 'Paugh SW', 'Mitra P', 'Yu J', 'Griffiths R', 'Barbour SE', 'Milstien S', 'Spiegel S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Massey Cancer Center, VCU School of Medicine, 1101 E.

The Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) gene encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that noncovalently associates with a variety of cytokine receptors and plays a nonredundant role in lymphoid cell precursor proliferation, survival, and differentiation. We report that somatic mutations in JAK1 occur in individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). JAK1 mutations were more prevalent among adult subjects with the T cell precursor ALL, where they accounted for 18% of cases, and were associated with advanced age at diagnosis, poor response to therapy, and overall prognosis. All mutations were missense, and some were predicted to destabilize interdomain interactions controlling the activity of the kinase. Three mutations that were studied promoted JAK1 gain of function and conferred interleukin (IL)-3-independent growth in Ba/F3 cells and/or IL-9-independent resistance to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in T cell lymphoma BW5147 cells. Such effects were associated with variably enhanced activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways. Leukemic cells with mutated JAK1 alleles shared a gene expression signature characterized by transcriptional up-regulation of genes positively controlled by JAK signaling. Our findings implicate dysregulated JAK1 function in ALL, particularly of T cell origin, and point to this kinase as a target for the development of novel antileukemic drugs.","['Flex, Elisabetta', 'Petrangeli, Valentina', 'Stella, Lorenzo', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Hornakova, Tekla', 'Knoops, Laurent', 'Ariola, Cristina', 'Fodale, Valentina', 'Clappier, Emmanuelle', 'Paoloni, Francesca', 'Martinelli, Simone', 'Fragale, Alessandra', 'Sanchez, Massimo', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Messina, Monica', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Camera, Andrea', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Tornesello, Assunta', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Battistini, Angela', 'Cave, Helene', 'Gelb, Bruce D', 'Renauld, Jean-Christophe', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N', 'Foa, Robin', 'Tartaglia, Marco']","['Flex E', 'Petrangeli V', 'Stella L', 'Chiaretti S', 'Hornakova T', 'Knoops L', 'Ariola C', 'Fodale V', 'Clappier E', 'Paoloni F', 'Martinelli S', 'Fragale A', 'Sanchez M', 'Tavolaro S', 'Messina M', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Camera A', 'Pizzolo G', 'Tornesello A', 'Vignetti M', 'Battistini A', 'Cave H', 'Gelb BD', 'Renauld JC', 'Biondi A', 'Constantinescu SN', 'Foa R', 'Tartaglia M']","['Dipartimento di Biologia Cellulare e Neuroscienze, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, 00161, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080324,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology']",2008/03/26 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2008/03/26 09:00'],"['2008/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20072182 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20072182 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2008 Apr 14;205(4):751-8. doi: 10.1084/jem.20072182.

Viral plaque assays demonstrated that transduced cells were significantly refractory to WNV replication, as compared to untransduced control cells (P < 0.05), which correlated with the reduced expression of target viral genes and respective viral proteins.

We then investigated the ability of indomethacin to alleviate the chemoresistance of AML-2/IDAC cells. Treatment with indomethacin alone induced growth arrest, but not the death of AML-2/IDAC cells. However, when AML-2/IDAC cells were treated with combinations of indomethacin and Id/AraC, the cell death and apoptosis rate of AML-2/IDAC cells were significantly increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The combined treatment with indomethacin and Id/AraC caused the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and was also demonstrated to enhance the activities of caspase-3 and -8 in AML-2/IDAC cells. Furthermore, indomethacin down-regulated expression of the ABCA3 and MRP1 genes, which were over-expressed in AML-2/IDAC cells.

We demonstrated that, when used in combination with radiation at a clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy, GDE further suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis as well as micronuclei formation in HL-60 cells, leading to increased cell death. Furthermore, GDE pretreatment not only reduced radiation-induced G2/M-phase arrest, but also induced G1-phase arrest. These events are associated with the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylation and the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB).

In particular the methyl transferase inhibitor 5 Azacytidine, that targets epigenetic changes in MDS, has been shown to be effective in up to 60% of patients in a Phase III randomized controlled trial comparing it with best supportive care and has been licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in all subtypes of MDS. It has been shown to prolong time to leukemic transformation (21 vs 12 months with 3% transforming to leukemia p=0.0001) and is the only disease-modifying drug. Patients with monosomy 7, trisomy 8, and diploid chromosomes appear to particularly benefit with the former deriving sustained remissions. As an outpatient therapy, with an acceptable side effect profile, treatment with Azacytidine needs to be considered in all MDS patients who are eligible for treatment.","['Raj, Kavita', 'Mufti, Ghulam J']","['Raj K', 'Mufti GJ']","['The Department of Haematological Medicine, Kings College London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Ther Clin Risk Manag,Therapeutics and clinical risk management,101253281,,,,2008/03/25 09:00,2008/03/25 09:01,['2008/03/25 09:00'],"['2008/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/25 09:01 [medline]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2147/tcrm.2006.2.4.377 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2006 Dec;2(4):377-88. doi: 10.2147/tcrm.2006.2.4.377.,,,,PMC1936359,,,,,['G84/6222/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

Four or 24 h after O3 exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and the lungs were harvested for Western blotting. Anti-IL-6 Ab caused substantial reductions in O3-induced increases in BAL IL-6 in mice of both genotypes. Four hours following O3, ob/ob mice had increased BAL neutrophils compared with controls, and anti-IL-6-Ab virtually abolished this difference. At 24 h, O3-induced increases in BAL protein and BAL serum albumin were augmented in ob/ob vs. wild-type mice, and anti-IL-6 Ab ablated these obesity-related differences in epithelial barrier injury. O3 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 and STAT-1. There was no effect of obesity on STAT-3 phosphorylation, whereas obesity decreased STAT-1 expression, resulting in reduced STAT-1 phosphorylation. IL-6 neutralization did not alter STAT-3 or STAT-1 phosphorylation in ob/ob or wild-type mice. O3 increased BAL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to a greater extent in obese than in lean mice, and LIF may account for effects on STAT phosphorylation. Our results suggest that IL-6 plays a complex role in pulmonary responses to O3, a role that differs between wild-type and ob/ob mice. Moreover, obesity-related differences in activation of STAT proteins may contribute to some of the differences in the response of obese vs. lean mice.","['Lang, Jason E', 'Williams, Erin S', 'Mizgerd, Joseph P', 'Shore, Stephanie A']","['Lang JE', 'Williams ES', 'Mizgerd JP', 'Shore SA']","['Molecular and Integrative Physiological Sciences Program, Dept. of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, 665 Huntington Ave., Boston, MA 02115-6021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080321,United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

METHODS: The total RNAs of Velcade-treated and control K562 cells were amplified and labeled with fluorescent dyes. The labeled RNAs were hybridized to Agilent Human 1A Microarray, and the raw expression data were processed with Agilent Feature Extraction Software. GeneSifter and GATHER were used for data analysis of the differentially expressed genes to perform gene ontology classification, KEGG pathway analysis, functional protein association network construction and literature mining. RESULTS: Totally 228 differentially expressed genes were identified in the Velcade-treated K562 cells. including 84 up-regulated and 144 down-regulated genes. Chymase 1 gene had the greatest down-regulation by 10.80 folds (log ratio), and interferon alpha-21 gene was also down-regulated by 2.31 folds. Gene ontology classification suggested enhanced aging and leukocyte activity. KEGG pathway analysis showed significant impact of Velcade on JAK-STAT signaling pathway, cytotoxicity mediated by natural killer cells, and antigen processing and presentation pathways. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism, antigen presentation and immune response, as well as JAK-STAT signaling pathway were the major elements of the protein network. Literature mining showed that the differentially expressed genes were strongly associated with terms such as leukemia, apoptosis, cell cycle, proteasome, inhibitor, aging and IkappaB, etc. CONCLUSIONS: Velcade may inhibit the cell survival pathways such as NF-kappaB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways to enhance the cytotoxicity and inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Velcade might also be involved in antigen processing and presentation, immune response and inflammation. Chymase 1 gene is probably the key target of Velcade.","['Liao, Zhi-jun', 'Ma, Wen-li', 'Meng, Wei', 'Liang, Shuang', 'Meng, Fan-yi', 'Zheng, Wen-ling']","['Liao ZJ', 'Ma WL', 'Meng W', 'Liang S', 'Meng FY', 'Zheng WL']","['Institute of Genetic Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. liaozj100@163.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Chymases/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology']",2008/03/25 09:00,2009/04/03 09:00,['2008/03/25 09:00'],"['2008/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2008 Mar;28(3):373-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work demonstrates that the flavonoids quercetin and chrysin cooperate with ATO to induce apoptosis in U937 promonocytes and other human leukemia cell lines (THP-1, HL-60). Co-treatment with ATO plus quercetin caused mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation, stimulated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by cytochrome c and Omi/Htra2 release, XIAP and Bcl-X(L) down-regulation, and Bax activation, and caused caspase-8/Bid activation. Bcl-2 over-expression abrogated cytochrome c release and apoptosis, and also blocked caspase-8 activation. Quercetin and chrysin, alone or with ATO, decreased Akt phosphorylation as well as intracellular GSH content. GSH depletion was regulated at the level of L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO)-sensitive enzyme activity, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine failed both to restore GSH content and to prevent apoptosis. Treatment with BSO caused GSH depletion and potentiated ATO-provoked apoptosis, but did not affect apoptosis induction by ara-C and cisplatin. As an exception, ATO plus quercetin failed to elicit Akt de-phosphorylation and GSH depletion in NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, and correspondingly exhibited low cooperative effect in inducing apoptosis in this cell line. It is concluded that GSH depletion explains at least in part the selective potentiation of ATO toxicity by quercetin, and that this flavonoid might be used to increase the clinical efficacy of the antileukemic drug.","['Ramos, Adrian M', 'Aller, Patricio']","['Ramos AM', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040-Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080216,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '3CN01F5ZJ5 (chrysin)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2008/03/25 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2008/03/25 09:00'],"['2007/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00103-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.02.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 May 15;75(10):1912-23. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.02.007.

It is a clinically heterogeneous disease, with survival ranging from a few months to decades. The mutation status of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgVH) gene has significantly improved prediction of the risk for disease progression. We investigated the frequency and mutation status of IgVH gene expression in Chinese patients with CLL. METHODS: IgVH gene segments usage and mutation status were investigated by multiplex RT-PCR, and the relationship between IgVH somatic mutation status and the expression of CD38 and ZAP-70 was analyzed in 65 CLL patients. RESULTS: Forty-five (69.2%) patients had mutated IgVH, and 20 (30.8%) had unmutated IgVH. The most frequently expressed VH gene family was found to be VH3 (47.7%) followed by VH4 (40%), VH1 (6.2%), VH2 (4.6%) and VH7 (1.5%), with no expression of VH5 or VH6 gene families. VH1-69 and VH3-21 which commonly overused in Western CLL were very low in our cohort. IgVH gene mutation status was significantly associated with the expression of CD38. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of IgVH gene families indicates significant difference in Chinese CLL patients compared with Western patients, suggesting involvement of ethnic and/or environmental factors in CLL disease initiation. The expression of them may be simple and reliable surrogates for the identification of IgVH mutations.","['Chen, Lijuan', 'Zhang, Yaping', 'Zheng, Wenjuan', 'Wu, Yujie', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Fan, Lei', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jianyong']","['Chen L', 'Zhang Y', 'Zheng W', 'Wu Y', 'Qiao C', 'Fan L', 'Xu W', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080321,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'China', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/ethnology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2008/03/25 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/03/25 09:00'],"['2007/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00082-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.02.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Oct;32(10):1491-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.02.005.

It has a very variable course, with survival ranging from months to decades. Major progress has been made in identification of molecular and cellular markers that could predict disease progression in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In particular, the mutational profile of immunoglobulin genes and some cytogenetic abnormalities are important predictors of prognosis. However, these advances have raised new questions about the biology, prognosis, and management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, some of which are addressed here. In particular, we discuss how better understanding of the function of the B-cell receptor, the nature of genetic lesions, and the balance between proliferation and apoptosis have affected our ability to assess prognosis and to manage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Available treatments generally induce remission, although nearly all patients relapse, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia remains an incurable disease. Advances in molecular biology have enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and, together with development of new therapeutic agents, have made management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia more rational and more effective than previously. Unfortunately, we know of no way that chronic lymphocytic leukaemia can be prevented.

After 4h of treatment, chelerythrine induced a dose-dependent decrease in the cell viability with IC50 of 2.6 microM as shown by MTT reduction assay. Dihydrochelerythrine appeared to be less cytotoxic since the viability of cells exposed to 20 microM dihydrochelerythrine for 24h was reduced only to 53%. Decrease in the viability induced by both alkaloids was accompanied by apoptotic events including the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-9 and -3, and appearance of cells with sub-G1 DNA. Moreover, chelerythrine, but not dihydrochelerythrine, elevated the activity of caspase-8. A dose-dependent induction of apoptosis and necrosis by chelerythrine and dihydrochelerythrine was confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide dual staining flow cytometry.

CML, when left untreated, progresses to a blast phase during which the disease turns aggressive and shows poor response to known treatment regimens. We have studied a Siddha herbal agent, Semecarpus anacardium Linn. nut milk extract (SA) for its antileukemic activity and its effect on the changes in energy metabolism in leukemic mice. Leukemia was induced in BALB/c mice by tail vein injection of BCR-ABL(+) 12B1 murine leukemia cell line. This resulted in an aggressive leukemia, similar to CML in blast crisis, myeloid subtype, confirmed by histopathological study and RT-PCR for the p210 mRNA in the peripheral blood, spleen and liver. Leukemia-bearing mice showed a significant increase in lipid peroxides, glycolytic enzymes, a decrease in gluconeogenic enzymes and significant decrease in the activities of TCA cycle and respiratory chain enzymes as compared to control animals. SA treatment was compared with standard drug imatinib mesylate. SA administration to leukemic animals resulted in clearance of the leukemic cells from the bone marrow and internal organs on histopathological examination and this was confirmed by RT-PCR for the p210 mRNA. Treatment with SA significantly reversed the changes seen in the levels of the lipid peroxides, the glycolytic enzymes, the gluconeogenic enzymes and the mitochondrial enzymes. These effects are probably due to the flavonoids, polyphenols and other compounds present in SA which result in total regression of leukemia and correction of the alterations in energy metabolism.

Sodium salicylate (NaSal, the natural deacetylated form of aspirin) induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells; high dose (20mM) of NaSal-induced apoptosis, whereas low dose (2-10mM) induced cell cycle arrest. We found that NaSal-activated Akt/PKB, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK signal cascades. Twenty micromolar of NaSal-induced apoptotic response of A549 cells was enhanced by the PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin) and in a less extent by the MEK1/2 inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059), whereas it was suppressed by the p38MAPK inhibitor (SB203580). Furthermore, simultaneous inhibition of the Akt/PKB and ERK1/2 signal cascades could lower the dose of NaSal to induce apoptosis to 2mM in A549 lung cancer cells. Similar enhancement was observed in cells treated with 2mM NaSal and 100muM genistein, an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are upstream of PI3K and MEK1/2 signaling. We further demonstrated that NAG-1 plays a key role in apoptosis by NaSal-based combined treatment. Collectively, our findings indicate that inhibition of the pro-survival Akt/PKB and ERK1/2 signaling may increase the chemopreventive effects of NaSal and combined treatment of two natural compounds (NaSal and genistein) results in a highly synergistic induction of apoptosis, thereby increasing the chemopreventive effects of NaSal against cancer.","['Kim, Cho Hee', 'Kim, Min Young', 'Moon, Ji Young', 'Hwang, Ji Won', 'Lee, Su Yeon', 'Joo, Young Mi', 'Han, Song Iy', 'Park, Hye Gyeong', 'Kang, Ho Sung']","['Kim CH', 'Kim MY', 'Moon JY', 'Hwang JW', 'Lee SY', 'Joo YM', 'Han SI', 'Park HG', 'Kang HS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, and Research Institute of Genetic Engineering, Pusan National University, Pusan 609-735, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080212,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Elafin)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GDF15 protein, human)', '0 (Growth Differentiation Factor 15)', '0 (PI3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'WIQ1H85SYP (Sodium Salicylate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Elafin/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Differentiation Factor 15', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sodium Salicylate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2008/03/25 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/03/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00098-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.02.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 May 1;75(9):1751-60. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.02.002.

Galloylated catechins; (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), (-)-gallocatechin-3-O-gallate (GCG), (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG), and (-)-catechin-3-O-gallate (CG) showed the cell-surface binding to the human basophilic KU812 cells by surface plasmon resonance analysis, but their non-galloylated forms did not. Binding activities of pyrogallol-type catechins (EGCG and GCG) were higher than those of catechol-type catechins (ECG and CG). These patterns were also observed in their inhibitory effects on histamine release. Previously, we have reported that biological activities of EGCG are mediated through the binding to the cell-surface 67kDa laminin receptor (67LR). Downregulation of 67LR expression caused a reduction of both activities of galloylated catechins. These results suggest that both the galloyl moiety and the B-ring hydroxylation pattern contribute to the exertion of biological activities of tea catechins and their 67LR-dependencies.","['Fujimura, Yoshinori', 'Umeda, Daisuke', 'Yamada, Koji', 'Tachibana, Hirofumi']","['Fujimura Y', 'Umeda D', 'Yamada K', 'Tachibana H']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', '0 (Tea)', '0C056HB16M (gallocatechin gallate)', '78OW2GLG8Q (catechin gallate)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', '92587OVD8Z (epicatechin gallate)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",IM,"['Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Basophils/metabolism', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glycosylation', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Receptors, Laminin/*physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tea/*chemistry']",2008/03/25 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/03/25 09:00'],"['2007/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(08)00120-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.abb.2008.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2008 Aug 15;476(2):133-8. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2008.03.002.

METHODS: Cell proliferation was assessed after exposure to rapamycin by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. The proteins important for cell cycle progression and Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling cascade were assessed by Western blotting. Telomerase activity was quantified by telomeric repeat amplication protocol assay. The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA levels were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Rapamycin inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat, induced G1 phase arrest, unregulated the protein level of p21 as well as p27, and downregulated cyclinD3, phospho-p70s6k, and phospho-s6, but had no effect on apoptosis. Treatment with rapamycin reduced telomerase activity, and reduced hTERT mRNA and protein expression.

We studied several clinical and laboratory features of 108 first diagnosed AML patients in relation with their prognosis. Patients with favourable prognostic features were excluded from the study. This study focused on the prognostic impact of PLT counts and related molecular biology in AML patients at initial diagnosis. In particular, the PLT counts were correlated with the endogenous production of thrombopoietin (TPO), c-mpl expression, CD34+ leukemic blast cell proportion, cytogenetics, and a prognostic correlation was established. We found that the most favorable prognosis appeared in the AML patient group with PLTs <25x10(9)/l and correlated to cytogenetic findings (normal or abnormal karyotypes), while by far the most unfavorable prognosis was found in the patient group with PLTs > or =130x10(9)/l independent of the corresponding cytogenetics. It was demonstrated that AML patients with normal or elevated PLT counts at first presentation, may constitute a distinct patient group with particular characteristics such as higher levels of endogenous TPO production, high expression of CD34+ leukemic blast cells, higher expression of c-mpl and consequently low response to chemotherapy and a very poor prognosis.

Although recent experimental data revealed the proapoptotic potency of piceatannol, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-leukemic activity have not yet been studied in detail. This study examined the effects of piceatannol on the growth of the human leukemia cell line U937. The results showed that piceatannol inhibits the viability of U937 cells by inducing apoptosis, as evidenced by the formation of apoptotic bodies, DNA fragmentation and the accumulation of the sub-G1 phase. RT-PCR and immunoblotting data showed that treating the cells with piceatannol caused the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and cIAP-2 expression. Piceatannol-induced apoptosis was also associated with the proteolytic activation of caspase-3, and the degradation/cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase protein. z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3-specific inhibitor, blocked the activation of caspase-3 and increased the survival of the piceatannol-treated U937 cells, suggesting that caspase-3 activation is essential for piceatannol-induced apoptosis.","['Kim, Yeong Hoon', 'Park, Cheol', 'Lee, Jeong Ok', 'Kim, Gi Young', 'Lee, Won Ho', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Ryu, Chung Ho']","['Kim YH', 'Park C', 'Lee JO', 'Kim GY', 'Lee WH', 'Choi YH', 'Ryu CH']","['Division of Applied Life Science, Institute of Agriculture and Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Stilbenes)', ""6KS3LS0D4F (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene)"", 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*physiology', 'Caspase 9/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2008/03/22 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2008/03/22 09:00'],"['2008/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2008 Apr;19(4):961-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some patients with SCID-X1 developed retroviral vector-mediated leukemia after treatment. The selective growth advantage of gene-modified cells in patients with SCID-X1 suggests that the transgene may have played a role in leukemogenesis. Here we report that 2 of 2 dogs and 1 of 2 macaques developed myeloid leukemia approximately 2 years after being transplanted with cells that overexpressed homeobox B4 (HOXB4) and cells transduced with a control gammaretroviral vector that did not express HOXB4. The leukemic cells had dysregulated expression of oncogenes, a block in myeloid differentiation, and overexpression of HOXB4. HOXB4 knockdown restored differentiation in leukemic cells, suggesting involvement of HOXB4. In contrast, leukemia did not arise from the cells carrying the control gammaretroviral vector. In addition, leukemia did not arise in 5 animals with high-level marking and polyclonal long-term repopulation following transplantation with cells transduced with an identical gammaretrovirus vector backbone expressing methylguanine methyltransferase. These findings, combined with the absence of leukemia in many other large animals transplanted with cells transduced with gammaretroviral vectors expressing genes other than HOXB4, show that HOXB4 overexpression poses a significant risk of leukemogenesis. Our data thus suggest the continued need for caution in genetic manipulation of repopulating cells, particularly when the transgene might impart an intrinsic growth advantage.","['Zhang, Xiao-Bing', 'Beard, Brian C', 'Trobridge, Grant D', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Sale, George E', 'Sud, Reeteka', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter']","['Zhang XB', 'Beard BC', 'Trobridge GD', 'Wood BL', 'Sale GE', 'Sud R', 'Humphries RK', 'Kiem HP']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Macaca nemestrina', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",2008/03/22 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2008/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI34371 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2008 Apr;118(4):1502-10. doi: 10.1172/JCI34371.,,,10.1172/JCI34371 [doi],PMC2268879,,,,,"['R01 HL084345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL74162/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL84345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL053750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK047754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL074162/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['J Clin Invest. 2008 Apr;118(4):1350-3.

In order to investigate the telomerase activity in patients with CLL and its correlation to commonly used morphologic prognostic markers, 38 frozen blood lymphocyte samples from patients with CLL and 47 age-matched controls were investigated for telomerase activity using the Telomerase PCR ELISA-plus kit from Roche. Trepanobiopsies from the same patients were analysed for the type of bone marrow infiltration as well. Analysis showed highly variable Relative Telomerase Activity (RTA) in B-CLL patients, ranging from comparable or even lower than the mean RTA of controls (in Binet A stage patients) to manifold increase in the majority of patients with advanced stage disease. The sex and age of the patients showed no influence on RTA in CLL patients, in contrast to the control group, where the age influenced telomerase activity.

Here, we show that some SOCS members are induced, while others are constitutively expressed, in retina and examine whether persistent elevation of SOCS levels in retina by chronic inflammation or cellular stress predisposes to developing insulin resistance in retina, a condition implicated in diabetic retinopathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SOCS-mediated insulin resistance and neuroprotection in retina were investigated in 1) an experimental uveitis model, 2) SOCS1 transgenic rats, 3) insulin-deficient diabetic rats, 4) retinal cells depleted of SOCS6 or overexpressing SOCS1/SOCS3, and 5) oxidative stress and light-induced retinal degeneration models. RESULTS: We show that constitutive expression of SOCS6 protein in retinal neurons may improve glucose metabolism, while elevated SOCS1/SOCS3 expression during uveitis induces insulin resistance in neuroretina. SOCS-mediated insulin resistance, as indicated by its inhibition of basally active phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling in retina, is validated in retina-specific SOCS1 transgenic rats and retinal cells overexpressing SOCS1/SOCS3. We further show that the SOCS3 level is elevated in retina by oxidative stress, metabolic stress of insulin-deficient diabetes, or light-induced retinal damage and protects ganglion cells from apoptosis, suggesting that upregulation of SOCS3 may be a common physiologic response of neuroretinal cells to cellular stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest two-sided roles of SOCS proteins in retina. Whereas SOCS proteins may improve glucose metabolism, mitigate deleterious effects of inflammation, and promote neuroprotection, persistent SOCS3 expression caused by chronic inflammation or cellular stress can induce insulin resistance and inhibit neurotrophic factors, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and insulin, that are essential for retinal cell survival.","['Liu, Xuebin', 'Mameza, Marie G', 'Lee, Yun Sang', 'Eseonu, Chikezie I', 'Yu, Cheng-Rong', 'Kang Derwent, Jennifer J', 'Egwuagu, Charles E']","['Liu X', 'Mameza MG', 'Lee YS', 'Eseonu CI', 'Yu CR', 'Kang Derwent JJ', 'Egwuagu CE']","['Molecular Immunology Section, Laboratory of Immunology, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1857, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20080320,United States,Diabetes,Diabetes,0372763,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SOCS6 protein, rat)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Socs6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Insulin Resistance/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Rats', 'Retina/*cytology/*physiology/physiopathology', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2008/03/22 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/03/22 09:00'],"['2008/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['db07-1761 [pii]', '10.2337/db07-1761 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes. 2008 Jun;57(6):1651-8. doi: 10.2337/db07-1761.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 195 patients who received ASCT between 1985 and June 2005 were reviewed. Median time from first treatment to ASCT was 2.6 years (0.4-27.3). Demography at ASCT was 61% stage IV, median age 31 years (18-69), median prior treatment (tx) regimens 3 (2-7), median Hasenclever index 3 (0-6); 150 patients had responding disease [54 complete remission (CR), 96 partial remission (PR)], and 45 patients had untested relapse/refractory disease. RESULTS: Post-ASCT, 61% (119/195) patients attained CR with an overall response (CR + PR) of 85%. Twelve patients had nonrelapse mortality. Of 119 patients attaining CR, 27 relapsed: 3 after attaining CR for >5 years and 1 after attaining CR for >10 years. Median overall survival (OS)/progression-free survival (PFS) from ASCT was 9 years/2.9 years. Five-year OS/PFS was 55% of 44% and 10-year OS/PFS was 49.4% of 37% for whole group. Twenty (10%) patients developed second cancer (seven secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)). Probability of developing second cancer at 10 years was 14.7% (95% confidence interval 8.9% to 23.8%) and 24.8% at 19 years. CONCLUSION: These data provide the longest follow-up reported for patients receiving ASCT for relapsed/refractory HL. In addition to previously described prognostic factors, our data show that Hasenclever index <3 influences outcome favorably and attaining CR at ASCT leads to a better outcome.","['Sirohi, B', 'Cunningham, D', 'Powles, R', 'Murphy, F', 'Arkenau, T', 'Norman, A', 'Oates, J', 'Wotherspoon, A', 'Horwich, A']","['Sirohi B', 'Cunningham D', 'Powles R', 'Murphy F', 'Arkenau T', 'Norman A', 'Oates J', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Horwich A']","['Lymphoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.', 'Lymphoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.

If this difference in tumorigenicity of cancer cells also occurs in patients, then the ability to enrich for cancer stem cells lays an important groundwork for future studies where mechanisms involved in cancer stem cells can now be investigated.","['Cho, Robert W', 'Clarke, Michael F']","['Cho RW', 'Clarke MF']","['Department of Pediatrics Division of Stem Cell Transplantation, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94304-1334, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080319,England,Curr Opin Genet Dev,Current opinion in genetics & development,9111375,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/growth & development', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/etiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology']",2008/03/22 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-437X(08)00022-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gde.2008.01.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Genet Dev. 2008 Feb;18(1):48-53. doi: 10.1016/j.gde.2008.01.017.

RESULTS: Extracts from lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.), and sage (Salvia officinalis L.) exhibited a high and concentration-dependent activity against the infection of HIV-1 in T-cell lines, primary macrophages, and in ex vivo tonsil histocultures with 50% inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.004%. The aqueous Lamiaceae extracts did not or only at very high concentrations interfere with cell viability. Mechanistically, extract exposure of free virions potently and rapidly inhibited infection, while exposure of surface-bound virions or target cells alone had virtually no antiviral effect. In line with this observation, a virion-fusion assay demonstrated that HIV-1 entry was drastically impaired following treatment of particles with Lamiaceae extracts, and the magnitude of this effect at the early stage of infection correlated with the inhibitory potency on HIV-1 replication. Extracts were active against virions carrying diverse envelopes (X4 and R5 HIV-1, vesicular stomatitis virus, ecotropic murine leukemia virus), but not against a non-enveloped adenovirus. Following exposure to Lamiaceae extracts, the stability of virions as well as virion-associated levels of envelope glycoprotein and processed Gag protein were unaffected, while, surprisingly, sucrose-density equilibrium gradient analyses disclosed a marked increase of virion density. CONCLUSION: Aqueous extracts from Lamiaceae can drastically and rapidly reduce the infectivity of HIV-1 virions at non-cytotoxic concentrations. An extract-induced enhancement of the virion's density prior to its surface engagement appears to be the most likely mode of action. By harbouring also a strong activity against herpes simplex virus type 2, these extracts may provide a basis for the development of novel virucidal topical microbicides.","['Geuenich, Silvia', 'Goffinet, Christine', 'Venzke, Stephanie', 'Nolkemper, Silke', 'Baumann, Ingo', 'Plinkert, Peter', 'Reichling, Jurgen', 'Keppler, Oliver T']","['Geuenich S', 'Goffinet C', 'Venzke S', 'Nolkemper S', 'Baumann I', 'Plinkert P', 'Reichling J', 'Keppler OT']","['Department of Virology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

Historical data are used to obtain an informative prior on covariate main effects, with uninformative priors assumed for all dose effect parameters. Elicited limits on the probabilities of efficacy and toxicity for each of a representative set of covariate vectors are used to construct bounding functions that determine the acceptability of each dose for each patient. Elicited outcome probability pairs that are equally desirable for a reference patient are used to define two different posterior criteria, either of which may be used to select an optimal covariate-specific dose for each patient. Because the dose selection criteria are covariate specific, different patients may receive different doses at the same point in the trial, and the set of eligible patients may change adaptively during the trial.

SCPD is a rare, chronic, sterile pustular eruption that was first described by Sneddon and Wilkinson in 1956. The primary lesions are pea-sized pustules classically described as half-pustular, half-clear flaccid fluid blisters. Histologically the salient feature is a subcorneal accumulation of neutrophils, suggesting the presence of chemoattractants such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha in the uppermost epidermis. However, to date its exact pathophysiology is unknown. Cases in association with pyoderma gangrenosum, benign monoclonal IgA gammopathy and multiple myeloma are well documented. There are anecdotal reports of SCPD associated with other internal malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, thymoma, apudoma and epidermoid carcinoma of the lung. The treatment of choice is dapsone. Therapeutic alternatives include retinoids, phototreatment with psoralen ultraviolet (UV) A, broadband or narrow band UVB and corticosteroids. Anecdotal uses of tacalcitol, ketoconazole, azithromycin, tetracycline, minocycline, vitamin E, ciclosporin, colchicine, mizoribine, mebhydrolin, infliximab and adalimumab with mycophenolate mofetil have all been reported.","['Cheng, S', 'Edmonds, E', 'Ben-Gashir, M', 'Yu, R C']","['Cheng S', 'Edmonds E', 'Ben-Gashir M', 'Yu RC']","['Departments of Dermatology and Histopathology, University College London Hospital, London, UK. suzanne.cheng@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080318,England,Clin Exp Dermatol,Clinical and experimental dermatology,7606847,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '8W5C518302 (Dapsone)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Blister/etiology', 'Dapsone/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin A/metabolism', 'Male', 'Paraproteinemias/diagnosis', '*Pyoderma Gangrenosum/drug therapy/pathology', '*Skin Diseases, Vesiculobullous/drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/03/22 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/03/22 09:00'],"['2008/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['CED2706 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2230.2008.02706.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Dermatol. 2008 May;33(3):229-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2230.2008.02706.x.

Animal and human studies suggest that newly diagnosed APL patients can be cured using As(2)O(3) combined with ATRA. Cyclooxygenases are involved in prostaglandins and thromboxane synthesis. We have recently demonstrated that ATRA induces cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) expression and prostaglandin synthesis in NB4 cells and in blasts from patients with APL. In the present study we investigated the effect of ATRA and As(2)O(3) co-treatment on COX-1 expression and prostaglandin formation and tested the effect of the COX-1/COX-2 nonselective inhibitor indomethacin on cell differentiation. Arsenic treatment of NB4 cells resulted in a partial but significant reduction of ATRA-dependent induction of COX-1 expression and activity. Pretreatment of NB4 cells with indomethacin significantly impaired ATRA/As(2)O(3)-induced differentiation, as assessed by cell morphology, nitroblue tetrazolium test or CD11c expression. PGE(2) reversed the negative effect of indomethacin on differentiation of ATRA/As(2)O(3)-treated NB4 cells. In conclusion, COX-1 contributes to ATRA-dependent maturation of NB4 cells and is affected by As(2)O(3). These results also suggest that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be avoided in APL patients treated with the combination of ATRA and As(2)O(3).","['Habib, A', 'Hamade, E', 'Mahfouz, R', 'Nasrallah, M S', 'de The, H', 'Bazarbachi, A']","['Habib A', 'Hamade E', 'Mahfouz R', 'Nasrallah MS', 'de The H', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Biochemistry, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon. ah31@aub.edu.lb']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080320,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD11c Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclooxygenase 1/*metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/*metabolism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/03/21 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/03/21 09:00'],"['2008/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200859 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.59 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jun;22(6):1125-30. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.59.

During imatinib treatment, cells are selected in some patients with BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations that render decreased drug sensitivity. In addition, some patients express deletion mutants of BCR-ABL, apparently due to missplicing. Most commonly these deletion mutants lack a significant portion of the kinase domain that includes the P-loop. We describe a screen for such mutations in patients with CML and demonstrate that they are not oncogenic and are catalytically inactive. We hypothesized that coexpressing BCR-ABL deletion mutants has a dominant-negative effect on the native form through heterocomplex formation. However, upon coexpression of native and deletion mutant BCR-ABL in Ba/F3 cells, growth factor independence is maintained and signaling is activated normally. Despite this, these cells have increased imatinib sensitivity compared to cells expressing only native BCR-ABL. Thus, it will be important to investigate the prognostic impact of coexpression of deletion mutants in CML patients during imatinib treatment.","['Sherbenou, D W', 'Hantschel, O', 'Turaga, L', 'Kaupe, I', 'Willis, S', 'Bumm, T', 'Press, R D', 'Superti-Furga, G', 'Druker, B J', 'Deininger, M W']","['Sherbenou DW', 'Hantschel O', 'Turaga L', 'Kaupe I', 'Willis S', 'Bumm T', 'Press RD', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Druker BJ', 'Deininger MW']","['Cell and Developmental Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080320,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2008/03/21 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/03/21 09:00'],"['2008/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200865 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.65 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jun;22(6):1184-90. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.65.

To determine the consequences of reducing PU.1 concentration during hematopoiesis, we analyzed mice with two distinct hypomorphic alleles of Sfpi1 that produce PU.1 at approximately 20% (BN) or approximately 2% (Blac) of wild-type levels. Myeloid development was impaired in these mice, but less severely than in Sfpi1 null mice. To identify the downstream target genes that respond to changes in PU.1 concentration, we analyzed ex vivo interleukin-3 dependent myeloid cell lines established from Sfpi1(BN/BN), Sfpi1(Blac/Blac) and Sfpi1(-/-) fetal liver cells. Unexpectedly, many T-cell and natural killer cell genes were expressed in Sfpi1(-/-) cells and repressed in a dose-dependent manner in Sfpi1(Blac/Blac) and Sfpi1(BN/BN) cells. This pattern of dose-dependent T/NK-cell gene repression also occurred in ex vivo interleukin-7 dependent progenitor B cell lines.

Therefore, leukemic cells were isolated from the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood (PB) of 57 ALL patients. Immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry and mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR. Overexpression of Ror1 mRNA was detected in 23 of 57 (40%) ALL patients. A similar expression pattern was observed in ALL cell lines, with 4 of 12 (33%) being positive. Stimulation of normal PB mononuclear cells with pokeweed mitogen and phorbol myristate acetate induced substantially higher Ror1 mRNA expression compared to unstimulated cultured cells.

Two major myeloid DC subsets are recognized: interstitial DC (IDC) that infiltrate connective tissues and Langerhans cells (LC) that line epithelial surfaces. Yet, functional differences between IDC and LC remain to be defined. We recently showed that the CD34(+) acute myeloid leukemia cell line MUTZ-3 supports differentiation of both DC-SIGN(+) IDC and Langerin-positive Birbeck granule-expressing LC. By comparative functional characterization of MUTZ-3 IDC and MUTZ-3 LC, we aimed to elucidate the relative abilities of these two DC subsets to induce a specific T cell response and reveal the more suitable candidate for use as a clinical vehicle of tumor vaccines. Although mature LC and IDC displayed comparable lymph node-homing potential, mature LC showed higher allogeneic T cell stimulatory capacity. Nevertheless, IDC supported the induction of tumor Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells at an overall higher efficiency. This might be related to the observed inability of LC to release T cell stimulatory cytokines such as IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-15. Although this inability did not result in a detectable deviation in the cytokine expression profile of primed T cells, transduction with IL-12p70 significantly improved priming efficiency of LC, and ensured a functional equivalence with IDC in this regard. In conclusion, except for the inability of LC to release distinct type 1 T cell stimulatory cytokines, in vitro function of LC and IDC suggests comparable abilities of both subsets for the in vivo induction of antitumor T cells.","['Santegoets, Saskia J A M', 'Bontkes, Hetty J', 'Stam, Anita G M', 'Bhoelan, Farien', 'Ruizendaal, Janneke J', 'van den Eertwegh, Alfons J M', 'Hooijberg, Erik', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D']","['Santegoets SJ', 'Bontkes HJ', 'Stam AG', 'Bhoelan F', 'Ruizendaal JJ', 'van den Eertwegh AJ', 'Hooijberg E', 'Scheper RJ', 'de Gruijl TD']","['Department of Pathology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Islets of Langerhans/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/immunology', '*Models, Immunological', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Skin/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2008/03/21 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/03/21 09:00'],"['2008/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['180/7/4540 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.180.7.4540 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Apr 1;180(7):4540-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.180.7.4540.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1 negatively regulates the number of immature hematopoietic cells in adult hematopoiesis, whereas it is required for megakaryocytic maturation and lymphocytic development. However, it remains yet to be determined how AML1 contributes to homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To address this issue, we analyzed in detail HSC function in the absence of AML1. Notably, cells in the Hoechst 33342 side population fraction are increased in number in AML1-deficient bone marrow, which suggests enrichment of quiescent HSCs. We also found an increase in HSC number within the AML1-deficient bone marrow using limiting dilution bone marrow transplantation assays.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 237 patients with ESFT treated at our institution from September 1979 through to February 2004. Cumulative incidence (CI) of SM by the type of malignancy and treatment was estimated. RESULTS: Twelve patients with SM were identified. Secondary leukaemia (SL) developed in 8 patients (2 ALL, 6 MDS/AML), a median 2.6 years (range 1.4-19.6 years) after diagnosis of ESFT. Four patients had secondary solid tumours, a median 8.0 years (range 7.4-9.4 years) after the ESFT diagnosis. Five- and 10-year estimates of the CI of SM were 3.0+/-1.1% and 4.7+/-1.5%, respectively. Patients treated on recent protocols with higher cumulative doses or an increased dose intensity of alkylators and epipodophyllotoxins and the use of G-CSF had a higher estimated CI of SL than those in earlier studies (5-year CI 6.4+/-2.4% versus 0.0+/-0.0%, respectively, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESFT are at risk for SM after treatment. The cumulative incidence of SM is higher with the current treatment protocols and may be related to the intensification of chemotherapeutic agents.","['Navid, Fariba', 'Billups, Catherine', 'Liu, Tiebin', 'Krasin, Matthew J', 'Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos']","['Navid F', 'Billups C', 'Liu T', 'Krasin MJ', 'Rodriguez-Galindo C']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

METHODS: Review and summary of publications on gemtuzumab ozogamicin indexed in the PubMed electronic database. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin has shown moderate activity as a single agent in patients with CD33-positive refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia, with more promising results in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. The side effect profile may be an improvement on conventional chemotherapy, except for a higher frequency of veno-occlusive disease or sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, especially after a subsequent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Because of the different mechanisms of action and non-overlapping toxicities, the integration of this immunoconjugate with standard chemotherapy is a rational approach, and Phase III trials are ongoing both in the induction and in the post-remission settings.","['Stasi, Roberto']",['Stasi R'],"['Regina Apostolorum Hospital, Department of Medical Sciences, Via S.

We herein investigated the mechanisms that are related to PD-induced antiproliferation and cell death in human leukemia cells (U937, THP-1 and K562 cells). Cell growth was assessed with proliferation assays, cell counting, flow cytometry, phase contrast microscopy and Western blot assay. Microtubule (MT) formation was measured with immunofluorescent staining and in vitro tubulin polymerization assay. Apoptotic effect was analyzed by assessing increase in annexin V-staining and caspase-3 activity. Treatment of synchronized leukemia cells with varying concentrations of PD resulted in significant mitotic arrest and endoreduplication (END) via downregulation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 and upregulation of wee1 expression, and elevated the Cdk2 protein via downregulation of p21 within 48 hr. We also researched PD's induction of polyploidy through the MT polymerization. Immunofluorescent microscopy and Western blot analysis revealed that PD significantly caused MT polymerization in leukemia cells. We also found that very high concentrations of PD (>200 microM) were required to directly induce MT polymerization in vitro. Finally, PD exposure induced apoptosis in U937 cells through caspase-3-dependent PARP and lamin A cleavage. We conclude that the primary antileukemia activity of PD is induction of endoreduplication and mitotic arrest, as a consequence of suppressing spindle MT dynamics and in promoting apoptosis in human leukemia cells.","['Kim, Mun-Ock', 'Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Lee, Jae-Dong', 'Kim, Nam Deuk', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Kim MO', 'Moon DO', 'Choi YH', 'Lee JD', 'Kim ND', 'Kim GY']","['Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'CWJ06TA2GI (platycodin D)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",2008/03/21 09:00,2008/08/07 09:00,['2008/03/21 09:00'],"['2008/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23442 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Jun 15;122(12):2674-81. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23442.,,,10.1002/ijc.23442 [doi],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Finally Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected and retinal necrosis resolved after specific treatment. However, visual acuity remains poor because of optic nerve atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: The polymerase chain reaction is an important diagnostic tool for differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients suffering from necrotising retinopathy. If resistance to therapy is noted atypical ocular toxoplasmosis should be considered.

A further 118 cases of AML or MDS post PV, in whom type of therapy during active PV and cytogenetic findings during AML or MDS were reported, were collected from the literature. AML or MDS developed in our own series after 1-30 years with a fairly constant rate (two cases per year). The most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities were +1q, -5, 5q-, -7, 7q-, +8, +9, 11q-, 13q-, and 20q-.

Half of the patients treated with hydroxyurea alone showed a -5 or 5q- abnormality. In patients treated with phlebotomy alone, +8 and +9 were the most frequent findings.

Our objective was to characterize the deletion size among 38 MDS and MPD patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes and to define commonly deleted and retained regions on chromosome 20. Patients were distributed in three groups according to the World Health Organization classification: MDS (22 patients), MPD (12 patients) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (four patients). FISH with centromeric, subtelomeric, and unique sequence probes was performed to characterize the deletion whereas its size was delineated using BAC clones. All 38 deletions were found to be interstitial. A commonly deleted region was identified for each of the three groups; it varied from 6.62 to 10.4 Mb and showed considerable overlapping. Two commonly retained regions (CRR), also showing overlapping, were identified in all three groups, one in the centromeric region, the other in the telomeric region. The deletion size is highly variable, with no apparent recurrent breakpoint. The deletion may result in the loss of one or several tumor suppressor genes but the target genes remain unknown. Loss of genes plays an important part in the myeloid leukemic process associated with del(20q).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We allocated 983 patients with prostate cancer with high-risk features to receive 2 years of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without six cycles of mitoxantrone (12 mg/m(2)) after prostatectomy. RESULTS: In January 2007, SWOG 9921 was closed to further accrual after three cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were reported of a total of 487 patients in the mitoxantrone treatment arm. The key cytogenetic features of these cases included inv(16) in the first case, t(15;17) in the second, and del(5) in the third case. Time from the start of mitoxantrone to the detection of AML was 13, 48, and 72 months, respectively. Before SWOG 9921, there were no cases of mitoxantrone-induced AML reported in patients treated for prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: The emergence of this possible pattern of secondary malignancy emphasizes the importance of randomized controlled trials in defining safety and efficacy of new approaches for patients in the adjuvant setting.","['Flaig, Thomas W', 'Tangen, Catherine M', 'Hussain, Maha H A', 'Stadler, Walter M', 'Raghavan, Derek', 'Crawford, E David', 'Glode, L Michael']","['Flaig TW', 'Tangen CM', 'Hussain MH', 'Stadler WM', 'Raghavan D', 'Crawford ED', 'Glode LM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Mail Stop 8117, P.O.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1993 and December 1999, 1,395 leukemic children were included in the French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 93 study. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (3.8%) had a leukemic induction failure (LIF) after three- or four-drug induction therapy. In univariate analysis, high WBC count (P = .001), mediastinal mass (P = .017), T-cell phenotype (T-ALL; P = .001), t(9;22) translocation (P = .001), and a slow early response (at day 8 and/or on day 21, P = .001) were predictive of LIF. The following three prognostic groups for LIF were identified by multivariate analysis: a low-risk group with B-cell progenitor (BCP) ALL without t(9;22) (odds ratio [OR] = 1), an intermediate-risk group with T-ALL and a mediastinal mass (OR = 7.4, P < .0001), and a high-risk group with BCP-ALL and t(9;22) or T-ALL without a mediastinal mass (OR = 28.4, P < .0001). Complete remission (CR) was subsequently obtained in 43 patients (81%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of the 53 patients was 30% +/- 6%. The 5-year OS rate among allogeneic graft recipients, autologous graft recipients, and after chemotherapy were 30.4% +/- 9.6% (50% +/- 26% after genoidentical transplantation), 50% +/- 17.7%, and 41.7% +/- 14.2%, respectively (P = .18). Fourteen patients (26%) were still in first CR after a median of 83 months (range, 53 to 117 months). CONCLUSION: Three risk categories for LIF in children with ALL were identified. Approximately one third of patients with LIF can be successfully treated with salvage therapy overall. Subsequent CR after LIF is mandatory for cure.","['Oudot, Caroline', 'Auclerc, Marie-Francoise', 'Levy, Vincent', 'Porcher, Raphael', 'Piguet, Christophe', 'Perel, Yves', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Debre, Marianne', 'Vermylen, Christiane', 'Pautard, Brigitte', 'Berger, Claire', 'Schmitt, Claudine', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Baruchel, Andre']","['Oudot C', 'Auclerc MF', 'Levy V', 'Porcher R', 'Piguet C', 'Perel Y', 'Gandemer V', 'Debre M', 'Vermylen C', 'Pautard B', 'Berger C', 'Schmitt C', 'Leblanc T', 'Cayuela JM', 'Socie G', 'Michel G', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A']","[""Service d'Hematologie et Oncologie Pediatrique, Hopital Mere-Enfant, Limoges, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Failure']",2008/03/20 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/03/20 09:00'],"['2008/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/9/1496 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.12.2820 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Mar 20;26(9):1496-503. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.12.2820.,,,10.1200/JCO.2007.12.2820 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two model human Ph(-) ALL cell lines (T-cell MOLT-4 and pre-B-cell Reh) were treated with LBH589 and evaluated for biologic and gene expression responses. Low nanomolar concentrations (IC(50): 5-20 nM) of LBH589 induced cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and histone (H3K9 and H4K8) hyperacetylation. LBH589 treatment increased mRNA levels of proapoptosis, growth arrest, and DNA damage repair genes including FANCG, FOXO3A, GADD45A, GADD45B, and GADD45G. The most dramatically expressed gene (up to 45-fold induction) observed after treatment with LBH589 is GADD45G. LBH589 treatment was associated with increased histone acetylation at the GADD45G promoter and phosphorylation of histone H2A.X. Furthermore, treatment with LBH589 was active against cultured primary Ph(-) ALL cells, including those from a relapsed patient, inducing loss of cell viability (up to 70%) and induction of GADD45G mRNA expression (up to 35-fold). Thus, LBH589 possesses potent growth inhibitory activity against including Ph(-) ALL cells associated with up-regulation of genes critical for DNA damage response and growth arrest. These findings provide a rationale for exploring the clinical activity of LBH589 in the treatment of patients with Ph(-) ALL.","['Scuto, Anna', 'Kirschbaum, Mark', 'Kowolik, Claudia', 'Kretzner, Leo', 'Juhasz, Agnes', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Pullarkat, Vinod', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Yen, Yun', 'Jove, Richard']","['Scuto A', 'Kirschbaum M', 'Kowolik C', 'Kretzner L', 'Juhasz A', 'Atadja P', 'Pullarkat V', 'Bhatia R', 'Forman S', 'Yen Y', 'Jove R']","['Molecular Medicine, City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080318,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GADD45G protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Indoles', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Panobinostat', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/03/20 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/03/20 09:00'],"['2008/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47195-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-117762 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 15;111(10):5093-100. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-117762.

Overall, individuals with the Gln/Gln genotype have a small cancer risk compared with Lys/Lys genotype for the reviewed cancer in total (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16). Subtle but significant cancer risk was observed for the XPD Asp 312 Asn polymorphism in bladder cancer (for Asp/Asn versus Asp/Asp: OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46). No significant associations were found for other cancers separately and all the reviewed cancer in total assessed for the Asp 312 Asn polymorphism.

Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has recently been shown to be effective against leukemias, so we studied whether As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis of CTCL cells in vitro. We further investigated if As(2)O(3) is effective in a MF mouse model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin-D stainings were carried out to investigate if As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis of CTCL cell lines. To study the underlying mechanisms, the effects of As(2)O(3) on various transcription factors and apoptosis regulating proteins were analyzed by western blots, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transcription factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The ability of As(2)O(3) to induce tumor regression was investigated in a MF mouse model. RESULTS: As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis was paralleled by a reduction of the DNA-binding activities of transcription factors of the NFkB and signal transducer and activator of transcription gene families and reduced expression of the antiapoptotic proteins bcl-1, bcl-xL and mcl-1. Local injections of 200 muM As(2)O(3) into tumors caused complete remissions in five of six mice and one partial remission. CONCLUSIONS: As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis of CTCL cells by the down-regulation of transcription factors that stimulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes. Local injection of As(2)O(3) into MF tumor-bearing mice resulted in tumor regression.","['Tun-Kyi, A', 'Qin, J-Z', 'Oberholzer, P A', 'Navarini, A A', 'Hassel, J C', 'Dummer, R', 'Dobbeling, U']","['Tun-Kyi A', 'Qin JZ', 'Oberholzer PA', 'Navarini AA', 'Hassel JC', 'Dummer R', 'Dobbeling U']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Harvard Medical School, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Boston, USA.', 'Skin Disease Research Laboratories, Oncology Institute, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute for Experimental Immunology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

Here, we show that the sumoylation site can be modified by ubiquitin. The stability and nuclear localization of PLZF were regulated by the antagonistic relationship between sumoylation and ubiquitination. We observed the antagonistic effects of ubiquitin and SUMO-1 on PLZF under oxidative stress induced by serum deprivation. Thus, the choice between modification of PLZF by SUMO or ubiquitin was determined by the intracellular level of ROS, which was generated by serum deprivation that inactivated the SUMO-conjugating enzymes Uba2 and Ubc9, and resulted in decrease of sumoylation.

The expression of BID, a known transcriptional target protein of PLZF, was decreased, and the consequent apoptosis was induced by the ROS generated during serum starvation.

The hydroxyl group of the A ring of the baicalein was alkylated at position 6 with terpenoids such as prenyl, geranyl, and farnesyl groups, and their free radical scavenging activities and glutathione (GSH) depletion capacities were examined. Their free radical scavenging activity was measured according to the 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(*+)) scavenging method. Baicalein and newly synthesized baicalein derivatives were found to be good free radical scavengers. Flow cytometrical method was employed to measure the intracellular antioxidative activity and GSH depletion capacity of these derivatives in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). It was also found that baicalein and its derivatives could decrease the levels of exogenous cumene hydroperoxide and H2O2 in THP-1 cells. These compounds also could significantly inhibit the intracellular GSH depletion induced by cumene hydroperoxide in THP-1 cells. The production of cumene hydroperoxide-induced Bax, a pro-apoptotic related protein, could also be inhibited by baicalein and its derivatives. These results suggested that baicalein and its derivatives could be beneficial to human health.","['Wu, Jin-Yi', 'Chung, King-Thom', 'Liu, Yi-Wen', 'Lu, Fung-Jou', 'Tsai, Ruei-Shiun', 'Chen, Chi-Hung', 'Chen, Ching-Hsein']","['Wu JY', 'Chung KT', 'Liu YW', 'Lu FJ', 'Tsai RS', 'Chen CH', 'Chen CH']","['Graduate Institute of Biomedical and Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Life Sciences, National Chiayi University, 300 University Road, Chiayi 60004, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080319,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', '0 (Terpenes)', ""28752-68-3 (2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid)"", '49QAH60606 (baicalein)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PG7JD54X4I (cumene hydroperoxide)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Antioxidants/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Benzene Derivatives/pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flavanones/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/chemistry', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Sulfonic Acids', 'Terpenes/chemistry']",2008/03/20 09:00,2008/07/10 09:00,['2008/03/20 09:00'],"['2008/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jf073224a [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2008 Apr 23;56(8):2838-45. doi: 10.1021/jf073224a.

METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 90 patients with acute leukemia (no history of bone marrow transplant) admitted to an ICU from 2001-2004. The primary endpoints were improvement and subsequent discharge from the ICU, discharge from the hospital, and 2-month survival after hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints were 6- and 12-month survival. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors predicting outcome. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 54 years and 48 (53%) were male. The most common reason for ICU transfer for all patients was respiratory compromise. The majority of all patients (68%) were eventually placed on ventilator support and approximately half required pressors. During the ICU course, 29 patients (32%) improved and subsequently resumed aggressive leukemia management, and 24 patients (27%) survived to be discharged from the hospital. The 2-, 6-, and 12-month overall survival was 24 (27%), 16 (18%), and 14 (16%), respectively. Higher APACHE II score, use of pressors, undergoing bone marrow transplantation preparative regimen, and adverse cytogenetics predicted worse outcome. Newly diagnosed leukemia, type of leukemia, or age did not. CONCLUSIONS: One of 4 patients with acute leukemia survived an ICU admission to be discharged from the hospital and were alive 2 months later. A diagnosis of acute leukemia should not disqualify patients from an ICU admission.","['Thakkar, Snehal G', 'Fu, Alex Z', 'Sweetenham, John W', 'Mciver, Zachariah A', 'Mohan, Sanjay R', 'Ramsingh, Giridharan', 'Advani, Anjali S', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Rybicki, Lisa', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Thakkar SG', 'Fu AZ', 'Sweetenham JW', 'Mciver ZA', 'Mohan SR', 'Ramsingh G', 'Advani AS', 'Sobecks R', 'Rybicki L', 'Kalaycio M', 'Sekeres MA']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23394 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 May 15;112(10):2233-40. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23394.,,,10.1002/cncr.23394 [doi],,,,,['(c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

However, more sensitive methods are required for monitoring residual disease (ie, molecular monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels). It is generally accepted that molecular responses have prognostic significance. Patients with CP CML who achieve early molecular responses are more likely to achieve durable cytogenetic responses and are less likely to experience disease progression. Rising BCR-ABL transcript levels also indicate loss of response, often as a consequence of developing BCR-ABL mutations. However, some studies have suggested that patients who achieve complete cytogenetic disease remission may not derive an additional prognostic benefit from achieving a major molecular response. Practical issues also exist for molecular monitoring with respect to restricted access and variability in methodologies and data reporting. Although molecular monitoring has a clear role in assessing residual disease and determining the risk of disease progression in patients with CML, the importance of cytogenetic monitoring should not be ignored.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Jabbour E', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of underlying this synergism. Most interestingly, EGCG + ibuprofen treatment in PC-3 cells resulted in altering the ratio of the splice variants of Bcl-X and Mcl-1, downregulating the mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1(L) with a concomitant increase in the mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic Bcl-X(s) and Mcl-1(s). However, there were no apparent changes in splicing variants in either ibuprofen or EGCG treated cells. Induction of alternative splicing was correlated with increased activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in EGCG + ibuprofen-treated cells, since pretreatment with calyculin A and tautomycin blocked EGCG + ibuprofen-induced alternative splicing in PC-3 cells in contrast to pretreatment with okadaic acid. On the other hand, EGCG + ibuprofen treatment in LNCaP cells did not alter splicing variants of Bcl-X and Mcl-1, despite the increase in protein phosphatase activity. In both cell lines, EGCG + ibuprofen inhibited cell proliferation synergistically. Taken together, this study demonstrate for the first time that EGCG + ibuprofen upregulated PP1 activity, which in turn induced alternative splicing of Bcl-X and Mcl-1 in a cell-type specific manner. Our study also demonstrates that the activation of PP1 contributes to the alternative splicing of Mcl-1.","['Kim, Myoung H']",['Kim MH'],"['Department of Molecular Biology and Immunology, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas 76107, USA. mkim@hsc.unt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'WK2XYI10QM (Ibuprofen)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*drug effects', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ibuprofen/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/08/21 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21725 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Jul 1;104(4):1491-9. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21725.,,,10.1002/jcb.21725 [doi],,,,,"['2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['R21CA102382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In contrast, cytotoxic ligand Apo2L/TRAIL induces the apoptosis of various transformed cells. We observed that co-culture of human pre-B leukemia cells KM3 and REH with Wnt1- or Wnt3a-producing rat embryonic fibroblasts efficiently suppressed Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis of the lymphoid cells. This suppression occurs at the early stages of the Apo2L/TRAIL apoptotic cascade and, interestingly, the activation of the Wnt pathway alone in human leukemia cells is not sufficient for their full anti-apoptotic protection. We hypothesize that a stimulus emanating specifically from Wnt1- or Wnt3a-expressing rat fibroblasts is responsible for the observed resistance to Apo2L/TRAIL. This anti-apoptotic signaling was significantly hampered by the inhibition of the MEK1/ERK1/2 or NFkappaB pathways in KM3 and REH cells. Our results imply that paracrine Wnt-related signals could be important for the survival of pre-B cell-derived malignancies.","['Doubravska, Lenka', 'Simova, Sarka', 'Cermak, Lukas', 'Valenta, Tomas', 'Korinek, Vladimir', 'Andera, Ladislav']","['Doubravska L', 'Simova S', 'Cermak L', 'Valenta T', 'Korinek V', 'Andera L']","['Laboratory of Cell and Developmental Biology, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, 14220, Praha 4, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080318,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (WNT3A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt1 Protein)', '0 (Wnt1 protein, rat)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt3A Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Wnt Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Wnt1 Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Wnt3 Protein', 'Wnt3A Protein', 'beta Catenin/physiology']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2006/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-008-0191-z [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2008 Apr;13(4):573-87. doi: 10.1007/s10495-008-0191-z.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with advanced leukemia received modified prophylactic DLI; that is, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-primed peripheral blood progenitor cells instead of steady-donor lymphocyte harvests were used, and a short-term immunosuppressive agent (cyclosporine A or methotrexate 10 mg once per week for 2 to 4 weeks) was used for prevention of DLI-associated graft versus host disease (GVHD) after human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine infusions were performed in 33 patients. The mononuclear cells and median CD3+ cells infused for DLI were 1-2 x 10(8) and 0.93 x 10(6) per kilogram, respectively. Six patients experienced II-IV-grade acute GVHD. Twenty patients developed chronic GVHD. No GVHD-related death or transfusion-related pancytopenia was observed. With an 18-month median follow-up, 16 patients were in disease-free survival, and overall survival at 1 and 1.5 years was 69.0% and 50.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The modified prophylactic DLI strategy might represent a step forward in the treatment of advanced leukemia.","['Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Wang, Yu', 'Liu, Dai-Hong', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Han, Wei', 'Shi, Hong-Xia', 'Liu, Kai-Yan']","['Huang XJ', 'Wang Y', 'Liu DH', 'Xu LP', 'Chen H', 'Chen YH', 'Han W', 'Shi HX', 'Liu KY']","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China, xjhrm@medmail.com.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080318,Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10875-008-9193-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 2008 Jul;28(4):390-7. doi: 10.1007/s10875-008-9193-4.

Substantial-to-severe alopecia is induced by anthracyclines (e.g., adriamycin), taxanes (e.g., taxol), alkylating compounds (e.g., cyclophosphamide), and the topisomerase inhibitor etoposide, agents that are widely used in the treatment of leukemias and breast, lung, ovarian, and bladder cancers. Currently, no treatment appears to be generally effective in reliably preventing this secondary effect of chemotherapy. We observed in experiments using different rodent models that localized administration of heat or subcutaneous/intradermal injection of geldanamycin or 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin induced a stress protein response in hair follicles and effectively prevented alopecia from adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, taxol, and etoposide.

The number of KIR loci can vary between individuals, resulting in a heterogeneous array of possible KIR genes. The range of observed profiles has been explained by the occurrence of two haplotype families termed A and B, which can be distinguished on the basis of certain KIR sequences. Immunogenetic analysis of different ethnic populations shows significant differences in terms of the distribution for group A and group B haplotypes. Recently, attention has been focused on the role of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-ligand incompatibility in the graft-versus-host direction between donor and recipient in allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). The goal of this study was to study the frequency of specific KIR genes in Chinese Northern Han population and evaluate the role of KIR-ligand mismatch in Chinese HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients with hematological malignancy. Here genomic DNA from 150 Northern Chinese Han individuals was typed for the presence or absence of KIR genes. Seventy-four allogeneic stem cell transplantation donor/recipient pairs were typed for HLA-A, B, C and KIR. Sixteen KIR genes were observed in the population, and framework genes 3DL3, 3DP1, 2DL4, and 3DL2 were present in all individuals. Twenty-two different genotypes were found. Group A haplotypes outnumbered group B haplotypes in frequency by approximately 3:1, with individuals having two group A haplotypes accounting for 51.9% (78/150). We observed that 57 out of 74 (77.3%) donor-recipient pairs could be characterized by lack of recipient HLA ligand for donor KIR. We observed that 36 out of 45 (80%) donor-recipient HLA-identical sibling transplant pairs could be characterized by lack of recipient HLA ligand for donor KIR. Cumulative incidence analysis of aGVHD in patients undergoing HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in this study demonstrated a decreased incidence of severe aGVHD in patients lacking HLA ligand for donor-inhibitory KIR2DL1 (31.4 vs. 70%, P = 0.029). And also in AML (acute myeloid leukemia) patients lacking HLA ligand for donor-inhibitory KIR and KIR2DL1 (17.6 vs. 75%, P = 0.03). Our data demonstrated that the Chinese Han population is distinct in KIR gene frequencies and putative KIR haplotypes in comparison to some other populations. Almost all allogeneic donors could be characterized as having an inhibitory KIR for each of the three known class I ligands. KIR and KIR2DL1 mismatch is associated with lower aGVHD in Chinese after HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Dou, Li Ping', 'Zheng, De Hua', 'Wang, Chang', 'Liu, Jun Hua', 'Sun, Jing Fen', 'Jin, Hai Jie', 'Gao, Chun Ji', 'Yu, Li', 'Da, Wan Ming']","['Dou LP', 'Zheng H', 'Wang C', 'Liu JH', 'Sun JF', 'Jin HJ', 'Gao CJ', 'Yu L', 'Da WM']","['Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital of China, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'PLA Transplant Center, PLA General Hospital of China, Beijing, 100091, China.', 'Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital of China, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital of China, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital of China, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital of China, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital of China, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital of China, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital of China, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. dwanming@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (GEM protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Asians/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*immunology/surgery', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Siblings', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/03/19 09:00,2009/04/16 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2006/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0058-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0058-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 May;87(4):422-433. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0058-7.,,,10.1007/s12185-008-0058-7 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His malignant plasma cells had a chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) that created overexpression of cyclin D1. Two courses of VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone) therapy failed to achieve complete remission. Three subsequent courses of hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone) therapy successfully induced remission with negative FISH test for t(11;14)(q13;q32). Thereafter, the patient received high-dose melphalan (125 mg/m(2)) followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Cyclin D1 that was present prior to the high-dose chemotherapy, was no longer detected by qualitative PCR analysis.

Plasma cell leukemia is a rare hematological malignancy with a poor prognosis. The treatment has not been standardized yet. The present case suggested the effectiveness of the combination of hyper-CVAD and high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

However, graft versus host disease (GVHD), which sometimes can be fatal, remains a major obstacle in classical HCT, where recipients are conditioned with total body irradiation or high-dose chemotherapy. We previously reported that anti-CD3 conditioning allows donor CD8(+) T cells to facilitate engraftment and mediate GVL without causing GVHD. However, the clinical application of this radiation-free and GVHD preventative conditioning regimen is hindered by the cytokine storm syndrome triggered by anti-CD3 and the high-dose donor bone marrow (BM) cells required for induction of chimerism. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) are known to induce apoptosis of cancer cells and reduce production of proinflammatory cytokines by nonmalignant cells. Here, we report that SAHA inhibits the proliferative and cytotoxic activity of anti-CD3-activated T cells. Administration of low-dose SAHA reduces cytokine production and ameliorates the cytokine storm syndrome triggered by anti-CD3. Conditioning with anti-CD3 and SAHA allows induction of chimerism with lower doses of donor BM cells in old nonautoimmune and autoimmune lupus mice. In addition, conditioning with anti-CD3 and SAHA allows donor CD8(+) T cell-mediated GVA activity to reverse lupus glomerulonephritis without causing GVHD. These results indicate that conditioning with anti-CD3 and HDAC inhibitors represent a radiation-free and GVHD-preventative regimen with clinical application potential.","['Li, Nainong', 'Zhao, Dongchang', 'Kirschbaum, Mark', 'Zhang, Chunyan', 'Lin, Chia-Lei', 'Todorov, Ivan', 'Kandeel, Fouad', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Zeng, Defu']","['Li N', 'Zhao D', 'Kirschbaum M', 'Zhang C', 'Lin CL', 'Todorov I', 'Kandeel F', 'Forman S', 'Zeng D']","['Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Division of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, The Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010-0269, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080317,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']",IM,"['Aging/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chimerism/chemically induced/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Lupus Nephritis/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vorinostat']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['0712051105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0712051105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Mar 25;105(12):4796-801. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0712051105.

OBSERVATIONS: We describe a 67-year-old patient with a 6-year history of Philadelphia chromosome translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11)-positive CML. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor AMN107 (nilotinib) kept the patient in chronic phase. After 10 months of taking nilotinib, he developed pneumonia with septic features. Seven days later, bullous skin infiltrations on the upper arms and a large, painful bullous swelling of the right neck occurred without any evidence of a viral, bacterial, or fungal blood infection. Findings from histologic examination showed massive infiltrations of the whole dermis with neutrophil granulocytes as well as with monocytoid histiocytic cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue revealed a BCR-ABL fusion, indicating the presence of t(9;22)(q34;q11). The addition of oral prednisolone to an adequate antibiotic treatment led to rapid resolution of the cutaneous infiltrations. CONCLUSIONS: Skin infiltrations consistent with Sweet syndrome can occur in patients with septic CML during the treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including nilotinib. Skin infiltrations can include specific CML cells.","['Kaune, Kjell Matthias', 'Baumgart, Mario', 'Gesk, Stefan', 'Mitteldorf, Christina', 'Baesecke, Joerg', 'Glass, Bertram', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Ghadimi, B Michael', 'Neumann, Christine', 'Emmert, Steffen']","['Kaune KM', 'Baumgart M', 'Gesk S', 'Mitteldorf C', 'Baesecke J', 'Glass B', 'Haase D', 'Siebert R', 'Ghadimi BM', 'Neumann C', 'Emmert S']","['Department of Dermatology, Georg-August-University Goettingen, Von-Siebold-Strasse 3, 37075 Goettingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Sweet Syndrome/chemically induced/*diagnosis/pathology']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['144/3/361 [pii]', '10.1001/archderm.144.3.361 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2008 Mar;144(3):361-4. doi: 10.1001/archderm.144.3.361.,,,10.1001/archderm.144.3.361 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aurora dysfunction can cause aneuploidy, mitotic arrest, and cell death. Aurora kinases are strongly expressed in a broad range of cancer types. Aurora A expression in tumors is often associated with gene amplification, genetic instability, poor histologic differentiation, and poor prognosis. Aurora B is frequently expressed at high levels in a variety of tumors, often coincidently with aurora A, and expression level has also been associated with increased genetic instability and clinical outcome. Further, aurora kinase gene polymorphisms are associated with increased risk or early onset of cancer. The expression of aurora C in cancer is less well studied. In recent years, several small-molecule aurora kinase inhibitors have been developed that exhibit preclinical activity against a wide range of solid tumors. Preliminary clinical data from phase I trials have largely been consistent with cytostatic effects, with disease stabilization as the best response achieved in solid tumors. Objective responses have been noted in leukemia patients, although this might conceivably be due to inhibition of the Abl kinase. Current challenges include the optimization of drug administration, the identification of potential biomarkers of tumor sensitivity, and combination studies with cytotoxic drugs. Here, we summarize the most recent preclinical and clinical data and discuss new directions in the development of aurora kinase inhibitors as antineoplastic agents.","['Gautschi, Oliver', 'Heighway, Jim', 'Mack, Philip C', 'Purnell, Phillip R', 'Lara, Primo N Jr', 'Gandara, David R']","['Gautschi O', 'Heighway J', 'Mack PC', 'Purnell PR', 'Lara PN Jr', 'Gandara DR']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinase C', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Delivery Systems/trends', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/mortality', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/6/1639 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-2179 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Mar 15;14(6):1639-48. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-2179.,93,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-2179 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have assessed a mouse model of leukemia caused by Mll-Enl protein fusion as a preclinical situation in which myeloid-lineage leukemia results from de novo occurrence of chromosomal translocations between Mll and Enl genes. Here, we show that the mouse leukemias respond to cytosine arabinoside, a frontline treatment for human leukemia. The observations show that the myeloid cells are susceptible to the drug and the mice undergo a remission that comprises a reduction of the myeloid population of cells and recovery of the lymphoid population.

Two members of this family, STAT5A and STAT5B (collectively called STAT5), have gained prominence in that they are activated by a wide variety of cytokines such as interleukins, erythropoietin, growth hormone, and prolactin. Furthermore, constitutive STAT5 activation is observed in the majority of leukemias and many solid tumors. Inactivation studies in mice as well as human mutations have provided insight into many of STAT5's functions. Disruption of cytokine signaling through STAT5 results in a variety of cell-specific effects, ranging from a defective immune system and impaired erythropoiesis, the complete absence of mammary development during pregnancy, to aberrant liver function. On a molecular level, STAT5 has been linked to cell specification, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Evidence is growing that the diverse outcomes of STAT5 signaling are not only determined by the expression of specific receptors but also by the interaction of STAT5 with cofactors and the cell-specific activity of members of the SOCS family, which negatively regulate STAT function. In this review, we focus on emerging concepts and challenges in the field of Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT5 signaling. First, we discuss unique functions of STAT5 in three distinct systems: mammary epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and regulatory T cells. Second, we present an example of how STAT5 can achieve cell specificity in hepatocytes through a physical and functional interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor. Third, we focus on the relevance of STAT5 in the development and progression of leukemia. Next, we discuss lessons derived from human mutations and disease. Finally, we address an emerging issue that the interpretation of experiments from STAT5-deficient mice and cells might be compromised as these cells might reroute and reprogram cytokine signals to the ""wrong"" STATs and thus acquire inappropriate cues. We propose that mice with mutations in various components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway are living laboratories, which will provide insight into the versatility of signaling hardware and the adaptability of the software.","['Hennighausen, Lothar', 'Robinson, Gertraud W']","['Hennighausen L', 'Robinson GW']","['Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. hennighausen@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/6/711 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1643908 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2008 Mar 15;22(6):711-21. doi: 10.1101/gad.1643908.,81,,10.1101/gad.1643908 [doi],PMC2394721,,,,,['Z99 DK999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS46771'],,,,,,,,

While several tools have been designed for nominal features such as Gene Ontology annotations or KEGG Pathways, very little has been proposed to tackle numerical features such as the chromosomal positions of genes. For instance, microarray studies typically generate gene lists that are differentially expressed in the sample subgroups under investigation, and when studying diseases caused by genome alterations, it is of great interest to delineate the chromosomal regions that are significantly enriched in these lists. In this article, we present a positional gene enrichment analysis method (PGE) for the identification of chromosomal regions that are significantly enriched in a given set of genes. The strength of our method relies on an original query optimization approach that allows to virtually consider all the possible chromosomal regions for enrichment, and on the multiple testing correction which discriminates truly enriched regions versus those that can occur by chance. We have developed a Web tool implementing this method applied to the human genome (http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/~bioiuser/pge). We validated PGE on published lists of differentially expressed genes. These analyses showed significant overrepresentation of known aberrant chromosomal regions.","['De Preter, Katleen', 'Barriot, Roland', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Vandesompele, Jo', 'Moreau, Yves']","['De Preter K', 'Barriot R', 'Speleman F', 'Vandesompele J', 'Moreau Y']","['Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. katleen.depreter@ugent.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20080316,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Chromosome Mapping/*methods', 'Down Syndrome/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Software']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/05/20 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['gkn114 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkn114 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Apr;36(7):e43. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkn114.

The primary target for this drug is the oncogenic BCR-ABL kinase. Five-year survival rates for patients in chronic phase CML is now greater than 80%. Patients who have advanced beyond the chronic phase to the accelerated phase or blast crisis, however, have not faired as well. Progression occurs for a variety of reasons, including late diagnosis, slow response to imatinib, and the development of imatinib-resistant clones. Imatinib resistance has, in part, been addressed with the introduction of the new BCR-ABL inhibitors, namely dasatinib and nilotinib. These drugs have shown efficacy in CML patients with wild-type BCR-ABL and some BCR-ABL mutants that are imatinib-resistant. Unfortunately, some BCR-ABL mutations remain resistant to these therapies and will require the development of alternative treatments, and other mechanisms of imatinib resistance besides BCR-ABL mutation exist. In the future, genetic and pharmacologic tests may allow the clinician to predict response to imatinib. More aggressive therapies are being considered for high-risk patients, including increased dosage of the current tyrosine kinase inhibitors, along with combination therapies. Aggressive therapy holds promise, as the data suggest that responses are improved. Unfortunately, toxicities are also increased, and thus a balance must be found to ensure safety and compliance. This is especially important for young CML patients, who hopefully will remain in remission for decades. Polymerase chain reaction analysis has become of primary importance as a means of assessing disease burden, and given the idiosyncrasies of this technique, standards must be established to allow results to be compared across different institutions. Additionally, the nature of advanced disease is being explored. Intriguingly, genetic analysis of transformed blasts from patients in blast crisis has identified numerous members of the Wnt/B-catenin pathway and JunB as being activated. Increased activity of these pathways correlates with poor response and eventual disease progression. In addition to these data, evidence is emerging associating survival of the quiescent blast cell with Wnt activity, leading to the hope that Wnt inhibitors will increase the likelihood of eradicating these cells. Other areas such as microRNA profiling and DNA methylation patterns are likely to provide important information.","['Giles, Francis J', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Hughes, Timothy', 'Mauro, Michael', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Giles FJ', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Baccarani M', 'Deininger M', 'Guilhot F', 'Hughes T', 'Mauro M', 'Radich J', 'Ottmann O', 'Cortes J']","['Professor of Medicine, and Chief, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA. frankgiles@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Genes, abl/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics', 'beta Catenin/genetics']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0093-7754(07)00271-0 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2007.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2008 Feb;35(1 Suppl 1):S1-17; quiz S18-20. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2007.12.002.,131,,10.1053/j.seminoncol.2007.12.002 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Finding of SNCT was carried out in 164 allo-HSCT recipients from January 2003 to June 2006. Clinical characteristics were analysed, including precursory symptoms and clinical manifestations. Associations between the onset of SNCT with blood CsA levels, age, transplant types, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matching, conditioning regimens, antihuman thymocyte globulin (ATG) used in the prevention and treatment for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and intravenous corticosteroid used for acute GVHD were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed with Binary Logistic Regression using SPSS/PC version 11.0. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (7.93%) were identified to have SNCT, including seizures (n = 8, 4.88%), paralysis (n = 6, 3.66%), coma (n = 2, 1.22%), cerebellar ataxia (n = 3, 1.83%) and chondroid encephalomyopathy (n = 1, 0.61%). All the patients had precursory symptoms prior SNCT including headache (n = 8), agitation (n = 4) and hypertension (n = 6). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in twelve patients after SNCT showed that eleven patients had signal abnormalities in cerebral cortex and cerebral white matter. Six patients examined with computerized tomography (CT) had no abnormal findings. After extenuation or withdrawal of CsA, ten patients had complete recovery, two had partial recovery and one died of SNCT. Simple effect analysis of Binary Logistic Regression showed that the associations between the onset of SNCT with blood CsA levels, transplant types, HLA matching, ATG used in the prevention and treatment for GVHD and intravenous corticosteroid used for acute GVHD were of statistical significance. The multiple effect analysis of Binary Logistic Regression showed that the associations of the onset of SNCT with blood CsA levels and ATG used had statistical significance and the odds ratio (OR) was 1.007 (P = 0.006) and 6.727 (P = 0.030), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 91.67% of the allo-HSCT recipients with SNCT have MRI abnormalities. High blood CsA levels and the use of ATG can elevate the risk of the occurrence of SNCT.","['Luo, Xiao-Dan', 'Liu, Qi-Fa', 'Ning, Juan', 'Fan, Zhi-Ping', 'Xu, Dan', 'Wei, Yong-Qiang']","['Luo XD', 'Liu QF', 'Ning J', 'Fan ZP', 'Xu D', 'Wei YQ']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Nanfang Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*etiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/07/12 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Jan;47(1):40-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HYPOTHESIS: Immunophenotype predicts prognosis in canine lymphoproliferative disorders involving circulating lymphocytosis. ANIMALS: Dogs that had peripheral blood evaluation performed by flow cytometry by the Clinical Immunology Service at Colorado State University between 2003 and 2005. METHODS: Outcome data regarding treatment and survival were sought on patients with lymphocytosis comprising a single lymphocyte subset. Ninety-six patients that met the inclusion criteria had sufficient follow-up information to be included in the study. RESULTS: Four main phenotypic classifications were found: CD8+ T-cell, CD21+ B-cell, CD4-8-5+ (aberrant T-cell phenotype), and CD34+ (undifferentiated progenitor). Expression of CD34 predicted poor outcome with median survival of 16 days (P < .0001) compared with other phenotypes. Within the CD8+ phenotype, dogs presenting with a lymphocytosis >30,000 lymphocytes/muL had significantly shorter median survival (131 days) than those presenting with <30,000 lymphocytes/muL (1098 days, P < .0008). Within the T-cell leukemias, there was no difference in outcome between dogs with CD4-8-5+ leukemia and dogs with the CD8+ T-cell phenotype nor was the loss of expression of the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 associated with decreased survival time. A CD21+ lymphocytosis composed of large cells was associated with shorter survival time (129 days) than those with smaller circulating cells (median survival not reached, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Immunophenotyping provides an objective method for determining prognosis in lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by lymphocytosis.","['Williams, M J', 'Avery, A C', 'Lana, S E', 'Hillers, K R', 'Bachand, A M', 'Avery, P R']","['Williams MJ', 'Avery AC', 'Lana SE', 'Hillers KR', 'Bachand AM', 'Avery PR']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080310,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Biomarkers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Dog Diseases/*immunology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping/*veterinary', 'Lymphocytosis/immunology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/09/27 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVIM41 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0041.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2008 May-Jun;22(3):596-601. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0041.x.

Clinical reports have shown that treatment was associated with cardiotoxicity. We investigated the toxic mechanisms of As(2)O(3) in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Clinically relevant concentrations of As(2)O(3) (2-10 microM) reduced the viability of H9c2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The decreased cell viability was because As(2)O(3) induced cell apoptosis (cell shrinkage, nuclear alterations and caspase-3 activation), or even necrosis at higher concentrations. Inhibition of caspase-3 with a specific inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, suppressed apoptosis induced by As(2)O(3). In addition, reactive oxygen species formation and cellular Ca(2+) overload were observed in H9c2 cells exposed to As(2)O(3), which was partly inhibited by vitamin E and verapamil. These results suggest that As(2)O(3)-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated, at least in part, by activation of caspase-3 pathway, which may be triggered by reactive oxygen species formation and intracellular Ca(2+) overload.","['Zhao, Xiaoyan', 'Feng, Tieming', 'Chen, He', 'Shan, Hongli', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Lu, Yanjie', 'Yang, Baofeng']","['Zhao X', 'Feng T', 'Chen H', 'Shan H', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu Y', 'Yang B']","['Department of Pharmacology, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080312,England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxides/*adverse effects', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vitamin E/pharmacology']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/07/18 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['PTO150 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-7843.2007.00150.x [doi]']",ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2008 May;102(5):419-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2007.00150.x.

In addition, the typical treatment for AML is among the most toxic of treatments for pediatric cancer; it includes intensive multiagent chemotherapy and, often, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Given the poor prognosis of pediatric AML and the significant toxicity of standard AML therapy, novel therapies are needed. Improved understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of leukemia has facilitated the development of molecularly targeted therapies. In this article, we review progress to date with agents that are showing promise in the treatment of pediatric AML including targeted immunoconjugates, inhibitors of signaling molecules (e.g. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3], farnesyltransferase, and mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]), agents that target epigenetic regulation of gene expression (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors), and proteasome inhibitors. For the specific agents in each of these classes, we summarize the published preclinical data and the clinical trials that have been completed, are in progress, or are being planned for children with AML. Finally, we discuss potential challenges to the success of molecularly targeted therapy including demonstrating adequate targeting of leukemia stem cells, developing synergistic and tolerable combinations of agents, and designing adequately powered clinical trials to test efficacy in molecularly defined subsets of patients.","['Brown, Patrick', 'Smith, Franklin O']","['Brown P', 'Smith FO']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. pbrown2@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['DNA Methylation', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Pediatrics', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/03/19 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2008/03/19 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1023 [pii]', '10.2165/00148581-200810020-00003 [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 2008;10(2):85-92. doi: 10.2165/00148581-200810020-00003.,92,,,,,,,,['K23 CA111728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Final autopsy reports were reviewed, and 3030 autopsies of patients > 1 year of age with an underlying disease and associated risk factors were selected. All had developed diffuse infiltrates and died of ARF-related pulmonary alterations. RESULTS: The principal pulmonary histopathological alterations resulting in immediate death were diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), pulmonary edema, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) and alveolar hemorrhage. The principal underlying diseases were AIDS, bronchopneumonia, sepsis, liver cirrhosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cerebrovascular accident, tuberculosis, cancer, chronic kidney failure and leukemia. The principal associated risk factors were as follows: age > 50 years; arterial hypertension; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and diabetes mellitus. These risk factors and AIDS correlated with a high risk of developing LIP; these same risk factors, if concomitant with sepsis or liver cirrhosis, correlated with a risk of developing DAD; thromboembolism and these risk factors correlated with a risk of developing alveolar hemorrhage; these risk factors and AMI correlated with a risk of developing pulmonary edema. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary findings in patients who died of ARF presented four histopathological patterns: DAD, pulmonary edema, LIP and alveolar hemorrhage.

The present study aimed to determine existing association between TGF-beta1 codon 10 polymorphism and aGVHD after HLA-identical sibling BMT in the Iranian population. MATERIAL/METHODS: In a retrospective case-control study, 168 subjects including 84 Iranian HLA-identical sibling BMT donor/recipient pairs were recruited. All of the patients were affected by hematological malignancies (AML=39, ALL=23 and CML=22). PCR-SSP method was performed to determine TGF-beta1 codon 10 T/C polymorphism genotypes. RESULTS: The frequency of TGF-beta1 codon 10 TT, TC and CC genotypes among all subjects were 26.8%, 33.3% and 39.9% respectively. Recipients with the T allele developed aGVHD significantly less than those without the T allele (odds ratio =0.334, P=0.026).

Methods to exclude presence of cancer cells were used to improve the safety of cryopreservation-reimplantation procedures. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with hematological malignancies were referred for the storage of ovarian tissue for fertility preservation. Investigation included preoperative imaging and histological evaluation of fresh ovarian tissue. After thawing markers to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) were used and compared with patient's disease used as positive control (five patients). RESULTS: Preoperative imaging detected disease in the ovaries (two patients). Conventional histology post-tissue harvesting did not disclose malignant cells (56 patients). MRD results post-thawing were negative in Hodgkin's disease (CD30 immunohistochemical staining), in T- and B-cell lymphoma (PCR for T-cell receptor and Ig clones, respectively) and in two chronic myelogenous leukemia patients (RT-PCR for BCR-ABL gene expression). However, highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR was positive in one CML patient and, this alarming result avoided tissue transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative imaging prevented operations and storage of tissue with cancer. Evaluation of stored ovarian tissue for MRD using sensitive markers is essential to increase safety and to prevent reimplantation of tissue with malignant cells.","['Meirow, Dror', 'Hardan, Izhar', 'Dor, Jehoshua', 'Fridman, Eduard', 'Elizur, Shai', ""Ra'anani, Hila"", 'Slyusarevsky, Elena', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Schiff, Eyal', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Ben Yehuda, Dina']","['Meirow D', 'Hardan I', 'Dor J', 'Fridman E', 'Elizur S', ""Ra'anani H"", 'Slyusarevsky E', 'Amariglio N', 'Schiff E', 'Rechavi G', 'Nagler A', 'Ben Yehuda D']","['IVF Unit, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel. meirow@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080315,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Ovary/*pathology/*transplantation', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/etiology/pathology', '*Reproductive Techniques', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/03/18 09:00,2008/06/07 09:00,['2008/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['den055 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/den055 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2008 May;23(5):1007-13. doi: 10.1093/humrep/den055.

The remarkable initial results of the first phase I clinical trial published in 1999 prompted the rapid initiation of large phase II trials. They also generated intense media coverage and significant interest from patients and clinicians and demand for access to imatinib before marketing approval. In response, a worldwide expanded access program (EAP) for imatinib was implemented in May 2000. PATIENTS: In total, 7380 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia failing prior therapies were enrolled in 106 centers in 34 countries. RESULTS: Time to progression and overall survival, as well as the safety profile, were similar to those observed in published phase II studies. At the end of the program, patients benefiting from treatment were continued on imatinib therapy by transferring to national health care systems or patient assistance programs. CONCLUSION: The imatinib EAP successfully provided therapy to patients with CML before marketing approval. The program provides an efficient framework for the development of global EAPs for innovative investigational anticancer agents in patients without a satisfactory therapeutic alternative.","['Capdeville, R', 'Krahnke, T', 'Hatfield, A', 'Ford, J M', 'Van Hoomissen, I', 'Gathmann, I']","['Capdeville R', 'Krahnke T', 'Hatfield A', 'Ford JM', 'Van Hoomissen I', 'Gathmann I']","['Clinical Development, Novartis Oncology, Basel, Switzerland.

Nearly 100,000 formulae have been recorded, but the working mechanisms of most remain unknown. In trying to address the possible beneficial effects of formulae with current biomedical approaches, we use Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF), which has been proven to be very effective in treating human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) as a model. The main components of RIF are realgar, Indigo naturalis, and Salvia miltiorrhiza, with tetraarsenic tetrasulfide (A), indirubin (I), and tanshinone IIA (T) as major active ingredients, respectively. Here, we report that the ATI combination yields synergy in the treatment of a murine APL model in vivo and in the induction of APL cell differentiation in vitro. ATI causes intensified ubiquitination/degradation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) oncoprotein, stronger reprogramming of myeloid differentiation regulators, and enhanced G(1)/G(0) arrest in APL cells through hitting multiple targets compared with the effects of mono- or biagents. Furthermore, ATI intensifies the expression of Aquaglyceroporin 9 and facilitates the transportation of A into APL cells, which in turn enhances A-mediated PML-RARalpha degradation and therapeutic efficacy. Our data also indicate A as the principal component of the formula, whereas T and I serve as adjuvant ingredients. We therefore suggest that dissecting the mode of action of clinically effective formulae at the molecular, cellular, and organism levels may be a good strategy in exploring the value of traditional medicine.","['Wang, Lan', 'Zhou, Guang-Biao', 'Liu, Ping', 'Song, Jun-Hong', 'Liang, Yang', 'Yan, Xiao-Jing', 'Xu, Fang', 'Wang, Bing-Shun', 'Mao, Jian-Hua', 'Shen, Zhi-Xiang', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu']","['Wang L', 'Zhou GB', 'Liu P', 'Song JH', 'Liang Y', 'Yan XJ', 'Xu F', 'Wang BS', 'Mao JH', 'Shen ZX', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080314,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AQP9 protein, human)', '0 (Aquaporins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '0 (realgar-indigo naturalis)', '56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aquaporins/genetics/metabolism', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Sulfides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2008/03/18 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['0712365105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0712365105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Mar 25;105(12):4826-31. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0712365105.

None of the vitamin C concentrations tested (1-100 microM) caused cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. However, there were significant losses of HL-60 cells viability, measured by MTT assay, 72 h after treatment with 50 and 100 microM vitamin C (29 and 46%, respectively). Moreover, an increase of lactate dehydrogenase release was significant with 50 microM at 72 h (28%) and with 100 microM of vitamin C at 48 and 72 h (27 and 36%, respectively). Also, the percentage of apoptotic HL-60 cells found in TUNEL assay increased to 21% when they were treated with 100 microM vitamin C for 72 h. Thus, in subsequent simultaneous treatments with NPYR (30 and 50 mM) or NDMA (27 and 68 mM) and vitamin C, concentrations of 5-50 microM vitamin C were used. Our results revealed that vitamin C, at all concentrations and times tested, reduced the apoptosis induced by NPYR and NDMA in both cell lines, showing a similar effect in HepG2 and HL-60 cells towards NPYR (50 mM)--65 and 63% of reduction, respectively--whereas towards NDMA (27 mM) the inhibition was higher in HL-60 than in HepG2 cells--75 and 57%, respectively. Therefore, our findings suggest that inhibition of apoptosis may be one of the mechanisms by which vitamin C exerts its protective effect.","['Arranz, Nuria', 'Haza, Ana I', 'Garcia, Almudena', 'Delgado, Ma Eugenia', 'Rafter, Joseph', 'Morales, Paloma']","['Arranz N', 'Haza AI', 'Garcia A', 'Delgado ME', 'Rafter J', 'Morales P']","['Departamento de Nutricion, Bromatologia y Tecnologia de los Alimentos, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '6384-92-5 (N-Methylaspartate)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'SZ4J5WK201 (N-Nitrosopyrrolidine)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists/toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'N-Methylaspartate/antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'N-Nitrosopyrrolidine/toxicity', 'Nitrosamines/*antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",2008/03/18 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jat.1340 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2008 Aug;28(6):788-96. doi: 10.1002/jat.1340.,,,10.1002/jat.1340 [doi],,,,,"['Copyright 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

Typically, addition of a ligand to Env gives binding to the new or target receptor, but little or no infection, and affects the subunit association of the modified Env. We previously discovered two point mutations that increase targeted infection by over 1000-fold when added to an Env modified by N-terminal insertion of the receptor-binding domain from amphotropic murine leukemia virus Env. Here, we asked whether these mutations would similarly increase transduction by Env modified with a clinically relevant ligand, human interleukin-13 (IL-13L). Addition of the point mutations stabilized the weak subunit association observed in some IL-13L-modified Env proteins, but infection via the target IL-13 receptor still did not occur. Fluorescence-based cell-cell fusion assays and studies with a membrane-curving agent revealed that defects in membrane fusion differed with the site of ligand insertion. When IL-13 was inserted into the N terminus of Env, membrane fusion was blocked prior to membrane-lipid mixing, regardless of whether flanking flexible linkers were added.

Thus, the site of ligand insertion influenced initiation of membrane fusion and its progression.

However, in addition to the well-described phenomenon of resistance to imatinib, typically due to point mutations, uncommon consequences (eg, the development of Philadelphia chromosome-negative clones) may infrequently occur. We report 2 cases of sudden BCR/ABL1+ blast crisis in patients with CML who had achieved complete hematologic remission with imatinib therapy but were obligated to discontinue therapy owing to pancytopenia. These sudden blast crises were unusual at 3 levels: first, they were of precursor T lymphoblastic lineage; second, they had a primary extranodal presentation without overt bone marrow involvement; and third, they developed after recent cessation of imatinib. These observations suggest that the occurrence of 2 such rare cases in a single institution within a 1-year time frame may reflect another unusual consequence of imatinib therapy.","['Kim, Annette S', 'Goldstein, Steven C', 'Luger, Selina', 'Van Deerlin, Vivianna M', 'Bagg, Adam']","['Kim AS', 'Goldstein SC', 'Luger S', 'Van Deerlin VM', 'Bagg A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry/pathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Remission Induction']",2008/03/18 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['J5K404712204120W [pii]', '10.1309/GTGTEQAFMV30W753 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2008 Apr;129(4):639-48. doi: 10.1309/GTGTEQAFMV30W753.,,,10.1309/GTGTEQAFMV30W753 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the clinical and pathologic features of 15 cases of de novo AML with normal cytogenetics and with the FLT3/ITD mutation. In comparison with patients with AML without the FLT3/ITD mutation, patients with FLT3/ITD+ AML are relatively younger, more often have marked peripheral leukocytosis with a higher number of circulating blasts at initial examination, more often have minimal differentiation morphologic features, more frequently have abnormal CD7 coexpression, and have poorer outcome.

However, in such cases, neither the Notch cleavage pattern nor the protein stability of Notch1-IC was determined to have been significantly altered. Indirubin-3'-monoxime suppresses Notch1 transcriptional activity via the dissociation of the Notch1-IC-RBP-Jk complex. Notably, the transcriptional activity of Notch1-IC was not suppressed significantly in the GSK-3beta null cells by indirubin-3'-monoxime as compared to what was observed with GSK-3beta wild-type cells. In the previous study, we synthesized a series of indirubin derivatives. Interestingly, some of these indirubin derivatives were characterized as potent inhibitors of Notch1 signaling.

In this study, we demonstrated that treatment of U937 cells with SP600125 resulted in significant G2/M cell cycle arrest that was due to decreased cyclin B1 and cdc25c protein levels. Moreover, SP600125 promoted LDH release and DNA fragmentation that was associated with caspase-3 activation and degradation of its substrates. In contrast, overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 rendered leukemia cells resistant to SP600125-induced apoptosis, but more sensitive to G2/M phase arrest and endoreduplication (>4N DNA). Overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly inhibited SP600125-induced caspase-3 activation and degradation of its substrates, and sustained expression levels of the IAP-2 proteins following SP600125 treatment. The inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on apoptosis was attenuated by treatment with the small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, HA14-1.

Here we demonstrate that in the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa and the human leukemia cell line HL-60, 4HPR caused rapid, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-dependent activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). In HeLa cells, 4HPR was shown to induce cell death and activation of procaspases. These effects of 4HPR could be abolished by the over-expression of dominant negative mutants of PERK or eIF2 alpha. HeLa cells incubated with 4HPR were found to form autophagosomes that were also mediated by the PERK/eIF2 alpha pathway. While 4HPR-induced cell death could be significantly prevented by the presence of specific caspase inhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) that inhibits autophagosome formation enhanced 4HPR-induced cell death. Examination of individual 4HPR-treated HeLa cells revealed that those without the development of autophagosomes hence exhibiting an incomplete UPR were caspase-active and were not viable, while those with autophagosomes were caspase-inactive and retained cell viability. Our data suggest that the PERK/eIF2 alpha pathway is essential for the cytotoxicity of 4HPR that targets on cancer cells with malfunctional UPR.","['Lai, Wai-Lung', 'Wong, Nai-Sum']","['Lai WL', 'Wong NS']","['Department of Biochemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080314,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (ATF6 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 6)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 6/metabolism', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fenretinide/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phagosomes/metabolism', 'Protein Folding', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'eIF-2 Kinase/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/03/18 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/03/18 09:00'],"['2007/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(08)00080-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.02.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2008 May 1;314(8):1667-82. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.02.002.

The finding of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities has influenced, in a primary way, the understanding and treatment of leukemias. Yet ""normal karyotype AML"" lacks such obvious abnormalities, but has a variety of prognostically important genetic abnormalities. Thus, the presence of a FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication), MLL-PTD (partial tandem duplication), or the increased expression of ERG or EVI1 mRNAs confer a poor prognosis, and an increased risk of relapse. In contrast, the presence of cytoplasmic nucleophosmin or C/EBPA mutations is associated with lower relapse rates and improved survival. Although resistance to treatment is associated with specific mutations, the degree to which the leukemia resembles a stem cell in its functional properties may provide greater protection from the effects of treatment. Although usually all of the circulating leukemia cells are cleared following treatment, a small residual population of leukemic cells in the bone marrow persists, making this disease hard to eradicate. Increased understanding of the biological consequences of at least some of these mutations in ""normal karyotype AML"" is leading to more targeted approaches to develop more effective treatments for this disease.","['Nimer, Stephen D']",['Nimer SD'],"['Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA. nimers@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

But how much has gene expression profiling impacted or improved current diagnosis and risk classification schemes and therapeutic targeting in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)? To date, gene expression profiling of AML has largely confirmed the presence of well-established recurring cytogenetic abnormalities, such as translocations, deletions, point mutations, or normal karyotypes, and has led to the identification of sets of genes reflective of these abnormalities. The use of expression profiling and statistical modeling to develop molecular classifiers that improve outcome prediction beyond traditional prognostic variables or the targeting of patients to specific therapies or transplantation has been less successful. Similarly, expression profiling has not led to the identification of many novel therapeutic targets in AML. Using advanced statistical modeling techniques, our group has focused on expression profiling in adult AML patients with poor risk features in order to identify novel cluster groups and potential targets for therapy in this highly resistant form of disease. To further advance the application of gene expression profiling and other comprehensive genomic and phosphoproteomic techniques to the study of AML, it would be ideal for the NCI Cooperative Groups to register all patients to common or intergroup collaborative clinical trials or registration studies in order to develop large, well-characterized cohorts of uniformly treated patients for future research studies.","['Willman, Cheryl L']",['Willman CL'],"['University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Cancer Research Facility, 2325 Camino de Salud NE, Room G03, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA. cwillman@salud.unm.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

We analyzed 181 consecutive patients who underwent MUD-PBSC transplantation at the City of Hope between August 2000 to December 2004. Patients were conditioned with either full-intensity regimen or reduced-intensity regimen. There was a significant inverse relationship between higher CD34(+) cell dose and faster neutrophil engraftment (r = -0.16, P = .035). By univariate analysis, a CD34(+) cell dose > or =4.2 x 10(6)/kg (above the lowest quartile) was associated with significantly lower relapse risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67, P = .0126), with a trend for corresponding improvement for disease-free survival (HR = 0.84, P = .12) but not overall survival (HR = 0.91, P = .46). The impact of the CD34(+) cell dose remained significant in multivariate analysis. The higher CD34(+) cell dose was significantly associated with faster recovery of absolute lymphocyte counts on day +30 posttransplant. Subset analysis demonstrated that the higher CD34(+) cell dose was associated with (1) greater reduction in relapse in myeloid malignancies than that in lymphoid malignancies, (2) greater reduction in reduced-intensity conditioning than in full-intensity conditioning, (3) greater reduction in relapse when there is a inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ligand (iKIRL)-mismatch in the gravft-versus-host (GVH) direction, and (4) greater reduction in relapse when there is a lack of iKIRL, suggesting that the protective effect of CD34(+) cell dose against relapse may be immune-mediated, possibly through NK cell recovery.","['Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Auayporn, Nademanee', 'Smith, David D', 'Palmer, Joycelynne', 'Sun, Joel Y', 'Schriber, Jeffrey', 'Pullarkat, Vinod', 'Parker, Pablo', 'Rodriguez, Roberto', 'Stein, Anthony', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Wang, Shirong', 'Karanas, Chatchada', 'Gaal, Karl', 'Senitzer, David', 'Forman, Stephen J']","['Nakamura R', 'Auayporn N', 'Smith DD', 'Palmer J', 'Sun JY', 'Schriber J', 'Pullarkat V', 'Parker P', 'Rodriguez R', 'Stein A', 'Rosenthal J', 'Wang S', 'Karanas C', 'Gaal K', 'Senitzer D', 'Forman SJ']","['Division of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010-3000, USA. makamura@coh.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/03/18 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/03/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(08)00070-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.02.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Apr;14(4):449-57. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.02.005.,,,10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.02.005 [doi],PMC3589832,,,,,['P01 CA030206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS43831'],,,,,,,,

Our study includes 221 patients with malignant diseases treated in the same institution with the same reduced intensity regimen. Other variables known to affect the transplantation outcome such as age, disease, disease risk, and donor characteristics were well-balanced between ABO-matched and ABO-mismatched transplants. Analysis of our data shows increased incidence of NRM during the first months after transplantation in the groups of patients with major and minor ABO-incompatibility. Although neither incidence nor severity of GVHD differed significantly among the different groups, we found increased mortality associated with GVHD in the major ABO-incompatible groups. Long-term OS and relapse rate were not different, although we observed a trend for decreased OS during the first year post transplantation in the group of patients with major ABO-incompatibility.

To investigate the potential role of T lymphocytes in graft rejection, we isolated a CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone of recipient origin from blood obtained from a patient with graft rejection after CBT from an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor. The isolated CTL clone specifically recognized an HLA-B( *)1501 molecule as an alloantigen, which was expressed in donor cells but not in recipient cells. The results of a microchimerism analysis specific for HLA-B( *)1501 and a polymerase chain reaction assay specific for the T cell receptor on DNA from pretransplant peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that the patient was exposed to HLA-B( *)1501 prior to CBT, and that the CTL clone was in the patient's blood prior to transplantation.

The therapy regimen was based on a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster protocol, for a total duration of 24 months. Cranial irradiation, prophylactic cranial and local, was omitted, even for patients with central nervous involvement at diagnosis. In total, 119 patients were evaluable. The median follow-up was 6.7 years. The overall event-free survival (EFS) rate at 6 years was 77.5% (standard error (SE)=4%). Median time of relapse was 1 year after complete remission (range 0.2-5.9 years). Only two (1.8%) patients had an isolated central nervous system relapse. For patients with complete response (n=16) to the 7-day prephase, the EFS rate at 6 years was 100% versus 14% (P<0.001) for patients with no response (n=7). Overall survival rate at 6 years was 86% (SE=3%). An intensive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia type chemotherapy regimen without irradiation leads to a high cure and survival rate in childhood T-LBL without an increased CNS recurrence. This suggests that prophylactic cranial irradiation can safely be omitted.

Whilst FLT3/ITD+ cells are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of FLT3 inhibitors than wild type (WT) cells, the sensitivity of FLT3/TKD+ cells to therapeutic agents is unclear, as is the importance of the mutant level. We therefore studied the effect of cytarabine and the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib, either alone or in combination, on in vitro survival of blast cells from 36 cases of AML (14 FLT3/WT, 11 FLT3/ITD+ and 11 FLT3/TKD+). All three groups showed similar sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of cytarabine but FLT3/ITD mutant level was inversely correlated with cytarabine cytotoxicity (P = 0.04) whereas FLT3/TKD mutant level had no impact. FLT3/TKD+ cells showed a similar response to lestaurtinib as FLT3/WT cells, whereas FLT3/ITD+ cells were more sensitive (P = 0.004). There was no correlation between mutant level and lestaurtinib sensitivity for either FLT3/ITD+ or FLT3/TKD+ cells. Synergistic cytotoxicity of lestaurtinib plus cytarabine was demonstrated in all three groups. These results suggest that FLT3/TKD+ and FLT3/WT cases should not be differentiated when considering patients for treatment with FLT3 inhibitors.","['Mead, Adam J', 'Gale, Rosemary E', 'Kottaridis, Panagiotis D', 'Matsuda, Satomi', 'Khwaja, Asim', 'Linch, David C']","['Mead AJ', 'Gale RE', 'Kottaridis PD', 'Matsuda S', 'Khwaja A', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, UK. adam.mead@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080312,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2008/03/18 09:00,2008/07/04 09:00,['2008/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7025 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07025.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 May;141(4):454-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07025.x.

Recently, two classes of compounds that restore the function of p53 in tumours have been described. PRIMA-1 (p53-dependent reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis) restores the wild-type conformation of mutant TP53, whereas RITA (reactivation of p53 and induction of tumour cell apoptosis) increases intracellular levels of p53. We evaluated the effects of RITA alone and in combination with PRIMA-1 or conventional cytostatics on leukaemic cells isolated from AML and CLL patients. AML samples with -17, which are more resistant to daunorubicin and cytarabine compared with samples without -17, were effectively killed by PRIMA-1. RITA, which stabilizes the function of wild-type p53, induced apoptosis in AML cells. In contrast to that seen with PRIMA-1, AML patient samples without -17 were significantly more sensitive to RITA. Similarly, RITA exerted dose-dependent apoptosis and cytotoxicity in CLL cells, which was significantly more pronounced in samples without hemizygous TP53 deletion. Notably, a synergistic effect was observed in all CLL samples with RITA and fludarabine in combination. In both AML and CLL cells exposure to RITA resulted in induction of intracellular p53. We conclude that small molecules targeting p53 might be of clinical importance in the future for treating drug-resistant leukaemia.","['Nahi, H', 'Selivanova, G', 'Lehmann, S', 'Mollgard, L', 'Bengtzen, S', 'Concha, H', 'Svensson, A', 'Wiman, K G', 'Merup, M', 'Paul, C']","['Nahi H', 'Selivanova G', 'Lehmann S', 'Mollgard L', 'Bengtzen S', 'Concha H', 'Svensson A', 'Wiman KG', 'Merup M', 'Paul C']","['Department of Haematology, Karolinska University Hospital at Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden. hareth.nahi@karolinska.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080312,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NSC 652287)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PRIMA1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Furans/pharmacology', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', '*Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2008/03/18 09:00,2008/07/04 09:00,['2008/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7046 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07046.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 May;141(4):445-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07046.x.

Lymphoblasts in PB predominantly expressed 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins (Neu5,9Ac2-GPs), sialic acid, alpha2-3 linked sialic acid, L- and P-selectins and vascular cell adhesion molecule -1 (VCAM-1) on their surface compared to BM, as determined with selective lectins and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by flow cytometric analysis.

Expression of ICAM-1 was reverse. However, MFI of Neu5,9Ac2-GPs was always higher both in CD34+CD38+ and CD34+CD38- population in PB compared to BM. Diverse trend of these cell surface macromolecules was observed during clinical remission. This is the first comparative study between PB and BM, where significant differential distribution of sialylated macromolecules and adhesion molecules was observed. Hence, supervising these cell surface macromolecules at various stages of treatment might help in minimal residual disease detection, identifying mobilization factor(s) and in isolation of normal HPCs for autologous BM transplantation.","['Chowdhury, Suchandra', 'Bandyopadhyay, Suman', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Chowdhury S', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Chandra S', 'Mandal C']","['Infectious Disease and Immunology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S.

To clarify the effect of MTHFR polymorphisms on the risk of lung cancer, a meta-analysis of all case-control observational studies was performed. The studies provided 5,111/6,415 cases/controls for C677T and 5,087/6,232 cases/controls for A1298C. The heterogeneity (P=0.0001, I(2)=76.6%) for C677T among the eight studies was extreme. Cluster analyses based on the frequencies of the C677T genotype of the control group in each study revealed that the studies could not cluster together according to their ethnicity. The random effects (RE) model showed that the 677T allele was not associated with the risk of lung cancer compared with the C allele [OR=1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.97-1.28), P=0.12]. The contrast of homozygotes, recessive model, dominant model produced the same pattern of results as the allele contrast. In regard to the A1298C polymorphism, there was no heterogeneity among the seven studies comparing the C versus the A allele (P=0.24, I(2)=24.4%), but no significant association was detected by the RE model or the fixed effects model [FE odds ratio (OR)=0.99 (0.93-1.05) and RE OR=1.00 (0.92-1.08)].

Although MTHFR polymorphisms were associated with the risk of colorectal cancer, leukemia, and gastric cancer supported by other meta-analysis, our pooled data suggest no evidence for a major role of these two variants in carcinogenesis of lung cancer. The results implied that different tumors evolve by different pathological pathways and the roles of MTHFR in cancer is determined by its target genes.","['Mao, Renfang', 'Fan, Yihui', 'Jin, Yan', 'Bai, Jing', 'Fu, Songbin']","['Mao R', 'Fan Y', 'Jin Y', 'Bai J', 'Fu S']","['Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150081, China.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150081, China.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150081, China.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150081, China.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150081, China. fusb@ems.hrbmu.edu.cn.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Key Laboratory of Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, 150081, China. fusb@ems.hrbmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080314,England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Cluster Analysis', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2007/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10038-008-0262-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s10038-008-0262-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2008;53(4):340-348. doi: 10.1007/s10038-008-0262-6.

RESULTS: We treated 20 patients (16 women), mean age 32 years. Twelve patients were comatose and 14 had hemorrhagic infarcts before thrombolysis. Twelve patients recovered (Rankin score 0 to 2), 2 survived with handicaps, and 6 died. Factors associated with a fatal outcome were leukemia (3/6 versus 0/14, P=0.02) and large hemorrhagic infarcts (4/6 versus 2/14, P=0.04). Seizures were less frequent in the fatal cases (P=0.05). Patients who died had a larger mean lesion surface than survivors (30.5 versus 13.6 cm(2); P=0.03), larger midline shift (5.2 versus 1.7 mm; P=0.02), and a more rapid course (2.7 versus 8.2 days; P=0.01). Five patients who died had large hemispheric infarcts and edema before thrombolysis, causing herniation. Five patients had increased cerebral hemorrhage (3 minor, 2 major) after thrombolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolysis can be effective for severe sinus thrombosis, but patients may deteriorate because of increased cerebral hemorrhage. Patients with large infarcts and impending herniation did not benefit.","['Stam, Jan', 'Majoie, Charles B L M', 'van Delden, Otto M', 'van Lienden, Krijn P', 'Reekers, Jim A']","['Stam J', 'Majoie CB', 'van Delden OM', 'van Lienden KP', 'Reekers JA']","['Department of Neurology, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The HTLV-I protein Tax alters gene expression, including those of cytokines and their receptors, which plays an important role in early stages of ATL. Here we demonstrate that expression of interleukin-9 (IL-9) is activated by Tax via an NF-kappaB motif in its proximal promoter, whereas IL-9 receptor-alpha (IL-9Ralpha) expression is not induced by Tax. However, supporting a role for IL-9/IL-9Ralpha in ATL, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed toward IL-9Ralpha inhibited ex vivo spontaneous proliferation of primary ATL cells from several patients. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these patients revealed high level expression of IL-9Ralpha on their CD14-expressing monocytes. Furthermore, purified T cells or monocytes alone from these patients did not proliferate ex vivo, whereas mixtures of these cell types manifested significant proliferation through a contact-dependent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that primary ATL cells, via IL-9, support the action of IL-9Ralpha/CD14-expressing monocytes, which subsequently support the ex vivo spontaneous proliferation of malignant T cells. In summary, these data support a role for IL-9 and its receptor in ATL by a paracrine mechanism.","['Chen, Jing', 'Petrus, Mike', 'Bryant, Bonita R', 'Phuc Nguyen, Vinh', 'Stamer, Mindy', 'Goldman, Carolyn K', 'Bamford, Richard', 'Morris, John C', 'Janik, John E', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Chen J', 'Petrus M', 'Bryant BR', 'Phuc Nguyen V', 'Stamer M', 'Goldman CK', 'Bamford R', 'Morris JC', 'Janik JE', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20080313,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-9)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-9)']",IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-9/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Monocytes', '*Paracrine Communication', 'Receptors, Interleukin-9/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47202-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-113654 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 15;111(10):5163-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-113654.

These experiments were possible through the use of calibrated, real-time fluorescence microscopy and the development of a microcuvette: a specialized device designed for exposing cell cultures to intense PEFs while carrying out real-time microscopy. A finite-element electrostatic simulation was carried out to assess the degree of electric field heterogeneity between the microcuvette's electrodes allowing us to correlate trends in electroporative response to electric field distribution. Analysis of experimental data identified two distinctive electroporative uptake signatures: one characterized by low-level, decelerating uptake beginning immediately after PEF exposure and the other by high-level, accelerating fluorescence that is manifested sometimes hundreds of seconds after PEF exposure. The qualitative nature of these fluorescence signatures was used to isolate the conditions required to induce exclusively transient electroporation and to discuss electropore stability and persistence. A range of electric field strengths resulting in transient electroporation was identified for HL60s under our experimental conditions existing between 1.6 and 2 kV/cm. Quantitative analysis was used to determine that HL60s experiencing transient electroporation internalized between 50 and 125 million nucleic acid-bound PI molecules per cell. Finally, we show that electric field heterogeneity may be used to elicit asymmetric electroporative PI uptake within cell cultures and within individual cells.","['Kennedy, S M', 'Ji, Z', 'Hedstrom, J C', 'Booske, J H', 'Hagness, S C']","['Kennedy SM', 'Ji Z', 'Hedstrom JC', 'Booske JH', 'Hagness SC']","['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA. smkennedy@wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080313,United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,['0 (Biopolymers)'],IM,"['Biopolymers/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electroporation/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate/radiation effects', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', '*Models, Biological']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/06/28 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(08)70365-5 [pii]', '10.1529/biophysj.106.103218 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2008 Jun;94(12):5018-27. doi: 10.1529/biophysj.106.103218.

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of PROK1 and prokineticin receptor 1 (PROKR1) in human endometrium during early pregnancy. PROK1 and PROKR1 expression is significantly elevated in first-trimester decidua, compared with nonpregnant endometrium. Expression of PROK1 and PROKR1 was localized in glandular epithelial and various cellular compartments within the stroma. To investigate the signaling pathways and target genes activated by PROK1, we generated an endometrial epithelial cell line stably expressing PROKR1 (Ishikawa PROKR1 cells). PROK1-PROKR1 interaction induced inositol phosphate mobilization and sequential phosphorylation of c-Src, epidermal growth factor receptor, and ERK 1/2. Gene microarray analysis on RNA extracted from Ishikawa PROKR1 cells treated with 40 nm PROK1 for 8 h revealed 49 genes to be differentially regulated. A number of these genes, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-11 are regulated in the endometrium during implantation and early pregnancy. We subsequently investigated the effect of PROK1 on expression of COX-2 in Ishikawa PROKR1 cells and first-trimester decidua. COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, and prostaglandin synthesis, were elevated in response to treatment with PROK1. Moreover, expression of COX-2 by PROK1 was dependent on activation of the Gq-phospholipase C-beta-cSrc-epidermal growth factor receptor-MAPK/ERK kinase pathway. These data demonstrate that PROK1 and PROKR1 expression is elevated in human decidua during early pregnancy and that PROK1-PROKR1 interaction regulates expression of a host of implantation-related genes.","['Evans, Jemma', 'Catalano, Rob D', 'Morgan, Kevin', 'Critchley, Hilary O D', 'Millar, Robert P', 'Jabbour, Henry N']","['Evans J', 'Catalano RD', 'Morgan K', 'Critchley HO', 'Millar RP', 'Jabbour HN']","[""Medical Research Council Human Reproductive Sciences Unit, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080313,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gastrointestinal Hormones)', '0 (PROK1 protein, human)', '0 (PROKR1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Endocrine-Gland-Derived)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'Decidua/physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Endometrium/cytology/physiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Hormones/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Menstrual Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Pregnancy/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Endocrine-Gland-Derived/genetics/*physiology']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2007-1633 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2007-1633 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2008 Jun;149(6):2877-87. doi: 10.1210/en.2007-1633.

In a prospectively enrolled population-based case-control study of Han Chinese conducted in Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan, a total of 114 leukemia cases and 221 controls <20 years old were recruited between November 1997 and December 2005. The present study set out to evaluate the association between childhood leukemia and both maternal and offspring's genotypes. To do so, we conducted a systematic assessment of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the 5' flanking 10 kb to 3' UTR of AKR1C3 gene. Gln5His and three tagSNPs (rs2245191, rs10508293 and rs3209896) and one multimarker (rs2245191, rs10508293 and rs3209896) were selected with average 90% coverage of untagged SNPs by using the HapMap II data set. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for age and gender. After correcting for multiple comparisons, we observed that risk of developing childhood leukemia is significantly associated with rs10508293 polymorphism on intron 4 of the AKR1C3 gene in both offspring alone and in the combined maternal and offspring genotypes (nominal P < 0.0001, permutation P < 0.005). The maternal methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase A1298C polymorphism was found to be an effect modifier of the maternal intron 4 polymorphism of the AKR1C3 gene (rs10508293) and the childhood leukemia risk.

A major hurdle, however, is to promote the directed and efficient differentiation of ES cells toward a specific lineage. Here, we define in serum-free media the minimal factor requirement controlling each step of the differentiation process, resulting in the production of highly enriched hematopoietic progenitors. Four factors - Bmp4, activin A, bFGF (Fgf2) and VEGF (VegfA) - are sufficient to drive the selective and efficient differentiation of mouse ES cells to hematopoiesis. Each of these factors appears to regulate a step of the process: Bmp4 promotes the very efficient formation of mesoderm; bFGF and activin A induce the differentiation of these mesodermal precursors to the hemangioblast fate; and VEGF is required for the production of fully committed hematopoietic progenitors. The stimulation of mesodermal precursors by bFGF and activin A switches on very rapidly the hematopoietic program, allowing us to dissect the molecular events leading to the formation of the hemangioblast. Runx1, Scl (Tal1) and Hhex expression is upregulated within 3 hours of stimulation, whereas upregulation of Lmo2 and Fli1 is observed later. Interestingly, increased expression levels of genes such as cMyb, Pu.1 (Sfpi1), Gata1 and Gata2 are not observed at the onset of hemangioblast commitment. This stepwise control of differentiation is extremely efficient, giving rise to a very high frequency of hematopoietic precursors, and provides an optimal system for understanding the molecular machineries involved in blood progenitor commitment.","['Pearson, Stella', 'Sroczynska, Patrycja', 'Lacaud, Georges', 'Kouskoff, Valerie']","['Pearson S', 'Sroczynska P', 'Lacaud G', 'Kouskoff V']","['Cancer Research UK, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Manchester University, Wilmslow Road, M20 4BX, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080313,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hhex protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (activin A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)']",IM,"['Activins/*pharmacology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*pharmacology']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/06/12 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['dev.011767 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.011767 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2008 Apr;135(8):1525-35. doi: 10.1242/dev.011767.

We used gene expression analysis to identify cellular factors underlying Bu resistance. Two Bu-resistant leukemia cell lines were established, characterized and analyzed for differentially expressed genes. The CML B5/Bu250(6) cells are 4.5-fold more resistant to Bu than their parental B5 cells. The AML KBM3/Bu250(6) cells are 4.0-fold more Bu-resistant than KBM3 parental cells. Both resistant sublines evade Bu-mediated G2-arrest and apoptosis with altered regulations of CHK2 and CDC2 proteins, constitutively up-regulated anti-apoptotic genes (BCL-X(L), BCL2, BCL2L10, BAG3 and IAP2/BIRC3) and down-regulated pro-apoptotic genes (BIK, BNIP3, and LTBR). Bu-induced apoptosis is partly mediated by activation of caspases; use of the inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK completely abrogated PARP1 cleavage and reduced apoptosis by approximately 50%. Furthermore, Bu resistance in these cells may be attributed in part to up-regulation of HSP90 protein and activation of STAT3. The inhibition of HSP90 with geldanamycin attenuated phosphorylated STAT3 and made B5/Bu250(6) and KBM3/Bu250(6) more Bu-sensitive. The analysis of cells derived from patients classified as either clinically resistant or sensitive to high-dose Bu-based chemotherapy indicated alterations in gene expression that were analogous to those observed in the in vitro model cell lines, confirming the potential clinical relevance of this model for Bu resistance.","['Valdez, Benigno C', 'Murray, David', 'Ramdas, Latha', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Jones, Roy', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Betancourt, Daniel', 'Li, Yang', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Andersson, Borje S']","['Valdez BC', 'Murray D', 'Ramdas L', 'de Lima M', 'Jones R', 'Kornblau S', 'Betancourt D', 'Li Y', 'Champlin RE', 'Andersson BS']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080312,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Busulfan/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2007/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00055-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Nov;32(11):1684-97. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.01.016.

In our previous studies, overexpression of ODC prevented apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and methotrexate. We further investigated the apoptotic mechanisms of the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, including etoposide (VP-16), paclitaxel (TAX) and cisplatin (CDDP), and the influences of ODC on apoptosis and cell cycle. Our results showed that the investigated drugs induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi m) in HL-60 cells, all of which were reversed by putrescine, glutathione or N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Overexpression of ODC prevented the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis, ROS generation and the disruption of Deltapsi m. After drug administrations, the decline of Bcl-2, cytochrome c release and caspases' activation were inhibited by ODC overexpression. In cell cycle, ODC overexpressed cells seemed to overcome the G1 arrest and G2/M arrest, caused by VP-16 and TAX, respectively, and kept on the cell cycle rolling. Overexpression of ODC increased the expression of Cyclin A, D, E and Cdk4 and the enzyme activity of Cdk1 and Cdk2 after the treatment of VP-16 and TAX, respectively. In conclusions, the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis is through ROS-related, mitochondria-mediated and caspase-dependent pathways. With higher ODC activity, cells are resistant to the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis and keep on the cell cycle rolling with the significant interference in G1/S arrest caused by VP-16 and G2/M arrest by TAX.","['Hsu, Pei-Chen', 'Hung, Hui-Chih', 'Liao, Ya-Fan', 'Liu, Chu-Chen', 'Tsay, Gregory J', 'Liu, Guang-Yaw']","['Hsu PC', 'Hung HC', 'Liao YF', 'Liu CC', 'Tsay GJ', 'Liu GY']","['Department of Life Sciences, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080312,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cisplatin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Etoposide/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Putrescine/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00056-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.01.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Oct;32(10):1530-40. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.01.017.

To determine whether a Neu3 is able to modulate megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, we studied the functional significance of human Neu3 induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that the induction of hST3Gal V, which synthesizes ganglioside GM3 and reduction of Neu3 by PMA, are linked for the expression of differentiation marker protein, CD41b surface antigen. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the down-regulation of the CD41b surface antigen expression when Neu3 gene is expressed in PMA-treated cells, we characterized the Neu3-mediated signaling pathway. Neu3 overexpression inhibited the PMA-induced ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the K562 cells. Down-regulation of expression of CD41b surface antigen was dependent on expression of Neu3 gene. However, a Neu3 inhibitor Neu5Ac2en induced morphological changes, showing megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, with expression of CD41b surface antigen, while a specific glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor PDMP inhibited megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. The molecular mechanisms involved in Neu3-involved inhibition of CD41b surface antigen expression in K562 cells have been suggested: the Neu3 degrades membrane sialic acids and the resulting signaling pathway of the PKC/ERKs/p38 MAPK is down-regulated, causing a decrease in CD41b surface antigen expression and inhibition of megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells.","['Jin, Un-Ho', 'Ha, Ki-Tae', 'Kim, Kyung-Woon', 'Chang, Young-Chae', 'Lee, Young-Coon', 'Ko, Jeong-Heon', 'Kim, Cheorl-Ho']","['Jin UH', 'Ha KT', 'Kim KW', 'Chang YC', 'Lee YC', 'Ko JH', 'Kim CH']","['Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Chunchun-Dong 300, Suwon, Kyunggi-Do 440-746, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080220,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (ITGA2B protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha2)', '0 (Morpholines)', '24967-27-9 (2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid)', '73257-80-4 (RV 538)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.9 (haematoside synthetase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neu3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glucosyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha2/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Models, Biological', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Neuraminidase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialyltransferases/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-4165(08)00034-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2008.01.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 May;1780(5):757-63. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2008.01.019.

However, telomere regulation mechanisms, as one of the possible major mechanisms by which hMSCs sustain their stem cell characteristics, remain unknown. We isolated hMSCs by plastic adhesion and characterized these cells by morphology, immune phenotype and differentiation capacity. Telomerase was found negative in hMSCs, but slightly up-regulated in hMSC-derived adipocytes by the Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) assay. Moreover, hMSCs lack the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism, because the hallmarks of ALT, such as very long and heterogeneous telomeres, extra-chromosome telomere repeat DNA (ECTR), and ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APBs), were not evident. However, when hMSCs were arrested in S phase with a combination of serum deprivation and aphidicolin, previously undetectable telomerase activity became predominantly positive. Meanwhile, the expression level of hTERT protein and mRNA increased, paralleled with the appearance of a large cohort of synchronized hMSCs at S phase. These findings provide a profile of telomere regulation by cell cycle dependent expression of telomerase in hMSCs and may lead to a better understanding of the stem cell nature of these cells.","['Zhao, Yan-Min', 'Li, Jing-Yuan', 'Lan, Jian-Ping', 'Lai, Xiao-Yu', 'Luo, Yi', 'Sun, Jie', 'Yu, Jian', 'Zhu, Yuan-Yuan', 'Zeng, Fen-Fang', 'Zhou, Qian', 'Huang, He']","['Zhao YM', 'Li JY', 'Lan JP', 'Lai XY', 'Luo Y', 'Sun J', 'Yu J', 'Zhu YY', 'Zeng FF', 'Zhou Q', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080311,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*enzymology', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Phenotype', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/05/15 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(08)00448-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 May 16;369(4):1114-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.03.011.

One hundred and forty-two patients out of 323 that underwent autologous transplantation for lymphoproliferative disorders were studied. The risk factors that were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis included: gender, sex, age, diagnosis, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy prior to conditioning regimen, disease status at peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) and type of harvest. Three patients developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (sMDS/AML) and three patients developed solid neoplasia. By univariate analysis diagnosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia and use of fludarabine and monoclonal antibodies were the only variables significantly associated with the development of sMDS/AML. By multivariate analysis, the variables associated with sMDS/AML were the use of fludarabine and disease status at PBSCT. By univariate analysis, we found that radiotherapy and the use of monoclonal antibodies were significantly associated with the development of secondary solid neoplasia. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the only two variables significantly associated with new cancers were radiotherapy and prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies. We report the lowest incidence of sMDS/AML after autologous stem-cell transplantation for lymphoproliferative malignancies. Major reasons could be ascribed to the stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria used to establish the real incidence of sMDS/AML because of chemo-radiotherapy used before transplant procedure. The low incidence of secondary solid tumors could be caused by the absence of total body irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen or the short follow-up.","['Laurenti, Luca', 'Tarnani, Michela', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'La Torre, Giuseppe', 'Garzia, Mariagrazia', 'Zollino, Marcella', 'Zini, Gina', 'Balducci, Mario', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Sica, Simona']","['Laurenti L', 'Tarnani M', 'Chiusolo P', 'La Torre G', 'Garzia M', 'Zollino M', 'Zini G', 'Balducci M', 'Leone G', 'Sica S']","['Department of Haematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore-Roma, Rome, Italy. l.laurenti@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*complications/epidemiology', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['CTR768 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-0012.2007.00768.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2008 Mar-Apr;22(2):191-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2007.00768.x.,,,10.1111/j.1399-0012.2007.00768.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that LIF protects mature rat OLG cultures selectively against the combined insult of the proinflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but it does not protect against oxidative stress nor against staurosporine induced apoptosis. We further demonstrate that LIF activates the janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt pathway in mature OLG. We show that LIF protection is independent of suppressors of cytokine signaling and Bcl-2 mRNA expression levels. To gain further insight into the protective mechanism, a quantitative proteomic approach (DIGE) was applied to identify differentially expressed proteins in LIF-treated OLG. Our results indicate that LIF induces a shift in the cellular machinery toward a prosurvival execution program, illustrated by an enhanced expression of isoforms of the antiapoptotic molecule 14-3-3. These data provide further insight into the mechanisms of LIF-mediated protection of mature OLGs.","['Slaets, Helena', 'Dumont, Debora', 'Vanderlocht, Joris', 'Noben, Jean-Paul', 'Leprince, Pierre', 'Robben, Johan', 'Hendriks, Jerome', 'Stinissen, Piet', 'Hellings, Niels']","['Slaets H', 'Dumont D', 'Vanderlocht J', 'Noben JP', 'Leprince P', 'Robben J', 'Hendriks J', 'Stinissen P', 'Hellings N']","['Hasselt University, Biomedical Research Institute and Transnationale Universiteit Limburg, School of Life Sciences, Diepenbeek, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.200700641 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2008 Mar;8(6):1237-47. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200700641.,,,10.1002/pmic.200700641 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated 3 new agents against 2 new K562 variants, IM-R1 and IM-R2 cells, which were developed having 7- and 27-fold greater IM resistance, respectively, than the parental K562 cells. Both variants possessed BCR-ABL gene amplification along with elevated levels of its transcript and protein. Greater BCR-ABL gene amplification was observed in IM-R2 cells than in IM-R1 cells, which was consistent with the higher mRNA and protein levels of Bcr-Abl, and ultimately correlated with the greater IM resistance in IM-R2 cells. No mutation in the Abl kinase domain was detected in either variant. Despite the absence of Lyn overexpression, the Src kinase inhibitor CGP76030 showed positive cooperability with IM in inhibiting cell growth of not only K562 cells but also these 2 variants. This might be because of the augmented inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation. The new Abl kinase inhibitor nilotinib was 10-fold more potent than IM in inhibiting the growth of K562 cells. Nilotinib inhibited the growth of IM-R1 and IM-R2 cells as potently as K562 cells. The combination of nilotinib with CGP76030 showed little additivity, because the potency of nilotinib masked the efficacy of CGP76030. The new dual Abl/Lyn inhibitor INNO-406 (formerly NS-187) was slightly more potent than nilotinib in inhibiting the growth of all 3 cell lines. Because BCR-ABL gene amplification occurs in blast crisis, these inhibitors might overcome IM resistance in such patients' leukemia.","['Morinaga, Koji', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Maekawa, Taira', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Morinaga K', 'Yamauchi T', 'Kimura S', 'Maekawa T', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CGP 76030)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'NVW4Z03I9B (bafetinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/isolation & purification', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Amplification', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23435 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Jun 1;122(11):2621-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23435.,,,10.1002/ijc.23435 [doi],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Western blotting analysis was carried out to determine the apoptosis-related proteins. Proliferation inhibition of L1210 cells by alternol was found remarkably in a dose-dependent manner. When treated with alternol, apoptotic morphological features of L1210 cells were observed by fluorescent microscopy (AO/EB) and the apoptosis rate was also elevated in a time-dependent manner. After treatments with various concentrations of alternol for 48 h, DNA laddering appeared. The increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was found after cells were exposed to alternol for 6 h, while the decrease of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi m) was not found until cells were exposed to alternol for 24 h. Furthermore, the level of Bcel-2 and Bcl-2/Bax was down-regulated, while the level of caspase-3 and caspase-9 but not caspase-8 was up-regulated when alternol was added for 72 h. In summary, the results suggested that alternol could inhibit the proliferation of L1210 cells and induce apoptosis of L1210 cells, which was mediated by mitochondria-dependent pathway.","['Liu, Zhao-zhe', 'Chen, Jie-peng', 'Zhao, Su-lan', 'Li, Chang-ling']","['Liu ZZ', 'Chen JP', 'Zhao SL', 'Li CL']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100083, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Yao Xue Xue Bao,Yao xue xue bao = Acta pharmaceutica Sinica,21710340R,"['0 (Alternol)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Alternaria/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2008/03/15 09:00,2009/08/11 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Yao Xue Xue Bao. 2007 Dec;42(12):1259-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessment of a clinical case.,608-10,"Neutropenic enterocolitis is a severe and potentially life-threatening complication that may affect patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia or lymphoma. These patients may develop systemic sepsis through bacterial or fungal translocation across the intestinal wall. In many cases neutropenic enterocolitis is confined to the cecum, but the entire colon is sometimes involved. Most patients are treated conservatively because an improvement occurs when the absolute neutrophil count rises. However, a surgical approach consisting of resection of the colon may sometimes be necessary, even in patients with complete aplasia and a high risk of complications. The right time to perform surgery is hard to define. Intestinal wall thickness, evaluated by ultrasound, is an important prognostic factor which could act as a guide to surgical indication. We analyze a case of neutropenic enterocolitis which occurred in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia during chemotherapy and we suggest that, as well as intestinal wall thickness, hemodynamic worsening should be considered an indication for surgery.","['Bagnoli, Pietro', 'Castagna, Luca', 'Cozzaglio, Luca', 'Rossetti, Carlo', 'Quagliuolo, Vittorio', 'Zago, Mauro', 'Santoro, Armando', 'Doci, Roberto']","['Bagnoli P', 'Castagna L', 'Cozzaglio L', 'Rossetti C', 'Quagliuolo V', 'Zago M', 'Santoro A', 'Doci R']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, Istituto Clinico Humanitas, Rozzano, Milan, Italy. pietro.bagnoli@humanitas.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Colectomy/methods/*standards', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects', 'Enterocolitis, Neutropenic/chemically induced/drug therapy/*pathology/*surgery', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Time Factors']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/03/21 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2007 Nov-Dec;93(6):608-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infections with these viruses induce chronic antigenicity and may stimulate clonal expansion of malignant B-cell neoplasms. Moreover, these viruses can proliferate in lymphatic structures and bone marrow. However, the relationship between lymphomas and HBV/HCV infections is not clear. In our region of the East Black Sea, Turkey (the city of Trabzon), we intended to demonstrate a relation of lymphoma and HBV/HCV infections with a case-controlled study. METHODS: A total of 109 patients diagnosed with lymphoma between 2002-2005 in the Black Sea Technical University Hospital was investigated. Seventy-one patients had a high-grade and 38 patients a low-grade lymphoma. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV Ab) were screened. The control group consisted of patients (n = 551) from other departments with diagnoses other than lymphoma. RESULTS: HBsAg was 3.7% and anti-HCV Ab positivity was 2.8% in lymphoma patients, compared with control of 5.3%, 5.1%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups (P = 0.7, OR = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.20-2.10; P = 0.4, OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.13-1.86, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the incidence of HBV and HCV infections in lymphoma patients is no different than that of nonlymphoma patients. Therefore, no direct correlation can be deduced between lymphoma and HBV-HCV infections in our East Black Sea region of Turkey.","['Sonmez, Mehmet', 'Bektas, Ozlen', 'Yilmaz, Mustafa', 'Durmus, Ahmet', 'Akdogan, Elif', 'Topbas, Murat', 'Erturk, Murat', 'Ovali, Ercument', 'Omay, Serdar Bedii']","['Sonmez M', 'Bektas O', 'Yilmaz M', 'Durmus A', 'Akdogan E', 'Topbas M', 'Erturk M', 'Ovali E', 'Omay SB']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey. mesonmez@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/*complications/immunology', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/blood', 'Hepatitis C/*complications/immunology', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/virology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",2008/03/15 09:00,2008/03/21 09:00,['2008/03/15 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2007 Nov-Dec;93(6):536-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examines the prevalence of and the risk factors for overweight and obesity in a cohort of ALL survivors treated and living in the French speaking part of Switzerland. METHODS: In this retrospective two-center study, height and weight of 54 patients diagnosed with ALL in first complete remission and treated with chemotherapy only were recorded at specified time points during treatment and off-therapy. Body mass index (BMI) and its age- and gender-adjusted standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) were calculated for the patients and their parents separately. Overweight and obesity were defined by a threshold of BMI-SDS >1.645 and BMI-SDS >1.96, respectively. RESULTS: At last follow-up, 16 (30%) of the 54 survivors were overweight and 10 (18%) were obese. The off-treatment period was most at risk with 11 of the 16 becoming overweight and 9 of the 10 becoming obese during that period. Overweight/obesity at diagnosis and abnormal maternal BMI were significantly associated with abnormal weight at follow-up, while age at diagnosis, gender, cumulative dose of steroids and paternal BMI showed no association. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with published evidence from other regions of the developed and developing world, there is a significant prevalence of obesity in young ALL survivors in the French speaking part of Switzerland. Factors significantly associated with this late effect were mostly related to the familial background rather than to the treatment components.","['Asner, S', 'Ammann, R A', 'Ozsahin, H', 'Beck-Popovic, M', 'von der Weid, N X']","['Asner S', 'Ammann RA', 'Ozsahin H', 'Beck-Popovic M', 'von der Weid NX']","['Department of Pediatrics, 1009 Lausanne-CHUV, Switzerland. sandra.asner@chuv.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Obesity/*etiology', 'Overweight/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors']",2008/03/14 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21496 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jul;51(1):118-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21496.,,,10.1002/pbc.21496 [doi],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

However, the subsequent steps in this process are incompletely understood. One of the key molecules involved is tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha): its expression is regulated by ROS and it regulates ROS production in turn. This cytokine has been the focus of many studies addressing the mechanisms of different forms of diabetes-induced embryopathies, such as early pregnancy loss, inborn anomalies, fetal growth retardation as well as some pathologies appearing during adult life. In this review, we analyze the results of these studies and discuss how TNFalpha may regulate the response of pre- and post-implantation stage embryos to diabetes-induced detrimental stimuli. The data presented in this review suggest that TNFalpha may play a dual role in the pathogenesis of diabetes-induced embryopathies. It may act both as a mediator of diabetes-induced embryotoxic stimuli leading to the death of peri-implantation stage embryos and, possibly, as a suppressor of diabetes-induced apoptosis in post-implantation stage embryos. It also appears that TNFalpha fulfills these functions via interaction with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the transcription factor NF-kappaB. These molecules are presently considered as attractive targets for the treatment of diabetes-induced complications.

Our results confirm the existence of heterogeneously altered phenotypes among CD34(+) HPC from MDS and indicate that such variability depends both on the relative distribution of the different subsets of CD34(+) HPC committed into the different myeloid and B-lymphoid compartments, and their immunophenotype (for example, higher reactivity for CD117 and CD13 and lower expression of CyMPO, CD64 and CD65 on CD34(+) immature and neutrophil precursors), a clear association existing between the accumulation of CD34(+) HPC and that of immature CD34(+) HPC. Interestingly, expansion of erythroid- and neutrophil-lineage CD34(+) cells is detected in low-grade MDS at the expense of CD34(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cell and B-cell precursors, while expansion of immature CD34(+) precursors occurs in high-grade MDS.

Loss of AML1 function causes expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells, whereas it is not sufficient for the development of leukemia. To identify essential mechanisms through which AML1-Evi-1 exerts full leukemogenic potential, we introduced AML1-Evi-1 and its mutants in murine bone marrow cells, and evaluated their transforming activities by colony replating assays. The transforming activity of AML1-Evi-1 was lost when any of the known functional domains of Evi-1 was deleted from the chimeric protein, and forced expression of Evi-1 did not transform the AML1-deleted bone marrow cells. Unlike the MLL-ENL and AML1-ETO leukemia-related chimeric proteins, AML1-Evi-1 could transform only the hematopoietic stem cell fraction. Moreover, AML1-Evi-1-transformed cells show a cell-marker profile distinct from that of the cells transformed by AML1-ETO, which also suppresses AML1 function. Thus, leukemogenic activity of AML1-Evi-1 may be due to activation of molecular mechanisms distinct from those activated by MLL-ENL or AML1-ETO in the hematopoietic stem cell fractions.","['Takeshita, M', 'Ichikawa, M', 'Nitta, E', 'Goyama, S', 'Asai, T', 'Ogawa, S', 'Chiba, S', 'Kurokawa, M']","['Takeshita M', 'Ichikawa M', 'Nitta E', 'Goyama S', 'Asai T', 'Ogawa S', 'Chiba S', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080313,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",2008/03/14 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200853 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.53 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jun;22(6):1241-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.53.

Conditional HoxA9 activation in BLIN-2 resulted in increased proliferation in the presence and absence of stromal cell support. Stimulation of HoxA9 activity resulted in increased expression of the c-Myb transcription factor and induction of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) surface expression. HoxA9-mediated proliferative effects in BLIN-2 cells were abrogated when the cells were treated with specific IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors or with an IGF-1R mAb (A12). IGF-1R expression correlated with endogenous HoxA9 expression in a small panel of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)/AF4 cell lines. siRNA knockdown of endogenous HoxA9 expression in the MLL/AF4-positive cell line RS4;11 resulted in loss of IGF-1R expression.

However, little is known about its effects on the immune system. In this report, we examine the effects of sorafenib on the proliferation and activation of human peripheral blood T cells, as well as its effects on T-cell-mediated immune response in mice. At concentrations similar to those used in patients, sorafenib inhibited the proliferation of primary human T cells in vitro. At more than 10 microM, sorafenib caused an irrecoverable inhibition of proliferation, even after drug withdrawal. In addition, sorafenib induced T-cell apoptosis at concentrations higher than 10 muM. sorafenib also caused G(0)/G(1) phase arrest, inhibition of CD25 and CD69 expression, interleukin-2 production and LCK phosphorylation in the T cells; all of these effects exhibited dose and time dependence. When tested against contact dermatitis in mice, sorafenib significantly reduced the ear swelling induced by picryl chloride. These findings suggest that sorafenib may cause the loss of T-cell immune response by inducing apoptosis and targeting LCK.

We investigated the role of adiponectin and leptin levels in the etiopathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a preleukemic condition with increasing incidence which has recently been associated with obesity. METHODS: In a case-control study, 101 cases with incident, histologically confirmed primary MDS and 101 controls matched on gender and age were studied between 2004 and 2007, and blood samples were collected. RESULTS: Higher serum adiponectin levels were associated with lower risk of MDS by bivariate analysis and after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and serum levels of leptin (p < 0.001). Subjects in the third quartile for leptin levels had a lower risk of MDS than controls, and low leptin concentrations were observed in low-risk MDS patients with normal or good prognostic karyotype after adjusting for age, gender and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating adiponectin and leptin may play an important role in MDS etiopathogenesis. Future studies are needed to confirm these associations and to explore underlying mechanisms.","['Dalamaga, Maria', 'Nikolaidou, Athina', 'Karmaniolas, Konstantinos', 'Hsi, Alex', 'Chamberland, John', 'Dionyssiou-Asteriou, Amalia', 'Mantzoros, Christos S']","['Dalamaga M', 'Nikolaidou A', 'Karmaniolas K', 'Hsi A', 'Chamberland J', 'Dionyssiou-Asteriou A', 'Mantzoros CS']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Medical School, University of Athens, Attikon General University Hospital, Chaidari, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080313,Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Leptin)']",IM,"['Adiponectin/*blood', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leptin/*blood', 'Leukemia/blood/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/*etiology', 'Obesity/blood/*complications', 'Precancerous Conditions/*blood/*etiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis']",2008/03/14 09:00,2008/04/15 09:00,['2008/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['000120995 [pii]', '10.1159/000120995 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2007;73(1-2):26-32. doi: 10.1159/000120995.

MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that show variable expression during myeloid differentiation. MicroRNA expression in marrow blasts in 215 cases of newly diagnosed and (cyto)genetically defined AML was assessed using quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 260 human microRNAs. In the same series, mRNA gene expression profiles were established, allowing a direct comparison between microRNA and mRNA expression. We show that microRNA expression profiling following unsupervised analysis reveals distinctive microRNA signatures that correlate with cytogenetic and molecular subtypes of AML (ie, AMLs with t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16), NPM1, and CEBPA mutations). Significantly differentially expressed microRNAs for genetic subtypes of AML were identified. Specific microRNAs with established oncogenic and tumor suppressor functions, such as microRNA-155, microRNA-21, and let-7, appear to be associated with particular subtypes. Combinations of selected sets of microRNAs could predict cytogenetically normal AML with mutations in the genes of NPM1 and CEBPA and FLT3-ITD with similar accuracy as mRNA probe set combinations defined by gene expression profiling. MicroRNA expression apparently bears specific relationships to the heterogeneous pathobiology of AML.

Overall, proliferation of neoplastic B cells highly varied among the different B-CLPD subtypes, the greatest numbers of proliferating cells being identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL).

We hypothesized that a coactivator of the serum response factor (SRF), megakaryoblastic leukemia factor-1 (MKL1), stimulates alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) transcription in primary cultures of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTC), which convert into myofibroblasts on treatment with TGF-beta1. Herein, we study the effect of MKL1 expression on alpha-SMA in these cells. We demonstrate that TGF-beta1 stimulation of alpha-SMA transcription is mediated through CC(A/T)(6)-rich GG elements known to bind to SRF. These elements also mediate the MKL1 effect that dramatically activates alpha-SMA transcription in serum-free media. MKL1 fused to green fluorescent protein localizes to the nucleus and induces alpha-SMA expression regardless of treatment with TGF-beta1. Using proteasome inhibitors, we also demonstrate that the proteolytic ubiquitin pathway regulates MKL1 expression. These data indicate that MKL1 overexpression is sufficient to induce alpha-SMA expression. Inhibition of endogenous expression of MKL1 by small interfering RNA abolishes TGF-beta1 stimulation of alpha-SMA expression. Therefore, MKL1 is also absolutely required for TGF-beta1 stimulation of alpha-SMA expression. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis show that overexpressed and endogenous MKL1 are located in the nucleus in non-stimulated RTC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrates that TGF-beta1 induces binding of endogenous SRF and MKL1 to the alpha-SMA promoter in chromatin. Since MKL1 constitutes a potent factor regulating alpha-SMA expression, modulation of endogenous MKL1 expression or activity may have a profound effect on myofibroblast formation and function in the kidney.","['Elberg, Gerard', 'Chen, Lijuan', 'Elberg, Dorit', 'Chan, Michael D', 'Logan, Charlotte J', 'Turman, Martin A']","['Elberg G', 'Chen L', 'Elberg D', 'Chan MD', 'Logan CJ', 'Turman MA']","['Section of Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA . gerard-elberg@ouhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080312,United States,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Using RT-PCR we compared expression of Il1a, Il1b, Il1rn, Il1r1, and Il1r2 during the pre- and peri-implantation periods of pregnancy in wild-type (WT) and LIF-null LE and stroma. In WT LE, Il1a transcripts were down-regulated on Day 4 of pregnancy (D4), with renewed expression by the evening of D4 (D4 pm). In Lif(-/-) LE there was a gradual decrease in expression on D2, and expression became undetectable by D6. Il1b and Il1r1 expression were similar in WT and null mice, but Il1rn expression was almost completely lost during the peri-implantation period in Lif(-/-) LE. In the stroma, Il1a was sharply down-regulated on D4 and reappeared on D4 pm but was only expressed from D3 to D5 in the null mice. Stromal Il1r1 and Il1r2 were also misregulated. Il1rn showed constitutive expression in null stroma in contrast to the loss of expression on D4 in the WT mouse. In Lif-deficient mice, immunostaining indicated a reduction of endometrial IL1A at the time of implantation and of IL1B in stroma. LE-stromal coculture revealed that LIF stimulated the apical secretion of both IL1A and PTGES2 by LE cells without affecting basal secretion of IL1A and with only a small effect on basal PTGES2 secretion. We conclude that Il1a and Il1rn in LE and Il1a, Il1rn, and Il1r1 in stroma are regulated by LIF, which stimulates apical secretion of IL1A by LE.","['Fouladi-Nashta, A A', 'Mohamet, L', 'Heath, J K', 'Kimber, S J']","['Fouladi-Nashta AA', 'Mohamet L', 'Heath JK', 'Kimber SJ']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, The University of Manchester, Core Technology Facility, Manchester M13 9MNT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080312,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo Implantation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Pregnancy', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2008/03/14 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['biolreprod.107.065219 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.107.065219 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2008 Jul;79(1):142-53. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.107.065219.

Using this proposed Laplacian approach, we can simultaneously discover different classes and determine the identity of each class. Through an illustrative test of the Laplacian approach applied to real datasets of gene expression profiles, leukemia data [Golub TR, et al.

An early event during induction of macrophage differentiation in the myeloblastic leukemia M1 cell line by different stimuli, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), is expression of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). We report that expression of active CSF-1R in M1 cells accelerated their subsequent terminal differentiation into macrophages in response to LIF and IL-6 when compared with cells lacking the CSF-1R or expressing the receptor with compromised kinase activity; however, there was no requirement for signaling through the CSF-1R, for example, via endogenous CSF-1, during the actual LIF-induced and IL-6-induced differentiation stage. Differences were noted in the signaling pathways downstream of the LIF receptor depending on the presence of the CSF-1R. Both LIF and IL-6 gave an additive response with CSF-1, consistent with LIF and IL-6 acting via a different signaling pathway (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 dependent) than CSF-1 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase dependent). Based at least on this cell model, we propose that terminal macrophage differentiation involves a critical priming or deterministic phase in which signaling by the CSF-1R prepares a precursor population for subsequent rapid terminal macrophage differentiation by diverse stimuli. We also propose that expression and activation of the CSF-1R explain much prior literature on macrophage lineage commitment in M1 leukemic cells and may be important in controlling the progression of certain myeloid leukemias.","['Hamilton, John A', 'Whitty, Genevieve', 'Masendycz, Paul', 'Wilson, Nicholas J', 'Jackson, Jacob', 'De Nardo, Dominic', 'Scholz, Glen M']","['Hamilton JA', 'Whitty G', 'Masendycz P', 'Wilson NJ', 'Jackson J', 'De Nardo D', 'Scholz GM']","['Arthritis and Inflammation Research Centre, University of Melbourne, Department of Medicine, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia. jahami@unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/drug effects/physiology']",2008/03/14 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/3/458 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0361 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2008 Mar;6(3):458-67. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0361.,,,10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0361 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacodynamics, which measures drug effects on the host, is key during early-phase clinical trials of novel agents to determine the relations between drug dose and target inhibition as well as measure the downstream effects of target inhibition on the cancer. In this article, we describe the application of flow cytometry to the pharmacodynamic monitoring of molecular-targeted agents in leukemia patients. The methods are based on current clinical flow-cytometry applications, with the addition of phosphospecific antibodies to measure the activation states of intracellular signaling elements and the introduction of techniques that maintain drug-target equilibrium during sample preparation. Using this approach, we successfully showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Kit during a phase I clinical trial treating acute leukemia patients with the novel agent sorafenib. Further refinements identify considerable interpatient variation in signaling activity within leukemic blast populations, suggesting that an individualized approach to treatment based on flow cytometric monitoring might be advantageous. Improvements in sample turnaround offer the potential to introduce real-time pharmacodynamic monitoring during early-phase clinical trials.","['Hedley, David W', 'Chow, Sue', 'Goolsby, Charles', 'Shankey, T Vincent']","['Hedley DW', 'Chow S', 'Goolsby C', 'Shankey TV']","['Division of Applied Molecular Oncology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. david.hedley@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzenesulfonates/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', '*Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Pyridines/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib']",2008/03/14 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2008/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['36/1/133 [pii]', '10.1177/0192623307310952 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 2008 Jan;36(1):133-9. doi: 10.1177/0192623307310952.,16,,10.1177/0192623307310952 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we set out to characterize the genome-wide mRNA expression profile under the condition of short-term stimulation (4h) with IL-18 using the Affymetrix GeneChip((R)) Array System. Besides the chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL1 we identified Epstein-Barr virus induced gene-3 (EBI3)/IL-27B as being among those genes that are profoundly upregulated by IL-18 in KG1 cells. Thorough investigation revealed that IL-18-induced EBI3 mRNA efficiently translates into protein. Electromobility shift analysis and mutational analysis of the human EBI3 promoter identified two nuclear factor-kappaB binding sites as being crucial for induction by pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-18. In addition, we demonstrate that KG1 cells express the Type A IL-27 receptor chain (WSX-1) and display STAT-1, -3 activation as well as induction of SOCS-3 under the influence of IL-27. IL-18 shows therapeutic potential in murine leukemia and is currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of immunologically sensitive cancers.

In children with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), internal tandem duplication of the Flt3 gene (Flt3/ITD) was previously reported and correlated to poor prognosis. Limited data are available about childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We analysed bone marrow specimens from 55 newly diagnosed acute leukaemia cases including 30 AML and 25 ALL by genomic PCR for the presence of Flt3/ITD and correlated its presence with clinical outcome. Tandem duplication was found in 6/30(20%) AML cases: 2/8 M1, 1/8 M2, 2/6 M3, 1/6 M4 with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in two cases. Four of the cases with duplication were males and the other two cases were females. Complete remission was achieved in 16.6% of cases with duplication vs. 45.8% in cases without duplication. Failure to achieve induction remission was noted in 50% of cases with duplication vs. 29.1% in cases without duplication. FLt3/ITD was not found in ALL cases. Lineage restriction analysis revealed that Flt3/ITD was not present in lymphocytes, suggesting a lack of stem cell involvement for this mutation. Flt3/ITD was the most significant prognostic factor as declared by multivariate analysis. Patients with Flt3/ITD appear to be refractory to primary induction therapy, and for those who achieve remission, there is a high rate of relapse and death so there may be an association between this type of mutation and patient outcome.","['Al-Tonbary, Y', 'Mansour, A K', 'Ghazy, H', 'Elghannam, D M', 'Abd-Elghaffar, H A']","['Al-Tonbary Y', 'Mansour AK', 'Ghazy H', 'Elghannam DM', 'Abd-Elghaffar HA']","[""Hematology/Oncology/BMT Unit, Mansoura University Children's Hospital, Mansoura, Egypt. ytonbary@gmail.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080310,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2008/03/14 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2008/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH1039 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01039.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2009 Jun;31(3):320-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01039.x.

It is a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases consisting of APOBEC1, APOBEC2, APOBEC3 (A to H), and AID (activation induced deaminase). During reverse transcription, it deaminates dC to dU in nascent minus-strand viral DNA, resulting in G-to-A hypermutation in the plus strand DNA to inhibit the replication of HIV-1. On the contrary, HIV-1 Vif protein counteracts this enzyme by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to enable HIV-1 replicate in target cells. Vif forms an E3 ligase complex with cellular proteins including Cullin5, ElonginB, and ElonginC (Vif-BC-Cul5) and functions as a substrate recognition subunit of the complex to target APOBEC3G for ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation in virus-producing cells. APOBEC3G has also been shown to have a broad antiviral activity on a wide variety of viruses which include not only retroviruses such as other lentiviruses, murine leukemia virus (MLV), and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) but also other viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and adeno-associated virus. Furthermore, other members of the APOBEC family also show a broad antiviral activity, but target virus specificities vary among APOBEC members. On the other hand, viruses have their own mechanisms to escape from APOBEC. These expanding evidences suggest that the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases plays an important role in antiviral innate immunity and might be a novel target for an antiviral therapy. Here we review the present understanding of APOBEC3 proteins as an antiviral innate immunity and battles between APOBEC3 and viruses.","['Izumi, Taisuke', 'Shirakawa, Kotaro', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Izumi T', 'Shirakawa K', 'Takaori-Kondo A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-Kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Retroelements)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (vif protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cytosine Deaminase/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Retroelements/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*drug effects/*enzymology/genetics', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2008/03/14 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138955708783744047 [doi]'],ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2008 Mar;8(3):231-8. doi: 10.2174/138955708783744047.,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulation of Mcl-1 expression occurs at multiple levels, allowing for either the rapid induction or elimination of the protein in response to different cellular events. This suggests that Mcl-1 can play an early role in response to signals directing either cell survival or cell death. Deregulation of pathways regulating Mcl-1 that result in its over-expression likely contribute to a cell's inability to properly respond to death signals possibly leading to cell immortalization and tumorigenic conversion. Correspondingly, Mcl-1 has been shown to be up-regulated in numerous hematological and solid tumor malignancies. Moreover, this up-regulation appears to be a factor in the resistance of some cancer types to conventional cancer therapies. Mechanisms that abrogate the pro-survival function of Mcl-1 either by diminishing its levels or inactivating its functional BH3 groove have shown promise for the combinational treatment with existing cancer therapies and as single agents in certain malignancies.

STATs are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which results in their dimerization and translocation into the nucleus where they exert their effect on transcription of regulated target genes. The phosphorylation of STATs is mediated mainly by Janus kinases (JAKs). The JAK/STAT pathway plays a critical role in hematopoietic and immune cell function. Here we focus on one member of the STAT family, STAT5. STAT5 is phosphorylated by several JAKs, including Jak3, Jak2, and Tyk2, in response to interleukin-2, erythropoietin (EPO), and interleukin-22, respectively. Activation of STAT5 is essential to T cell development and has been associated with hematologic malignancies. Therefore, the ability to assess STAT5 phosphorylation is important for discovery efforts targeting these indications. The assay formats available to detect phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) are relatively low throughput and involve lengthy protocols. These formats include western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. The SureFire (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) pSTAT5 assay is a homogeneous assay that utilizes AlphaScreen (Perkin Elmer) technology to detect pSTAT5 in cell lysates. We have used this assay format to evaluate EPO-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in HEL cells and successfully complete a small-scale screening campaign to identify inhibitors of this event. The results obtained in these studies demonstrate that the SureFire pSTAT5 assay is a robust, reliable assay format that is amenable to high-throughput screening (HTS) applications.","['Binder, Christina', 'Lafayette, Amy', 'Archibeque, Ivonne', 'Sun, Yu', 'Plewa, Cherylene', 'Sinclair, Angus', 'Emkey, Renee']","['Binder C', 'Lafayette A', 'Archibeque I', 'Sun Y', 'Plewa C', 'Sinclair A', 'Emkey R']","['Amgen Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Assay Drug Dev Technol,Assay and drug development technologies,101151468,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Artifacts', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/physiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*chemistry']",2008/03/14 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/adt.2007.111 [doi]'],ppublish,Assay Drug Dev Technol. 2008 Feb;6(1):27-37. doi: 10.1089/adt.2007.111.,,,10.1089/adt.2007.111 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Both BPs were able to induce apoptosis significantly. No correlation was observed between BP-induced apoptosis and clinical parameters or MDR phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that concurrent or sequential administration of BPs with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs may have significant therapeutic potential for CLL patients.","['Silva, Karina Lani', 'Vasconcellos, Deborah Vidal', 'Castro, Eric Delfraro de Paula', 'Vasconcelos, Flavia da Cunha', 'Bigni, Ricardo', 'Maia, Raquel Ciuvalschi']","['Silva KL', 'Vasconcellos DV', 'Castro ED', 'Vasconcelos FC', 'Bigni R', 'Maia RC']","['Laboratorio de Hematologia Celular e Molecular, Servico de Hematologia, Hospital do Cancer I, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Praca Cruz Vermelha 23, 6 andar, Centro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, CEP. 20230-130, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080312,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diphosphonates/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pamidronate', 'Phenotype', 'Zoledronic Acid']",2008/03/13 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/03/13 09:00'],"['2007/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-008-0710-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Jun;62(1):165-71. doi: 10.1007/s00280-008-0710-1.

Exposure to benzene occurs in occupational and environmental settings. OBJECTIVE: I evaluated variation in benzene-related leukemia with age at exposure and time since exposure. METHODS: I evaluated data from a cohort of 1,845 rubber hydrochloride workers. Benzene exposure-leukemia mortality trends were estimated by applying proportional hazards regression methods. Temporal variation in the impact of benzene on leukemia rates was assessed via exposure time windows and fitting of a multistage cancer model. RESULTS: The association between leukemia mortality and benzene exposures was of greatest magnitude in the 10 years immediately after exposure [relative rate (RR) at 10 ppm-years = 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.29]; the association was of smaller magnitude in the period 10 to < 20 years after exposure (RR at 10 ppm-years = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97-1.13); and there was no evidence of association > or = 20 years after exposure. Leukemia was more strongly associated with benzene exposures accrued at > or = 45 years of age (RR at 10 ppm-years = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17) than with exposures accrued at younger ages (RR at 10 ppm-years = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.92-1.09). Jointly, these temporal effects can be efficiently modeled as a multistage process in which benzene exposure affects the penultimate stage in disease induction.

An association between BCP ALL and HLA class II (DR, DQ, DP) alleles could provide further clues to the identity of the infection, since HLA molecules exhibit allotype-restricted binding of infection-derived antigenic peptides. We clustered >30 HLA-DPB1 alleles into six predicted peptide-binding supertypes (DP1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8), based on amino acid di-morphisms at positions 11 (G/L), 69 (E/K), and 84 (G/D) of the DPbeta(1) domain. We found that the DPbeta11-69-84 supertype GEG (DP2), was 70% more frequent in BCP ALL (n=687; P<10(-4)), and 98% more frequent in cases diagnosed between 3 and 6 years (P<10(-4)), but not <3 or >6 years, than in controls. Only one of 21 possible DPB1 supergenotypes, GEG/GKG (DP2/DP4) was significantly more frequent in BCP ALL (P=0.00004) than controls. These results suggest that susceptibility to BCP ALL is associated with the DP2 supertype, which is predicted to bind peptides with positively charged, nonpolar aromatic residues at the P4 position, and hydrophobic residues at the P1 and P6 positions. Studies of peptide binding by DP2 alleles could help to identify infection(s) carrying these peptides.","['Taylor, G M', 'Hussain, A', 'Lightfoot, T J', 'Birch, J M', 'Eden, T O B', 'Greaves, M F']","['Taylor GM', 'Hussain A', 'Lightfoot TJ', 'Birch JM', 'Eden TO', 'Greaves MF']","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. gmtaylor@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080311,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DP Antigens', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2008/03/13 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/03/13 09:00'],"['2008/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['6604257 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604257 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2008 Mar 25;98(6):1125-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604257.

Molecular basis of several congenital neutropenia has been recently determined, involving gene coding for the neutrophil elastase gene (ELA2), GFI1, WAS protein and mitochondrial HAX1 protein. These mutations, dominant (ELA2, GFI1), X-linked (WAS) and autosomal recessive (HAX1), result in instability of the contents of the granules- particularly the neutrophil elastase- or in abnormalities of the cytoskeleton, and possibly, in an increased apoptosis. ELA2 mutations resulting both in profound and permanent neutropenia, and in cyclic--pseudo sinusoidal--neutropenia lead to consider that time pattern is very close in the two apparently distinct phenotypes. This observation suggests that temporal variations of neutrophils could be represented by non linear functions. Congenital neutropenia, specifically ELA2 mutated, are also characterized by a high rate of leukemia (about 15% at 20 years of age). Leukemia risk does not appear to be related to an oncogenic effect of ELA2 mutations, but much likely to the deepness of the neutropenia, and the intensity of G-CSF therapy.","['Donadieu, Jean', 'Beaupain, Blandine', 'Bellanne-Chantelot, Christine']","['Donadieu J', 'Beaupain B', 'Bellanne-Chantelot C']","[""Service d'Hemato-oncologie Pediatrique, Registre francais des neutropenies congenitales, Hopital Trousseau, 26 avenue du Docteur Arnold Netter, 75012 Paris, France. jean.donadieu@trs.aphp.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Med Sci (Paris),Medecine sciences : M/S,8710980,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Gfi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WAS protein, human)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Cytoskeleton/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Elastase/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelopoiesis/*physiology', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Risk', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein/deficiency/genetics/physiology']",2008/03/13 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/03/13 09:00'],"['2008/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['00/00/0C/20/ [pii]', '10.1051/medsci/2008243284 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sci (Paris). 2008 Mar;24(3):284-9. doi: 10.1051/medsci/2008243284.,36,Granulopoiese et leucemogenese: ce que nous apportent les neutropenies congenitales.,10.1051/medsci/2008243284 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing immunoblot analyses, we have demonstrated that PER 2 is endogenously expressed in human breast epithelial cell lines but is not expressed or is expressed at significantly reduced level in human breast cancer cell lines. Expression of PER 2 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and, when PER 2 was co-expressed with the Crytochrome 2 (Cry 2) gene, an even greater growth-inhibitory effect was observed. The inhibitory effect of PER 2 on breast cancer cells was also demonstrated by its suppression of the anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells as evidenced by the reduced number and size of colonies. A corresponding blockade of MCF-7 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle was also observed in response to the expression of PER 2 alone or in combination with CRY 2. Expression of PER 2 also induced apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells as demonstrated by an increase in PARP [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase] cleavage. Finally, our studies demonstrate that PER 2 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells is associated with a significant decrease in the expression of cyclin D1 and an up-regulation of p53 levels.","['Xiang, Shulin', 'Coffelt, Seth B', 'Mao, Lulu', 'Yuan, Lin', 'Cheng, Qi', 'Hill, Steven M']","['Xiang S', 'Coffelt SB', 'Mao L', 'Yuan L', 'Cheng Q', 'Hill SM']","['Department of Structural and Cellular Biology, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. smhill@tulane.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080311,England,J Circadian Rhythms,Journal of circadian rhythms,101200389,,,,2008/03/13 09:00,2008/03/13 09:01,['2008/03/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/13 09:01 [medline]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1740-3391-6-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1740-3391-6-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Circadian Rhythms. 2008 Mar 11;6:4. doi: 10.1186/1740-3391-6-4.,,,10.1186/1740-3391-6-4 [doi],PMC2365929,,,,,['R01 CA054152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The end stage of inflammatory joint diseases is characterized by excessive ECM catabolism, and in this study we assess the role of PI3K signaling in the induction of collagenolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in human chondrocytes. We used the most potent cytokine stimulus reported to promote cartilage ECM catabolism, namely interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM). Both OSM and IL-6 (in the presence of its soluble receptor), but not IL-1 nor leukemia inhibitory factor, induced Akt phosphorylation in human chondrocytes. Inhibition of PI3K signaling using LY294002 blocked IL-1+OSM-mediated Akt phosphorylation, induction of MMP-1 and MMP-13, and cartilage collagenolysis. To further explore the role of downstream substrates within the PI3K pathway, complementary use of small molecule inhibitors and specific small interfering RNAs demonstrated that the PI3K subunit p110alpha and Akt1 were required for MMP-1 mRNA induction. MMP-13 induction was also reduced by loss of function of these molecules and by a lack of p110delta, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 or Akt3. We therefore propose that the activities of specific elements of the PI3K signaling pathway, including Akt, are necessary for the synergistic induction of MMP-1 and MMP-13 and the cartilage breakdown stimulated by IL-1+OSM. Our data provide new insight into the mechanism of synergy between IL-1 and OSM and highlight new therapeutic targets for inflammatory joint diseases that aim to repress the expression of collagenases.","['Litherland, Gary J', 'Dixon, Craig', 'Lakey, Rachel L', 'Robson, Timothy', 'Jones, Debra', 'Young, David A', 'Cawston, Tim E', 'Rowan, Andrew D']","['Litherland GJ', 'Dixon C', 'Lakey RL', 'Robson T', 'Jones D', 'Young DA', 'Cawston TE', 'Rowan AD']","['Cell Signalling, Injury, and Repair Group, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080310,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cartilage/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Collagenases/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2008/03/12 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/03/12 09:00'],"['2008/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)54288-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M710136200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 May 23;283(21):14221-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M710136200.

MRTs are extremely aggressive cancers caused by the loss of the hSNF5 subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. We found previously that, in MRT cells, hSNF5 is required for p16(INK4a) induction, mitotic checkpoint activation, and cellular senescence. Here, we investigated how the balance between Polycomb group (PcG) silencing and SWI/SNF activation affects epigenetic control of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus in MRT cells. hSNF5 reexpression in MRT cells caused SWI/SNF recruitment and activation of p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a), but not of p14(ARF). Gene activation by hSNF5 is strictly dependent on the SWI/SNF motor subunit BRG1. SWI/SNF mediates eviction of the PRC1 and PRC2 PcG silencers and extensive chromatin reprogramming. Concomitant with PcG complex removal, the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein is recruited and active histone marks supplant repressive ones. Strikingly, loss of PcG complexes is accompanied by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B dissociation and reduced DNA methylation. Thus, various chromatin states can be modulated by SWI/SNF action. Collectively, these findings emphasize the close interconnectivity and dynamics of diverse chromatin modifications in cancer and gene control.","['Kia, Sima Kheradmand', 'Gorski, Marcin M', 'Giannakopoulos, Stavros', 'Verrijzer, C Peter']","['Kia SK', 'Gorski MM', 'Giannakopoulos S', 'Verrijzer CP']","['Department of Biochemistry, Center for Biomedical Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center, P.O.

After specific ligand binding, the intracellular part of Notch is cleaved off and translocates to the nucleus, where it targets the DNA binding protein RBP-Jkappa. In the absence of Notch, RBP-Jkappa represses Notch target genes by recruiting a corepressor complex. We and others have previously identified SHARP as one component of this complex. Here, we show that the corepressor ETO as well as the leukemogenic fusion protein AML1/ETO directly interacts with SHARP, that ETO is part of the endogenous RBP-Jkappa-containing corepressor complex, and that ETO is found at Notch target gene promoters. In functional assays, corepressor ETO, but not AML1/ETO, augments SHARP-mediated repression in an histone deacetylase-dependent manner. Furthermore, either the knockdown of ETO or the overexpression of AML1/ETO activates Notch target genes. Therefore, we propose that AML1/ETO can disturb the normal, repressive function of ETO at Notch target genes. This activating (or derepressing) effect of AML1/ETO may contribute to its oncogenic potential in myeloid leukemia.","['Salat, Daniela', 'Liefke, Robert', 'Wiedenmann, Jorg', 'Borggrefe, Tilman', 'Oswald, Franz']","['Salat D', 'Liefke R', 'Wiedenmann J', 'Borggrefe T', 'Oswald F']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology, Stubeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080310,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (BHLHE41 protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HEY1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (MTG8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RBPJ protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2008/03/12 09:00,2008/05/15 09:00,['2008/03/12 09:00'],"['2008/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01966-07 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01966-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 May;28(10):3502-12. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01966-07.

Living cells decorated with surface-attached colorimetric/fluorescent polydiacetylene patches might constitute an effective platform for analysis and visualization of membrane processes in situ. This work examines the biological and chemical consequences of plasma membrane labeling of promyelocytic leukemia cells with polydiacetylene. We show that the extent of fusion between incubated lipid/diacetylene vesicles and the plasma membrane is closely dependent upon the lipid composition of both vesicles and cell membrane. In particular, we find that cholesterol presence increased bilayer fusion between the chromatic vesicles and the plasma membrane, suggesting that membrane organization plays a significant role in the fusion process. Spectroscopic data and physiological assays show that decorating the cell membrane with the lipid/diacetylene patches reduces the overall lateral diffusion within the membrane bilayer, however polydiacetylene labeling does not adversely affect important cellular metabolic pathways. Overall, the experimental data indicate that the viability and physiological integrity of the surface-engineered cells are retained, making possible utilization of the platform for studying membrane processes in living cells. We demonstrate the use of the polydiacetylene-labeled cells for visualizing and discriminating among different membrane interaction mechanisms of pharmaceutical compounds.","['Groysman, Natalie', 'Orynbayeva, Zulfiya', 'Katz, Marina', 'Kolusheva, Sofiya', 'Khanin, Marina', 'Danilenko, Michael', 'Jelinek, Raz']","['Groysman N', 'Orynbayeva Z', 'Katz M', 'Kolusheva S', 'Khanin M', 'Danilenko M', 'Jelinek R']","['The Ilse Katz Institute of Nanotechnology and Department of Chemistry, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080219,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Polyacetylene Polymer)', '0 (Polymers)', '25067-58-7 (Polyynes)', '27987-87-7 (polydiacetylene)']",IM,"['Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Polyacetylene Polymer', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'Polyynes/*chemistry']",2008/03/12 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/03/12 09:00'],"['2007/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(08)00055-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamem.2008.01.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 May;1778(5):1335-43. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamem.2008.01.028.

L. reuteri secretes factors that potentiate apoptosis in myeloid leukemia-derived cells induced by tumour necrosis factor (TNF), as indicated by intracellular esterase activity, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labelling assays and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. L. reuteri downregulated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent gene products that mediate cell proliferation (Cox-2, cyclin D1) and cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL). L. reuteri suppressed TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, including NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression in a dose-and time-dependent manner. L. reuteri stabilized degradation of IkappaBalpha and inhibited nuclear translocation of p65 (RelA). Although phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha was not affected, subsequent polyubiquitination necessary for regulated IkappaBalpha degradation was abrogated by L. reuteri. In addition, L. reuteri promoted apoptosis by enhancing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities including c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK. In contrast, L. reuteri suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 in TNF-activated myeloid cells. L. reuteri may regulate cell proliferation by promoting apoptosis of activated immune cells via inhibition of IkappaBalpha ubiquitination and enhancing pro-apoptotic MAPK signalling. An improved understanding of L. reuteri-mediated effects on apoptotic signalling pathways may facilitate development of future probiotics-based regimens for prevention of colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease.","['Iyer, Chandra', 'Kosters, Astrid', 'Sethi, Gautam', 'Kunnumakkara, Ajaikumar B', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B', 'Versalovic, James']","['Iyer C', 'Kosters A', 'Sethi G', 'Kunnumakkara AB', 'Aggarwal BB', 'Versalovic J']","['Departments of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Lactobacillus reuteri/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2008/03/12 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/03/12 09:00'],"['2008/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['CMI1137 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1462-5822.2008.01137.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2008 Jul;10(7):1442-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2008.01137.x.

We propose a unified pathway-analysis method that can be used for diverse phenotypes including binary, multiclass, continuous, count, rate, and censored survival phenotypes. The proposed method also allows covariate adjustments and correlation in the phenotype variable that is encountered in longitudinal, cluster-sampled, and paired designs. These are accomplished by combining the regression-based test statistic for each individual gene in a pathway of interest into a pathway-level test statistic. Applications of the proposed method are illustrated with two real pathway-analysis examples: one evaluating relapse-associated gene expression involving a matched-pair binary phenotype in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; and the other investigating gene expression in breast cancer tissues in relation to patients' survival (a censored survival phenotype). Implementations for various phenotypes are available in R.

The phenomenon is caspase-dependent and results in membrane changes leading to an increased recognition of TRAIL death receptors by TRAIL. Because either caspase-2 or an apical proteolytic event has been recently proposed to act as an initiator of the cell death mechanism induced by heat shock, we have investigated the hierarchy of caspase activation in cells exposed to the combined heat shock plus TRAIL treatment. We report here that caspases-2, -3, and -8 were the first caspases to be activated. As expected, caspase-8 is required and indispensable during the initiation of this death signaling. Caspase-2 may also participate in the phenomenon but, in contrast to caspase-8, its presence appears dispensable because its depletion by small interfering RNA is devoid of effects. Our observations also suggest a role of caspase-3 and of a particular cleaved form of this caspase during the early signals of heat shock plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis.","['Moulin, Maryline', 'Arrigo, Andre-Patrick']","['Moulin M', 'Arrigo AP']","['Laboratoire Stress, Chaperons et Mort Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 5534, Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon-1, 16 rue Dubois, Villeurbanne Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080311,Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Fever', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/03/12 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/03/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12192-008-0027-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2008 Sep;13(3):313-26. doi: 10.1007/s12192-008-0027-3.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 44 children with newly diagnosed acute leukemia participated in the study. The control group consisted of 23 healthy children. The examination took place at the time of the diagnosis, and during and at the end of the chemotherapy treatment course. During the collection of resting mixed saliva samples the salivary flow rate was measured. In the saliva's supernatant the following parameters were determined: total protein, peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, lactoferrin, and secretory immunoglobulin A. RESULTS: The introduction of chemotherapy caused a slight decrease of salivary secretion rate (P < .05), as well as the decrease of S-IgA concentration (P < .01), which remained at the same level after the end of chemotherapy (P < .001). Patients with aplasia had decreased levels of peroxidase (P = .014) and myeloperoxidase (P = .013). Patients with oral mucositis presented with lower myeloperoxidase (P = .026) and peroxidase (P = .003) activity levels as well as the drop of S-IgA (P = .000) concentration compared with subjects with no mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: Antileukemic treatment contributes to the compromise of salivary defense mechanisms, therefore it is reasonable to support pharmacologically the saliva's antibacterial potential of leukemic patients to impede the development of local infection.","['Karolewska, Ewa', 'Konopka, Tomasz', 'Pupek, Malgorzata', 'Chybicka, Alicja', 'Mendak, Magdalena']","['Karolewska E', 'Konopka T', 'Pupek M', 'Chybicka A', 'Mendak M']","['Department of Oral Pathology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland. ewkaem@wp.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080310,United States,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics",9508562,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A, Secretory)', '0 (Salivary Proteins and Peptides)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antioxidants/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A, Secretory/immunology', 'Lactoferrin/immunology', 'Leukemia/*complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Mucositis/etiology/prevention & control', 'Muramidase/immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Peroxidase/immunology', 'Saliva/*immunology/metabolism', 'Salivary Proteins and Peptides/analysis/*immunology', 'Secretory Rate/drug effects', 'Stomatitis/etiology/*prevention & control']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/07/01 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2006/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-2104(07)00830-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.tripleo.2007.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod. 2008 Jun;105(6):739-44. doi: 10.1016/j.tripleo.2007.10.010.

METHODS: Individual data on cases of CNS cancer in children (0-14 years) and on subsequent SMNs were obtained from 13 population-based cancer registries contributing data for different time periods in 1943-2000. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), absolute excess risk and cumulative incidence of SMNs were computed. RESULTS: We observed 43 SMNs in 8431 CNS cancer survivors. The SIR was 10.6 (4.85-20.1) for thyroid cancer (nine cases), 2.75 (1.01-5.99) for leukaemia (six cases) and 2.47 (0.90-5.37) for lymphoma (six cases). The SIRs were highest in the first 10 years after CNS cancer diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of non-CNS SMNs was 3.30% (0.95-5.65%) within 45 years after a CNS cancer diagnosis. Within 15 years, the cumulative incidence was highest for cases diagnosed after 1980 (0.56%, 95% CI: 0.29-0.82%). CONCLUSION: This population-based study indicates that about one every 180 survivors of a childhood CNS cancer will develop a non-CNS SMN within the following 15 years. The excess is higher after glioma and embryonal malignant tumour than after another CNS tumour.","['Maule, M', 'Scelo, G', 'Pastore, G', 'Brennan, P', 'Hemminki, K', 'Pukkala, E', 'Weiderpass, E', 'Olsen, J H', 'Tracey, E', 'McBride, M L', 'Brewster, D H', 'Pompe-Kirn, V', 'Tonita, J M', 'Kliewer, E V', 'Chia, K S', 'Jonasson, J G', 'Martos, C', 'Magnani, C', 'Boffetta, P']","['Maule M', 'Scelo G', 'Pastore G', 'Brennan P', 'Hemminki K', 'Pukkala E', 'Weiderpass E', 'Olsen JH', 'Tracey E', 'McBride ML', 'Brewster DH', 'Pompe-Kirn V', 'Tonita JM', 'Kliewer EV', 'Chia KS', 'Jonasson JG', 'Martos C', 'Magnani C', 'Boffetta P']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, CPO Piemonte, CeRMS, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. milena.maule@cpo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080310,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Risk']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(08)00122-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2008.02.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2008 Apr;44(6):830-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2008.02.012.

To date, solid tumors, and particularly brain tumors and rhabdomyosarcomas, have been documented in patients with NS; however, few cases of neuroblastoma associated with NS have been reported. Here we report an unusual case of neuroblastoma with mediastinal, retroperitoneal, and medullar locations associated in a NS patient carrying a PTPN11 germline missense mutation (p.G60A). This missense mutation occurs within the N-SH2 domain of the PTPN11 gene and has been reported to be associated with acute leukemia in NS patients.

One case of der(21) duplication with ETV6/RUNX1 exhibited a novel MLL translocation variant t(6;11)(p21.1p23;q13q25), with translocation of 3' telomeric MLL and deletion of 5' centromeric MLL. Another case of der(21) duplication with ETV6/RUNX1 showed MLL rearrangement upon Southern blotting. The remaining five ETV6/RUNX1-positive cases had MLL allelic deletion. ETV6/RUNX1 and MLL aberration clone size in these cases was suggestive of ETV6/RUNX1 as an early primary event, originating in the embryonic or infant stage and developing into leukemia by later acquisition of MLL aberration, ETV6 loss, and ETV6/RUNX1 duplication as secondary events. To date, the prognosis has been favorable, which seems to be compatible with ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL. We conclude that the cases with coexisting ETV6/RUNX1 and MLL aberrations probably exist as a small, hidden group of ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL, which invites further investigation, in large series from different populations, to confirm the findings and establish the biological mechanisms and prognostic significance.","['Amare Kadam, Pratibha S', 'Raje, Gauri Chandrakant', 'Pais, Anurita Peter', 'Banavali, Shripad']","['Amare Kadam PS', 'Raje GC', 'Pais AP', 'Banavali S']","['Cancer Cytogenetics Laboratory, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai 400012, India. pratibha.amare@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2007/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(08)00004-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.12.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2008 Apr 1;182(1):27-32. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.12.012.,,,10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.12.012 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hitherto we indicated the anticancer activity induced by xanthones such as alpha-, beta-, and gamma-mangostin which were major constituents of the pericarp of mangosteen fruits. In this study, we examined the effect of xanthones on cell degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Antigen (Ag)-mediated stimulation of high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) activates intracellular signal transductions resulting in the release of biologically active mediators such as histamine. The release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cell or basophils is the primary event in several allergic responses. These xanthones suppressed the release of histamine from IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. In order to reveal the inhibitory mechanism of degranulation by xanthones, we examined the activation of intracellular signaling molecules such as Lyn, Syk, and PLCgammas. All the xanthones tested significantly suppressed the signaling involving Syk and PLCgammas. In Ag-mediated activation of FcepsilonRI on mast cells, three major subfamilies of mitogen-activated protein kinases were activated. The xanthones decreased the level of phospho-ERKs. Furthermore, the levels of phospho-ERKs were observed to be regulated by Syk/LAT/Ras/ERK pathway rather than PKC/Raf/ERK pathway, suggesting that the inhibitory mechanism of xanthones was mainly due to suppression of the Syk/PLCgammas/PKC pathway. Although intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was elevated by FcepsilonRI activation, it was found that alpha- or gamma-mangostin treatment was reduced the [Ca(2+)](i) elevation by suppressed Ca(2+) influx.","['Itoh, Tomohiro', 'Ohguchi, Kenji', 'Iinuma, Munekazu', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori', 'Akao, Yukihiro']","['Itoh T', 'Ohguchi K', 'Iinuma M', 'Nozawa Y', 'Akao Y']","['Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, Bio-active Substances Research, 1-1 Naka-Fudogaoka, Kakamigahara, Gifu 504-0838, Japan. titoh@giib.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080221,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Xanthones)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Garcinia mangostana/*chemistry', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Syk Kinase', 'Xanthones/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(08)00174-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2008.02.054 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2008 Apr 15;16(8):4500-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2008.02.054.

The current study examines factors influencing sensitivity to arsenic using human malignant melanoma cell lines. A375 and SK-Mel-2 cells were sensitive to clinically achievable concentrations of arsenite, whereas SK-Mel-3 and SK-Mel-28 cells required supratherapeutic levels for toxicity. Inhibition of glutathione synthesis, glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) transporter function attenuated arsenite resistance, consistent with studies suggesting that arsenite is extruded from the cell as a glutathione conjugate by MRP-1. However, MRP-1 was not overexpressed in resistant lines and GST-pi was only slightly elevated. ICP-MS analysis indicated that arsenite-resistant SK-Mel-28 cells did not accumulate less arsenic than arsenite-sensitive A375 cells, suggesting that resistance was not attributable to reduced arsenic accumulation but rather to intrinsic properties of resistant cell lines. The mode of arsenite-induced cell death was apoptosis. Arsenite-induced apoptosis is associated with cell cycle alterations. Cell cycle analysis revealed arsenite-sensitive cells arrested in mitosis whereas arsenite-resistant cells did not, suggesting that induction of mitotic arrest occurs at lower intracellular arsenic concentrations. Higher intracellular arsenic levels induced cell cycle arrest in the S-phase and G(2)-phase in SK-Mel-3 and SK-Mel-28 cells, respectively. The lack of arsenite-induced mitotic arrest in resistant cell lines was associated with a weakened spindle checkpoint resulting from reduced expression of spindle checkpoint protein BUBR1. These data suggest that arsenite has potential for treatment of solid tumors but a functional spindle checkpoint is a prerequisite for a positive response to its clinical application.","['McNeely, Samuel C', 'Belshoff, Alex C', 'Taylor, B Frazier', 'Fan, Teresa W-M', 'McCabe, Michael J Jr', 'Pinhas, Allan R', 'States, J Christopher']","['McNeely SC', 'Belshoff AC', 'Taylor BF', 'Fan TW', 'McCabe MJ Jr', 'Pinhas AR', 'States JC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville, 570 S.

METHODS: This analysis included 272 5-year AML survivors who participated in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). All patients were diagnosed at age < or =21 years between the years 1970 and 1986, and none underwent stem cell transplantation. Rates of survival, relapse, and late outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The average follow-up was 20.5 years (range, 5-33 years). The overall survival rate was 97% at 10 years (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 94%-98%) and 94% at 20 years (95% CI, 90%-96%). Six survivors reported 8 recurrences. The cumulative incidence of recurrent AML was 6.6% at 10 years (95% CI, 3.7%-9.6%) and 8.6% at 20 years (95% CI, 5.1%-12.1%). Ten subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN) were reported, including 4 with a history of radiation therapy, for a 20-year cumulative incidence of 1.7% (95% CI, 0.02%-3.4%). Six cardiac events were reported, for a 20-year cumulative incidence 4.7% (95% CI, 2.1%-7.3%). Half of the survivors reported a chronic medical condition and, compared with siblings, were at increased risk for severe or life-threatening chronic medical conditions (16% vs 5.8%; P < .001). Among those aged > or =25 years, the age-adjusted marriage rates were similar among survivors and the general United States population (57% for both) and lower compared with siblings (67%; P < .01). Survivors' college graduation rates were lower compared with siblings but higher than the general population (40% vs 52% vs 34%, respectively; P < .01). Employment rates were similar between survivors, siblings, and the general population (93%, 97.6%, and 95.8%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival from childhood AML > or =5-years after diagnosis was favorable. Late-occurring medical events remained a concern with socioeconomic achievement lower than expected within the individual family unit, although it was not different from the general United States population.","['Mulrooney, Daniel A', 'Dover, Douglas C', 'Li, Suwen', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Davies, Stella M']","['Mulrooney DA', 'Dover DC', 'Li S', 'Yasui Y', 'Ness KK', 'Mertens AC', 'Neglia JP', 'Sklar CA', 'Robison LL', 'Davies SM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School and Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. mulro006@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Educational Status', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Insurance, Health', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality', 'Male', 'Marriage', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23405 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 May 1;112(9):2071-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23405.,,,10.1002/cncr.23405 [doi],,['Childhood Cancer Survivor Study'],"['Robison LL', 'Hudson M', 'Armstrong G', 'Perkins J', ""O'Leary M"", 'Friedman D', 'Pendergrass T', 'Greffe B', 'Odom L', 'Ruccione K', 'Mulvihill J', 'Ginsberg J', 'Meadows A', 'Tersak J', 'Ritchey A', 'Blatt J', 'Reaman G', 'Packer R', 'Davies S', 'Bhatia S', 'Qualman S', 'Hammond S', 'Termuhlen A', 'Ruymann F', 'Diller L', 'Grier H', 'Li F', 'Meacham L', 'Mertens A', 'Leisenring W', 'Potter J', 'Greenberg M', 'Nathan PC', 'Boice J', 'Rodriguez V', 'Smithson WA', 'Gilchrist G', 'Sklar C', 'Oeffinger K', 'Finklestein J', 'Anderson B', 'Inskip P', 'Vik TA', 'Weetman R', 'Green DM', 'Hayashi R', 'Vietti T', 'Marina N', 'Donaldson SS', 'Link MP', 'Dreyer Z', 'Whelan K', 'Sande J', 'Berkow R', 'Yasui Y', 'Casallis J', 'Zeltzer L', 'Goldsby R', 'Ablin A', 'Hutchinson R', 'Neglia J', 'Deapen D', 'Breslow N', 'Bowers D', 'Tomlinson G', 'Buchanan GR', 'Strong L', 'Stovall M']","['Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa', 'Armstrong, Greg', 'Perkins, Joanna', ""O'Leary, Maura"", 'Friedman, Debra', 'Pendergrass, Thomas', 'Greffe, Brian', 'Odom, Lorrie', 'Ruccione, Kathy', 'Mulvihill, John', 'Ginsberg, Jill', 'Meadows, Anna', 'Tersak, Jean', 'Ritchey, A Kim', 'Blatt, Julie', 'Reaman, Gregory', 'Packer, Roger', 'Davies, Stella', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Qualman, Stephen', 'Hammond, Sue', 'Termuhlen, Amanda', 'Ruymann, Frederick', 'Diller, Lisa', 'Grier, Holcombe', 'Li, Frederick', 'Meacham, Lillian', 'Mertens, Ann', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Potter, John', 'Greenberg, Mark', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Boice, John', 'Rodriguez, Vilmarie', 'Smithson, W Anthony', 'Gilchrist, Gerald', 'Sklar, Charles', 'Oeffinger, Kevin', 'Finklestein, Jerry', 'Anderson, Barry', 'Inskip, Peter', 'Vik, Terry A', 'Weetman, Robert', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Hayashi, Robert', 'Vietti, Teresa', 'Marina, Neyssa', 'Donaldson, Sarah S', 'Link, Michael P', 'Dreyer, Zoann', 'Whelan, Kimberly', 'Sande, Jane', 'Berkow, Roger', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Casallis, Jackie', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie', 'Goldsby, Robert', 'Ablin, Arthur', 'Hutchinson, Raymond', 'Neglia, Joseph', 'Deapen, Dennis', 'Breslow, Norman', 'Bowers, Dan', 'Tomlinson, Gail', 'Buchanan, George R', 'Strong, Louise', 'Stovall, Marilyn']",,"['K12 RR023247/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA 55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 K12 RR 023247/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In the 1960s, the use and marketing of pesticides was regulated to reduce exposure to these substances, and, since 1970, substantial exposure has been rare in Denmark. The present study aimed at investigating the extent to which these alterations have influenced the cancer risk of gardeners. METHODS: A historical cohort of 3156 male gardeners was followed from May 1975 until 2002 with regard to cancer incidence. RESULTS: The cancer incidence was significantly below the national average [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.79-0.94], but an analysis by birth cohort indicated marked differences with a downward tendency for younger birth cohorts. Among the gardeners born prior to 1915, significant increases were found for leukemia (12 cases, SIR 2.33, 95% CI 1.32-4.10) and soft tissue sarcoma (3 cases, SIR 5.87, 95% CI 1.89-18.20). CONCLUSIONS: Gardeners constitute a healthy worker group, but an increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma and leukemia is indicated for people born prior to 1915, a finding that may reflect substantial pesticide exposure during the late 1940s and the 1950s. Among the gardeners born in 1915 or later, no excess cancer risk was found. The latter finding suggests a cancer-preventive effect for safety recommendations and improved technical devices with respect to pesticide application, along with legislative control measures to reduce pesticide exposure.","['Hansen, Eva S', 'Lander, Flemming', 'Lauritsen, Jens M']","['Hansen ES', 'Lander F', 'Lauritsen JM']","['Department of Occupational Medicine, Glostrup Hospital, Glostrup, Denmark. eshmail@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gardening', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Pesticides', 'Risk']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1162 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.1162 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2007 Dec;33(6):465-9. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.1162.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The manifestation of the disease is either self-limiting acute diarrhea in immunocompetent individuals, or potentially fatal chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: In this study, which was conducted in Tehran, 214 patients from ten health centers were investigated. Stool samples were collected, fixed and examined by three methods: acid-fast staining, auramin phenol fluorescence and direct fluorescence using monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Overall, 1.4% of all patients and 6.3% of diarrheal patients were infected by Cryptosporidium. The results revealed three cases of cryptosporidiosis, including two cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and one of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The prevalence of infection in subjects with AIDS or AML who were suffering from diarrhea was 33.4% and 11.1%, respectively. The duration of disease in infected patients lasted for weeks, and was terminated by death in two AIDS patients. In the patient with AML, diarrhea lasted for 18 days, and stopped after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy.

Although this condition occurs primarily in severely myelosuppressed and immunosuppressed patients with leukemia, it may also occur in those with other advanced malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. It has been described most recently in patients with solid tumors who receive taxane-based therapy. A 60-year old woman with medullary breast cancer stage IIIB underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with TAC (doxetaxele 100 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2). Sixth day after TAC chemotherapy, she had abdominal pain and vomiting. Abdomen CT scan showed diffuse circumferential thickening of ileum wall typical for ileitis, narrowing of the lumen, disturbance of peristaltic. This abdomen CT scan was thought as abnormality pictures of neutropenic enterocolitis. Neutropenic enterocolitis should be considered in patients with abdominal symptoms especially during the granulocyte nadir following chemotherapy.

Nevertheless, low yields, microbial contamination, and degradation of buccal samples present challenges for epidemiologic studies incorporating genetic investigations. The aims of this study were to compare the quality and yield of DNA extracted from buccal specimens with BuccalAmp swabs (Epicenter BioTechnologies, Madison, Wisconsin) or FTA cards (Whatman, Inc., Clifton, New Jersey) and to investigate the use of whole-genome amplification (WGA) for increasing DNA yields for single nucleotide polymorphism analyses. Buccal specimens were collected from 55 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 52 control children without acute lymphoblastic leukemia in New South Wales, Australia, in 2003-2004. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate polymorphisms in the genes encoding the cytochrome p450 enzyme CYP3A4 (CYP3A4 A392G, also known as CYP3A4*1B) and the steroid xenobiotic receptor (SXR C25385T). Results showed that DNA could be isolated from buccal specimens collected by use of both methods and that yields could be substantially improved with WGA without introducing genotyping error. However, DNA quality was poorer in samples collected by BuccalAmp swabs, and the presence of polymerase chain reaction inhibitors in these samples reduced the sensitivity of quantitative real-time PCR analysis. These findings show that different methods for collecting buccal samples impact on the downstream success of genetic investigations and influence DNA quality after WGA.","['Beckett, Sara M', 'Laughton, Stephen J', 'Pozza, Luciano Dalla', 'McCowage, Geoffrey B', 'Marshall, Glenn', 'Cohn, Richard J', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'Ashton, Lesley J']","['Beckett SM', 'Laughton SJ', 'Pozza LD', 'McCowage GB', 'Marshall G', 'Cohn RJ', 'Milne E', 'Ashton LJ']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Cheek', 'Child', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Epidemiology/*methods', 'Mouth Mucosa/*cytology', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Paper', 'Pediatrics/methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Specimen Handling/methods']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['kwn012 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwn012 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2008 May 15;167(10):1260-7. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwn012.

The prognosis of patients with CLL may be predicted using a number of biomarkers, including the level of CD38 expression at the leukemic cell surface. This study investigates the hypothesis that CD38 expression by CLL cells reflects interactions with nonmalignant cells within pseudofollicles in secondary lymphoid tissue where tumor cell proliferation is thought to occur. CD38 expression is higher in tissues that contain pseudofollicles compared with those that do not. In addition, we show that CD38 expression in CLL is dynamic, changes in response to contact with activated CD4(+) T cells, and identifies cells that are primed to proliferate. Finally, we demonstrate close contact between activated CD4(+) T cells and proliferating tumor in primary patient tissue. Proliferating tumor cells in lymph nodes express CD38, which is in turn associated with an increased number of CD31(+) vascular endothelial cells. Although the factors resulting in colocalization of tumor, T cells, and endothelium remain unclear, the existence of these cellular clusters may provide an explanation for the association between CD38 expression and adverse outcome in CLL and suggests novel therapeutic targets.","['Patten, Piers E M', 'Buggins, Andrea G S', 'Richards, Julie', 'Wotherspoon, Andrew', 'Salisbury, Jon', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Hamblin, Terry J', 'Devereux, Stephen']","['Patten PE', 'Buggins AG', 'Richards J', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Salisbury J', 'Mufti GJ', 'Hamblin TJ', 'Devereux S']","[""Department of Haematological and Molecular Medicine, King's College London, Rayne Institute, London, USA. piers.patten@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)'],IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*genetics', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Cell Communication', 'Endothelium, Vascular/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47203-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-08-108605 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 15;111(10):5173-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-08-108605.

Several molecules, including gelatinase B/MMP-9, contribute to these processes. Although mainly a secreted protease, some MMP-9 is present at the B-CLL cell surface and the function, mode of anchoring, and interactions of this MMP-9 are unknown. Here we show that anti-MMP-9 antibodies immunoprecipitated a 190-kDa CD44v isoform and alpha4beta1 integrin from B-CLL cells, but not from normal B cells. Function-blocking antibodies to alpha4beta1 or CD44, or transfection with specific siRNAs, decreased cell-associated proMMP-9 and increased the secreted form. B-CLL cells attached to and bound proMMP-9 and active MMP-9, and this was inhibited by blocking the expression or function of alpha4beta1 or CD44. The MMP-9 hemopexin domain was critical in these interactions. alpha4beta1 and 190-kDa CD44v (but not CD44H) formed a complex at the cell surface, since they both coimmunoprecipitated with anti-alpha4, anti-beta1, or anti-CD44 antibodies. Immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that alpha4beta1 and CD44v colocalized with MMP-9. Binding of proMMP-9 inhibited B-CLL cell migration, and this required MMP-9 proteolytic activity. Thus, we have identified alpha4beta1 and CD44v as a novel proMMP-9 cell surface docking complex and show that cell-associated MMP-9 may regulate B-CLL cell migration and arrest.","['Redondo-Munoz, Javier', 'Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'del Cerro, Mercedes Hernandez', 'Van den Steen, Philippe E', 'Opdenakker, Ghislain', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Redondo-Munoz J', 'Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'del Cerro MH', 'Van den Steen PE', 'Opdenakker G', 'Terol MJ', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Departamento de Fisiopatologia Celular y Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (pro-matrix metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Enzyme Precursors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/07/18 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47057-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-08-109249 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jul 1;112(1):169-78. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-08-109249.

A causal role of up-regulated MEF2C expression in myelomonocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has recently been demonstrated. Due to the pronounced monocytic component observed in Mef2c-induced AML, this study was designed to assess the importance of Mef2c in normal myeloid differentiation. Analysis of bone marrow (BM) cells manipulated to constitutively express Mef2c demonstrated increased monopoiesis at the expense of granulopoiesis, whereas BM isolated from Mef2c(Delta/-) mice showed reduced levels of monocytic differentiation in response to cytokines. Mechanistic studies showed that loss of Mef2c expression correlated with reduced levels of transcripts encoding c-Jun, but not PU.1, C/EBPalpha, or JunB transcription factors. Inhibiting Jun expression by short-interfering RNA impaired Mef2c-mediated inhibition of granulocyte development. Moreover, retroviral expression of c-Jun in BM cells promoted monocytic differentiation. The ability of Mef2c to modulate cell-fate decisions between monocyte and granulocyte differentiation, coupled with its functional sensitivity to extracellular stimuli, demonstrate an important role in immunity--and, consistent with findings of other myeloid transcription factors, a target of oncogenic lesions in AML.","['Schuler, Andrea', 'Schwieger, Maike', 'Engelmann, Afra', 'Weber, Kristoffer', 'Horn, Stefan', 'Muller, Ursula', 'Arnold, Michael A', 'Olson, Eric N', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Schuler A', 'Schwieger M', 'Engelmann A', 'Weber K', 'Horn S', 'Muller U', 'Arnold MA', 'Olson EN', 'Stocking C']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Mef2c protein, mouse)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41141-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-116343 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 1;111(9):4532-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-116343.

We hypothesize that imatinib may create a window in which the immune response is partially restored while apoptotic leukemic cells are present, thus rendering leukemic cells immunogenic as patients enter remission. To detect and quantify antileukemia immune responses in an antigen-unbiased way, we used cryopreserved autologous pretreatment blood samples (representing predominantly leukemic cells) as stimulators to detect antileukemia T-cell responses in CML patients in remission on imatinib. We studied patients over time to address the dynamics of such responses. Our data show that antileukemia T-cell responses develop in the majority of CML patients (9 of 14) in remission and that CD4(+) T cells producing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (median 17.6%) represent the major response over interferon-gamma. This confirms the immune system's ability to respond to leukemia under certain conditions. Such responses may be further amplified as a potential therapy that synergizes with imatinib for improved control of CML.","['Chen, Christiane I-U', 'Maecker, Holden T', 'Lee, Peter P']","['Chen CI', 'Maecker HT', 'Lee PP']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-gamma/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/drug effects/metabolism']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/07/02 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47140-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-12-128397 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jun 1;111(11):5342-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-12-128397.

We identified the amino acid sequence DANGMDV (motif-1) or DPSFYSSSWTLFDY (motif-2) in the Ig heavy-chain (IgH) third complementarity-determining region (HCDR3) of IgH, respectively, used by 25 or 3 cases. The IgH with HCDR3 motif-1 or motif-2, respectively, was paired with Ig light chains (IgL) encoded by IGLV3-21 or IGKV3-20, suggesting that these Ig had been selected for binding to conventional antigen(s). Cases that had HCDR3 motif-1 had a median time from diagnosis to initial therapy comparable with that of cases without a defined HCDR3 motif, as did cases that used mutated IGHV3-21 (n = 27) versus unmutated IGHV3-21 (n = 30). Of 7 examined cases that used Ig encoded by IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21, we found that 5 had a functionally rearranged IGKV allele that apparently had incurred antigendriven somatic mutations and subsequent rearrangement with KDE. This study reveals that CLL cells expressing IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21 most likely were derived from B cells that had experienced somatic mutation and germinal-center maturation in an apparent antigen-driven immune response before undergoing Ig-receptor editing and after germinal-center leukemogenic selection.","['Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Jain, Sonia', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wierda, William G', 'Gribben, John G', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Greaves, Andrew W', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Ghia EM', 'Jain S', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Keating MJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Gribben JG', 'Brown JR', 'Rai KR', 'Byrd JC', 'Kay NE', 'Greaves AW', 'Kipps TJ']","['Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080307,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Prognosis']",2008/03/11 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47196-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-12-130229 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 15;111(10):5101-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-12-130229.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), an immunoconjugate of an anti-CD33 antibody that facilitates cellular uptake of a toxic calicheamicin-gamma(1) derivative, induces complete remissions in a subset of patients with AML. We herein tested whether simultaneous targeting of CD45 could improve GO cytotoxicity against AML cell lines and primary AML cells. We found that the anti-CD45 antibody, BC8, dose-dependently increased cytotoxicity induced by GO, and, to a lesser degree, free calicheamicin-gamma(1). BC8 promoted CD33 endocytosis, suggesting that its effect on GO cytotoxicity may be, at least partly, due to increased uptake and intracellular GO availability. Finally, compared with either agent alone, BC8 combined with GO resulted in marked tumor growth inhibition and superior survival rates of mice bearing human AML xenografts.

Caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation were considerably inhibited by N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Chelidonine induced only a slight release of cytochrome c (12h), parallel to caspase-3 activation. Effect of sanguinarine or chelerythrine towards mitochondria was confirmed by marked changes in morphology of this organelle (3h), while chelidonine did not affect mitochondria intactness. Sanguinarine or chelerythrine also caused an intensive DNA damage in cells in 1h, however a massive increase in number of such impaired cells occurred in 6h, while chelidonine induced intensive DNA damage in 15-20% cells only in 24h. Thus, our results demonstrated that rapid cytochrome c release in CEM T-leukemia cells exposed to sanguinarine or chelerythrine was not accompanied by changes in Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X((L/S)) proteins in the mitochondrial fraction, and preceded activation of the initiator caspase-8.","['Kaminskyy, Vitaliy', 'Kulachkovskyy, Oleksandr', 'Stoika, Rostyslav']","['Kaminskyy V', 'Kulachkovskyy O', 'Stoika R']","['Institute of Cell Biology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080131,Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8K7EK8446J (chelidonine)', 'AV9VK043SS (sanguinarine)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzophenanthridines/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chelidonium/chemistry', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",2008/03/08 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2008/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-4274(08)00013-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2008 Apr 1;177(3):168-81. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.01.009.

A polymer-drug conjugate containing doxorubicin (DOX) bound to HPMA copolymer backbone through the enzymaticaly non-cleavable sequence GlyGly shows low but significant cytotoxicity in vitro in seven cancer cell lines of mouse (EL4, 38C13, 3T3, BCL1) and human (SW620, Raji, Jurkat) origin. The low cytotoxicity can be considerably increased by the presence of additional drug-free GlyPheLeuGly side chains. P1 conjugate, i.e. non-targeted HPMA copolymer bearing doxorubicin bound via a biodegradable GlyPheLeuGly sequence, synthesized by direct copolymerization of HPMA with monomeric doxorubicin and thus without additional drug-free GlyPheLeuGly sequences is less effective compared to PK1 synthesized by polymer analogous reaction and thus containing extra drug-free GlyPheLeuGly sequences. Significant activity-enhancing effect was not seen with other amino acid/oligopeptide sequences (e.g., Gly or GlyGly). The activity-enhancing effect of GlyPheLeuGly sequences is more obvious in the conjugate containing doxorubicin bound to HPMA through GlyGly sequence. Derivatization of the terminal carboxyl group of the extra GlyPheLeuGly side chains (amide, N-substituted amide, free carboxyl) does not significantly influence the cytotoxicity of the conjugates. The presence of the GlyPheLeuGly sequence in the conjugate structure increases its rate of intracellular accumulation. Normal cells (Balb/c splenocytes) accumulate less polymer-doxorubicin conjugate compared to cancer cells (T cell lymphoma EL4, B cell lymphoma Raji and T cell leukemia JURKAT).","['Rihova, B', 'Strohalm, J', 'Hovorka, O', 'Subr, V', 'Etrych, T', 'Chytil, P', 'Pola, R', 'Plocova, D', 'Boucek, J', 'Ulbrich, K']","['Rihova B', 'Strohalm J', 'Hovorka O', 'Subr V', 'Etrych T', 'Chytil P', 'Pola R', 'Plocova D', 'Boucek J', 'Ulbrich K']","['Institute of Microbiology, AS CR, v.v.i., Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080116,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Methacrylates)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Polymethacrylic Acids)', '0 (doxorubicin-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer conjugate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'UKW89XAX2X (hydroxypropyl methacrylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methacrylates/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Necrosis', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polymethacrylic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology']",2008/03/08 09:00,2008/06/07 09:00,['2008/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-3659(08)00028-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2008 Apr 21;127(2):110-20. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.01.003.

To elucidate the application, the proposed procedure is intertwined with the estimation of the therapeutic window of a drug. It provides confidence limits for the efficacy and the toxicity of the effective doses, highest ineffective dose, safe doses, and lowest unsafe dose, simultaneously.

Retrospective findings indicated that t-AML/MDS associated genetic aberrations can be observed directly after exposure to chemotherapy and can precede t-AML by several months. To determine the incidence of post-therapeutic aberrations and their predictive value, we prospectively investigated 316 samples of 95 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who were treated with intermediate and high dose chemotherapy (Arm A and B of the megaCHOEP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, prednisolone) trial of the German High Grade NHL study group). Molecular aberrations (RUNX1/RUNX1T1, PML-RARA, CBFB-MYH11, MLL-MLLT1, BCR-ABL1) were observed in 33.3% (Arm A) and 55.4% (Arm B) of patients and in 14.9% and 28.7% of respective samples. Cytogenetic analysis of 53 NHL patients after high dose therapy showed frequent chromosomal breakage. Clonal aberrations were found in three patients. None of these patients developed a t-AML/MDS during a 3-year clinical follow up period.

This disease is rare, associated with high morbidity and mortality, and appears to be more prevalent in East Asian countries. But because there is no grading or categorization system for CAEBV, pathologists and clinicians often disagree regarding diagnosis and therapy. EBV-T/NK LPD includes polyclonal, oligoclonal, and monoclonal proliferation of cytotoxic T and/or NK cells. Moreover, a unique disease previously described as infantile fulminant EBV-associated T-LPD has been identified and overlaps with EBV-T/NK LPD. In the present review a clinicopathological categorization of EBV-T/NK LPD is proposed, based on pathological evaluation and molecular data, as follows: (i) category A1, polymorphic LPD without clonal proliferation of EBV-infected cells; (ii) category A2, polymorphic LPD with clonality; (iii) category A3, monomorphic LPD (T-cell or NK cell lymphoma/leukemia) with clonality; and (iv) category B, monomorphic LPD (T-cell lymphoma) with clonality and fulminant course. Categories A1, A2, and A3 possibly constitute a continuous spectrum and together are equivalent to CAEBV. Category B is the exact equivalent of infantile fulminant EBV-associated T-LPD. It is expected that this categorization system will provide a guide for the better understanding of this disorder. This proposal was approved at the third meeting of the Asian Hematopathology Association (Nagoya, 2006).","['Ohshima, Koichi', 'Kimura, Hiroshi', 'Yoshino, Tadashi', 'Kim, Chul Woo', 'Ko, Young H', 'Lee, Seung-Suk', 'Peh, Suat-Cheng', 'Chan, John K C']","['Ohshima K', 'Kimura H', 'Yoshino T', 'Kim CW', 'Ko YH', 'Lee SS', 'Peh SC', 'Chan JK']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Japan. ohshima_kouichi@med.kurume-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/classification/*pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/virology']",2008/03/08 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2008/03/08 09:00'],"['2008/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['PIN2213 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1827.2008.02213.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2008 Apr;58(4):209-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2008.02213.x.,40,,10.1111/j.1440-1827.2008.02213.x [doi],,['CAEBV Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The top 5 childhood cancers were the same among boys and girls: leukemias, lymphomas, central nervous system neoplasms, retinoblastomas and renal tumors. The highest 5-year absolute survival was observed in Hodgkin's disease (65%) followed by Wilm's tumor (64%), retinoblastomas (48%), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (47%), osteosarcomas (44%), acute lymphoid leukemia and astrocytoma (39%). Multifactorial analysis of age at diagnosis and sex showed no differences in the risk of dying for all childhood cancers. Completeness of treatment and type of hospital combination emerged as a prognostic factor for survival for all childhood cancers together (p < 0.001), acute lymphoid leukemia (p < 0.001) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (p = 0.04). A Childhood Cancer Registry with high-resolution data collection is advocated for in-depth analysis of variation in incidence and survival.","['Swaminathan, Rajaraman', 'Rama, Ranganathan', 'Shanta, Viswanathan']","['Swaminathan R', 'Rama R', 'Shanta V']","['Division of Epidemiology and Cancer Registry, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. iarcsurvival@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Retinoblastoma/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",2008/03/08 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/03/08 09:00'],"['2008/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23428 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Jun 1;122(11):2607-11. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23428.,,,10.1002/ijc.23428 [doi],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

SBDS encodes a highly conserved protein previously implicated in ribosome biogenesis. Using human primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), lymphoblasts, and skin fibroblasts, we show that SBDS stabilized the mitotic spindle to prevent genomic instability. SBDS colocalized with the mitotic spindle in control primary BMSCs, lymphoblasts, and skin fibroblasts and bound to purified microtubules. Recombinant SBDS protein stabilized microtubules in vitro. We observed that primary BMSCs and lymphoblasts from SDS patients exhibited an increased incidence of abnormal mitoses. Similarly, depletion of SBDS by siRNA in human skin fibroblasts resulted in increased mitotic abnormalities and aneuploidy that accumulated over time. Treatment of primary BMSCs and lymphoblasts from SDS patients with nocodazole, a microtubule destabilizing agent, led to increased mitotic arrest and apoptosis, consistent with spindle destabilization. Conversely, SDS patient cells were resistant to taxol, a microtubule stabilizing agent. These findings suggest that spindle instability in SDS contributes to bone marrow failure and leukemogenesis.","['Austin, Karyn M', 'Gupta, Mohan L Jr', 'Coats, Scott A', 'Tulpule, Asmin', 'Mostoslavsky, Gustavo', 'Balazs, Alejandro B', 'Mulligan, Richard C', 'Daley, George', 'Pellman, David', 'Shimamura, Akiko']","['Austin KM', 'Gupta ML Jr', 'Coats SA', 'Tulpule A', 'Mostoslavsky G', 'Balazs AB', 'Mulligan RC', 'Daley G', 'Pellman D', 'Shimamura A']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SBDS protein, human)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Genomic Instability/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Spindle Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Syndrome']",2008/03/08 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2008/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI33764 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2008 Apr;118(4):1511-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI33764.,,,10.1172/JCI33764 [doi],PMC2263145,,,,,"['R01 HL079582/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '7R01 HL079582-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood (PB) and/or BM mononuclear cell samples of pediatric patients with (v)SAA (n=38), refractory cytopenia (MDS-RC) (n=28) and 18 controls were analysed via TCR Vbeta heteroduplex PCR analysis of extracted RNA. A skewed TCR Vbeta CDR3 repertoire was found in 21/38 (v)SAA and in 17/28 RC patients in contrast to 2/18 in the control group.

In the present study, the potential of autologous DCs pulsed ex vivo with tumor cell lysates to stimulate antitumor immunity in patients with B-CLL in early stages was evaluated. Twelve patients at clinical stage 0-2 as per Rai were vaccinated intradermally up to eight times with a mean number of 7.4 x 10(6) DCs pulsed with B-CLL cell lysate. We observed a decrease of peripheral blood leukocytes and CD19+/CD5+ leukemic cells in five patients, three patients showed a stable disease and four patients progressed despite DC vaccination. A significant increase of specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes against the leukemia-associated antigens RHAMM or fibromodulin was detected in four patients after DC vaccination. In patients with a clinical response, an increase of interleukin 12 (IL-12) serum levels and a decrease of the frequency of CD4+CD25(+)FOXP3+ T regulatory cells were observed. Taken together, the study demonstrated that vaccination with autologous DC in CLL patients is feasible and safe.

Moreover, the recent demonstration that other ncRNAs, the ultraconserved genes (UCGs) or transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), are involved in human cancerogenesis, suggests that the wider family of ncRNAs (including both miRNAs and UCGs) could contribute to the development of the malignant phenotype.

Similar results were obtained with combinations of the MEK inhibitors U0126 (30 microM) or PD98059 (50 microM) with rapamycin (10 nM). The combined treatment of melanoma cells with sorafenib and rapamycin led to an approximately twofold increase of cell death compared with sorafenib monotreatment (P<0.05) as assessed by propidium iodide staining and cell death detection ELISA. Moreover, sorafenib in combination with rapamycin completely suppressed invasive melanoma growth in organotypic culture mimicking the physiological context. These effects were associated with complete downregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Sorafenib combined with rapamycin appears to be a promising strategy for the effective treatment of melanoma and merits clinical investigation.","['Lasithiotakis, Konstantinos G', 'Sinnberg, Tobias W', 'Schittek, Birgit', 'Flaherty, Keith T', 'Kulms, Dagmar', 'Maczey, Evelyn', 'Garbe, Claus', 'Meier, Friedegund E']","['Lasithiotakis KG', 'Sinnberg TW', 'Schittek B', 'Flaherty KT', 'Kulms D', 'Maczey E', 'Garbe C', 'Meier FE']","['Division of Dermatologic Oncology, Department of Dermatology, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080306,United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (U 0126)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/pharmacology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/genetics', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Sorafenib', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/genetics', 'Wortmannin']",2008/03/08 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/03/08 09:00'],"['2008/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)33996-8 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2008.44 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2008 Aug;128(8):2013-23. doi: 10.1038/jid.2008.44.

The initial pathogen of concern was Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.), recognized for many years as a pathogen of nonhuman primates as well as a human health target. More recently attention has focused on four viral pathogens as the basis for an SPF colony: simian type D retrovirus (SRV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T cell lymphotropic/leukemia virus (STLV), and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (CHV-1). New technologies, breeding, and maintenance schemes have emerged to develop and provide SPF primates for research.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 58,068 Dutch patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1989 and 2003, SNBC risk was quantified using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), cumulative incidence, and Cox regression analysis, adjusted for competing risks. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 2,578 SNBCs had occurred. Compared with the Dutch female population at large, in this cohort, the SIR of SNBCs was increased (SIR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.27). The absolute excess risk was 13.6 (95% CI, 9.7 to 17.6) per 10,000 person-years. SIRs were elevated for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, lung, uterus, ovary, kidney, and bladder cancers, and for soft tissue sarcomas (STS), melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The 10-year cumulative incidence of SNBCs was 5.4% (95% CI, 5.1% to 5.7%). Among patients younger than 50 years, radiotherapy was associated with an increased lung cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.31; 95% CI, 1.15 to 4.60) and chemotherapy with decreased risk for all SNBCs (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.98) and for colon and lung cancer. Among patients age 50 years and older, radiotherapy was associated with raised STS risk (HR = 3.43; 95% CI, 1.46 to 8.04); chemotherapy with increased risks of melanoma, uterine cancer, and AML; and hormonal therapy with all SNBCs combined (HR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.21) and uterine cancer (HR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.27). An SNBC worsened survival (HR = 3.98; 95%CI 3.77 to 4.20). CONCLUSION: Breast cancer patients diagnosed in the 1990 s experienced a small but significant excess risk of developing an SNBC.","['Schaapveld, Michael', 'Visser, Otto', 'Louwman, Marieke J', 'de Vries, Elisabeth G E', 'Willemse, Pax H B', 'Otter, Renee', 'van der Graaf, Winette T A', 'Coebergh, Jan-Willem W', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E']","['Schaapveld M', 'Visser O', 'Louwman MJ', 'de Vries EG', 'Willemse PH', 'Otter R', 'van der Graaf WT', 'Coebergh JW', 'van Leeuwen FE']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center North-Netherlands (CCCN), P.O.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) regulates the degradation of beta-catenin, a critical regulator of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here we show that GSK-3beta inhibition activates beta-catenin in cord blood CD34(+) cells and upregulates beta-catenin transcriptional targets c-myc and HoxB4, both known to regulate HSC self-renewal. GSK-3beta inhibition resulted in delayed ex vivo expansion of CD34(+) cells, yet enhanced the preservation of stem cell activity as tested in long-term culture with bone marrow stroma. Delayed cell cycling, reduced apoptosis, and increased adherence of hematopoietic progenitor cells to bone marrow stroma were observed in these long-term cultures treated with GSK-3beta inhibitor. This improved adherence to stroma was mediated via upregulation of CXCR4. In addition, GSK-3beta inhibition preserved severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) repopulating cells as tested in the nonobese diabetic/SCID mouse model. Our data suggest the involvement of GSK-3beta inhibition in the preservation of HSC and their interaction with the bone marrow environment. Methods for the inhibition of GSK-3beta may be developed for clinical ex vivo expansion of HSC for transplantation. In addition, GSK-3beta inhibition suppressed leukemic cell growth via the induction of apoptosis mediated by the downregulation of survivin. Modulators of GSK-3beta may increase the range of novel drugs that specifically kill leukemic cells while sparing normal stem cells.","['Holmes, Tiffany', ""O'Brien, Tracey A"", 'Knight, Robert', 'Lindeman, Robert', 'Shen, Sylvie', 'Song, Emma', 'Symonds, Geoff', 'Dolnikov, Alla']","['Holmes T', ""O'Brien TA"", 'Knight R', 'Lindeman R', 'Shen S', 'Song E', 'Symonds G', 'Dolnikov A']","[""Sydney Cord and Marrow Transplant Facility, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080306,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"[""0 (6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime)"", '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oximes/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Umbilical Cord/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2008/03/08 09:00,2008/07/29 09:00,['2008/03/08 09:00'],"['2008/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007-0600 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2007-0600 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2008 May;26(5):1288-97. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2007-0600.

We report a case of dirofilariosis and review all previously observed cases in Hungary. MATERIALS, METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors present a case of human subconjunctival dirofilariosis in a 56-year-old man with mild itching and a burning sensation in his right eye. A slow-moving, whitish, thread-like worm was detected by slit-lamp examination. The worm was surgically removed and parasitological examination identified it as an immature male Dirofilaria repens. A review of Hungarian cases from 1880 to 2000 is presented, with updates of earlier reports. In addition, 16 new cases (8 men; 8 women) diagnosed between 2001 and 2006 are reviewed. The mean age of these 16 patients was 60 years; eight cases had ocular localization, seven were subcutaneous and one was diagnosed in a histopathological section of removed axillary lymph node in a patient with lymphoid leukemia. Twelve of the 16 identified Dirofilariae were females, four were males. According to their recorded histories the patients had not traveled internationally. CONCLUSION: Most of the above cases of dirofilariosis are certainly autochthonous infections. The increasing number of diagnosed cases suggests that this zoonosis is becoming more important in central Europe and that the incidence may increase with the improvement of clinical diagnosis.","['Szenasi, Zsuzsanna', 'Kovacs, Andras Hari', 'Pampiglione, Silvio', 'Fioravanti, Maria Letizia', 'Kucsera, Istvan', 'Tanczos, Balazs', 'Tiszlavicz, Laszlo']","['Szenasi Z', 'Kovacs AH', 'Pampiglione S', 'Fioravanti ML', 'Kucsera I', 'Tanczos B', 'Tiszlavicz L']","['Department of Parasitology, National Center for Epidemiology, Budapest, Hungary. szenasizs@oek.antsz.hu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,,IM,"[""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/surgery"", 'Animals', 'Cats/parasitology', 'Conjunctiva/parasitology/pathology', 'Conjunctival Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/surgery', 'Culicidae/parasitology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dirofilariasis/diagnosis/*epidemiology/surgery/transmission', 'Dogs/parasitology', 'Humans', 'Hungary', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Swine/parasitology', 'Zoonoses/*epidemiology/transmission']",2008/03/07 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00508-008-0928-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2008;120(3-4):96-102. doi: 10.1007/s00508-008-0928-2.,34,,10.1007/s00508-008-0928-2 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biologic parameters 70-kDa zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) and CD38 expression are easier and faster surrogate markers for mutational status. OBJECTIVE: To assess retrospectively ZAP-70 expression in B-CLL cells using flow cytometry and examine its relationship with CD38 expression and the median time from diagnosis to initial therapy. METHODS: Ninety-four unselected patients who had their follow-up in the outpatient clinic from 2004 to 2005 were reviewed for immunophenotyping ZAP-70 and CD38 expression. Direct immunolabeling with clone 2E3.2, isotype IgG2a, enabled easy quantification of ZAP-70 by flow cytometry in association with CD38 expression; in addition, the mean fluorescence intensity ratio (MFIR) of CD19+CD5+ B-CLL cells compared to an isotype control monoclonal antibody was determined. RESULTS: ZAP-70 expression levels in B-CLL cells varied widely (0.3-99%). The median time to therapy was significantly shorter for the 54 patients with 20% or more ZAP-70+ cells (30 months) than for the 40 patients with less than 20% ZAP-70+ cells (median time to treatment not reached). The optimal MFIR for classifying patients as ZAP-70+ was 2. Thirty-two patients had a threshold of ZAP-70+CD38+ greater than 30%, with a median time from diagnosis to treatment of 19 months. Regardless of CD38 expression level, CD38 and ZAP-70 expressions were significantly associated. The median interval from diagnosis to initial therapy was 16.2 months for ZAP-70+CD38+ patients, 60 months for ZAP-70+CD38- or ZAP-70-CD38+ patients, and had not yet been reached for ZAP-70-CD38- patients. CONCLUSION: The association of ZAP-70+CD19+CD5+ B-CLL cells and percentage of CD38+CD19+CD5+ B-CLL cells evaluated by flow cytometry provide reliable methods that could be introduced into a routine diagnostic B-CLL panel to predict outcome.","['Ertault-Daneshpouy, Marjan', 'Noguera, Maria Elena', 'Gisselbrecht, Christian', 'Haddad, Albert', 'Brice, Pauline', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Mounier, Nicolas']","['Ertault-Daneshpouy M', 'Noguera ME', 'Gisselbrecht C', 'Haddad A', 'Brice P', 'Marolleau JP', 'Soulier J', 'Mounier N']","[""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St Louis, 75010 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/classification/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",2008/03/07 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2008/03/07 09:00'],"['2008/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2008 Jan;6(1):55-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the result of a prospective study aimed at investigating the dynamics and heterogeneity of C. albicans flora in patients with de novo acute leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 2001 and 2003, 66 consecutive adults with newly diagnosed acute leukemia were monitored for Candida colonization. From 19 patients with repeated multi-site C. albicans colonization, eight were randomly selected and multiple isolates from each individual mucosal site were genotyped sequentially over time using microsatellite markers. RESULTS: Despite topical use of polyenes, 60.6% of the patients were colonized repeatedly and at multiple sites. Altogether, 2,730 peripheral samples were cultured, 379 (13.9%) of which yielded yeasts. C. albicans was the most common species recovered (68%). From eight randomly selected patients colonized with C. albicans, 429 isolates were genotyped. Seven patients carried a unique genotype which was identical in all body niches and over the period of study. In one case, minor genotypic differences were observed. None of the patients shared C. albicans clones with identical genotypic profiles. Candidemia occurred in one of eight patients and the blood strain genotype did not differ from those of colonizing isolates. The genotypic profile was not altered by topical and/or systemic use of antifungal agents in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with de novo acute leukemia, genetic evolution of the colonizing C. albicans flora and selection of variants or replacement of the original strain upon antifungal drug pressure or nosocomial transmission are rare events.","['Dalle, Frederic', 'Lafon, Ingrid', ""L'ollivier, Coralie"", 'Ferrant, Emmanuelle', 'Sicard, Pierre', 'Labruere, Catherine', 'Jebrane, Ahmed', 'Laubriet, Aline', 'Vagner, Odile', 'Caillot, Denis', 'Bonnin, Alain']","['Dalle F', 'Lafon I', ""L'ollivier C"", 'Ferrant E', 'Sicard P', 'Labruere C', 'Jebrane A', 'Laubriet A', 'Vagner O', 'Caillot D', 'Bonnin A']","['Laboratoire de Parasitologie Mycologie, Hopital du Bocage, BP 77 908, 21079 Dijon Cedex, France. frederic.dalle@chu-dijon.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080305,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Candida albicans/drug effects/*genetics', 'Candidiasis/etiology/*microbiology', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', '*Genome, Fungal', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Organ Specificity', 'Patient Isolation', 'Sampling Studies']",2008/03/07 09:00,2008/06/03 09:00,['2008/03/07 09:00'],"['2008/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.11882 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11882 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Apr;93(4):581-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11882.

Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitors causes cell cycle block, but only after treatment for several days. We further documented the effects of gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and tested whether combining gamma-secretase inhibitors with other anti-cancer drugs offers a therapeutic advantage. DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment and combinations of gamma-secretase inhibitors with chemotherapy or glucocorticoids was assessed on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. We sequenced NOTCH1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases with ABL1 fusions and tested combinations of gamma-secretase inhibitors and the ABL1 inhibitor imatinib in a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. RESULTS: gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment for 5-7 days reversibly inhibited cell proliferation, caused cell cycle block in sensitive T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, and caused differentiation of some T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Treatment for 14 days or longer was required to induce significant apoptosis. The cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine were not significantly enhanced by addition of gamma-secretase inhibitors to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, but gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment sensitized cells to the effect of dexamethasone. NOTCH1 mutations were identified in all T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with ABL1 fusions and in a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line expressing NUP214-ABL1. In this cell line, the anti-proliferative effect of imatinib was increased by pre-treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines with gamma-secretase inhibitors had limited effects on cell proliferation and survival. Combinations of gamma-secretase inhibitors with other drugs may be required to obtain efficient therapeutic effects in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and not all combinations may be useful.","['De Keersmaecker, Kim', 'Lahortiga, Idoya', 'Mentens, Nicole', 'Folens, Cedric', 'Van Neste, Leander', 'Bekaert, Sofie', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Odero, Maria D', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Cools, Jan']","['De Keersmaecker K', 'Lahortiga I', 'Mentens N', 'Folens C', 'Van Neste L', 'Bekaert S', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Odero MD', 'Marynen P', 'Cools J']","['Human Genome Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080305,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0', '(2-(((3,5-difluorophenyl)acetyl)amino)-N-(1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-', '1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl)propanamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzodiazepinones)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (L 685458)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NUP214-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Benzodiazepinones/*pharmacology', 'Carbamates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/enzymology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dipeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2008/03/07 09:00,2008/06/03 09:00,['2008/03/07 09:00'],"['2008/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.11894 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11894 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Apr;93(4):533-42. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11894.

Among such cytokines, interleukin-8 is highly expressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells refractory to chemotherapy. In this study we explored whether bone marrow stromal cells can regulate IL-8 expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and investigated the role of the stromal CXCL12 chemokine in this event. We also investigated the roles of the nuclear factor-kappaB and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activating protein (AP)-1 signaling pathways, which contribute to regulate interleukin-8 production in some cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression of interleukin-8 in primary cells from ten adult patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia when these cells were cultured with bone marrow stromal cells or stimulated with exogenous CXCL12. Interleukin-8 mRNA was analyzed by a colorimetric assay. Cytokine production was assayed by cytometric antibody array and flow cytometry. Nuclear factor-kappaB and JNK/AP-1 activation was investigated by using specific inhibitors of these pathways, immunoblotting, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and cell transfection assays. RESULTS: Bone marrow stromal cells upregulated interleukin-8 mRNA in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells through the activity of CXCR4, the CXCL12 receptor, as assessed by the use of neutralizing antibodies. Exogenous CXCL12 induced a significant increase in the production of IL-8 mRNA and protein in all T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. We showed that CXCL12 activates the nuclear factor-kappaB and JNK/AP-1 pathways, and that these events are required for increased expression of interleukin-8. Furthermore, the nuclear factor-kappaB and AP-1 elements of the interleukin-8 promoter are necessary for both constitutive and CXCL12-induced interleukin-8 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Interleukin-8 is physiologically regulated by the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis and the nuclear factor-kappaB and JNK/AP-1 pathways are required for interleukin-8 expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We propose that, by upregulating interleukin-8, the bone marrow microenvironment and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis may play a role in the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Scupoli, Maria T', 'Donadelli, Massimo', 'Cioffi, Federica', 'Rossi, Maria', 'Perbellini, Omar', 'Malpeli, Giorgio', 'Corbioli, Silvia', 'Vinante, Fabrizio', 'Krampera, Mauro', 'Palmieri, Marta', 'Scarpa, Aldo', 'Ariola, Cristina', 'Foa, Robin', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni']","['Scupoli MT', 'Donadelli M', 'Cioffi F', 'Rossi M', 'Perbellini O', 'Malpeli G', 'Corbioli S', 'Vinante F', 'Krampera M', 'Palmieri M', 'Scarpa A', 'Ariola C', 'Foa R', 'Pizzolo G']","['Laboratorio Universitario di Ricerca, Medica (LURM), Policlinico, G.B.

Prior epidemiological studies have quantified the risks of bone marrow failure, acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumors, but these estimates have not been replicated. DESIGN AND METHODS: We assembled a cohort of 181 patients with Fanconi anemia mostly from Germany. We calculated the ratio of observed to expected cancers, and the risks of bone marrow failure, acute myeloid leukemia, and solid tumors by age. RESULTS: The first adverse event was bone marrow failure in 66 patients, acute meyloid leukemia in 14 patients and solid tumors in 10 patients. The ratio of observed to expected cancers was 44 for all cancers, 26 for all solid tumors, and 868 for acute myeloid leukemia; these increased risks were statistically significant. Significantly elevated ratios of observed to expected cancers were observed for esophageal (6281), vulvar (2411), head and neck (240), breast (34) and brain (23) tumors. Absent or abnormal radii, and a five-item congenital abnormality score, were significant risk factors for bone marrow failure. The cumulative incidence of bone marrow failure by the age of 10 years varied from 12.6% in the lowest bone marrow failure risk group to 84% in the highest. The relative hazard of bone marrow failure was significantly higher in complementation group G versus A (relative hazard=2.2) and in C versus A (relative hazard=5.4). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the German Fanconi Anemia Registry cohort validate prior risk estimates, and strongly support the concept that Fanconi anemia is a highly penetrant cancer susceptibility syndrome with early onset of acute myeloid leukemia and slightly later onset of specific solid tumors.","['Rosenberg, Philip S', 'Alter, Blanche P', 'Ebell, Wolfram']","['Rosenberg PS', 'Alter BP', 'Ebell W']","['Biostatistics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 6120 Executive Blvd, Executive Plaza South, Room 8022, Rockville 20852-7244 USA. rosenbep@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080305,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/epidemiology/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Fanconi Anemia/epidemiology/*genetics/surgery', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Penetrance', 'Postoperative Complications/mortality', 'Radius/abnormalities', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk']",2008/03/07 09:00,2008/06/03 09:00,['2008/03/07 09:00'],"['2008/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12234 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12234 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Apr;93(4):511-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12234.

Currently available estimates of survival do not reflect results from present state-of-the-art treatment due to a lag between the availability of new treatments and data concerning their effect on survival on the population level when traditional cohort analysis is used. We estimated trends in age-specific 5- and 10-year relative survival of acute myeloblastic leukemia patients aged over 15 years old for 5-year calendar periods from 1980-1984 through 2000-2004 using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Period analysis was employed to reveal recent developments in prognosis. Five and 10-year relative survival improved greatly between 1980-1984 and 2000-2004 for all patients except those aged over 75 years old. Improvements were greatest for patients aged 15-34, with increases in 5- and 10-year relative survival of greater than 30% points in this group.

A transient expression assay suggested that pp71 and IE1 were also involved in this process, and this suggestion was significant, since both proteins have been reported to interact with components of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (ND10) and also interact functionally with retinoblastoma pocket proteins (RB). PML bodies have been linked to the formation of nuclear aggresomes, and colocalization studies suggested that viral proteins were recruited to these structures and that UL97 kinase activity inhibited their formation. Proteins associated with PML bodies were examined by Western blot analysis, and pUL97 appeared to specifically affect the phosphorylation of RB in a kinase-dependent manner. Three consensus RB binding motifs were identified in the UL97 kinase, and recombinant viruses were constructed in which each was mutated to assess a potential role in the phosphorylation of RB and the inhibition of nuclear aggresome formation. The mutation of either the conserved LxCxE RB binding motif or the lysine required for kinase activity impaired the ability of the virus to stabilize and phosphorylate RB. We concluded from these studies that both UL97 kinase activity and the LxCxE RB binding motif are required for the phosphorylation and stabilization of RB in infected cells and that this effect can be antagonized by the antiviral drug maribavir. These data also suggest a potential link between RB function and the formation of aggresomes.","['Prichard, Mark N', 'Sztul, Elizabeth', 'Daily, Shannon L', 'Perry, Amie L', 'Frederick, Samuel L', 'Gill, Rachel B', 'Hartline, Caroll B', 'Streblow, Daniel N', 'Varnum, Susan M', 'Smith, Richard D', 'Kern, Earl R']","['Prichard MN', 'Sztul E', 'Daily SL', 'Perry AL', 'Frederick SL', 'Gill RB', 'Hartline CB', 'Streblow DN', 'Varnum SM', 'Smith RD', 'Kern ER']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama 35233, USA. mprichard@peds.uab.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080305,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ganciclovir kinase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*physiology', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment']",2008/03/07 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/03/07 09:00'],"['2008/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02174-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02174-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 May;82(10):5054-67. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02174-07.

We report here a disseminated nocardiosis in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient presented prolonged febrile neutropenia and nodular pneumopathy. Based on the amplification of a 16S rDNA, a PCR assay detected Nocardia sp. in the patient's bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Culture of BAL samples yielded Nocardia nova colonies after 2 weeks of incubation. Hepatic, splenic, renal and cerebral localisations were detected on extension checkup. trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole and amikacine were started given the results of PCR assay, with a good response. Improvement of the patient's general condition led to complete chemotherapy under ciprofloxacine and ceftriaxone treatment, without nocardiosis reactivation. Nocardiosis is a rare complication in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis is widely used to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci infection in children with haematologic malignancies. As Nocardia species are usually sensible, trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole could play a role in Nocardia prophylaxis in such population. In our patient, compliance with trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole had been low. Nocardia species are relatively fastidious growth bacteria and are difficult to isolate with classical bacteriological techniques. Molecular methods are now available, with a good sensitivity and fast results allowing to start an appropriate antibiotherapy before culture results, as early treatment is a major prognosis factor in nocardiosis. Nocardia infection should be suspected in case of nodular pneumopathy in immunocompromised children.

We then applied this methodology, together with real-time DNA qPCR and p27 capsid antigen capture ELISA, to examine cats challenged with FeLV. We found that circulating viral RNA and DNA levels were highly correlated and the assays were almost in perfect agreement. This indicates that the vast majority of viral DNA is transcriptionally active, even in the absence of antigenemia.

By using an adaptor-ligation/suppression-PCR, we identified four integrations into the myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4) gene from 10 HCC patients with positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Determination of the cellular-virus DNA junction demonstrated that various lengths of the virus were integrated within 300 bp of intron 3 flanked by the Alu element of MLL4. Chimeric hepatitis B virus X gene (HBx)/MLL4 transcripts and the HBx fusion proteins were detected. DNA microarray revealed that HBx/MLL4 fusion proteins suppressed unique genes in HepG2 cells. Finally, chromosomal translocations of intron 3 of MLL4 to the specific region of chromosome 17p11.2 in 22 out of 32 HCC patients were observed, showing that the intron 3 region of MLL4 gene would be a target of translocation breakpoint. In conclusion, the present data suggest that the translocation breakpoint of MLL4 gene is one of the preferential targets for HBV DNA integration into the MLL4 gene and the HBV DNA integration may be involved in liver oncogenesis.","['Saigo, Kenichi', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Ikeda, Ryuji', 'Sakamoto, Yoshiko', 'Murakami, Yoshiki', 'Urashima, Tetsuro', 'Asano, Takehide', 'Kenmochi, Takashi', 'Inoue, Ituro']","['Saigo K', 'Yoshida K', 'Ikeda R', 'Sakamoto Y', 'Murakami Y', 'Urashima T', 'Asano T', 'Kenmochi T', 'Inoue I']","['Second Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/*virology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Hepatitis B virus/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', '*Virus Integration']",2008/03/06 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2008/03/06 09:00'],"['2008/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/humu.20701 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2008 May;29(5):703-8. doi: 10.1002/humu.20701.,,,10.1002/humu.20701 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription of the c-myc gene appears to be linked to the late G(1)- and preferentially to S-phases of the cell cycle. The c-myc gene and its transcripts were positioned non-randomly within the interphase nucleus; additionally, c-myc RNA signals accumulated at nucleoli. Using oligo-probes, designed to exon II and exon III of the c-myc gene, single c-myc (T) was preferentially observed in human carcinoma HT29 and A549 cells. Conversely, human embryonal teratocarcinoma NTERA cells were characterized by the presence of multiple c-myc RNA signals located in both the nucleoli and nucleoplasm. When accumulated at nucleoli, c-myc (T) occupied the periphery of this organelle, though not those associated with the cultivation surface. In HT29 cells, approximately 80% of c-myc (T) co-localized with the RNAP II positive regions, so-called transcription factories. However, in approximately 20% of the cells with c-myc transcripts, the c-myc (T) was released from the site of synthesis, and was not associated with either transcription factories or SC35 domains. In approximately 60% of nuclei with c-myc (T), these signals were located in close proximity to the SC35 regions, but promyelocytic leukaemia bodies were associated with c-myc (T) only in approximately 20% of the nuclei. Taken together, c-myc RNA signals were positioned in the most internal parts of the cell nuclei preferentially associated with the nucleoli. Specific nuclear and nucleolar positioning probably reflects the kinetics of c-myc RNA metabolism.","['Bartova, Eva', 'Harnicarova, Andrea', 'Krejci, Jana', 'Strasak, Ludek', 'Kozubek, Stanislav']","['Bartova E', 'Harnicarova A', 'Krejci J', 'Strasak L', 'Kozubek S']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, CZ-612 65, Brno, Czech Republic. bartova@ibp.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,Netherlands,Chromosome Res,"Chromosome research : an international journal on the molecular, supramolecular and evolutionary aspects of chromosome biology",9313452,"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, myc', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/03/06 09:00,2008/06/26 09:00,['2008/03/06 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10577-007-1196-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Chromosome Res. 2008;16(2):325-43. doi: 10.1007/s10577-007-1196-0.

The relationship between ALVE methylation status and neoplastic disease in the chicken is undefined. White Leghorn inbred lines 7(2) and 6(3) at the ADOL have been respectively selected for resistance and susceptibility to tumors that are induced by avian viruses. In this study, the DNA methylation patterns of 3 approximately 6 CpG sites of four conserved regions in ALVE, including one unique region in ALVE1, the promoter region in the TVB (tumor virus receptor of ALV subgroup B, D and E) locus, were analyzed in the two lines using pyrosequencing methods in four tissues, i.e., liver, spleen, blood and hypothalamus. A significant CpG hypermethylation level was seen in line 7(2) in all four tissues, e.g., 91.86 +/- 1.63% for ALVE region2 in blood, whereas the same region was hemimethylated (46.16 +/- 2.56%) in line 6(3). CpG methylation contents of the ALVE regions were significantly lower in line 6(3) than in line 7(2) in all tissues (P < 0.01) except the ALVE region 3/4 in liver. RNA expressions of ALVE regions 2 and 3 (PPT-U3) were significantly higher in line 6(3) than in line 7(2) (P < 0.01). The methylation levels of six recombinant congenic strains (RCSs) closely resembled to the background line 6(3) in ALVE-region 2, which imply the methylation pattern of ALVE-region 2 may be a biomarker in resistant disease breeding. The methylation level of the promoter region in the TVB was significantly different in blood (P < 0.05) and hypothalamus (P < 0.0001), respectively. Our data disclosed a hypermethylation pattern of ALVE that may be relevant for resistance against ALV induced tumors in chickens.","['Yu, Ying', 'Zhang, Huanmin', 'Tian, Fei', 'Bacon, Larry', 'Zhang, Yuan', 'Zhang, Wensheng', 'Song, Jiuzhou']","['Yu Y', 'Zhang H', 'Tian F', 'Bacon L', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang W', 'Song J']","['Department of Animal & Avian Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080305,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*genetics', 'Chickens/*genetics/virology', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Susceptibility/*virology', 'Female', 'Hypothalamus/physiology', 'Liver/physiology', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/physiology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics']",2008/03/06 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/03/06 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0001731 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Mar 5;3(3):e1731. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0001731.,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0001731 [doi],PMC2254315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent immunophenotypic studies performed mainly in Western populations have demonstrated the prognostic value of CD38 and ZAP-70 expression in B-CLL. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the expression pattern of a variety of membrane antigens on leukemic cells from Iranian patients with CLL and to find out if there are any differences in the expression of these markers between indolent and progressive groups. METHODS: In the present study, peripheral blood samples from 87 Iranian patients with B-CLL were analysed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In all cases, the neoplastic cells displayed B-CLL phenotype (CD5+/CD19+/sIg+). The vast majority of the cases expressed CD23, but failed to stain for CD3 or CD14. The leukemic cells of most patients expressed CD27 (84/87, 95.4%) and CD45RO (74/87, 83.9%) molecules, suggesting a memory B-cell phenotype. Comparison between the indolent (n=42) and progressive (n=37) patients revealed significantly higher frequency and intensity of CD38 expression in progressive group (40.5%) compared to indolent (11.9%) patients (p<0.05). None of the other membrane antigens were differentially expressed in these two groups of patients. CONCLUSION: Our results obtained in an Asian ethnic population confirm and extend previous findings obtained from Western populations regarding the association of CD38 expression and disease progression in B-CLL.","['Hojjat Farsangi, Mohammad', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Sharifian, Ramazan Ali', 'Shamsian Khoramabadi, Ahmad', 'Rabbani, Hodjatallah', 'Shokri, Fazel']","['Hojjat Farsangi M', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Razavi SM', 'Sharifian RA', 'Shamsian Khoramabadi A', 'Rabbani H', 'Shokri F']","['Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Medical Sciences/Tehran University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Iran', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging']",2008/03/06 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/03/06 09:00'],"['2008/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['02 [pii]', 'IJIv5i1A2 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2008 Mar;5(1):25-35. doi: IJIv5i1A2.,,,IJIv5i1A2 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definite diagnosis invariably centers on histologic identification of hyphae in tissue or on culture from a sterile body site. Therefore, most practitioners have relied on prophylaxis and empiric therapy. Currently, emphasis is shifting from routine prophylaxis and empiric therapy to screening of patients with neutropenia at high risk so that clinicians can administer appropriate antifungal therapy early, when it can potentially improve patient outcome. Non-culture-based microbiologic tools are at the forefront of this paradigm shift. Commercially available methods to detect fungal antigens and sophisticated techniques to detect fungal DNA may be used as screening tools during the highest risk period. Together with assessment of clinical signs, cultures, and especially CT scanning, these methods are useful for starting antifungal therapy preemptively. While awaiting further evaluation of these tools during the postengraftment period of allogeneic HSCT, mold-active prophylaxis targeting the subgroup of patients with severe acute or chronic GVHD may be justified. However, some critical issues have not yet been adequately addressed, including the generalizability of study results, impact of mucositis and gastrointestinal GVHD on drug bioavailability, need for therapeutic drug monitoring, impact of prophylaxis on the performance of diagnostic assays, and optimal treatment of breakthrough invasive fungal infections.","['Maertens, Johan', 'Buve, Kristel', 'Anaissie, Elias']","['Maertens J', 'Buve K', 'Anaissie E']","['Department of Hematology, Acute Leukemia and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, Campus Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. johan.maertens@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Fungal)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '3X48A86C8K (polysaccharide-K)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Fungal/blood', 'Aspergillosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Neutropenia/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Proteoglycans', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'beta-Glucans']",2008/03/06 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/03/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.6004/jnccn.2008.0015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2008 Feb;6(2):183-9. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2008.0015.,50,,,,,,,,,,['J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2008 Feb;6(2):175-82.

The tumour suppressor Hypermethylated In Cancer 1 (HIC1) is a transcriptional repressor, which is epigenetically silenced in solid cancers. HIC1 mRNA expression was found to be low in 128 patient samples of AML and CD34+ progenitor cells when compared with terminally differentiated granulocytes. HIC1 mRNA was induced in a patient with t(15;17)-positive acute promyelocytic leukaemia receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. We therefore investigated whether HIC1 plays a role in granulocytic differentiation and whether loss of function of this gene might contribute to the differentiation block in AML. We evaluated HIC1 mRNA levels in HL-60 and U-937 cells upon ATRA-induced differentiation and in CD34+ progenitor cells after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced differentiation. In both models of granulocytic differentiation, we observed significant HIC1 induction. When HIC1 mRNA was suppressed in HL-60 cells using stably expressed short hairpin RNA targeting HIC1, granulocytic differentiation was altered as assessed by CD11b expression. Bisulphite sequencing of GC-rich regions (CpG islands) in the HIC1 promoter provided evidence that the observed suppression in HL-60 cells was not because of promoter hypermethylation. Our findings indicate a role for the tumour suppressor gene HIC1 in granulocytic differentiation. Low expression of HIC1 may very well contribute to pathogenic events in leukaemogenesis.","['Britschgi, Christian', 'Jenal, Mathias', 'Rizzi, Mattia', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Torbett, Bruce E', 'Andres, Anne-Catherine', 'Tobler, Andreas', 'Fey, Martin F', 'Tschan, Mario P']","['Britschgi C', 'Jenal M', 'Rizzi M', 'Mueller BU', 'Torbett BE', 'Andres AC', 'Tobler A', 'Fey MF', 'Tschan MP']","['Experimental Oncology/Haematology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080303,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HIC1 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/03/06 09:00,2008/06/12 09:00,['2008/03/06 09:00'],"['2008/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6992 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.06992.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Apr;141(2):179-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.06992.x.

The folate receptor (FR) has two glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored isoforms, alpha and beta. FR-alpha expression is frequently amplified in epithelial cancers, whereas FR-beta expression is found in myeloid leukemia and activated macrophages associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. Conjugates of folic acid and anti-FR antibodies can be taken up by cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, thus providing a mechanism for targeted delivery to FR+ cells. The aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of applications of FR targeting in drug delivery, with an emphasis on the strategy of using folate as a targeting ligand. In order to do this, recent literature is surveyed on targeted delivery via both FR sub-types, as well as new findings on selective receptor upregulation in the targeted cells. A wide variety of molecules and drug carriers, including imaging agents, chemotherapeutic agents, oligonucleotides, proteins, haptens, liposomes, nanoparticles and gene transfer vectors have been conjugated to folate and evaluated for FR-targeted delivery. Substantial targeting efficacy has been found both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, mechanisms and methods for selective FR upregulation have been uncovered, which might enhance the effectiveness of the FR-targeted delivery strategy. FR-alpha serves as a useful marker for cancer, whereas FR-beta serves as a marker for myeloid leukemia and chronic inflammatory diseases. FR-targeted agents have shown promising efficacy in preclinical models and significant potential for future clinical application in a wide range of diseases.","['Zhao, Xiaobin', 'Li, Hong', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Zhao X', 'Li H', 'Lee RJ']","['Abbott Laboratories, Global Pharmaceutics and Life Cycle Technology, Abbott Park, IL 60064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Drug Deliv,Expert opinion on drug delivery,101228421,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/administration & dosage/chemistry/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/administration & dosage/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism']",2008/03/06 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/03/06 09:00'],"['2008/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/17425247.5.3.309 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2008 Mar;5(3):309-19. doi: 10.1517/17425247.5.3.309.,113,,10.1517/17425247.5.3.309 [doi],,,,,,['R01 CA095673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Current classification schemes incorporate morphologic features, immunophenotype, molecular genetics, and clinical data to specifically categorize leukemias into various subtypes. Although sophisticated methodologies are frequently used to detect characteristic features conferring diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic implications, a thorough microscopic examination remains essential to the pathologic evaluation. Detailed blast immunophenotyping can be performed with lineage- and maturation-specific markers. Although no one marker is pathognomonic for one malignancy, a well-chosen panel of antibodies can efficiently aid the diagnosis and classification of acute leukemias. OBJECTIVE: To review important developments from recent and historical literature. General immunohistochemical staining patterns of the most commonly encountered lymphoid and myeloid leukemias are emphasized. The goal is to discuss the immunostaining of acute leukemias when flow cytometry and genetic studies are not available. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive review was performed of the relevant literature indexed in PubMed (National Library of Medicine) and referenced medical texts. Additional references were identified in the reviewed manuscripts. CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotyping of blasts using an immunohistochemical approach to lymphoid and myeloid malignancies is presented. Initial and subsequent additional antibody panels are suggested to confirm or exclude each possibility in the differential diagnosis and a general strategy for diagnostic evaluation is discussed. Although the use of immunohistochemistry alone is limited and evaluation by flow cytometry and genetic studies is highly recommended, unavoidable situations requiring analysis of formalin-fixed tissue specimens arise. When performed in an optimized laboratory and combined with a careful morphologic examination, the immunohistochemical approach represents a useful laboratory tool for classifying various leukemias.","['Olsen, Randall J', 'Chang, Chung-Che', 'Herrick, Jennifer L', 'Zu, Youli', 'Ehsan, Aamir']","['Olsen RJ', 'Chang CC', 'Herrick JL', 'Zu Y', 'Ehsan A']","['Department of Pathology, The Methodist Hospital, 6565 Fannin St, M227, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*classification/*diagnosis']",2008/03/06 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2008/03/06 09:00'],"['2007/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['2006-0767-RAR2 [pii]', '10.5858/2008-132-462-ALIASD [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2008 Mar;132(3):462-75. doi: 10.5858/2008-132-462-ALIASD.,110,,10.1043/1543-2165(2008)132[462:ALIASD]2.0.CO;2 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients received topotecan (2.4 mg/m(2) daily as a 30-minute infusion) for 5 days before induction therapy with dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase (native or pegylated Escherichia coli). The pharmacokinetics of topotecan were measured with the first dose of treatment in 23 patients. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 31 patients with circulating blast cells were evaluable for response to topotecan. Twenty-five patients (89.3%) had a response (>25% decrease in circulating blast cells). The leukocyte count (P = .0001) and blast cell count (P = .0009) declined significantly during topotecan therapy. The median (range) topotecan lactone area under the concentration-time curve after the first dose was 85.4 L/hour/m(2) (range, 38.7-229.3 L/hour/m(2)). At the end of induction, 23 patients (74.2%) had a complete response, 1 patient (3.2%) had a partial response, 5 patients (16.1%) had no response, and 2 patients had died of infection. Six of the 17 patients who were studied for minimal residual disease (MRD) achieved MRD-negative status at the end of induction. The main toxicities were hematologic, gastrointestinal, and hepatic. The estimated 5-year survival rate, event-free survival rate, and cumulative incidence of second relapse were 24.1% +/- 7.9%, 18.2% +/- 7.4%, and 22.8% +/- 8.7%, respectively, in the 29 patients who had a hematologic first relapse. CONCLUSIONS: A regimen comprising single-agent topotecan given with a standard 3-drug combination was effective in inducing remission in pediatric patients with relapsed ALL and was tolerated well.","['Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Stewart, Clinton F', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Campana, Dario', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Gajjar, Amar']","['Hijiya N', 'Stewart CF', 'Zhou Y', 'Campana D', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Rivera GK', 'Relling MV', 'Pui CH', 'Gajjar A']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. nhijiya@childrensmemorial.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2008/03/06 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/03/06 09:00'],"['2008/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23395 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 May 1;112(9):1983-91. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23395.,,,10.1002/cncr.23395 [doi],,,,,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This case highlights the involvement of rare site by a rare lymphoma and should be kept in mind in the differential diagnoses of pituitary tumors.","['Jain, D', 'Sharma, M C', 'Sarkar, C', 'Suri, V', 'Garg, A', 'Mahapatra, A K', 'Kumar, L']","['Jain D', 'Sharma MC', 'Sarkar C', 'Suri V', 'Garg A', 'Mahapatra AK', 'Kumar L']","['Department of Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110029, India.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*complications/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*etiology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*metabolism', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*complications/pathology']",2008/03/05 09:00,2008/11/06 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11060-008-9561-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2008 Jun;88(2):237-41. doi: 10.1007/s11060-008-9561-1.,,,10.1007/s11060-008-9561-1 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a retrospective study at Charles University Hospital, Hradec Kralove. METHODS: The Czech version of the international generic European Quality-of-Life questionnaire (EQ-5D) was applied to evaluate QOL among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and malignant Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma (ML). The total number of respondents was 36: 12 with AML (seven males and five females) and 24 with ML (11 males and 13 females). The mean age of AML respondents was 46 years and the mean age of ML respondents was 44.5 years. RESULTS: Age, smoking status and education level had statistically significant effects on QOL among AML respondents (p < 0.05), and age had a statistically significant effect on QOL among ML respondents (p < 0.05). The overall QOL among AML and ML respondents was generally good: the mean EQ-5D score among AML respondents was 71.5% and among ML respondents it was 82.7%. CONCLUSION: The QOL among AML and ML respondents treated with autologous HSCT was good. However, patients more than 50 years old, smokers and patients with lower education levels presented worse QOL. These findings need to be better evaluated in longitudinal studies, using large samples.","['Slovacek, Ladislav', 'Slovackova, Birgita', 'Jebavy, Ladislav', 'Macingova, Zuzana']","['Slovacek L', 'Slovackova B', 'Jebavy L', 'Macingova Z']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Charles University, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. ladislav.slovacek@seznam.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Czech Republic', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*psychology', 'Hodgkin Disease/psychology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/psychology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/psychology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",2008/03/05 09:00,2009/01/27 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1516-31802007000600012 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802007000600012 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2007 Nov 1;125(6):359-61. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802007000600012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These limitations may be of utmost importance in the adjuvant and curative intent settings. Hematologic toxicities may result in febrile neutropenia, infections, fatigue, and bleeding, all of which may lead to additional complications and prolonged hospitalization. The older cancer patient and patients with significant comorbidities may be at highest risk of neutropenic complications. Colony-stimulating factors (csfs) such as filgrastim and pegfilgrastim can effectively attenuate most of the neutropenic consequences of chemotherapy, improve the ability to continue chemotherapy on the planned schedule, and minimize the risk of febrile neutropenia and infectious morbidity and mortality. The present consensus statement reviews the use of csfs in the management of neutropenia in patients with cancer and sets out specific recommendations based on published international guidelines tailored to the specifics of the Canadian practice landscape. We review existing international guidelines, the indications for primary and secondary prophylaxis, the importance of maintaining dose intensity, and the use of csfs in leukemia, stem-cell transplantation, and radiotherapy. Specific disease-related recommendations are provided related to breast cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer. Finally, csf dosing and schedules, duration of therapy, and associated acute and potential chronic toxicities are examined.","['Kouroukis, C T', 'Chia, S', 'Verma, S', 'Robson, D', 'Desbiens, C', 'Cripps, C', 'Mikhael, J']","['Kouroukis CT', 'Chia S', 'Verma S', 'Robson D', 'Desbiens C', 'Cripps C', 'Mikhael J']","['Juravinski Cancer Centre, Hamilton, ON, USA. tom.kouroukis@hrcc.on.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,,2008/03/05 09:00,2008/03/05 09:01,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:01 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3747/co.2008.198 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2008 Jan;15(1):9-23. doi: 10.3747/co.2008.198.,,,,PMC2259432,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Canadian recommendations', 'chemotherapy-induced neutropenia', 'colony-stimulating factors', 'febrile neutropenia', 'neutropenia', 'safety', 'supportive care']",

In this study, 198 patients and their corresponding donors were analyzed retrospectively for the occurrence of NOD2/CARD15 mutations to evaluate the impact on clinical results after Allo-SCT. In all, 7.6% of the patients and 11% of the donors were heterozygous for one of three SNPs 8, 12 or 13. Contrary to earlier findings, we found no significant impact on incidence of acute GVHD or TRM following Allo-SCT.

To investigate the relevance of an intrinsic PI3K-AKT pathway activation in hematopoietic malignancies, we analysed the effect of point mutations in the catalytic (p110alpha) and regulatory (p85alpha) subunit of class IA PI3K. We demonstrated that mutations in the helical (E542K, E545A) and kinase domain (H1047R) of p110alpha constitutively activate the PI3K-AKT pathway and lead to factor-independent growth of early hematopoietic cells. Proliferation and survival of the cells were inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner using either PI3K or AKT inhibitors. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was demonstrated to be important for mitogenic, but not antiapoptotic signaling of mutant p110alpha. In a syngenic mouse model, hematopoietic cells expressing mutated p110alpha induced a leukemia-like disease characterized by anemia, neoplastic infiltration of hematopoietic organs and 90% mortality within 5 weeks, whereas activated mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT led to 100% mortality within 10 days. Our data show that point mutations in the p110alpha subunit of class IA PI3K confer factor independence to hematopoietic cells in vitro and leukemogenic potential in vivo, but have lower transforming activity than a deregulated class III receptor tyrosine kinase.","['Horn, S', 'Bergholz, U', 'Jucker, M', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Trumper, L', 'Stocking, C', 'Basecke, J']","['Horn S', 'Bergholz U', 'Jucker M', 'McCubrey JA', 'Trumper L', 'Stocking C', 'Basecke J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080303,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2008/03/05 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc200840 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.40 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jul 3;27(29):4096-106. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.40.

Unique genetic alterations in combinations or in isolation account for a small fraction of MDS suggesting the epigenetic hypermethylation as a possible leading cause for MDS and its transformation to acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML). Therefore, in this study, promoter hypermethylation status of key cell cycle regulators was assessed as markers in MDS patients and association of hypermethylation with clinical progression of disease was also studied. METHODS: Promoter hypermethylation analysis of five tumour associated genes namely p16, p15, MGMT, hMLH1 and E-cadherin were done for 41 MDS patient samples with its various subtype. The hypermethylation analysis was done by using semi-nested multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Eighty per cent of (33/41) of the MDS samples were found to be methylated in any one of the four genes (p16, p15, MGMT and E-cadherin). The p15 methylation was found to be the most frequent 61 per cent (25/41), E-cadherin was methylated in 39 per cent (16/41) and p16 in 37 per cent (15/41) of the cases. MGMT gene showed a low 5 per cent (2/41) methylation whereas hMLH1 gene was not methylated in any one of the samples analysed. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Differential rate of methylation of the four genes (p16, p15, MGMT and E-cadherin) was observed in MDS samples. All the samples analysed showed the absence of a methylator phenotype in MDS. The methylation frequency of all these genes increased with the clinical severity of the MDS subtypes. Therefore, hypermethylation may be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in ascertaining the clinical severity of MDS.","['Solomon, P R', 'Munirajan, A K', 'Tsuchida, Nobuo', 'Muthukumarasamy, Kottampatti', 'Rathinavel, Andiappan', 'Selvam, G S', 'Shanmugam, G']","['Solomon PR', 'Munirajan AK', 'Tsuchida N', 'Muthukumarasamy K', 'Rathinavel A', 'Selvam GS', 'Shanmugam G']","['Department of Biochemistry, Centre for Advanced Studies in Functional Genomics, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (MGMT protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/genetics', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics', 'Humans', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2008/03/05 09:00,2008/07/02 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2008 Jan;127(1):52-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of DLI is mediated by donor T cells recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags) on malignant recipient cells. Because HLA class II molecules are predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells, mHag-specific CD4(+) T cells may selectively mediate graft versus leukemia (GvL) reactivity without graft versus host disease (GvHD). In this study, we used a recombinant bacteria cDNA library for the identification of the first autosomal HLA class II (HLA-DQB1*0603)-restricted mHag LB-PI4K2B-1S encoded by the broadly expressed phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II beta gene. A polyclonal CD4(+) T cell response against LB-PI4K2B-1S was demonstrated in a patient with relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who responded to DLI after HLA-matched alloSCT. LB-PI4K2B-1S-specific CD4(+) T cells recognized and lysed the CD34(+) CML cells of the patient and other leukemic cells as well as high HLA-DQ-expressing normal hematopoietic cells. HLA-DQ expression on normal cells of nonhematopoietic origin was moderately up-regulated by IFN-gamma and not sufficient for T cell recognition.

We conducted this phase I study to determine if the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib could be safely added to induction chemotherapy in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bortezomib was given on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 at doses of 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, or 1.5 mg/m(2) with idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 3 and cytarabine 100 mg/m(2)/day on days 1 to 7. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients were enrolled. The median age was 62 years, and 16 patients were male. Nine patients had relapsed AML (ages, 18-59 years, n = 4 and > or = 60 years, n = 5). There were 22 patients of > or = 60 years with previously untreated AML (eight with prior myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative disorder or cytotoxic therapy). All doses of bortezomib, up to and including 1.5 mg/m(2), were tolerable. Nonhematologic grade 3 or greater toxicities included 12 hypoxia (38%; 11 were grade 3), 4 hyperbilirubinemia (13%), and 6 elevated aspartate aminotransferase (19%). Overall, 19 patients (61%) achieved complete remission (CR) and three had CR with incomplete platelet recovery. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the total body clearance of bortezomib decreased significantly (P < 0.01, N = 26) between the first (mean +/- SD, 41.9 +/- 17.1 L/h/m(2)) and third (18.4 +/- 7.0 L/h/m(2)) doses. Increased bone marrow expression of CD74 was associated with CR. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bortezomib, idarubicin, and cytarabine showed a good safety profile. The recommended dose of bortezomib for phase II studies with idarubicin and cytarabine is 1.5 mg/m(2).","['Attar, Eyal C', 'De Angelo, Daniel J', 'Supko, Jeffrey G', ""D'Amato, Ferdinando"", 'Zahrieh, David', 'Sirulnik, Andres', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Ballen, Karen K', 'McAfee, Steve', 'Miller, Kenneth B', 'Levine, James', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Trehu, Elizabeth G', 'Schenkein, David', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Amrein, Philip C']","['Attar EC', 'De Angelo DJ', 'Supko JG', ""D'Amato F"", 'Zahrieh D', 'Sirulnik A', 'Wadleigh M', 'Ballen KK', 'McAfee S', 'Miller KB', 'Levine J', 'Galinsky I', 'Trehu EG', 'Schenkein D', 'Neuberg D', 'Stone RM', 'Amrein PC']","['Hematology/Oncology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA. eattar@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/03/05 09:00,2008/05/24 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/5/1446 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4626 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Mar 1;14(5):1446-54. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4626.,,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4626 [doi],,,,,,['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Data from in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies have revealed that no specific treatment can prevent or block HTLV-1 replication and therefore that there is no therapy for the prevention and/or treatment of HTLV-1-associated diseases in infected individuals. HTLV-1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrases, the enzymes that specifically catalyze the integration of these retroviruses in host cell DNA, share important structural properties, suggesting that compounds that inhibit HIV-1 integration could also inhibit HTLV-1 integration. We developed quantitative assays to test, in vitro and ex vivo, the efficiencies of styrylquinolines and diketo acids, the two main classes of HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. The compounds were tested in vitro in an HTLV-1 strand-transfer reaction and ex vivo by infection of fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes with lethally irradiated HTLV-1-positive cells. In vitro, four styrylquinoline compounds and two diketo acid compounds significantly inhibited HTLV-1 integration in a dose-dependent manner. All compounds active in vitro decreased cell proliferation ex vivo, although at low concentrations; they also dramatically decreased both normalized proviral loads and the number of integration events during experimental ex vivo primary infection. Accordingly, diketo acids and styrylquinolines are the first drugs that produce a specific negative effect on HTLV-1 replication in vitro and ex vivo, suggesting their potential efficiency for the prevention and treatment of HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Rabaaoui, Samira', 'Zouhiri, Fatima', 'Lancon, Agnes', 'Leh, Herve', ""d'Angelo, Jean"", 'Wattel, Eric']","['Rabaaoui S', 'Zouhiri F', 'Lancon A', 'Leh H', ""d'Angelo J"", 'Wattel E']","['CNRS UMR5537, Universite Lyon 1, Centre Leon Berard, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, 28 rue Laennec, 69373, Lyon Cedex 08, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080303,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (HIV Integrase Inhibitors)', '0 (Integrase Inhibitors)', '0 (Ketones)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (styrylquinoline)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HIV Integrase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Integrase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ketones/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Proviruses/drug effects/physiology', 'Quinolines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Virus Integration/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2008/03/05 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['AAC.01361-07 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.01361-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Oct;52(10):3532-41. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01361-07.

RUNX1 function can be regulated by post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. We show that RUNX1 is arginine-methylated in vivo by the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1, and that PRMT1 serves as a transcriptional coactivator for RUNX1 function. Using mass spectrometry, and a methyl-arginine-specific antibody, we identified two arginine residues (R206 and R210) within the region of RUNX1 that interact with the corepressor SIN3A and are methylated by PRMT1. PRMT1- dependent methylation of RUNX1 at these arginine residues abrogates its association with SIN3A, whereas shRNA against PRMT1 (or use of a methyltransferase inhibitor) enhances this association. We find arginine-methylated RUNX1 on the promoters of two bona fide RUNX1 target genes, CD41 and PU.1 and show that shRNA against PRMT1 or RUNX1 down-regulates their expression. These arginine methylation sites and the dynamic regulation of corepressor binding are lost in the leukemia-associated RUNX1-ETO fusion protein, which likely contributes to its dominant inhibitory activity.","['Zhao, Xinyang', 'Jankovic, Vladimir', 'Gural, Alexander', 'Huang, Gang', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Menendez, Silvia', 'Zhang, Jin', 'Dunne, Richard', 'Xiao, Andrew', 'Erdjument-Bromage, Hediye', 'Allis, C David', 'Tempst, Paul', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Zhao X', 'Jankovic V', 'Gural A', 'Huang G', 'Pardanani A', 'Menendez S', 'Zhang J', 'Dunne R', 'Xiao A', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Allis CD', 'Tempst P', 'Nimer SD']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Arginine/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Mutation', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/*genetics', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2008/03/05 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/5/640 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1632608 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2008 Mar 1;22(5):640-53. doi: 10.1101/gad.1632608.,,,10.1101/gad.1632608 [doi],PMC2259033,,,,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Deregulation of this pathway has been linked to a large variety of cancers, including different subtypes of leukemia. Lef-1 is a major transcription factor of this pathway and plays a pivotal role in lymphoid differentiation as well as in granulopoiesis. Here, we demonstrate Lef-1 expression in murine HSCs as well as its expression in human leukemia. Mice transplanted with bone marrow retrovirally transduced to express Lef-1 or a constitutive active Lef-1 mutant showed a severe disturbance of normal hematopoietic differentiation and finally developed B lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Lef-1-induced AMLs were characterized by immunoglobulin (Ig) DH-JH rearrangements and a promiscuous expression of lymphoid and myeloid regulatory factors. Furthermore, single cell experiments and limiting dilution transplantation assays demonstrated that Lef-1-induced AML was propagated by a leukemic stem cell with lymphoid characteristics displaying Ig DH-JH rearrangements and a B220(+) myeloid marker(-) immunophenotype. These data indicate a thus far unknown role of Lef-1 in the biology of acute leukemia, pointing to the necessity of balanced Lef-1 expression for an ordered hematopoietic development.","['Petropoulos, Konstantin', 'Arseni, Natalia', 'Schessl, Christina', 'Stadler, Christiane R', 'Rawat, Vijay P S', 'Deshpande, Aniruddha J', 'Heilmeier, Bernhard', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela', 'Buske, Christian']","['Petropoulos K', 'Arseni N', 'Schessl C', 'Stadler CR', 'Rawat VP', 'Deshpande AJ', 'Heilmeier B', 'Hiddemann W', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Bohlander SK', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Buske C']","['Department of Medicine III, Klinikum Grosshadern, D-81377 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080303,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lef1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism']",2008/03/05 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20071875 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20071875 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2008 Mar 17;205(3):515-22. doi: 10.1084/jem.20071875.

The protein product of BCR-ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives the abnormal proliferation of CML cells. Blast crisis (BC) is the terminal phase of CML, which is often associated with additional chromosomal and molecular secondary changes. Although the mechanisms responsible for transition of CML chronic phase (CP) into BC remain poorly understood, ample evidence suggests that it depends on synergy of BCR/ABL with other genes dysregulated during disease progression, and signaling pathways are abnormally activated by BCR/ABL. With the application of imatinib, a ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, its remarkable therapeutic effects suggest that blast crisis transition will be postponed in most patients with CML. Rate of cumulative best response in CML-CP patients from the IRIS trial after 5 years are 98% for complete hematologic response, 92% for major cytogenetic response and 87% for complete cytogenetic response. However, a minority of CML-CP patients and most patients in progression either fail or respond suboptimally to imatinib.

For inhibiting hTERT mRNA, three siRNA strands were chemosynthesized and transfected into K562 cells, two effective and specific siRNA strands were chosen. Then plasmid pSUPER-U6-Kan rhTERT-1, pSUPER-U6-Kan rhTERT-2 targeting hTERT mRNA were constructed and transfected into K562 cells by liposome. The expression of hTERT mRNA, telomerase activity and cell apoptosis were detected at 48 hours and 72 hours. The results showed that three chemosynthesized strands began to significantly inhibit target gene expression at 48 hours, but the inhibiting rates were different. The inhibiting effect disappeared after 72 hours. After plasmid pSUPER-U6-Kan rhTERT -1 (P-1 group) and pSUPER-U6-Kan rhTERT -2 (P-2 group) were transfected into K562 cells, the expressions of hTERT mRNA both decreased in the two groups. The expression of hTERT mRNA in P-1 group was 0.39+/-0.13 at 48 hours, 0.57+/-0.32 at 72 hours. The expression of hTERT mRNA in P-2 group was 0.55+/-0.20 at 48 hours, 0.88+/-0.23 at 72 hours. Telomerase activity in P-1 group was 0.42+/-0.07 at 48 hours, 0.31+/-0.08 at 72 hours; the telomerase activity in group P-2 was 0.49+/-0.27 at 48 hours, 0.39+/-0.03 at 72 hours while telomerase activities in both groups were significantly lower than that in negative control group (0.88+/-0.30, 0.88+/-0.32). At 48 hours, the apoptosis rates in P-1 group (18.39+/-3.08%) and P-2 group (15.5+/-3.59%) were significantly higher than that in negative control group (7.64+/-3.73%). At 72 hours the apoptosis rate in P-1 group (13.2+/-1.18%) and in P-2 group (12.86+/-3.09%) had no significant difference as compared with negative control group (8.07+/-0.19%). It is concluded that RNAi targeting hTERT inhibits the expression of hTERT mRNA, and therefore inhibits telomerase activity. The inhibiting effect is closely correlated with target site. The si-hTERT-1 effect is better than si-hTERT-2, while si-hTERT-3 almost has no effect at all. The effective time of plasmid-induced RNAi is obviously longer than that of chemosynthesized siRNA. The former is longer than 72 hours, while the latter is only 48 hours. After the telomerase activity is inhibited, cell apoptosis increases a little than control group at 48 hours. At 72 hours cell apoptosis has no difference with control group.

The telomerase relative activities in K562 cells treated with 0.2, 0.6, 1.0 micromol/L SPSODN were 76.1%, 72.2%, 65.7% respectively, but the telomerase relative activities of K562 cells in 0.2, 0.6 micromol/L SPSODN groups was not inhibited obviously. When K562 cells were treated for 48 hours, telomerase relative activity of K562 cells in each ASPSODN groups restored. It showed that telomerase relative activities of K562 cells treated with 0.2, 0.6, 1.0 micromol/L ASPSODN were 84.1%, 82.3%, 79.6% respectively, while telomerase relative activities of K562 cells treated with 0.2, 0.6, 1.0 micromol/L SPSODN for 48 hours were 74.8%, 74.5%, 67.9% respectively. Telomerase activity of K562 cells could not be inhibited by 0.2 and 0.6 micromol/L SPSODN. After culturing for 48 hours, the cell apoptosis rates of K562 in 0.6 micromol/L ASPSODN, 0.6 micromol/L SPSODN, liposome control and blank control groups were (4.82+/-0.39)%, (1.83+/-0.34)%, 1.84+/-1.04)%, (1.07+/-0.74)% respectively. There was difference between ASPSODN and SPSODN groups (p<0.05), but the significant difference was found in ASPSODN group as compared with liposome control and blank control (p<0.01). It is concluded that the ASPSODN targeting hTERT can specifically inhibit the expression of hTERT mRNA in K562 cells and significantly suppress the telomerase activity of K562 cells at 0.6 micromol/L, which inhibitory time is short. The ASPSODN at high concentration (1.0 micromol/L) shows definite cytotoxicity. 0.6 micromol/L of ASPSODN significantly induces cell apoptosis, while no such effect was seen in SPSODN group.","['Ying, Xiao-Yang', 'Fang, Mei-Yun', 'Wang, Yi']","['Ying XY', 'Fang MY', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Hematology, The Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, Dalian 116001, Liaoning Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/03/05 09:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2008)01-0048-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Feb;16(1):48-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML-M(2b) is characterized by the non-random chromosome translocation t (8; 21) (q22; q22), through which AML1 (acute myeloid leukemia 1) gene on chromosome 21 is fused with ETO (eight twenty-one) gene on chromosome 8, coding correspondent AML1-ETO fusion protein, which plays a crucial role in the leukemogenesis of AML-M(2b). The AML-M(2b) cell line Kasumi-1 cells were used as an in vitro model. The influences of 8-CPT-cAMP on the proliferation and differentiation of Kasumi-1 cells were evaluated according to cellular morphology, changes in cell surface antigen and cell cycle, as well as nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) assay. Meanwhile, semi-quantity RT-PCR and Western blot assay were used to detect the degradation of AML1-ETO fusion protein in Kasumi-1 cells before and after the treatment. The results showed that 8-CPT-cAMP (200 micromol/L) could significantly inhibit cell growth and induce differentiation of Kasumi-1 cells. However, it must be pointed out that 8-CPT-cAMP-induced differentiation in Kasumi-1 is not a typical terminal differentiation. Furthermore, 8-CPT-cAMP exerted little influence on the expression of AML1-ETO fusion gene and its product in Kasumi-1 cells. In conclusion, the 8-CPT-cAMP induced differentiation in Kasumi-1 cells. This results may provide experimental and theoretical basis for the breakthrough of differentiation-induced therapy extended to another leukemia.","['Zhu, Qi', 'Hu, Jun-Pei', 'Jia, Pei-Min', 'Wang, Zhen-Yi', 'Tong, Jian-Hua']","['Zhu Q', 'Hu JP', 'Jia PM', 'Wang ZY', 'Tong JH']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical College, Shanghai 200011, China. zhuqi70@hotmail.com']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""41941-66-6 (8-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)cyclic-3',5'-AMP)"", 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Thionucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/03/05 09:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2008)01-0044-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Feb;16(1):44-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these host-encoded restriction factors, the APOBEC3 (A3; apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide 3) proteins are potent inhibitors of retroviruses and retrotransposons. While primates encode seven of these genes (A3A to A3H), rodents carry only a single A3 gene. RESULTS: Here we identified and characterized several A3 genes in the genome of domestic cat (Felis catus) by analyzing the genomic A3 locus. The cat genome presents one A3H gene and three very similar A3C genes (a-c), probably generated after two consecutive gene duplications. In addition to these four one-domain A3 proteins, a fifth A3, designated A3CH, is expressed by read-through alternative splicing. Specific feline A3 proteins selectively inactivated only defined genera of feline retroviruses: Bet-deficient feline foamy virus was mainly inactivated by feA3Ca, feA3Cb, and feA3Cc, while feA3H and feA3CH were only weakly active. The infectivity of Vif-deficient feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus was reduced only by feA3H and feA3CH, but not by any of the feA3Cs. Within Felidae, A3C sequences show significant adaptive selection, but unexpectedly, the A3H sequences present more sites that are under purifying selection. CONCLUSION: Our data support a complex evolutionary history of expansion, divergence, selection and individual extinction of antiviral A3 genes that parallels the early evolution of Placentalia, becoming more intricate in taxa in which the arms race between host and retroviruses is harsher.","['Munk, Carsten', 'Beck, Thomas', 'Zielonka, Jorg', 'Hotz-Wagenblatt, Agnes', 'Chareza, Sarah', 'Battenberg, Marion', 'Thielebein, Jens', 'Cichutek, Klaus', 'Bravo, Ignacio G', ""O'Brien, Stephen J"", 'Lochelt, Martin', 'Yuhki, Naoya']","['Munk C', 'Beck T', 'Zielonka J', 'Hotz-Wagenblatt A', 'Chareza S', 'Battenberg M', 'Thielebein J', 'Cichutek K', 'Bravo IG', ""O'Brien SJ"", 'Lochelt M', 'Yuhki N']","['Division of Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 63225 Langen, Germany. mueca@pei.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080303,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,['EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)'],IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats/metabolism/virology', 'Cytosine Deaminase/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Retroviridae/physiology', 'Virus Replication']",2008/03/05 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['gb-2008-9-3-r48 [pii]', '10.1186/gb-2008-9-3-r48 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Biol. 2008;9(3):R48. doi: 10.1186/gb-2008-9-3-r48.

METHODS: A total of 245 survivors (78% of those invited) who were 9.4-16.5 years post-diagnosis completed surveys that inquired about current HRQL, economic, spiritual, physical and psychosocial concerns, and health-oriented behaviors (e.g. smoking, exercise, and supplement use). A regression model was developed to examine factors related to global HRQL across all domains. RESULTS: The regression model revealed that decreased energy levels (odds ratio (OR)=1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.07), having heart disease (OR=5.01, 95% CI: 1.39, 18.1), having two or more co-morbidities (OR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.10, 5.19), and lower social support (OR=1.03, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.05) were associated with lower global HRQL. Factors related to psychological, spiritual, and economic domains were not predictive of global HRQL. Regarding lifestyle changes, some women reported engaging in health-oriented behaviors since their cancer diagnosis, such as improving eating habits (54%), increasing exercise (32%), and reducing/quitting smoking (20%). The most prevalent problems reported by women at follow-up were menopausal symptoms (64%), such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness, osteoporosis (25%), and lymphedema (23%). CONCLUSION: Suggestions are provided to target interventions, such as provider-based strategies, in order to improve HRQL in long-term breast cancer survivors.","['Paskett, Electra D', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Day, Jeannette M', 'Stark, Nancy N', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Grubbs, Stephen S', 'Pavy, Michael D', 'Shapiro, Charles L', 'List, Marcy A', 'Hensley, Martee L', 'Naughton, Michelle A', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Habin, Karleen R', 'Fleming, Gini F', 'Bittoni, Marisa A']","['Paskett ED', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Day JM', 'Stark NN', 'Winer EP', 'Grubbs SS', 'Pavy MD', 'Shapiro CL', 'List MA', 'Hensley ML', 'Naughton MA', 'Kornblith AB', 'Habin KR', 'Fleming GF', 'Bittoni MA']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210-1240, USA. electra.paskett@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*psychology/surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Climacteric/psychology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sick Role', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2008/03/05 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.1329 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2008 Nov;17(11):1108-20. doi: 10.1002/pon.1329.,,,10.1002/pon.1329 [doi],PMC3930158,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,"['(c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AG16602/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS551248'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: Methylation status was analyzed in 127 patients with histologically confirmed MDS and 26 reactive controls. We employed Pyrosequencing, Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) and a realtime PCR-based quantitative assay. RESULTS: We detected an increase of methylation level of LINE-1 sequences using pyrosequencing and an increase of methylation in the HpaII recognition site employing LUMA during the progression of MDS. Methylation sensitive quantitative PCR showed no statistically significant differences, only a trend. CONCLUSIONS: LINE-1 and methylation sensitive cleavage of DNA can act as a surrogatmarker for global DNA methylation. The genome wide hypermethylation of MDS is a distinct feature of this disease. It discriminates MDS from other neoplasia and may explains the success of hypomethylation inducing reagents like azadeoxycytidine in MDS therapy.","['Romermann, D', 'Hasemeier, B', 'Metzig, K', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Langer, F', 'Kreipe, H', 'Lehmann, U']","['Romermann D', 'Hasemeier B', 'Metzig K', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Langer F', 'Kreipe H', 'Lehmann U']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol,Verhandlungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Pathologie,7503704,,IM,"['*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",2008/03/05 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol. 2007;91:338-42.,,Methylierungszustand von LINE-1-Sequenzen bei Patienten mit MDS oder sekundarer AML.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, rising insights into molecular pathogenesis of human diseases strengthen the attempt of pathologists to define and to detect underlying defects beyond the microscope. Since discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia as the first specific molecular abnormality ever detected in a human neoplasia the gain of knowledge of molecular pathomechanisms in Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) CMPD was rather sparse. A decisive breakthrough in Ph CMPD was the finding of JAK2 (V617F) derived from a somatic point mutation in the majority of patients with polycythemia vera (P.vera) and half of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). It therefore can not be overestimated that detection of JAK2 (V617F) in a suspective myeloproliferation now enables a clearcut discrimination of a true Ph CMPD from a reactive state, e.g. P.vera from reactive erythrocytosis. Interestingly, a basic principle of molecular defects demonstrable in CMPD and related disorders seems to be the involvement of genes with kinase activities. Some of those genes will be discussed in more detail. In primary MDS, karyotyping via classical cytogenetics is the predominant molecular approach to estimate prognosis, e.g. -Y, del(5q) and del(20q) represent favourable anomalies. Indeed, in 5q- syndromes karyotyping enables definite subtyping and allows clinicians and patients to expect a good prognosis. Until now, dozens of molecular abnormalities such as mutations in AML1, FLT3 and Ras as well as epigenetic alterations of genes have been identified to various degrees in MDS subtypes. Some of them seem to be involved in disease initiation (""master event"") and others might indicate disease progression. However, even though useful for further dissection of molecular pathomechanisms the majority of aberrations currently does not serve as potent markers in the daily routine. Nevertheless, in CMPD and MDS the importance of molecular analyses for diagnosis, estimation of prognosis, and disease monitoring will further increase in a foreseeable period of time.","['Bock, O']",['Bock O'],"['Institut fur Pathologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol,Verhandlungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Pathologie,7503704,,IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*pathology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/03/05 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2008/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol. 2007;91:140-53.,,Molekulare Diagnose chronischer myeloproliferativer Erkrankungen und myelodysplastischer Syndrome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ephrin-B activity is deregulated in various nonlymphoid malignancies; however, their precise role in cancer has only started to be addressed. We show here that ephrin-B1, a member of the ephrin-B group, is expressed in pediatric T-cell leukemias, including leukemia cell line Jurkat. Treatment of Jurkat cells with ephrin-B-stimulating EphB3 enhances ephrin-B1 phosphorylation and induces its relocalization into lipid rafts. These events are mediated by the T lineage-specific kinase, Lck, as ephrin-B1 phosphorylation and lipid raft association are blocked in the Lck-deficient clone of Jurkat, JCAM1.6. Ephrin-B1 also induces colocalization of the CrkL and Rac1 cytoskeleton regulators and initiates in leukemic cells a strong repulsive response. The absence of Lck blocks ephrin-B1-induced signaling and repulsion, confirming the essential role for Lck in ephrin-B1-mediated responses. This shows a new role for ephrin-B1 in the regulation of leukemic cells through the Lck-dependent Rac1 colocalization with its signaling partner, CrkL, in lipid rafts. In agreement with its repulsive action, ephrin-B1 seems to support metastatic properties of leukemic cells, as suppression of ephrin-B1 signaling inhibits their invasiveness. Because ephrin-B1-activating EphB proteins are ubiquitously expressed, our findings suggest that ephrin-B1 is likely to play an important role in the regulation of malignant T lymphocytes through the control of lipid-raft-associated signaling, adhesion, and invasive activity, and therefore may represent a novel target for cancer treatment.","['Jiang, Guangping', 'Freywald, Tanya', 'Webster, Jarret', 'Kozan, Daniel', 'Geyer, Ron', 'DeCoteau, John', 'Narendran, Aru', 'Freywald, Andrew']","['Jiang G', 'Freywald T', 'Webster J', 'Kozan D', 'Geyer R', 'DeCoteau J', 'Narendran A', 'Freywald A']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Regina, Regina, SK, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Ephrin-B1)', '0 (Ephrin-B3)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Child', 'Ephrin-B1/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ephrin-B3/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*enzymology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', '*Signal Transduction', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/04/10 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/2/291 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0047 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2008 Feb;6(2):291-305. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0047.,,,10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0047 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of oxygen stabilizes HIF-1, which in turn modulates the gene expression pattern to adapt cells to the hypoxic environment. Activation of HIF-1 is also detected in most solid tumors and supports tumor growth through the expression of target genes that are involved in processes like cell proliferation, energy metabolism, and oxygen delivery. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a chromatin-associated protein, which was shown to regulate transcription. Here we report that chronic myelogenous leukemia cells expressing small interfering RNA against PARP1, which were injected into wild-type mice expressing PARP1, showed tumor growth with increased levels of necrosis, limited vascularization, and reduced expression of GLUT-1. Of note, PARP1-deficient cells showed a reduced HIF-1 transcriptional activation that was dependent on PARP1 enzymatic activity. PARP1 neither influenced binding of HIF-1 to its hypoxic response element nor changed HIF-1alpha protein levels in hypoxic cells. However, PARP1 formed a complex with HIF-1alpha through direct protein interaction and coactivated HIF-1alpha-dependent gene expression. These findings provide convincing evidence that wild-type mice expressing PARP1 cannot compensate for the loss of PARP1 in tumor cells and strengthen the importance of the role of PARP1 as a transcriptional coactivator of HIF-1-dependent gene expression during tumor progression.","['Elser, Michael', 'Borsig, Lubor', 'Hassa, Paul O', 'Erener, Suheda', 'Messner, Simon', 'Valovka, Taras', 'Keller, Stephan', 'Gassmann, Max', 'Hottiger, Michael O']","['Elser M', 'Borsig L', 'Hassa PO', 'Erener S', 'Messner S', 'Valovka T', 'Keller S', 'Gassmann M', 'Hottiger MO']","['Institute of Veterinary Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Lung/cytology/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/*genetics/*pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/04/10 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/2/282 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0377 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2008 Feb;6(2):282-90. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0377.,,,10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0377 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 5 human Fc receptor-like molecules (FCRL1-5) have tyrosine-based immunoregulatory potential and are expressed by B-lineage subpopulations. To determine their prognostic potential in CLL, FCRL expression was compared with IGHV mutation status, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, and clinical features from 107 patients. FCRL1, FCRL2, FCRL3, and FCRL5 were found at markedly higher levels on CLL cells bearing mutated IGHV genes than on unmutated CLL cells or CD19(+) polyclonal B lymphocytes. Univariate comparisons found that similar to CD38 and ZAP-70, FCRL expression was strongly associated with IGHV mutation status; however, only FCRL2 maintained independent predictive value by multivariate logistic analysis. Strikingly, FCRL2 demonstrated 94.4% concordance with IGHV mutation compared with 76.6% for CD38 and 80.4% for ZAP-70. Compared with other indicators, FCRL2 was also superior at predicting the time to first therapy; the median treatment-free interval was 15.5 years for patients with high FCRL2 expression compared with 3.75 years for FCRL2-low patients.

A distinction should be made between a protective limp, to avoid painful weight bearing, and an equilibration limp, which corresponds to an adaptation to a disturbance of muscular activity with a neuromuscular or osteoarticular origin. Etiological analysis of a protective limp is essentially based on the history and examination. Further radiological or biochemical investigations contribute to the diagnostic process and are essential in limps of recent onset. Broadly speaking, in children aged between one and two years, the main etiological hypothesis, in terms of frequency and potential seriousness, is osteoarticular infection, although fractures are also common. In children aged between three and eight years, osteoarticular infection should be sought as a priority. The diagnosis of acute transient synovitis (irritable hip) should only be made after excluding other conditions including benign bone tumours (such as ostioid osteoma), malignant tumours, inflammatory monoarthritis, primary osteochondritis of the hip, trauma with or without fracture, apophysitis, leukemia, etc. The diagnosis of acute transient synovitis should be questioned if the condition persists for more than seven days. After the age of nine years, the diagnosis that is important not to miss is proximal femoral epiphysiolysis, because this condition can have serious implications for the future function of the hip. The other diagnoses already cited remain possibilities. Finally, a psychogenic aetiology, tendinitis, or sprain should not be considered in children, and they risk delaying the diagnosis of a potentially serious condition. The aetiology of an equilibration limp is based on a precise clinical examination, aimed at detecting orthopedic or neurological pathology, which will direct further investigations.","['Wicart, P', 'Seringe, R']","['Wicart P', 'Seringe R']","['Hopital Saint-Vincent de Paul, universite Rene-Descartes, 82, avenue Denfert-Rochereau, Paris-V, 75014 Paris, France. p.wicart@svp.aphp.fr']",['fre'],['Journal Article'],20080307,France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hip Joint/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Movement Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Osteochondritis/diagnostic imaging', 'Radiography', 'Sprains and Strains/complications', 'Tendinopathy/complications']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2007/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0929-693X(07)00641-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcped.2007.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 2008 Mar;15(3):340-8. doi: 10.1016/j.arcped.2007.12.009.
