In normal individuals, the largest and most intense deposits of reaction product was seen in a unique cytoplasmic granule population termed 'phosphasomes'. Lighter deposits were seen on nuclear membranes, some intracytoplasmic membranes lining vacuoles and granules and occasionally in focal patches on the internal surface of the plasma membrane. In cells isolated from women in the third trimester of pregnancy, activity was found in the same intracellular sites but there were, on average, more alkaline phosphatase-containing granules per cell than in the cells from non-pregnant individuals. Neutrophils from pregnant women were also characterized by the presence of large deposits of reaction product on the external surface of the plasma membrane (extramembranous). This activity had properties characteristic of the placental isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase, found in serum during pregnancy. Neutrophils from patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia, showing normal mature morphology, contained significant amounts of granule reaction product but there were fewer phosphasomes per cell than in normal individuals. In morphologically immature cells, reaction product was present in nuclear membranes, endoplasmic reticulum and large granules.

In Group B, Fr III showed an absolute increase in cluster growth. Fr IV did not show cluster growth and addition of Fr IV to Fr III suppressed growth.

Kinetic studies showed that the activity was optimal at pH 6.8, was stimulated by Mn2+ and Co2+, and inhibited by sodium sulphite and zinc chloride. The apparent Km of the enzyme for histone phosphate was 0.89 mumol/l. Neutrophils were homogenized in isotonic sucrose and, after low speed centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to analytical subcellular fractionation. Gradient fractions were assayed for principal marker enzymes and for histone phosphate phosphatase. Histone phosphate phosphatase activity was shown to be solely located to the cytosol. No activity was detected in the alkaline phosphatase-containing granules. Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of control subjects, patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia and women in the third trimester of pregnancy. The specific activity (milliunits/mg protein) of histone phosphate phosphatase was significantly reduced in patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia compared to control values but this decrease was considerably less than that found for alkaline phosphatase. The possible implication of the reduced histone phosphatase activity in leukaemia neutrophils is discussed. There was no significant change in histone phosphate phosphatase in leucocytes from pregnant women. These results, together with the subcellular fractionation experiments and inhibitor studies, strongly indicate that histone phosphate phosphatase is not attributable to neutrophil alkaline phosphatase.","['Smith, G P', 'Peters, T J']","['Smith GP', 'Peters TJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (Histones)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/*blood', 'Female', 'Histones/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Phosphorylation', '*Pregnancy', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology']",,1981/03/19 00:00,1981/03/19 00:01,['1981/03/19 00:00'],"['1981/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-8981(81)90415-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-8981(81)90415-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 1981 Mar 19;111(1):17-25. doi: 10.1016/0009-8981(81)90415-0.,,,,,,

Both forms of enzyme were found in normal tissues, but the malignant blast cells showed only one G6PD, indicating that the disease was clonal at the time of testing. The observations that normal erythroid cells were present in two young patients at diagnosis and relapse indicate that the clone suppressed expression of normal granulopoiesis but did not prevent normal erythroid differentiation. In contrast to this situation, in two elderly patients, the disease involved stem cells multipotent for granulocytes, red cells, and platelets. These results indicate that acute nonlymphocytic leukemia is heterogeneous. In some patients, the disease is expressed in cells with differentiation restricted to the granulocyte-monocyte pathway; in others, it involves stem cells capable of differentiating to granulocytes-monocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes. This heterogeneity may reflect differences in causation and could have prognostic and therapeutic importance.","['Fialkow, P J', 'Singer, J W', 'Adamson, J W', 'Vaidya, K', 'Dow, L W', 'Ochs, J', 'Moohr, J W']","['Fialkow PJ', 'Singer JW', 'Adamson JW', 'Vaidya K', 'Dow LW', 'Ochs J', 'Moohr JW']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/enzymology']",,1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63276-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Jun;57(6):1068-73.,"['CA 16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 15253/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,

Eventually each line ceased production of both infectious viruses but retained its tumorigenic potential in syngeneic hosts. Virus-producer and -nonproducer clones of these cell lines were examined for expression of proteins encoded by the SFFV or FMuLV genomes. Lysates of labeled cells were treated with various antiviral sera, and the precipitates were examined by gel electrophoresis. Expression of the FMuLV env gene-encoded precursor protein, gPr84env, was observed in all producer and most nonproducer clones, but the FMuLV gag and pol gene products, Pr65gag and Pr200gag-pol, were uniformly undetectable in nonproducer clones. All HFL/d and HFL/b clones expressed appreciable amounts of the SFFV-encoded envelope protein, gp52, including one exceptional clone which had ceased to express any FMuLV-encoded proteins. The molecular weight of this SFFV-encoded envelope protein was consistently smaller in all HFL/b clones than in HFL/d clones, regardless of their producer or nonproducer status. The virus-nonproducer phenotype thus appears to be due to shutdown of expression of the 5' portion of the FMuLV genome in two independent cell lines.","['Anand, R', 'Lilly, F', 'Ruscetti, S']","['Anand R', 'Lilly F', 'Ruscetti S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Rats', 'Viral Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology']",PMC171053,1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.37.2.654-660.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Feb;37(2):654-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.37.2.654-660.1981.,"['09060/PHS HHS/United States', '09173.

Jolicoeur and E. Rassart, J. Virol. 33:183-195, 1980). To determine the fate of linear viral DNA made in resistant cells we performed pulse-chase experiments, labeling viral DNA with 5-bromodeoxyuridine and following it with a thymidine chase. 5-Bromodeoxyuridine-labeled viral DNA (HH) recovered by banding on cesium chloride gradients was sedimented on neutral sucrose density gradients or separated by the agarose gel-DNA transfer procedure and detected by hybridization with complementary DNA. Levels of linear viral DNA made in Fv-1(b/b) (JLS-V9 and SIM.R) and Fv-1(n/n) (NIH/3T3 and SIM) cells were found to decrease during the chase period at about the same rate in permissive and nonpermissive conditions, indicating that linear viral DNA is not specifically degraded in Fv-1 resistant cells. Levels of the two species of closed circular viral DNA made in Fv-1 permissive cells increased relative to the levels of linear DNA during the chase period. This confirmed the precursor-product relationship between linear DNA and the two species of circular DNA. In Fv-1 resistant cells, this apparent conversion of linear viral DNA into circular forms was not seen, and no supercoiled viral DNA could be detected. To determine whether the transport of linear viral DNA from the cytoplasm into the nucleus was prevented by the Fv-1 gene product, SIM.R cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and viral DNA was detected in each fraction by the agarose gel-DNA transfer procedure. Levels of linear viral DNA were nearly identical in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of permissive or resistant cells. Circular viral DNA could be detected in the nuclear fraction of permissive cells, but not in that of resistant cells. A pulse-chase experiment was also performed with SIM.R cells. During the thymidine chase period, linear viral DNA was seen to accumulate in nuclei of both permissive and resistant cells, whereas supercoiled viral DNA accumulated only in nuclei of permissive cells. These results indicate that the Fv-1 gene product does not interfere with the transport of linear viral DNA into the nucleus. Our data also suggest that the Fv-1 restriction does not operate through a degradation process. Therefore, the Fv-1 gene product could either block the circularization of linear viral DNA directly or promote the synthesis of a faulty linear viral DNA whose defect (yet undetected) would prevent its circularization.","['Jolicoeur, P', 'Rassart, E']","['Jolicoeur P', 'Rassart E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Circular/metabolism', 'DNA, Superhelical/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/growth & development', 'Genes', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Virus Replication']",PMC171048,1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.37.2.609-619.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Feb;37(2):609-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.37.2.609-619.1981.,,,,,,

The appearance of differentiated cells in cultures exposed to BADP occurred 18 to 20 hours earlier than in those treated with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a standard inducer of differentiation in this system. Studies with [3H]BADP indicated the occurrence of relatively rapid association of the inducer with cells, and subsequent linear accumulation. Fractionation of cellular components and measurement of radioactivity from BADP therein demonstrated that this agent preferentially associates with a fraction enriched for plasma membrane. In addition, [3H]BADP was capable of binding to the plasma membrane-enriched fraction isolated from murine erythroleukemia cells as measured by gel filtration. These findings support the concept that interaction of inducers of murine erythroleukemia differentiation such as BADP with components of the surface membrane may be important in the cascade of events that lead to the erythroid maturation of these leukemic cells.","['Tsiftsoglou, A S', 'Bhargava, K K', 'Rittmann, L S', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Tsiftsoglou AS', 'Bhargava KK', 'Rittmann LS', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Diamines)', '3073-58-3 (bis-(acetyl)diaminopentane)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Diamines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice']",,1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041060311 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1981 Mar;106(3):419-24. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041060311.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CM-53824/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The tumour developed in 100 per cent of cases, producing metastases in some of the animals and resulting in death in three cases.

The skeletal metastases had the characteristics of osteosarcoma, while those in the lymph glands and lungs had those of an undifferentiated sarcoma. The writers also took into consideration a series of previous trial performed at the Institute of Clinical Orthopaedics of the University of Milan, involving a total of 740 mice, in arriving at their final conclusion that MSV-M induces, in the mouse, an osteosarcoma similar to spontaneous osteosarcoma in man, capable of producing osteoid tissue, of giving rise to metastases, and of causing the death of the animal.","['Peretti, G', 'Torri, G', 'Marinoni, E C', 'Facchini, R', 'Scaglione, P', 'Mantovani, G']","['Peretti G', 'Torri G', 'Marinoni EC', 'Facchini R', 'Scaglione P', 'Mantovani G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Ital J Orthop Traumatol,Italian journal of orthopaedics and traumatology,7511480,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/microbiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*isolation & purification', 'Osteosarcoma/microbiology/*pathology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/microbiology/pathology', 'Xeroradiography']",,1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ital J Orthop Traumatol. 1980 Aug;6(2):255-68.,,,,,,

Additional chromosome abnormalities, besides the Ph1 or unusual Ph2-translocations, were found in three out of twelve cases in the chronic phase (CP), in two of four cases entering the blastic phase (BP), and in all four cases in the BP during the study. The growth pattern and SCE incidence in these cases were similar to those in cases in the BP during the study. The growth pattern and SCE incidence in these cases were similar to those in cases with a Ph1 as the sole abnormality. Ph1-positive CML cells undergoing second or more generations predominated in the marrow in the CP, whereas in the active stage of the CP and in the BP the CML marrow cells tended to go through only one generation. There were no clear correlations between the SCE incidence and the state of the CML. However, a marked increase in the SCE frequency was observed in some cases after chemotherapy, irrespective of the state of the disease. The results indicate that the type of Ph1-translocation and/or the presence of additional karyotypic abnormalities hardly affect the growth pattern and SCE incidence in the Ph1-positive CML cells, and that the in vitro BrdU-labelling methods may have a potential for detecting chemotherapeutic effects in CML patients and in the 'staging' of the clinical course of such patients.","['Abe, S', 'Kakati, S', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Abe S', 'Kakati S', 'Sandberg AA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytobios,Cytobios,0207227,,IM,"['Blood Cells/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Cell Division', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', '*Crossing Over, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cytobios. 1980;28(111-112):137-49.,,,,,,

The production of the inhibitory factor(s) by M1 cells incubated with retinoic acid was inhibited by a low concentrations (5--10 ng/ml) of actinomycin D.

We questioned whether the induction process was associated with changes in lipid synthesis. With [14C]acetate, a precursor for all cell lipids, a decrease in sterol and phospholipid synthesis (but not triglyceride synthesis) was observed within the first 5 hr after exposure to inducer, a time prior to inhibition of DNA synthesis or cessation of cell growth. Similarly, the membrane fraction of HL-60 cells exhibited decreased incorporation of newly synthesized lipid. Synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from choline as well as from the transmethylation of membrane phosphatidylethanolamine was also inhibited by myeloid inducers. In contrast, neither sterol nor phospholipid degradation was stimulated under these conditions. Both cholesterol and lanosterol were synthesized by growing HL-60 cells, but cholesterol esters were not. Synthesis of sterols was subject to feedback inhibition by cholesterol in the medium, but such feedback inhibition did not affect differentiation in the presence of myeloid inducers and did not alter the effect of myeloid inducers on phospholipid synthesis. Removal of dimethyl sulfoxide at 16 hr permitted a return to normal lipid synthesis and prevented differentiation, whereas removal of dimethyl sulfoxide at 40 hr was followed by continued inhibition of lipid synthesis and progressive differentiation. These studies demonstrate that the induction of myeloid differentiation is associated with an early inhibition of the synthesis of those lipids which are normally a part of cell membranes.","['Cooper, R A', 'Ip, S H', 'Cassileth, P A', 'Kuo, A L']","['Cooper RA', 'Ip SH', 'Cassileth PA', 'Kuo AL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Sterols)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetates/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Choline/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/*biosynthesis', 'Sterols/*biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 May;41(5):1847-52.,"['AM 15441/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

An attempt to correlate receptor levels with clinical responsiveness demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptor determination might be of value in patients with lymphoid malignancies but probably not in patients with other leukemias.","['Ho, A D', 'Hunstein, W', 'Schmid, W']","['Ho AD', 'Hunstein W', 'Schmid W']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*analysis', 'Receptors, Steroid/*analysis']",,1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01026388 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1981 Mar;42(3):183-90. doi: 10.1007/BF01026388.,,,,,,

These features include: (1) lymphoid blast crisis, determined by morphology and immunological marker analysis; (2) dual blast cell populations that can be distinguished both morphologically and by immunological markers; (3) clonal evolution, as shown by the emergence of chromosome markers and in one of the cell lines a change in membrane phenotype. These changes were apparently associated with the emergence of a relatively drug resistant subclone of leukaemic cells. This study demonstrates that the lymphoid blast crisis of CGL, and its sequelae, can occur in Ph1- cases. It is similar in respect to morphology, enzyme, and membrane markers and responsiveness to vincristine and prednisolone therapy to the lymphoid blast crisis seen in Ph1+ CGL. This suggests that the Philadelphia chromosome is a clonal marker only, and its presence is not directly related to the subsequent clinical course of the disease.","['Hughes, A', 'McVerry, B A', 'Walker, H', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Janossy, G']","['Hughes A', 'McVerry BA', 'Walker H', 'Bradstock KF', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Janossy G']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",,1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb02685.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 Apr;47(4):563-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb02685.x.,,,,,,

The appearance of subsequent malignancies may be related to a combination of therapy-induced immunosuppression, a direct carcinogenic effect resulting from therapy, and/or constitutional factors.

The authors emphasize that no lesions occurred in the hematopoietic organs during the course of the disease, which clearly differentiates this case from the parotid lesions seen fairly frequently in blood diseases and Gougerot-Sjogren syndromes complicated by lymphoid leukemia.","['Beziat, J L', 'Souteyrand, P', 'Freidel, M', 'Perrot, H', 'Bouvier, R', 'Cros, P', 'Dumas, P']","['Beziat JL', 'Souteyrand P', 'Freidel M', 'Perrot H', 'Bouvier R', 'Cros P', 'Dumas P']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Stomatol Chir Maxillofac,Revue de stomatologie et de chirurgie maxillo-faciale,0201010,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Parotid Gland/*pathology', 'Parotid Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Skin/pathology']",,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Stomatol Chir Maxillofac. 1981;82(1):7-10.,,Parotidomegalie bilaterale revelatrice d'un lymphome malin.,,,,

Mutation rates and properties of mutants.,187-99,Spontaneous mutation at the thymidine-kinase locus in clone 707 of the Friend cell line has been examined. The rate of mutation in BrdU resistance was found to be 2.6 x 10(-6) cell-1 generation-1. The rate of reversion to HAT resistance was found to vary from 1.1 x 10(-7) to 2.85 x 10(-6) cell-1 generation-1 in 4 BrdU-resistant clones. Of 14 mutant clones assayed for thymidine-kinase activity only one had greater than 13% the activity of wild-type cells. Fluctuation analysis showed that mutations occurred spontaneously and were not induced by the selective agent. The mutation rate at the thymidine-kinase locus is several orders of magnitude greater than those reported for several other cells lines. There does not appear to be a general genetic instability in this cell line as the mutation rate at the HGPRT locus is similar to those found in other established cell lines. It is suggested that the high forward mutation rate at the thymidine-kinase locus may be due to only one functional thymidine-kinase allele being present in cells of this clone.,"['McKenna, P G', 'Hickey, I']","['McKenna PG', 'Hickey I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/*enzymology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0027-5107(81)90187-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(81)90187-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1981 Jan;80(1):187-99. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(81)90187-1.,,,,,,

In a further experiment with intact infected chicks, artificial metastasis at various ages by surgical bursectomy and inoculation of bursa cells into the bloodstream of the host did not shorten the latency period.

Mortalities from major types of cancer for farmers and nonfarmers were compared by means of proportionate mortality ratios (PMR). The combined mortality rate for all types of cancer was significantly lower for farmers (PMR = 0.97), due primarily to the significantly lower rates for smoking-related cancers: lung, PMR = 0.78; esophagus, PMR = 0.74; mouth other than lip, PMR = 0.82; and other respiratory cancers, PMR = 0.65. However, the mortality rates for the following cancers were significantly higher for farmers: lip, PMR = 1.62; stomach, PMR = 1.14; leukemia, PMR = 1.10; lymphatic, PMR = 1.14; multiple myeloma, PMR = 1.27; and prostate, PMR = 1.10.

This was demonstrated by measuring association of labeled drug with cells and by assaying the antimetabolic effect of DDMP on incorporation of deoxyuridine into DNA. Uptake of both aqueous and lipid-soluble antifolates was substantially reduced in the human lymphoblastoid cell line WIL-2 when Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) was substituted for a basal salts solution containing glucose [DDMP approximatley 50%, methotrexate (MTX) approximately 30%]. Uptake of DDMP, however, was inhibited by the amino acid fraction of EMEM or glutamine alone, whereas MTX uptake was unaffected by amino acids. Further studies with human leukemia cells showed that DDMP was only about 25% as effective an inhibitor of deoxyuridine incorporation in autologous human plasma when compared to its inhibitory effect in RPMI-1640 medium MTX inhibition of deoxyuridine incorporation in these cells was essentially unaffected by substitution of autologous human plasma for RPMI-1640 medium. Replacing EMEM with pooled human plasma resulted in a 60-70% decrease in DDMP uptake but had only a marginal effect upon MTX uptake. Thus the choice of medium is important in studies of lipid-soluble antifolates such as DDMP that have a high affinity for cellular and medium lipoprotein components.","['Fyfe, M J', 'Sedwick, W D', 'Brown, O E', 'Laszlo, J']","['Fyfe MJ', 'Sedwick WD', 'Brown OE', 'Laszlo J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '2L9RKX796Q (metoprine)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'Z3614QOX8W (Pyrimethamine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*pharmacology', 'Blood', 'Cell Line', '*Culture Media', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*metabolism', 'Glutamine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Pyrimethamine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",,1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Mar;66(3):445-51.,"['CA08800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM67121/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of doxorubicin (adriamycin) (1-2 mg/kg/d, on day 10-12) resulted in reduced tumor growth and prolonged median survival to 95+ and 64 days, respectively. Higher dose doxorubicin (3-4 mg/kg/d, on day 10-12) caused early lethal toxicity. Autopsy data revealed a characteristic sarcomatous tumor producing osteoid. Gross pulmonary nodules appeared in 30% of both treated and untreated animals. Microscopic evaluation of lung tissue revealed anaplastic tumors without osteoid in as many as 90% of rats. Hepatosplenomegaly was usually present but microscopic sections of the spleen did not reveal tumor. Long bone metastases were increased in frequency in those animals receiving doxorubicin. Cell mediated immunity (CMI) to osteosarcoma cells by peripheral blood lymphocytes of tumor-bearing animals was detectable between days 21-48. This was bimodal with an early peak at day 21 (CMI = 56%) and a late peak at day 39 (CMI = 48%). CMI in rats given 1 mg/kg/d x 3d of doxorubicin was similar, with peak cytotoxicity (CMI = 61%) on day 26. Two mg/kg/d x 3d of doxorubicin did not significantly suppress either the early response (CMI = 50% on day 22) or the second peak (CMI = 38% and 50% on day 40 and 46, respectively). Thus, doxorubicin was effective in decreasing the growth of an MSV-M induced osteosarcoma and prolonging survival in the rat while usually failing to suppress CMI against rat osteosarcoma cells.","['Kempf, R A', 'Cebul, R D', 'Mitchell, M S']","['Kempf RA', 'Cebul RD', 'Mitchell MS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunopharmacol,Journal of immunopharmacology,7901853,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08923978009026409 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunopharmacol. 1980;2(4):509-25. doi: 10.3109/08923978009026409.,['CA 25765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

Washed platelets from 11 normal donors and 27 patients were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated ovalbumin-anti-ovalbumin complexes and examined by phase and fluorescence microscopy. Only 3.2+/-1% of the normal platelets stained, whereas 76+/-16% of the myeloproliferative platelets stained with the immune complex. The fluorescent staining was mediated by a platelet Fc receptor, as shown by the absence of platelet staining with immune complex containing antibody preincubated with Staphylococcal protein A to block the Fc region. In addition, no staining occurred with antigen or antibody alone or after preincubation of platelets with aggregated IgG. Platelets from normal or myeloproliferative donors did not stain with the immune complexes when the incubation was performed in plasma. The increased expression of Fc receptors on myeloproliferative platelets was corroborated by studies of [(14)C]serotonin release by immune complexes or aggregated IgG in 8 patients and 17 normal donors. Serotonin uptake was similar in both groups. Myeloproliferative platelets released significantly more serotonin than normal platelets at each concentration of immune complex or aggregated IgG; in addition, myeloproliferative platelets released serotonin in response to much smaller concentrations of immune complex or aggregated IgG. [(14)C]Serotonin release by myeloproliferative platelets was not increased above that of normal platelets when thrombin was used as the stimulus. The results were independent of patient age, sex, therapy, hematocrit, or platelet size. Interaction of circulating immune complexes with platelets bearing increased Fc receptors may contribute to the abnormal hemostasis associated with the myeloproliferative syndromes.","['Moore, A', 'Nachman, R L']","['Moore A', 'Nachman RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/blood', 'Thrombocytosis/immunology']",PMC370665,1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/jci110118 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1981 Apr;67(4):1064-71. doi: 10.1172/jci110118.,"['HL-07029/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-18828/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

There was substantial variation in the molecular structure of terminal transferase on denaturing polyacrylamide gels: (a) a protein that migrated as a single polypeptide with M(r) = 62,000 was isolated from two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and from MOLT-4 cells; (b) a protein that migrated as a single polypeptide with M(r) = 42,500 was isolated from two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; (c) a protein that migrated as a single polypeptide with M(r) = 42,500 was isolated from two patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis; (d) a protein that migrated as two non-identical subunits of M(r) = 27,000 and 10,000, respectively, was isolated from two additional patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. The subunit structure of d is characteristic of the homogeneous enzymes purified from human and calf thymus. Neutralizing and precipitating antibodies to terminal transferase from human lymphoblasts and calf thymus have been produced in rabbits and goats. Antisera directed against either human or calf antigens neutralize enzymatic activity and precipitate all forms of human terminal transferase. The multiple human forms give reactions of antigenic identity by immunodiffusion, but differ antigenically from the calf enzyme.

In an attempt to alter the fatal course of the disease in progressor animals, immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy of the osteosarcoma in F1 hybrid rats war carried out by injecting them with parentalor, third party, allogeneic lymphoid cells. Injection of parental spleen lymphocytes into F1 hybrids produced a transient graft versus host reaction (GVHR), and prolonged the survival of the animals when lymphocytes were injected three days before, seven days after and on the day of tumour induction. Injection of allogeneic, third party lymphoid cells produced no detectable GVHR and prolonged the survival of F1 hybrids with osteosarcoma only when injected on the day of tumour induction. The prolonged survival of the groups treated with parental lymphoid cells was a result of stimulation of the host's immunological mechanisms during a transient GVHR, whereas the prolongation of survival in the group given allogeneic cells was most likely the result of a direct action of the donor lymphocytes on tumour cells, and not connected to a GVHR.","['Czitrom, A A', 'Langer, F', 'Gross, A E', 'Urovitz, E P', 'Pritzker, K P']","['Czitrom AA', 'Langer F', 'Gross AE', 'Urovitz EP', 'Pritzker KP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int Orthop,International orthopaedics,7705431,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Culture Techniques', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Osteosarcoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred ACI', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Time Factors']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00268153 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Orthop. 1980;4(3):167-75. doi: 10.1007/BF00268153.,,,,,,

A number of leukemia cell lines in continuous culture were also subjected to the GR assay, and the results were correlated with the sensitivity of these cell lines to glucocorticoid steroids in vitro. The GR content of normal human lymphocytes amounted to 4,850 +/- 1,340 (mean +/- SD) receptors/cell. The mean equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the interaction of [3H]dexamethasone with the GR was 1.2 x 10(-8) M. Steroidal compounds with a known glucocorticoid potency effectively competed for the binding, whereas steroids devoid of glucocorticoid activity (e.g. estradiol-17 beta and testosterone) were ineffective. The GR content of the blast cells obtained from eight patients suffering from acute leukemia and four patients with a blast crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia was found to be highly variable (3,230-29,900 receptors/cell), while the lymphocytes of six patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia contained a rather stable GR content (2,930-5,120 receptors/cell), which was comparable with that of normal lymphocytes. GR was identified in all the 12 malignant continuous white cell lines studied. Large cells contained more GR than the smaller ones. There was no apparent correlation between the GR concentration and the sensitivity of the cells in vitro to glucocorticoids as judged by [3H]thymidine incorporation studies. Distribution of the surface markers in the leukemic cell lines did not relate to the GR concentration.

Of special importance is the association of consistent chromosome translocations with particular types of leukemia; this has long been recognized in CML, which is associated with the Ph1 chromosome, now identified as a 9;22 translocation. We now realize that the 8;21 translocation is seen in at least 10% of patients with AML (M2 marrow), and that the 15;17 translocation is present in at least 40% of patients with APL (M3 marrow). In addition to providing an important technique for more precise classification of myeloid leukemias, cyto-genetic analysis can be used in a general sense to predict possible response to therapy, and thus to predict survival. Although this information is not widely used at present, it may be that physicians would choose supportive therapy rather than aggressive chemotherapy in an individual older than 60 or 70 years of age who had only chromosomally abnormal leukemic cells. On the other hand, a younger patient with a normal karyotype might be identified during the initial therapy as one for whom bone marrow transplantation could be appropriate.","['Rowley, J D']",['Rowley JD'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Compr Ther,Comprehensive therapy,7605837,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Compr Ther. 1980 Jul;6(7):57-64.,,,,,,

Retinoic acid was the most potent inducer of lysosomal enzyme activities. The induction of lysozyme activity by retinoic acid was inhibited by treatment with puromycin. The retinoids did not induce phagocytic and locomotive activities or morphological changes in M1 cells, and they inhibited the induction of these differentiation-associated properties by various inducers without inhibiting cell growth. Retinoic acid was the most potent inhibitor of induction of these differentiation-associated properties. The inhibitory effect of retinoic acid was found to be reversible.

Thirty-five subclones have been isolated and tested for their ability to express various markers of blood and bone marrow cells. Upon dimethyl sulfoxide treatment, the cells differentiated along the erythroid pathway as shown by morphological evidence and by their increased synthesis of hemoglobin and spectrin. In addition, a high proportion of dimethyl sulfoxide-induced cells stained positive for specific esterase, a marker characteristic of granulocytic cells. Of these cells, about 20% stained positive for both hemoglobin-peroxidase and specific esterase. Analysis of the subclones showed that the expression of these markers for erythroid and leukopoietic differentiation was uncoordinated. Further dissection of expression was obtained by the use of two potent tumor promoters, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and phorbol-12,13-benzoate, which in general inhibited specific esterase more than hemoglobin peroxidase expression. Inhibition was related to the structure of the phorbol diester and was unrelated to toxicity. No evidence was found for other markers characteristic of different pathways of differentiation, such as Fc and C3 receptors, cell surface immunoglobulins, theta antigen, or the capacity to phagocytose inert particles. All cells stained positive for nonspecific esterase activity in both the presence and the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide. This staining was only partially fluoride sensitive. In unstimulated cultures, a few cells also reacted for myeloperoxidase, Sudan black staining and, very rarely, alkaline phosphatase staining. These findings support the view that 3BM-78 cells are leukemic cells which, despite a prevalent commitment to erythroid differentiation, retain the genetic determinants for some traits of leukopoietic differentiation. These traits may be expressed under suitable culture conditions.","['Fioritoni, G', 'Bertolini, L', 'Torlontano, G', 'Revoltella, R']","['Fioritoni G', 'Bertolini L', 'Torlontano G', 'Revoltella R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (chloroacetate esterase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetates/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology']",,1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Mar;40(3):866-72.,,,,,,

The blasts were tested with anti-i serum in cytotoxicity tests and with antisera to myeloblastic leukemia-associated antigens in immunofluorescence tests. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT) content of the blasts was also measured. Lymphoblasts react strongly with anti-i, do not react with anti-myeloblast serum, and have high levels of TDT; myeloblasts react weakly with anti-i, do not react with anti-myeloblast serum, and have very low levels of TDT. Of the 17 patients with acute undifferentiated leukemia, there were six with blasts which reacted like lymphoblasts, six with blasts which reacted like myeloblasts, and five with blasts bearing different combinations of these lymphoblastic and myeloblastic markers. Eight of the 11 patients with lymphoblastic or mixed lymphoblastic-myeloblastic markers, but only one of the six with myeloblastic markers, achieved complete or partial remission in response to therapy. Thus, in acute undifferentiated leukemia, classification of blasts with these markers may be of prognostic value.

CSA is generated by monocytes and lymphocytes. The estimation of the molecular weight of colony stimulating factors from both cell lines demonstrates a non-identity. All monocyte derived molecular weight fractions induce differentiation of myeloid stem cells into granulocytes and macrophages. Lymphocyte derived factors have identical biologic activity, with the exeption of one factor which promotes differentiation into eosinophilic granulocytes. Granulocytes release factors which inhibit the growth of myeloid stem cells. Blasts from patients with acute leukaemia do not generate significant amounts of colony stimulating activity, however, in four of nine cases investigated the production of inhibitors for normal stem cell growth is found. Blasts from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis may be capable of producing colony stimulating activity. Granulocytes from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in the chronic phase exhibit no measurable release of inhibitors of myeloid stem cells. In myeloid leukaemias the normal leukocyte population is entirely or partially replaced by leukaemic leukocytes; thus, the proliferation of leukaemic and normal haemopoietic cells is likely to occur under abnormal control.","['Hinterberger, W', 'Paukovits, W']","['Hinterberger W', 'Paukovits W']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",,1980/09/26 00:00,1980/09/26 00:01,['1980/09/26 00:00'],"['1980/09/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/26 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 1980 Sep 26;92(18):650-4.,,Untersuchungen uber zellulare und humorale Steuermechanismen der Myelopoese bei Normalpersonen und Patienten mit myeloischen Leukamien.,,,,

Successful transplantation of the blastoma cells into nude mice enabled extensive studies of the cell properties. The blastoma cells were double Ph1-positive cells which did not respond to human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and were similar to cells demonstrated in spleen and bone marrow at the terminal stage of the patient's illness. These observations clearly support the case for sequential studies of colony formation in vitro as a useful test for the early detection of disturbances in marrow function that may occur before generalized blastic transformation. Studies of the properties of the blastoma cells also provide some insight into possible mechanisms for the transformation event.","['Asano, S', 'Sato, N', 'Ueyama, Y', 'Mori, M', 'Sakurai, M', 'Tamaoki, K', 'Chiba, S', 'Imamura, Y', 'Kosaka, K']","['Asano S', 'Sato N', 'Ueyama Y', 'Mori M', 'Sakurai M', 'Tamaoki K', 'Chiba S', 'Imamura Y', 'Kosaka K']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice']",,1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1981.tb01397.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1980 Sep;25(3):251-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1981.tb01397.x.,,,,,,

Compared to 9 patients with acute bacterial infection and to 42 normal controls, patients with untreated AML exhibited deeply depressed monocyte cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity was reduced in each of the cytomorphological subgroups of AML. Patients attaining remission showed the same cytotoxicity as patients not attaining remission. During remission monocyte cytotoxicity increased significantly, but normal function was not achieved. Patients receiving chemotherapy alone exhibited the same defective cytotoxicity as patients receiving chemotherapy plus immunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum. The termination of maintenance chemotherapy after remission for 1 year did not normalize cytotoxicity. Also the cytotoxicity of normal monocytes was not affected by patient serum. It is suggested that the reduced monocyte cytotoxicity observed in AML is related to the leukaemic process. The lack of complete normalization during the remission may indicate the continuous presence of an intrinsic defect of monocytopoiesis.","['Kragballe, K', 'Ellegaard, J']","['Kragballe K', 'Ellegaard J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*immunology']",,1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1980 Aug;25(2):181-90.,,,,,,

Study of a case].,391-3,"Disseminated intravascular coagulation is relatively common as initial clinical presentation of certain myeloblastic leukemias, particularly acute promyelocytic leukemia, occurring less frequently in association with acute non-myeloid leukemias. The occurrence of such coagulopathy as presenting feature of a lymphoblastic leukemia is exceptional as demonstrated by the scarcity of reports in the literature and by the authors experience, having encountered only one case out of 86 consecutive patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The laboratory findings in this case are commented upon, and particular emphasis is made on the measurement of coagulation factors II, V, VII-X, and VIII, the study of fibrin formation and fibrinolysis, and the changes in these parameters brought about by therapy with heparin, coagulation factors (fibrinogen, platelets), and cytostatic drugs. The coagulation abnormalities were corrected once the blast population was destroyed by chemotherapy, with the exception of persisting fibrinopenia secondary to the corticosteroid treatment included in the chemotherapy protocol. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was manifested in this case by gingivorrhagia, ecchymosis and hematuria. The probable etiological role of lymphoblasts in the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation is discussed.","['Duran Suarez, J R', 'Junca Piera, J', 'Zuazu Nagore, J', 'Triginer Boixeda, J M']","['Duran Suarez JR', 'Junca Piera J', 'Zuazu Nagore J', 'Triginer Boixeda JM']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications/diagnosis']",,1980/11/25 00:00,1980/11/25 00:01,['1980/11/25 00:00'],"['1980/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1980 Nov 25;75(9):391-3.,,Coagulacion intravascular diseminada como forma de presentacion de leucosis linfoblastica.

These studies indicate that some early events associated with Friend cell differentiation, including an early change in 86Rb+ transport and a decrease in cell volume, still occur in the presence of TPA. However, several late events in the program of Friend cell differentiation, including the induction of heme synthesis and the loss of proliferative capacity, are inhibited by TPA. These effects of TPA can be reversed by hemin, which alone does not induce Friend cells to differentiate. The addition of hemin to cultures grown in the presence of inducer plus TPA for several days results in the rapid restoration of hemoglobin synthesis, and also causes a parallel decrease in colony-forming ability. These results suggest that tumor promoters may inhibit only heme-dependent events, rather than the entire program of Friend cell differentiation.","['Mager, D', 'Bernstein, A']","['Mager D', 'Bernstein A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Heme/metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1980/12/01 00:00,1980/12/01 00:01,['1980/12/01 00:00'],"['1980/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041050316 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1980 Dec;105(3):519-26. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041050316.,,,,,,

With tritiated thymidine (3HTdR) the half-time was 67 h, where as with 125Iododeoxyuridine it was 47 h. The longer half-time with 3HTdR supports the notion that a fraction of nuclear 3HTdR from dead cells is reutilized by the newly proliferating cells. The 3HTdR labeling index of granulocytic precursors in the multiplicative pool during the first 10 days in DC is not constant, suggesting a variation in the rate of proliferation. The DNA synthesis time in DC, determined by double isotope labeling technique, showed that it was relatively constant. Simultaneous evaluation of rate of transition of granulocytes in DC from one stage to the next of one patient with chronic myelocytic leukemia and another with myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis indicated a more rapid transition in the DC than in vivo in man.","['Chikkappa, G', 'Carsten, A L', 'Cronkite, E P']","['Chikkappa G', 'Carsten AL', 'Cronkite EP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Diffusion', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood']",,1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1980 May;8(5):533-40.,['CA-0888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

As suggested by the data, folate binding displayed positive cooperativity. Dilution of the binder solution resulted in a shift to a simple non-cooperative binding type and increased binding affinity. Furthermore, binding was inhibited at pH 5.0 and at low temperature (7 degrees C). This study demonstrates important similarities between high-affinity folate binding in milk and serum: positive cooperativity and dependence of binding affinity on concentration of binder.

The myeloid leukemia cells that were blocked at the myeloblast-promyelocyte stage of maturation (KG-1, HL-60, and ML-3) had a prominent response when cultured with TPA. The cells became adherent, developed pseudopodia, displayed macrophage characteristics by light microscopy, developed nonspecific acid esterase activity, phagocytized yeast, slightly reduced nitro blue tetrazolium, displayed Fc-immunoglobulin G receptors, and killed bacteria. Lysozyme secretion and enzyme activity for beta-glucuronidase and acid phosphatase increased 2- to 20-fold concomitant with macrophage differentiation. The myeloid leukemia cells that were blocked at the undifferentiated myeloid blast stage of maturation (KG-1a and K562) were completely resistant to TPA-induced macrophage differentiation. We examined ten macrophage functions in the myeloid cell lines and sublines after exposure to phorbol diesters. The leukemic lines blocked at the myeloblast-promyelocyte stage of maturation expressed almost all the macrophage-specific functions. Phorbol diesters probably induced differentiation through a common cellular mechanism because the macrophage-differentiated events could not be dissociated. In sharp contrast, the early myeloid blast cells (KG-1a and K562) were incapable of acquiring any of the macrophage-specific functions after exposure to phorbol diesters. The KG-1a variant, in particular, should provide a good model to help elucidate the regulatory mechanism controlling the expression of macrophage functions during exposure to phorbol diesters.","['Koeffler, H P', 'Bar-Eli, M', 'Territo, M C']","['Koeffler HP', 'Bar-Eli M', 'Territo MC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Blood Bactericidal Activity/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Macrophages/*pathology/physiology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Fc/metabolism']",,1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Mar;41(3):919-26.,"['CA 15688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The cessation of cell replication and the development of nuclear condensation, changes which are associated with the terminal differentiation of these cells, occur when the level of heme rises 0.1 nmol/10(6) cells over that amount which can be complexed by globin protein. A significant fraction of the excess heme is localized in the nuclei of the DMSO-treated cells. The addition of exogenous hemin facilitates the onset of terminal differentiation in the DMSO-treated T3C12 cells, whereas only the induction of globin gene expression is observed in the absence of DMSO. To study the role of heme in erythroid differentiation, a Friend cell variant (R10) has been isolated whose synthesis and accumulation of heme in response to DMSO is deficient. This variant grows logarithmically in the presence of DMSO and fails to terminally differentiate. When exogenous hemin is added, the DMSO-treated R10 cells stop replicating. In the absence of DMSO, however, hemin-treated R10 cells continue to grow and express their globin genes without exhibiting other signs of terminal differentiation. The combined results support the conclusion that both the DMSO treatment and the accumulation of excess heme are required to bring about the terminal differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells. Preliminary evidence is presented which suggests that in addition to the induction of heme and globin synthesis, DMSO also induces a heme activation process which is required for differentiation. The possible relationship of this process to the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells is discussed.","['Lo, S C', 'Aft, R', 'Mueller, G C']","['Lo SC', 'Aft R', 'Mueller GC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/metabolism', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice']",,1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Mar;41(3):864-70.,"['CA-07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09020/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23076/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,

However, addition of L-ornithine but not D-ornithine resulted in a substantial degree of differentiation approaching the degree of differentiation reached by these inducers in the presence of fetal calf serum.

These studies also attempted to determine whether SEM could be used to distinguish lymphoid and nonlymphoid leukemias, to recognize different types of lymphoid leukemia, and to define the cell type involved in cases of unclassified leukemia. The results of this study suggest that there is a good correlation between surface morphology as seen by SEM and cell type identified by multiparameter techniques. In most cases, nonlymphoid leukemic cells could be distinguished from lymphoid leukemic cells on the basis of their surface morphology. SEM did not appear to contribute to the diagnosis of unclassified leukemia, but more cases of this nature must be studied. Despite the fact that acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells frequently showed fewer microvilli than did other lymphoid leukemias, overlap of surface features in about one-third of the cases did not enable SEM to be used as a reliable means of distinction. The above conclusions appear to be supported by preliminary scanning immunoelectron microscopic observations on leukemic cells. It is concluded that SEM is a useful aid to other modes of microscopy in leukemia but should not be used on its own to establish diagnosis.","['Polliack, A', 'Prokocimer, M', 'Or, R', 'Korkesh, A', 'Leizerowitz, R', 'Ben-Bassat, H', 'Gamliel, H']","['Polliack A', 'Prokocimer M', 'Or R', 'Korkesh A', 'Leizerowitz R', 'Ben-Bassat H', 'Gamliel H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning']",,1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Mar;41(3):1171-9.,,,,,,

Clinical follow-up data and light microscopy of the bone marrow however, revealed a chronic megakaryocytic-granulocytic myelosis (CMGM) with progression into myelofibrosis during the course of disease. In one patient the blastic transformation involved predominantly basophils, and in the other, neutrophils, with an accompanying abnormal proliferation of megakaryocytes in both cases. Electron microscopy of this cell population demonstrated remarkable atypicalities of the neutrophilic, basophilic and megakaryocytic cell lines. These abnormalities consisted of a nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony and a partial arrest of maturation, sometimes resulting in bizarre cell forms. Our investigations support the hypothesis of a mixed cellularity type of myelosis with a gradual and insiduous progression into osteomyelofibrosis/-sclerosis and a potential blastic crisis. In the evolution of blastic crisis all cell lines may be transformed, but with predominance of one population - basophils and neutrophils in our two cases - in addition to atypicalities of megakaryocytes.","['Thiele, J', 'Vykoupil, K F', 'Georgii, A']","['Thiele J', 'Vykoupil KF', 'Georgii A']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Virchows Arch A Pathol Anat Histol,"Virchows Archiv.

Histopathology of the bone marrow in these patients was described as chronic megakaryocytic-granulocytic myelosis - CMGM - since neutrophilic granulopoiesis is also apparently neoplastic and both cell lineages showed a complete differentiation to mature forms. CMGM should be separated from the chronic granulocytic leukemia - CGL - which consists of only a single line proliferation. The incidence of CGL in our total of 1,083 patients was 25%.

Although GIX is expressed in some mouse strains that appear to be free of virus, the antigen can also be induced in GIX- mice by infection with particular murine leukemia viruses (termed GIX+). We have investigated the envelope gene products from two closely related viruses that differ in their GIX phenotype. Analysis of the envelope protein precursors by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and endoglycosidase treatment indicated that the GIX+ viral protein contained six oligosaccharide chains, whereas the GIX- viral protein contained seven. The observed differences in gel electrophoretic mobilities and glycopeptide profiles of the respective glycosylated envelope gene cleavage products (gp70) may be accounted for by the presence of an additional oligosaccharide chain on the gp70 of the GIX- virus. No differences between the apparent molecular weights of the nonglycosylated product of the envelope gene (p15E) were detected. These results suggest that the GIX- virus codes for an extra glycosylation site relative to the GIX+ virus, and this oligosaccharide chain is present both on the envelope gene precursor (Prenv) and on the major cleavage product (gp70). Recent nucleotide sequence analyses of selected RNase T1 oligonucleotides from the genomes of viruses that differ in GIX phenotype have similarly suggested that there may be a correlation between the GIX- phenotype and an extra glycosylation site [Donis-Keller, H., Rommelaere, J., Ellis, R. W. & Hopkins, N. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 1642-1645]. The results of these two different approaches raise the possibility that the presence of an additional oligosaccharide chain on gp70 may, either directly or indirectly, mask the expression of the GIX antigen on the surfaces of thymocytes and virus-infected cells.","['Rosner, M R', 'Tung, J S', 'Hopkins, N', 'Robbins, P W']","['Rosner MR', 'Tung JS', 'Hopkins N', 'Robbins PW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', '*Antigens, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation', 'Oligosaccharides/metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/*physiology', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC350296,1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.11.6420 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Nov;77(11):6420-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.11.6420.,"['CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

In irradiation chimeras, the high recovery phenotype was transferred by cells of the spleen, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Furthermore, in cell transfers using unirradiated recipients, spleen and bone marrow cells of the high-recovery genotype were able to mediate recovery from leukemia in mice of the low-recovery genotype. Thus, the H-2D (Rfv-1) influence on recovery appeared to operate via nonleukemic cells of the spleen and bone marrow rather than via leukemic cells. The specific nonleukemic cell type(s) involved in recovery remains unknown.

Surfaces of leukemic cells have been labeled using 125I both before and after modulation by J5 antibody for different time intervals. Leukemic cells have also been metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine before modulation. These studies indicate that the 100,000-dalton glycoprotein expressing CALLA (gp 100-CALLA) cannot be detected in cells that were modulated with J5 antibody before surface labeling but that it is easily detectable in cells that were surface labeled before modulation for 10 hr. At later time points, gp 100-CALLA is selectively lost from cells that were surface labeled before modulation. Gp 100-CALLA is not detected in the supernatants from cultures of these modulated cells. We conclude that gp 100-CALLA is rapidly internalized during modulation and that CALLA is degraded. Gp 100-CALLA is not shed into the culture media, nor does it remain on the cell surface in an altered form. Incubation of leukemic cells with antisera to beta2-microglobulin or IgM does not affect the expression of gp 100-CALLA.","['Pesando, J M', 'Ritz, J', 'Lazarus, H', 'Tomaselli, K J', 'Schlossman, S F']","['Pesando JM', 'Ritz J', 'Lazarus H', 'Tomaselli KJ', 'Schlossman SF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Fabaceae', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Lectins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Plant Lectins', 'Plants, Medicinal']",,1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Feb;126(2):540-4.,"['AI 12069/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,

Production, serologic, and immunochemical characterization.",32-7,"Xenogeneic antibodies to guinea pig Ia antigens were produced by application of the hybridoma technique. BALB/c mice were immunized with the Ia-positive B cell leukemia line EN-L2C of strain 2 guinea pigs, and the spleen cells were fused to the mouse myeloma line NS-1. Culture supernatants of hybrids growing in the selective HAT medium were screened in a binding assay, and hybrids selectively reactive with EN-L2C but not with its Ia-negative variant BZ-L2C were cloned. Ascitic fluid was produced and used as a source of antibody. Four independently derived antibodies proved to be specific for Ia antigens. Two of the antibodies (25E3 and 25E11) seemed to recognize alloantigenic determinants on strain 2 Ia antigens in that they bound only to the cells of strain 2 but not to the cells of strain 13 animals. Two other antibodies (22C4 and 27E7) were found to react with both strain 2 and strain 13 cells, and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that these antibodies were directed to common determinants shared between certain strain 2 and strain 13 Ia antigens. All antibodies were cytotoxic in the presence of complement for EN-L2C (but not for BZ-L2C) leukemia cells and for lymph node, spleen, peritoneal exudate cells, thymocytes, and purified T cells of strain 2 guinea pigs. In addition, 22C4 was cytolytic for cells of both strains. These results indicate that antibodies can be obtained through the hybridoma technique that are able to distinguish different determinants on Ia antigen molecules of te guinea pig. These antibodies should provide a useful tool for further study of the role of Ia antigens in cellular interaction and Ia-Ir gene function.","['Burger, R', 'Clement, L', 'Schroer, J', 'Chiba, J', 'Shevach, E M']","['Burger R', 'Clement L', 'Schroer J', 'Chiba J', 'Shevach EM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies', '*Antibody Formation', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Guinea Pigs', '*Histocompatibility Antigens Class II', 'Hybrid Cells/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Jan;126(1):32-7.,,,,,,

The method involves disruption of cell pellet with high salt and detergent followed by centrifugation of extracts at 12,000 X g and partial purification on phosphocellulose matrix by a batch elution technique using a standard laboratory microcentrifuge. Using this microassay, TdT activities have been determined in 500 samples of peripheral blood and bone marrow of 240 adult patients with acute leukemias (86 ALL, 108 ANLL, 44 blastic CML, two acute leukemias following P. vera). From an analysis of our data based on TdT activity, cell surface markers and growth patterns in soft agar and observations published in the literature, it can be concluded that the frequencies of TdT + phenotypes in the various clinical-morphological diagnostic groups are approximately 95% in ALL, 10% in ANLL, 50% in AUL, and 35% in blastic CML. Since the presence of high TdT activity is clearly associated with clinical response to specific forms of chemotherapy in blastic CML and most probably, also in ANLL, the determination of TdT should be considered in all cases of acute leukemias to objectively define prognostically important subgroups which can not be diagnosed by conventional means.","['Modak, M J', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Koziner, B', 'Pahwa, R', 'Moore, M A', 'Clarkson, B D', 'Good, R A']","['Modak MJ', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Koziner B', 'Pahwa R', 'Moore MA', 'Clarkson BD', 'Good RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests/*methods', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis/blood', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Thymus Gland/enzymology']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00413181 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1980;98(1):91-104. doi: 10.1007/BF00413181.,"['ACS PDT-95/PHS HHS/United States', 'NCI-CA-17404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI-CA-19267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,

On Day 1, patients received 60 mg/m2 of MTX iv, followed 24 hours later by L-ASP at a dose of 10,000 IU/m2 iv. This sequence was repeated weekly with 50% escalations in the dose of MTX with each course. Overall, 31 of 76 patients (40.7%) achieved complete remission after a median of three courses; the response rate was 35.5% in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (21 of 59 patients) and 58.8% in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ten of 17). Increasing the starting dose of MTX to 200 mg/m2 did not improve the response rate. Maintenance therapy with the same combination given every 2 weeks produced a median complete remission of 10 weeks. Toxicity was manifested by: acute hypersensitivity reactions to L-ASP (five patients), stomatitis (36 patients), and mild liver abnormalities (five patients). MTX in doses up to 200 mg/m2 caused minimal myelosuppression. We conclude that the MTX-L-ASP combination is a well-tolerated, highly effective induction regimen for refractory acute leukemia.","['Amadori, S', 'Tribalto, M', 'Pacilli, L', 'De Laurentis, C', 'Papa, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Amadori S', 'Tribalto M', 'Pacilli L', 'De Laurentis C', 'Papa G', 'Mandelli F']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged']",,1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1980 Aug-Sep;64(8-9):939-42.,,,,,,

In both cases, embryonal hemoglobins [Portland, Gower 1, Hb X, and fetal hemoglobin (Hb-F)] were detected. Butyric acid-treated K562(S) cells contained mostly Hb Gower 1 (zeta 2 epsilon 2) and a hemoglobin with the electrophoretic characteristics of Portland (gamma 2 zeta 2). For hemin-treated K562(S), the most abundant hemoglobin synthesized by Hb X (epsilon 2 gamma 2), and the second most abundant was Bart's (gamma 4). Traces of Gower 1 were observed in nontreated K562(S) cells. The kinetics of hemoglobin induction as a result of the two treatments differed; increased hemoglobin synthesis was detected after only 24 hr of hemin treatment, whereas 4 days were required in butyric acid-treated cells. Both hemin and butyric acid were able to induce their respective patterns of hemoglobin synthesis independent of the presence of serum in the K562(S) growth medium. Analysis of the globin chains in induced K562(S) cells induced to differentiate indicated that, with both inducers, adult alpha- but not beta-globin chains were present. Karyotype analysis of K562(S) cells revealed a nearly triploid chromosome complement with a modal number of 68 chromosomes. Three copies of chromosome 11 and four copies of chromosome 16 (coding for the beta-like and alpha-like globin genes, respectively) were present. A large marked chromosome, involving chromosome 7, and a Philadelphia chromosome were also seen.

Binding of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide to cytosol glucocorticoid receptors was maximal at 22 hr of incubation at 19 degrees, and the receptor complex was stable for 48 hr. The receptor complex was not affected by DNase or RNase, but the receptor complex was lost with pronase or heat denaturation. Whole-cell binding assays were also performed, which resulted in similar quantities of maximally bound glucocorticoid receptor as well as the specificity of binding of various hormone analogs as found in the cytosol receptor assays. Transferring the whole cells from 0 to 22 degrees resulted in the appearance in nuclei of approximately 65% bound receptors.

There was no significant difference among the first and second transfusion of fresh platelet concentrates, nor was the difference observed between fresh and controlled-rate frozen platelet concentrates significant. The difference between fresh and vapor-phase frozen platelet concentrates, and between controlled-rate frozen and vapor-phase frozen platelet concentrates were highly significant (p < 0.01).

A prior co-incubation of nonadherent leukemic cells with adherent cell monolayers from 9 out of 10 donors in liquid cultures over a 4-hr period was sufficient to reduce subsequent leukemic growth in semisolid agar cultures. Inhibition was seen with adherent to leukemic cell ratios of as low as 0.5:1. Conversely, identical numbers of adherent cells in agar cultures but separated from the leukemic cells enhanced growth more than the cultures containing human placental conditioned media alone. Because leukemic cell exposure to adherent cells was brief, a cytotoxic mechanism appeared likely; however, this could not be detected by 51Cr release. Human peripheral blood adherent cells not activated by any in vitro mechanism suppress clonal growth of human myeloid leukemic cells by a mechanism requiring cell to cell contact. Examination of the inhibition of clonal growth appears to be more sensitive than 51Cr release as an indicator of adherent cell effects on myeloid leukemia.","['Spitzer, G', 'Verma, D S', 'Beran, M', 'Zander, A R', 'Dicke, K A', 'McCredie, K B']","['Spitzer G', 'Verma DS', 'Beran M', 'Zander AR', 'Dicke KA', 'McCredie KB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media)', '9002-18-0 (Agar)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Agar', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Communication', 'Clone Cells/*physiology', 'Culture Media', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Growth', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Time Factors']",,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71578-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Jan;57(1):71-4.,"['CA-11520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

A similar procedure was carried out on 19 patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (AnonLL). Plasma from the patients with ALL was variably found to reduce the uptake of the radiolabelled DNA-precursor by their own blasts, with the most marked effect apparent in those with shorter survival times (P < 0.02). This phenomenon was not observed in AnonLL. The amount of plasma-mediated inhibition shown by the ALL patients also correlated overall with their WBC, a known feature of a poor outlook, but even in the 21 patients with WBC below 20.0 x 10(9)/l there was still a significant association between plasma effect and survival (P < 0.01).

Effect of arabinosylcytosine.,423-34,"Flow and conventional DNA-cytofluorometry and in vitro tritiated thymidine cytoautoradiography were employed in the study of the cytokinetic changes induced by Ara-c on the peripheral blood blast cells of six patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemias. Nine courses of therapy were studied, in 5 of which Ara-c was administered in low pulse doses (20-60 mg/sqm) repeated every 12 hrs and in the other 4 it was administered in continuous infusion (90-150 mg/sqm) lasting 24 hrs. Low repeated pulse doses have little cytocidal effect and increase the 2n-4n cell percentage and, less markedly, the LI, while the median grain count is reduced. Many U-like cells and accumulation of 3H-TdR labeled blasts in early S phase were observed during therapy. The continuous infusion of Ara-c induces striking cytoreduction and concomitantly decreases the 2n-4n percentage and LI. Progressive recovery of 2n-4n percentage and LI over pretreatment values was observed 24-48 hrs after stopping infusion in one case and was probably due to cell recruitment following tumor mass reduction. Our data agree with the literature, which is briefly reviewed, in that they indicate that Ara-c in a low intravenous pulse frequently dose synchronizes the blasts in S phase while higher doses of the drug are more often cytocidal in S phase and cell recruitment can follow cytoreduction.","['Montecucco, C M', 'Riccardi, A', 'Cresci, R', 'Mazzini, G', 'Ascari, E']","['Montecucco CM', 'Riccardi A', 'Cresci R', 'Mazzini G', 'Ascari E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Basic Appl Histochem,Basic and applied histochemistry,7910664,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cells/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*blood']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Basic Appl Histochem. 1980;24(4):423-34.,,,,,,

In these circumstances acquisition by the tumor of an apparent ""defect in maturation"" could reflect either abnormal response to external growth regulators or loss ability to synthesize certain special differentiation products. Karyotypic data from a variety of mammalian neoplasms support both possibilities. The terminal accelerated phase of chronic granulocytic leukemia, for instance, in which undifferentiated blast cells replace a previously well-differentiated population, seems to represent emergence of a subline, often recognizable cytogenetically, in which an additionally altered response to growth regulation further shifts the balance between proliferation and differentiation at the stem cell level, so that undifferentiated (proliferating) cells come to predominate. In a case of chronic T cell leukemia, on the other hand, we have observed loss of certain specific T cell characteristics (membrane markers, response to mitogens) in conjunction with emergence of a chromosomally abnormal subclone, without alteration in the ""mature"" morphology of the neoplastic lymphocytes or any apparent change in their proliferation kinetics in vivo. Presumably, loss of these differentiated characteristics reflects alterations in specific gene functions within the neoplastic subpopulation, rather than any significant expansion in the undifferentiated stem cell pool.

Tumor initiators can produce a variety of mutations and tumor promotres can regulate a variety of physiological molecles that control growth and differentiation. The appropriate mutation and the regulation of the appropriate molecules to induce cell growth can initiate and promote the sequence of changes required for transformation of normal cells into malignant cells. After this sequence of changes, some tumors can still be induced to revert with a high frequency from a malignant phenotype to a nonmalignant phenotype. Results obtained from analysis of regulation of growth and differentiation in normal and leukemic myeloid cells, the phenotypic reversion of malignancy by induction of normal differentiation in myeloid leukemia, and the blocks in differentiation-defective leukemic cell mutants have been used to propose a general model for the origin and progression of malignancy. The model states that malignancy originates by changing specific pathways of gene expresion required for growth from inducible to constitutive in cells that can still be induced to differentiate normally by the physiological inducer of differentiation. The malignant cells, unlike the normal cells, then no longer require the physiological inducer for growth. This changes the requirements for growth and uncouples growth from differentiation. Constitutive expression of other specific pathways can uncouple other controls, which then causes blocks in differentiation and the further progression of malignancy. The existence of specific constitutive pathways of gene expression that uncouple controls in malignant cells can also exlain the expresion of fetal proteins, hormones, and some other specialized products of normal development in various types of tumors.","['Sachs, L']",['Sachs L'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Carcinogens', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phenotype']",PMC350232,1980/10/01 00:00,1980/10/01 00:01,['1980/10/01 00:00'],"['1980/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.10.6152 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Oct;77(10):6152-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.10.6152.,,,,,,

Amiloride completely blocked the dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-induced erythroid differentiation of cells at a concentration (10 microgram/ml) that did not affect cell proliferation. Amiloride also prevented the decrease in cell volume normally observed afte a 20-hr exposure to Me2SO. The ratio of total cell Na+ to total cell water was essentially the same for control cells, Me2SO-treated cells, and cells treated with Me2SO plus amiloride. However, cells treated for 24 hr with Me2SO had a rate of Ca2+ uptake that was twice that of untreated cells and a similarly higher Ca2+ content. Addition of amiloride plus Me2SO prevented both the increase in Ca2+ uptake rate and the increase in Ca2+ content. Cells grown in the presence of Me2SO plus amiloride initiated differentiation immediately after removal of amiloride or addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 microgram/ml). Addition of sufficient ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid to reduce free extracellular Ca2+ to submicromolar levels prevented Me2SO-induced differentiation while only slightly affecting cell proliferation. These results suggest that an increase in in the Ca2+ level is an essential step in Me2SO induction, that amiloride either directly or indirectly inhibits this process, and that Me2SO has an early effect on cells that is necessary for differentiation and is not mimicked by A23187.","['Levenson, R', 'Housman, D', 'Cantley, L']","['Levenson R', 'Housman D', 'Cantley L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Pyrazines)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amiloride/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Water/metabolism']",PMC350189,1980/10/01 00:00,1980/10/01 00:01,['1980/10/01 00:00'],"['1980/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.10.5948 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Oct;77(10):5948-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.10.5948.,"['CA 26717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA1405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Despite the role of the host cellular environment in governing the proliferation and differentiation of both normal and malignant cells, little is known about these host factors. The characterization of host genes that influence both normal cellular processes, as well as susceptibility to tumour induction, is one approach to identifying such factors. Mice carrying two recessive mutations at the steel (Sl) locus have an environmental defect that affects both normal haematopoietic stem cell function as well as susceptibility to Friend leukaemia virus. In this study, we have used Sl/sld mice to examine whether malignant transformation by this RNA tumour virus results in a population of cells capable of proliferating even in the defective cellular microenvironment of Sl/sld mice. We report here that late after infection, the leukaemic spleens of Friend virus-infected mice contain cells which, unlike normal haematopoietic stem cells, are able to form macroscopic spleen colonies in irradiated mice of genotype Sl/Sld.

The phorbols are excellent tools to investigate the expression and control of differentiation in some cells and the mechanism by which oncogenic agents interfere with the process of terminal differentiation. The mechanism of action of the phorbols on different target cells is not understood at the present time. It is felt that the status of the cell is of major importance as, in some cases, opposite effects can be achieved by the same concentration of the phorbol diester used. Changes in membranes, receptors, in secretion of prostaglandins and in the level of cyclic AMP have all been reported. However, the relationship of these changes with the alterations in the genetic program involved in the differentiation process is not clear, and the recent report of a possible cell receptor for phorbol diesters should elucidate their mechanism of action. The findings on the effect of phorbol diesters on differentiation have suggested the testable hypothesis that promotion could be mediated through inhibition of cellular differentiation. It has also been suggested that changes in differentiating systems could be of future use in screening for unknown tumor promoters, however, this possibility seems quite remote. Finally, phorbol diesters with tumor-promoting activity appear to exert a specific effect on differentiation of leukemic cells of both mouse and human origin, and therefore, the application of this particular phenomenon in experimental therapy should be the subject of future investigations.","['Abrahm, J', 'Rovera, G']","['Abrahm J', 'Rovera G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology', 'Animals', 'Bone and Bones/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Muscles/cytology', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Skin/cytology']",,1980/08/16 00:00,1980/08/16 00:01,['1980/08/16 00:00'],"['1980/08/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/16 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00225849 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1980 Aug 16;31(3):165-75. doi: 10.1007/BF00225849.,"['CA 10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

As a control group 12 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in complete remission and after cessation of all antileukemic therapy, were studied. By centrifugation over a discontinuous bovine serum albumin (BSA) density gradient, good reproducibility of the partition of the bone marrow cell population was obtained, with a peak in the more dense region. The cells capable of incorporation of [3H] thymidine in vitro were present predominantly in the lower density range. In 9 patients with lympho- or myeloproliferative malignancies (3 with o-cell ALL, 2 with T-cell malignant lymphoma, 1 with B-cell malignant lymphoma, 3 with various malignancies of the myeloid-monocytoid series) similar fractionation on the BSA gradient revealed a different cell partition pattern as compared with the control group. The peak of the distribution curve was located in the less dense region. Highest [3H] thymidine incorporation values were measured in vitro with cells from the lower density region. At last the importance of purely practical considerations in the choice of material for density gradient fractionation is stressed.

On preliminary examination of the bone marrow smears, these inclusions looked like ingested red blood cells in that they were pink and not azurophilic. The bone marrow specimens were processed for the electron microscopic demonstration of peroxidase with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine and H2O2 at pH 7.6. In all three cases, the inclusions were determined to be large peroxidase-positive granules since they were limited by a single unit membrane and, unlike endocytized red blood cells, were not contained within phagocytic vasuoles. The granules were homogeneously dense for peroxidase and showed no obvious crystalline structure when examined stained or unstained on grid. We believe that they correspond to the giant pink round granules Van Slyck and Rebuck observed in immature leukemic granulocytes in 1974 and termed the pseudo-Chediak-Higashi anomaly. Like the giant purple granules seen in leukemia with this anomaly, these granules also appear to be an abnormal variant of peroxidase-positive azurophil (primary) granules. Their lack of azurophilia is due to the absence of sulfated glycoaminoglycans.","['Dittman, W A', 'Kramer, R J', 'Bainton, D F']","['Dittman WA', 'Kramer RJ', 'Bainton DF']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chediak-Higashi Syndrome/pathology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Peroxidases/metabolism']",,1980/12/01 00:00,1980/12/01 00:01,['1980/12/01 00:00'],"['1980/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Dec;40(12):4473-81.,['CA-14264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

Total enzyme activity was generally elevated in untreated and in stable disease; a marked further elevation was noted 30 to 60 days before development of blast crisis. Electrofocusing studies indicate the presence of three major enzymes. The level of enzyme which focused at pH 5.6 was elevated in untreated disease and rose markedly during blastic transformation. A second enzyme focused at pH 5.1 and appeared to be related to marrow erythroid turnover. A third enzyme with pI = 4.7 was elevated only during marrow regeneration which followed myelosuppressive therapy.

Studies employing tritiated vincristine ([3H]-VCR) revealed a progressive inhibition of uptake of the radio-label into CEM cells with increasing concentrations of albumin.

Six features were associated with a poor prognosis: splenomegaly (more than 15 cm below the costal margin), hepatomegaly (more than 6 cm below the costal margin), thrombocytopenia (< 150 X 10(9)/l) or thrombocytosis (> 500 X 10(9)/l), a leucocyte count above 100 X 10(9)/l, peripheral blood non-granulated precursors (blast cells) above 1%, and peripheral blood granulated precursors (promyelocytes and myelocytes) above 20%. Depending on the number of negative prognostic factors, patients were divided into three categories: group I (0 or 1 factor), group II (2 or 3 factors) and group III (4,5 or 6 factors). Survival was significantly different in the three groups (P < 0.0005), and this was independent of age (below and above 50). The prognostic value of the classification was confirmed in a third series of 153 patients.

One of the patients was 'autografted' on two occasions. Five patients had been splenectomized early in the first chronic phase and the other three patients had their spleens intact. Recovery of peripheral blood values was more rapid in the splenectomized than in the non-splenectomized patients. CFUc were present in the circulation immediately after autografting in each case but subsequently the pattern of CFUc changes differed between patients. The bone marrow was hypocellular at the time of autografting but the rate at which it returned to a typical chronic phase picture varied. Peripheral blood nucleated cells collected at the time of diagnosis include stem cells with the capacity to repopulate the marrow after 'ablative' therapy for transformation.

Classification and clinical significance.,215-22,"In patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), we have found the break points on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q) are variable (heteromorphic or polymorphic). Consequently, the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome is heteromorphic in size for the long arm. Based upon the break points and the relative size of chromosome 22, four types of Ph1 chromosomes are proposed. They are: Types I (very large), II (large), III (average) and IV (small) with the break points at bands 22q13.3, 22q13.1, 22q12 and 22q11.3, respectively. The break points are arbitrary and should not be considered absolute since they are based on length differences. In two cases the Ph1 chromosome involved a translocation between chromosome 9 and 22, and the other two cases chromosome 1 or 12. Because Types I and II are hard to recognize by conventional techniques, the RFA technique (R. band by fluorescence with acridine orange) must be performed on all cases. An earlier contention that only chromosome 22 band 12 is concerned with abnormal myeloid cell proliferation in human leukaemia is rejected. Furthermore, break points are not restricted at the junction of 22ql and q2 and 22q2 and q3 and can happen anywhere on the long arm of chromosome 22.","['Verma, R S', 'Dosik, H']","['Verma RS', 'Dosik H']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)']",IM,"['Acridine Orange', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y/*analysis', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quinacrine', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1980/06/01 00:00,1980/06/01 00:01,['1980/06/01 00:00'],"['1980/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1980.tb07141.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1980 Jun;45(2):215-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1980.tb07141.x.,,,,,,

From 10 to 12 electroencephalograms (EEGs) were done before and at intervals during after 30 months of treatment that included 2,400 rads of CNS irradiation plus intrathecal methotrexate therapy. None of the children had CNS leukemia, and all remained in first complete remissions. All 49 had abnormally slow EEG background frequencies during the four-year study, and 29 (60%) developed somnolence syndrome six to eight weeks after CNS prophylaxis. During this syndrome, EEG background frequencies decreased more than 3 standard deviations below the expected mean values for normal children. Thereafter, 7 of the 29 began to show signs of learning disabilities and 7 developed recurrent seizures. Of the 20 children who did not have the syndrome, none showed later evidence of CNS dysfunction.

We have recently reported in vitro transformation of bone marrow cells by FVP, producing clusters of erythroid colonies (erythroid bursts) 4-6 days after infection. In contrast to uninfected bone marrow cells, FVP-treated cells proliferated and differentiated (synthesized hemoglobin) in the absence of added erythropoietin, the physiologic regulator of erythropoiesis. The relative roles of helper murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and SFFV in the in vitro erythroid transformation have now been examined. Pseudotype studies and the finding that cloned MuLV-F (free of SFFV) did not induce burst formation indicated that SFFV was essential for this in vitro effect of FVP. Because SFFV could not be obtained free of helper MuLV, we assessed the requirement of MuLV in the transformation by kinetic analyses of helper-deficient and helper-excess FVP preparations. Whereas helper-excess FVP gave single-hit kinetics both in vivo and in vitro, the helper-deficient FVP followed multiple-hit kinetics when titrated for spleen focus formation in vivo. Addition of MuLV-F to helper-deficient FVP prior to injection resulted in a marked enhancement of spleen focus formation and a conversion from multiple-hit to single-hit kinetics. In contrast, titration of this same preparation for erythroid burst transformation in vitro yielded single-hit kinetics, and the addition of helper MuLV-F had no effect. The time course of burst development was similar with or without added MuLV-F. Unlike burst transformation, SFFV production by these infected cultures followed multiple-hit kinetics. Addition of MuLV-F at the time of infection led to an enhancement of SFFV production and conversion of the titration curve from multiple-hit to single-hit. These data are consistent with the idea that SFFV is competent for erythroid transformation in vitro, but requires helper MuLV for its replication.","['Hankins, W D', 'Krantz, S B']","['Hankins WD', 'Krantz SB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Defective Viruses/*metabolism', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Helper Viruses', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/growth & development', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spleen/cytology']",PMC350043,1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.9.5287 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Sep;77(9):5287-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.9.5287.,"['AM15555/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Study of 161 cases].,2115-23,"161 cases of CML have been studied. Clinically significant adenopathies were present in 3,2% of the patients at the moment of diagnosis, and in the subsequent course they appeared in 7% of them. The behaviour of adenopathies showed to be unrelated to: --splenomegaly; --blastic metamorphosis in the peripheral blood or in the marrow (which they often preceded from 3 to 26 months); --hematological sensibility to cytostatic therapy; and furthermore they often acted as the most important clinical and therapeutic problem. From the cyto-histological point of view three features have been observed: 1) blastic metamorphosis in a lymphnode showing features of myeloid metaplasia; 2) blastic invasion in a lymphnode without any sign of myeloid metaplasia; 3) malignant lymphoma. Cytological examination of imprints and ultrastructural studies, besides the usual histological investigations, proved to be useful for the definition of the above mentioned features. In lymphomatous forms, together with the study of the cariotype and the research of the Ph' chromosome, the performance of immunocytological investigations is also necessary.","['Paolino, W', 'Infelise, V', 'Degani, G', 'Falda, M', 'Paolino, F', 'Fiorio, C', 'Marmont, F', 'Coda, R']","['Paolino W', 'Infelise V', 'Degani G', 'Falda M', 'Paolino F', 'Fiorio C', 'Marmont F', 'Coda R']",['ita'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Minerva Med,Minerva medica,0400732,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*etiology']",,1980/08/25 00:00,1980/08/25 00:01,['1980/08/25 00:00'],"['1980/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Med. 1980 Aug 25;71(30):2115-23.,,Adenopatie nella leucemia mieloide cronica (LMC).

Seeking a common property, Bernstein reported that the relationship between activity and octanol/water partition coefficients for inducers resembled that reported for anaesthetics; moreover, anaesthetics inhibited induction. Since anaesthetics were known to increase membrane fluidity, they suggested that inducers might decrease it. Reporting evidence against unitary theories of anaesthesia, Richards et al. suggested that lipophilic drugs competed, according to their individual structure, with membrane lipids for hydrophobic regions on membrane proteins. The antagonism between pairs of anaesthetics, anaesthetics and inducers and pairs of inducers, might thus be explained economically by Richards' anaesthesia model, inducers and lipophilic drugs acting by similar rather than contrary mechanisms. Lipophilic drugs should, therefore, induce differentiation. We report here that some tranquillizers do so. As reported elsewhere for classical inducers, they also block non-differentiating 3T3 cells in pre-S. These findings may have application in cancer chemotherapy.","['Clarke, G D', 'Ryan, P J']","['Clarke GD', 'Ryan PJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,1980/09/11 00:00,1980/09/11 00:01,['1980/09/11 00:00'],"['1980/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/11 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/287160a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1980 Sep 11;287(5778):160-1. doi: 10.1038/287160a0.,,,,,,

Cells could be observed to accumulate in G2 by 24 hours even if prospidine (0.1 mg/ml) was removed after 12 hours.

Recent surgical literature states that if cecitis is found as a consequence of therapy for leukemia, the surgeon should refrain from operating because standard procedures, including hemicolectomy, have not improved survival. This paper reports two patients with acute typhlitis resulting from induction therapy of acute leukemia with cytosine arabinoside and hydroxydaunorubicin. Both patients underwent subtotal colectomy, while their marrows were aplastic from therapy, and survived their surgery. Both are living and well in maintained remission, 1 year from surgery. We review the pathogenesis of this disorder and discuss its clinical, x-ray, and laboratory features. Close oncologic/surgical teamwork is stressed as the patient is followed closely into the time frame when the decision is made whether to operate. Factors contributing to this decision are discussed. Preoperative recommendations are made in order to bring the patient into a state of physiologic stability. The operative procedure is described along with the postoperative complications encountered. We strongly recommend that laparotomy be considered in selected patients with typhlitis occurring as a complication of treated leukemia.","['Lea, J W Jr', 'Masys, D R', 'Shackford, S R']","['Lea JW Jr', 'Masys DR', 'Shackford SR']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Clin Trials,Cancer clinical trials,7905482,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colectomy/methods', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/*etiology/pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1980/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Clin Trials. 1980;3(4):355-62.,,,,,,

The results depended on the treatment used. With modern treatment, including more intensive chemotherapy and central nervous system prophylaxis, CR rate increased from 65% to 81% and median duration of CR improved from four months to ten months. The most important prognostic difference was related to the sex: CR rate was higher (78.5% vs. 66%) and median duration of CR and hematological remission was longer for females (nine months vs. six months and ten months vs. 6.5 months, respectively). This difference only appeared with modern treatments, however: before 1972 the median duration of CR was four months for both sexes, and after 1972, it was eight months for males and 17 months for females. This difference could be explained by the site of the first relapse, which was testicular in only 2% of cases before 1972 and 27% (47% of the males who relapsed) after 1972.","['Harousseau, J L', 'Tobelem, G', 'Schaison, G', 'Chastang, C', 'Auclerc, M F', 'Weil, M', 'Jacquillat, C', 'Bernard, J']","['Harousseau JL', 'Tobelem G', 'Schaison G', 'Chastang C', 'Auclerc MF', 'Weil M', 'Jacquillat C', 'Bernard J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/drug therapy', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Testicular Neoplasms/epidemiology']",,1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19801101)46:9<1996::aid-cncr2820460917>3.0.co;2-r [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1980 Nov 1;46(9):1996-2003. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19801101)46:9<1996::aid-cncr2820460917>3.0.co;2-r.,,,,,,

Dexamethasone inhibited colony formation by the K562 cells, and the inhibitory effect could be reversed by progesterone (10(-6) M). Fluoxymesterone caused a prominent enhancement of K562 colony growth, whereas estriol had no effect. Stimulation by triiodothyronine was maximal at 10(-7) M, and the thyroid effect could be abrogated by the beta 2-adrenergic antagonist butoxamine in equimolar concentrations. Using standard tissue culture conditions, the beta-adrenergic agent isoproterenol, but not the alpha catecholamine phenylephrine, enhanced the proliferation of K562 cells. When K562 cells were grown under hormone-depleted conditions, they developed responsiveness to phenylephrine and were no longer stimulated by isoproterenol.

Our results are consistent with the identificaiton of K562 as an erythroid line, and they indicate that K562 cells respond to endocrine hormones in a manner analogous to normal erythroid progenitors.","['Gauwerky, C', 'Golde, D W']","['Gauwerky C', 'Golde DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hormones)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', '0NM31M53PW (Butoxamine)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9JU12S4YFY (Fluoxymesterone)', 'FB33469R8E (Estriol)']",IM,"['Butoxamine/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Estriol/pharmacology', 'Fluoxymesterone/pharmacology', 'Hormones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'Triiodothyronine/pharmacology']",,1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84617-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1980 Nov;56(5):886-91.,"['CA 15619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The cell populations examined were chosen on the basis that they proliferated in short-term culture, did not bind anti-Ig reagents directly, and that more than 80% of the cells did not carry detectable Fc receptors. With 8/9 patients studied, no specific antibodies of the IgG or IgM class could be detected in serum samples taken during remission. IgG and IgM antibodies from the remission sera of one patient were found be bind to autologous leukaemic cells, but this was found to be due to the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and removal of the RF activity abolished this binding.

This suggests that CSF from patients who are HBsAg-positive should be handled with care, as it may be capable of transmitting hepatitis B to health care personnel caring for these patients and laboratory personnel handling their specimens.","['Spiegel, R J', 'Taber, E', 'Pizzo, P A', 'Gerety, R J']","['Spiegel RJ', 'Taber E', 'Pizzo PA', 'Gerety RJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/analysis/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*cerebrospinal fluid/immunology', 'Male', 'Occult Blood', 'Specimen Handling']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950080203 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1980;8(2):115-21. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950080203.,,,,,,

This was followed by declines in HCT in hypoxic SCL rats similar to that observed in nonhypoxic SCL animals. HCT of nonleukemic controls remained elevated throughout hypoxic exposure. Results suggested that in SCL, erythropoietic homeostatic response mechanisms are functional prior to terminal phases of this disease, whereas anemia-producing mechanisms exceed maximum erythropoietic capacity of these animals during later stages of SCL. The HCT of most SCL rats exposed to hypoxia did not fall below 40% before death. This was in contrast to nonhypoxic SCL animals, which became severely anemic in terminal stages.

Thus, although the role of VIP in normal PMN function is unknown, measurement of VIP in leukemic cells may aid in the differential diagnosis of acute leukemias.","[""O'Dorisio, M S"", ""O'Dorisio, T M"", 'Cataland, S', 'Balcerzak, S P']","[""O'Dorisio MS"", ""O'Dorisio TM"", 'Cataland S', 'Balcerzak SP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Gastrointestinal Hormones)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', '*Gastrointestinal Hormones', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Neutrophils/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Rabbits', 'Swine', '*Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide']",,1980/10/01 00:00,1980/10/01 00:01,['1980/10/01 00:00'],"['1980/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0022-2143(80)90070-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1980 Oct;96(4):666-72.,"['NIH-GCRC/PHS HHS/United States', 'R-01 CA 19705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-34/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,

These nuclear hnRNP particles sediment at 50S-200S and contain, in addition to high molecular weight hnRNA, a specific set of nuclear proteins predominated by a major component of approximately 38,000 mol wt. The hnRNP particles are free of histones and ribosomal structural proteins, indicating their purification from the two other major nucleoprotein components of the nucleus: chromatin and nucleolar ribosomal precursor RNP particles. Th authenticity of the Friend cell hnRNP particles is demonstrated by the results of reconstruction experiments with deproteinized hnRNA, and by the resistance of the articles to dissociation during isopycnic banding in Cs2SO4 gradients without prior aldehyde fixation. Hybridization analysis with cloned mouse beta-globin DNA demonstrates that hnRNP particles from induced Friend cells contain newly synthesized transcripts of the beta-globin gene. Agarose gel electrophoresis of hnRNP particle-derived RNA denatured in glyoxal followed by ""Northern"" transfer to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper and hybridization with 32P-labeled cloned mouse beta-globin DNA reveals the presence in hnRNP of two size classes of beta-globin gene transcripts, the larger of which corresponds to the pre-spliced 15S beta-globin mRNA precursor previously identified in whole nuclear RNA, and the smaller of which corresponds to completely processed 9S beta-globin mRNA. These results establish, for the first time, that the nuclear transcripts of a specific, well-defined eukaryotic structural gene can be isolated in an RNP particle form, and that their RNP structure persists throughout mRNA splicing.","['Pederson, T', 'Davis, N G']","['Pederson T', 'Davis NG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC2110708,1980/10/01 00:00,1980/10/01 00:01,['1980/10/01 00:00'],"['1980/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.87.1.47 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1980 Oct;87(1):47-54. doi: 10.1083/jcb.87.1.47.,"['CA 12708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 21595/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 23914/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

There were 98 parenchymal infiltrates identified, including 43 episodes of local disease and 55 episodes of diffuse disease. The causes of the infiltrates were determined from biopsies of tissue and autopsies whenever possible. If roentgenographic resolution after therapy with an antibiotic or diuretic agent was documented, the cause was considered determined; however, this did not identify a specific bacterial or viral agent. Parenchymal infiltrates (17 episodes) appearing in the period before treatment or within 72 hours of initiating therapy were not opportunistic. Local disease during treatment was infectious in 23 (74 percent) of 31 cases and was bacterial in 20 (87 percent) of 23 cases. Opportunistic organisms caused only 13 percent of the local infectious episodes. Diffuse disease was noninfectious in 26 (65 percent) of 40 episodes; while in the 14 episodes of infectious disease identified, 13 (93 percent) were caused by opportunistic organisms. We conclude that procedures for biopsy to document opportunistic infection are of little value in local or diffuse disease before treatment, are of modest value in local disease during treatment, and are of greatest value in diffuse disease during treatment if little clinical evidence for noninfectious causes exists.","['Tenholder, M F', 'Hooper, R G']","['Tenholder MF', 'Hooper RG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Chest,Chest,0231335,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/etiology', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/*etiology', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Lung Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/diagnosis/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-3692(16)53686-1 [pii]', '10.1378/chest.78.3.468 [doi]']",ppublish,Chest. 1980 Sep;78(3):468-73. doi: 10.1378/chest.78.3.468.,,,,,,

Evidence for large conformational changes during catalysis.",4244-51,"The conformations of thymidylate synthetases from CCRF-CEM human leukemic cells and Lactobacillus casei were studied by hydrodynamic methods. Although the human enzyme has a molecular weight of 70 000--72 500, somewhat smaller than that of the L. casei enzyme, it has a larger Stokes radius and a lower sedimentation coefficient, indicating that the human enzyme is less spherical than the bacterial enzyme. Thymidylate synthetases from the human leukemic cells and the bacterial source both undergo substantial conformational changes upon the formation of a covalent ternary complex with the mechanism-based inhibitor 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. The Stokes radius of both proteins decreases by 3.5% when the ternary complex is formed in spite of the 1.8% increase in molecular weight, and the sedimentation coefficient increases by 3.5% after appropriate corrections for the bound ligands. Ternary complex formation results in a more compact structure for both enzymes, with approximately the same reduction in the frictional ratio. Experiments with the bacterial enzyme indicate that approximately 70% of the total conformational change occurs upon binding of 1 mol of ligands/mol of enzyme. These results demonstrate that human and bacterial thymidylate synthetases undergo marked structural changes upon forming a ternary complex which is probably very similar to an activated complex formed with both substrates. These investigations also provide evidence for fundamental similarities in the mechanism of ternary complex formation with 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, despite the marked differences in amino acid composition and the dissimilar conformations of these two enzymes obtained from widely divergent sources.","['Lockshin, A', 'Danenberg, P V']","['Lockshin A', 'Danenberg PV']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0SXY5ET48B (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic acid)', '134-46-3 (Fluorodeoxyuridylate)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Fluorodeoxyuridylate/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactobacillus/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Species Specificity', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",,1980/09/02 00:00,1980/09/02 00:01,['1980/09/02 00:00'],"['1980/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00559a016 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1980 Sep 2;19(18):4244-51. doi: 10.1021/bi00559a016.,"['1 R01 CA 27327/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

These membrane-bound inclusions ranged from 0.8 to 1.4 microgram in diameter and were clearly demonstrated on routinely stained preparations. Electron microscopy disclosed transitions between well-developed mitochondria and the electron-dense structures. The functional significance of these presumably altered mitochondria is uncertain. Whorled lamellar internal structures, in occasional fingerprintlike arrangements, may represent duplication of mitochondrial cristae and, functionally, may reflect increased metabolic rate or otherwise abnormal metabolism. Cytochemical studies demonstrated the presence of both periodic acid-Schiff positivity and nonspecific esterase activity in these inclusions, but no peroxidase or acid phosphatase was found. These findings support the lymphoid nature of the disorder. Immunologic surface membrane markers are consistent with this case being, as with the majority of acute lymphoblastic leukemias, of non-B, non-T cell type. Cytogenetic studies on cultured leukemic cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood showed a consistently abnormal karyotype associated with the presence of an XXY chromosomal constitution. Since no other tissues (e.g., dermal fibroblasts) were examined, the diagnosis of Klinefelter's syndrome cannot be confirmed.

The globin genes in MEL cells are inducible by dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO); induction leads to the accumulation of mouse globin mRNA and hemoglobin. Globin mRNA was not detected in the cytoplasm of the human lymphoblast cells, even at low levels, whether or not these cells were treated with Me2SO. In cell hybrids that had retained the lymphoblast-derived beta-globin gene, human beta-globin mRNA was induced by Me2SO. Poly(A)-containing 10S human beta-globin mRNA was detected in the cytoplasm of the hybrid cells. Karyologic and isozymic analyses of a series of hybrids and subclones showed that human beta-globin gene expression occurred only in hybrids that had retained human chromosome 11. Analysis of one hybrid bearing a deletion of both the beta-globin and lactate dehydrogenase A genes indicated that the beta-globin gene is located on the short arm of human chromosome 11. No other human chromosomes are required for human beta-globin gene expression in MEL cell hybrids. We conclude that the restricted expression of a globin gene in a human nonerythroid cell can be reversed. Furthermore, all components required for the transcription, processing, and transport to the cytoplasm of a human globin mRNA appear to be present in mouse erythroleukemia cells. Thus cell fusion with MEL cells provides a way to isolate permanent cell lines with functioning human globin genes. The technique should be useful for studying the biochemical basis for abnormal function of mutant globin genes, such as those present in individuals with the thalassemia syndromes.","['Pyati, J', 'Kucherlapati, R S', 'Skoultchi, A I']","['Pyati J', 'Kucherlapati RS', 'Skoultchi AI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Genes, Synthetic', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC349631,1980/06/01 00:00,1980/06/01 00:01,['1980/06/01 00:00'],"['1980/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.6.3435 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Jun;77(6):3435-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.6.3435.,,,,,,

In order to further investigate the relationship between histone H5 and/or chromatin condensation and nucleosome structure, repeat lengths were examined during in vitro differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells in which chromatin condensation occurs but in which histone H5 is absent.

IC50 (50% growth inhibition) in culture was observed at a drug concentration of 0.22 micrograms/ml, which was ca. 11 times higher than IC50 for the parental cells. The resistant cell line exhibited cross resistance to mitomycin C, actinomycin D, macromomycin, auromomycin, vinblastine, cytochalasin B, and other anthracyclines: daunorubicin, adriamycin, 4'-O-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin, baumycins A1 and A2, aclacinomycins B and Y, MA144-S1, 1-deoxypyrromycin, cinerubin A, musettamcyin, and pyrromycin. The 1-deoxy group of anthracyclines showed higher degree of cross resistance than the 1-hydroxy group. No significant cross resistance was found with bleomycin A2, neothramycin and blasticidin S. The resistance to aclacinomycin A and cross resistance to adriamycin were also demonstrated by the method of uridine incorporation. The accumulation or retention studies with [3H]adriamycin revealed that the resistance may be due to decreased uptake and increased efflux of the antibiotic in the resistant cells.","['Nishimura, T', 'Suzuki, H', 'Muto, K', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Tanaka, N']","['Nishimura T', 'Suzuki H', 'Muto K', 'Tanaka Y', 'Tanaka N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis']",,1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7164/antibiotics.33.737 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 1980 Jul;33(7):737-43. doi: 10.7164/antibiotics.33.737.,,,,,,

Two patterns of concentration profiles were distinguished: a) The plasma concentration reached a rather low maximum, followed by a relatively slow decline ('slow type'): b) The plasma concentration increased rapidly to a relatively high value after which it declined rather steeply ('fast type'). The incidence of the 'fast type' increased progressively with the number of intrathecal injections. When the plasma concentration-time curves were described by a pharmacokinetic 2-compartment open model with first-order absorption, it was calculated that the transfer of methotrexate from the spinal fluid into the plasma is much slower for the 'slow type' compared with the 'fast type'. Assuming concentration-dependent cytostatic activity, the therapeutic efficacy in the central nervous system is likely to be less for the 'fast type' than for the 'slow type'. Systemic toxicity resulting from the 'slow type' is expected to be higher than from the 'fast type'.","['Lankelma, J', 'Lippens, R J', 'Drenthe-Schonk, A', 'Termond, E F', 'van der Kleijn, E']","['Lankelma J', 'Lippens RJ', 'Drenthe-Schonk A', 'Termond EF', 'van der Kleijn E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological']",,1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003088-198005050-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 1980 Sep-Oct;5(5):465-75. doi: 10.2165/00003088-198005050-00004.,,,,,,

Gallium-67 scanning revealed diffuse uptake in both lungs. The busulfan was discontinued and therapy was changed to hydroxyurea. Three months later the patient was without symptoms, the CO diffusing capacity had risen to 64% (of predicted), and the Ga-67 scan had returned to normal. The chest radiograph remained normal.

Since February 1975, 883 previously untreated children with acute lymphocytic leukemia were entered in a protocol designed to evaluate prognostic factors that influence induction rate, remission duration, and survival and to identify subsets of patients with a high risk of early failure. Stratification was based upon the initial wbc count, and standard and more intensive induction and maintenance therapy programs were compared. The combination of older age (> 10 years), high initial wbc counts (greater than or equal to 20 x 10(9)/liter), and low serum IgG is associated with a significantly lower rate of induction of complete remission. The following factors were associated with an unfavorable prognosis with regard to bone marrow relapse and death: wbc count of greater than or equal to 20 x 10(9)/liter; age > 7 years old; CNS disease at diagnosis; L2 lymphoblasts; hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 11 g/dl; decreased concentration of serum immunoglobulin; and M3 marrow on Day 14 of induction. None of the 41 patients in the low-risk prognostic group (3-7 years old with an initial wbc count of < 10 x 10(9)/liter) with L1 blast cells, normal Ig, and M1 marrow on Day 14 has sustained an adverse event. Identification of prognostic factors should permit more efficient and effective design of future protocols by refining the classification of acute lymphocytic leukemia, decreasing the toxic risk to patients with a better prognosis, and improving the relatively poor remission duration and survival for patients with a poor prognosis.","['Miller, D R', 'Leikin, S', 'Albo, V', 'Vitale, L', 'Sather, H', 'Coccia, P', 'Nesbit, M', 'Karon, M', 'Hammond, D']","['Miller DR', 'Leikin S', 'Albo V', 'Vitale L', 'Sather H', 'Coccia P', 'Nesbit M', 'Karon M', 'Hammond D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Computers', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/therapy', 'Leukopenia', 'Lymphocytes', 'Prognosis', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",,1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1980 Feb-Mar;64(2-3):381-92.,"['CA-02649/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-03888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,

Clonal analysis of hemin-treated cells revealed that unlike other inducers, hemin does not cause a reprogramming of MEL cells to a specific limitation of proliferative capacity.

Addition of PMA to control uninfected or R-MuLV-infected cultures decreased production of nonadherent granulocytic cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GM-CFU-c), and increased the numbers of adherent macrophages. Addition of PMA to FLV-A-infected cultures did not inhibit generation of granulocytic leukemia cell lines even though the numbers of adherent adipocytes were decreased and adherent macrophages were increased. PMA treatment of freshly explanted whole bone marrow but not purified nonadherent GM-progenitor cells from long-term bone marrow cultures stimulated GM-CFU-c and cluster formation in the absence of added colony-stimulating factor (CSF). The sensitivity of purified GM-progenitor cells to L929 or WEHI-3 CSF was not altered by PMA; however, PMA treatment of bone marrow macrophages or peritoneal exudate macrophages stimulated detectable GM-CFU-c and cluster formation by purified GM-progenitor cells under conditions where equal numbers of untreated macrophages failed to be stimulatory.

Clinically, preleukemia is characterized by variable degrees of pancytopenia, with associated symptoms due to decreased circulating blood elements. The bone marrow is usually hypercellular, and there are prominent morphologic abnormalities in erythroid precursors and more subtle changes in megakaryocytes and granulocyte progenitors. During this phase of the leukemic process, the neoplastic clone is usually already established and predominant. A clear distinction should be made between the preleukemic syndrome and diseases that predispose to development of acute myelogenous leukemia. Preleukemia, like acute myelogenous leukemia, is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm manifested functionally by abnormal hematopoietic cell maturation and ineffective hematopoiesis. During the course of preleukemia, precursor cell maturation becomes progressively impaired with termination in the severe maturational block characteristic of acute myelogenous leukemia. We favor the concept that preleukemia is an early phase of acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Koeffler, H P', 'Golde, D W']","['Koeffler HP', 'Golde DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', '*Preleukemia/etiology/pathology/physiopathology']",,1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-93-2-347 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1980 Aug;93(2):347-53. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-93-2-347.,,,,,,

Whereas erythroleukaemia develops rapidly (within 2-3 weeks) in mice infected with any strain of FV or RV, the helper-independent virus alone is pathogenic in mice only if they are infected neonatally. We now describe how two biological markers can be used to distinguish among the otherwise confusing array of virus-induced erythroleukaemias in mice. The evidence suggests that there are three different classes of this disease: (1) those (S+E+) from which both defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) and erythropoietin-independent, erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-EI) can be recovered, (2) those (S+E-) from which only SFFV (but not CFU-EI) can be recovered, and (3) those (S-E-) from which neither SFFV nor CFU-EI can be recovered. There is a consistent association between the type of virus used to induce the erythroleukaemia and the class of the disease induced.","['Anand, R', 'Steeves, R']","['Anand R', 'Steeves R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Defective Viruses', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Helper Viruses', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/classification/*microbiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/classification/*microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', '*Rauscher Virus', 'Virus Replication']",,1980/08/07 00:00,1980/08/07 00:01,['1980/08/07 00:00'],"['1980/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/286615a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1980 Aug 7;286(5773):615-7. doi: 10.1038/286615a0.,,,,,,

Hindlimb hyperthermia reulted in steady-state rectal and femoral bone marrow and muscle temperatures of 42 degrees C and upper extremity muscle and esophagus temperatures of 41 degrees C. With this hyper thermia technique, the mouse spleen colony assay could be used to quantitate the lethality of hyperthermia and/or cis-dichloro-diammineplatinum(II) (cis-platinum) on clonogenic bone marrow and leukemia cells. Hyperthermia prior to cis-platinum administration increased cis-platinum inhibition of leukemia colony formation as much as 2 logs; however, antileukemia synergism ws greatest when cis-platinum administration immediately preceded hyperthermia and no evidence existd of synergism against normal bone marrow colonies.

The function of this modification is not known. We have found that DNA synthesized during chemically induced differentiation of friend erythroleukemia cells is hypomethylated, as measured by its ability to accept methyl groups transferred by homologous DNA methyltransferases in vitro. The extent of hypomethylation detected by this sensitive method is small, a decrease of less than 1.6 percent in 5-methylcytosine content. Hypomethylated DNA can be isolated from friend erythroleukemia cells grown in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, butyrate, hexamethylene-bis- acetamide, pentamethylene-bis acetamide, and ethionine. However, hypomethylated DNA is found only under conditions where differentiation is actually induced. DNA isolated from cells of a dimethyl sulfoxide- resistant subclone grown in the presence of that agent is not hypomethylated, although DNA of these cells becomes hypomethylated after growth in the presence of inducers that can trigger their differentiation. We also find that the DNA of friend erythroleukemia cells does not become hypomethylated when the cells are exposed to inducing agents in the presence of substances that inhibit differentiation. These results suggest a close link between genome modification by methylation and differentiation of friend erythroleukemia cells.","['Christman, J K', 'Weich, N', 'Schoenbrun, B', 'Schneiderman, N', 'Acs, G']","['Christman JK', 'Weich N', 'Schoenbrun B', 'Schneiderman N', 'Acs G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice']",PMC2111478,1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.86.2.366 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1980 Aug;86(2):366-70. doi: 10.1083/jcb.86.2.366.,,,,,,

A control, non-erythroleukemia cell line did not express cell surface blebs in the presence or absence of DMSO.

Nevertheless from the brief review given here it is obvious that even for radiation the data are meagre and often not appropriate to the problems of setting dose limits for the protection of radiation workers. ICRP derived a quantitative relationship between exposure and risk of cancer induction and used it to justify their recommended dose limits for exposure. This was done by proposing that the acceptable risk should be about 10(-4) per year. No doubt there will be many other views expressed on acceptable risk which is quite clearly a political issue. If other views prevail and an alternative value is adopted then the dose limit will have to be changed by reference to the dose-risk relationship. This new feature of radiological protection which follows automatically once a quantitative relationship between dose and risk has been recommended, does not seem to be widely recognised. The comparative method of assessing acceptability of actual radiation exposures by comparing cancer mortality data with other industries, does have the advantage that in principle the results of the comparison should be simple and understandable to workers, managers and the public. However, the one analysis of mortality data which is available for a group of radiation workers at Hanford, has lead to a considerable controversy over the method of analysis. The author thinks that the way ahead in radiological protection must lie in the study of cancer morbidity and mortality and not with the theoretical approach where predicted cancer mortality is compared with death rates from industrial accidents, which is the approach used by ICRP in Publication 26.","['Dolphin, G W']",['Dolphin GW'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Toxicol Suppl,Archives of toxicology.

Ecologic relationships between human leukemia, livestock populations and bovine lymphosarcoma were investigated. Iowa has higher rates than the national average for human leukemias. The lymphoid leukemias make up the majority of the excess leukemias. Excessive acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is seen in the ages under 20 years and over 60 years. The excess ALL is in males living in rural counties. There is no sex difference for chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), but there is a slight urban-rural differential. There is a high positive correlation between ALL in males and cattle density. This relationship is greater for daily cattle than for beef cattle. There is an additional positive relationship between counties with excessive ALL and the presence of dairy herds affected with bovine lymphosarcoma.","['Donham, K J', 'Berg, J W', 'Sawin, R S']","['Donham KJ', 'Berg JW', 'Sawin RS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Dairying', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iowa', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Density', 'Rural Population', 'Sex Factors']",,1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112979 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1980 Jul;112(1):80-92. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112979.,,,,,,

These cells can be induced to differentiate to morphologically and functionally mature granulocytes by incubation with a wide variety of compounds, including butyrate and hypoxanthine and polar planar compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide and hexamethylene bisacetamide. We have now found that retinoic acid (all-trans-retinoic acid) induces differentiation (as measured morphologically and by the ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium) of HL-60 at concentrations as low as 1 nM. Maximal differentiation (approximately 90%) occurs at 1 micro M, a concentration 1/500th to 1/160,000th the concentrations of butyrate (0.5 mM) and dimethyl sulfoxide (160 mM) that promote a similar increase in differentiation. Continuous exposure to retinoic acid is necessary for optimal differentiation, with the percentage of mature cells in the culture directly related to the length of time of exposure to retinoic acid. Retinoic acid and 13-cis-retinoic acid are equally effective in inducing differentiation of HL-60. Retinol (vitamin A), retinal, and retinyl acetate are approximately 1/1000th less potent. This study suggests that retinoids could provide a therapeutic tool in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, a disease that has been looked upon as primarily involving a block in myeloid differentiation, and indicates that retinoids, in addition to their well-characterized involvement in epithelial cell differentiation, may also be involved in the differentiation of certain hematopoietic cells.","['Breitman, T R', 'Selonick, S E', 'Collins, S J']","['Breitman TR', 'Selonick SE', 'Collins SJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Preleukemia/*pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC349521,1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.5.2936 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 May;77(5):2936-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.5.2936.,,,,,,

After treatment with 20-30 micro M AMS for 4 days, the cultures contained between 80 and 90% benzidine-positive cells. Stimulation of hemoglobin synthesis was dose and time dependent. Inosine had no stimulatory activity; however, when it was added to the medium together with AMS, erythroid differentiation was almost completely inhibited. The inhibitory effect of inosine on this potent inducer was also dose and time dependent. No cytotoxicity was observed with either compound, alone or in combination. Inhibition of AMS stimulation of erythroid differentiation was also observed in the presence of inosine monophosphate and poly(inosinic acid). Hypoxanthine had a dual effect. At high concentrations (500 microgram/ml) it acted as an inducer, but when added at low concentrations (20 microgram/ml) together with AMS it inhibited differentiation. These findings suggest there is a link between purine biosynthesis and the event(s) required to trigger differentiation.

So it is murmured by skeptics who hear the blasts of premature trumpeting heralding early therapeutic triumphs, and then, years later, strain to hear the nearly inaudible notes of guarded optimism that report long-term evaluations. But life has changed, dramatically, for the child with leukemia. In the past untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) had a median survival of 1-3 months from the time of diagnosis. The most common causes of death were hemorrhage and infection. Today, the majority of properly treated children with ALL and AML remain continuously disease-free for over 5 and over 1 year, respectively. More than a third of children with ALL may be curable (1). The successful long-term management of children with leukemia often depends on appropriate decisions by the physicians who first encounter these patients. This review is intended to assist them.","['Sallan, S E', 'Weinstein, H J']","['Sallan SE', 'Weinstein HJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Paediatrician,Paediatrician,0352330,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/etiology', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy/*therapy']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Paediatrician. 1980;9(2):56-67.,,,,,,

Although, in all the patients studied, leukocytes were found to contain glucocorticoid receptors, we failed to demonstrate any correlation between the level of binding sites and the in vitro or in vivo response to glucocorticoids. This absence of correlation could be in part explained by the marked heterogeneity of the steroid response demonstrated in leukocyte subpopulations.

Myeloid colony formation by granulocyte-macrophage-commited colony-forming cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia was not inhibited even by high concentrations of prostaglandin E and was independent of colony morphology. The altered sensitivity of leukemic colony-forming cells to prostaglandin E was observed at all stages of the disease and persisted following chemotherapy-induced reversion to a partial or complete Philadelphia chromosome-negative bone marrow status.

In the present work, granulocyte reserves and related mobilization functions have been sequentially assessed by the endotoxin stress assay during the preclinical and clinical phases of these hemopoietic disorders. Characteristic patterns of granulocyte reserve mobilization are described that reflect given stages of pathologic progression. For radiation-induced leukemia, a five stage pattern has been proposed. In contrast, a simple pattern of progressive, time-dependent contraction of granulocyte reserves and mobilization capacity was noted in the development of terminal aplastic anemia. Early preclinical phases of radiation-induced leukemia appear to involve an extensive depletion of the granulocyte reserves ((phase I) during the first approximately 200 days of exposure followed by a partial renewal of the reserves and associated mobilization functions approximately 200 and 400 days (phase II). Sustained, subnormal granulocyte mobilizations (phase III) following endotoxin stress typify the responses of dogs during the intermediate phase, whereas late preclinical, preleukemic stages (phase IV) are characterized by a further expansion of the reserves and in the mobilization capacities, particularly of the less mature granulocytes. Such late alterations in the pattern of granulocyte mobilization, together with other noted cellular aberrancies in the peripheral blood and marrow, appear to indicate leukemia (phase V) onset.","['Seed, T M', 'Cullen, S M', 'Kaspar, L V', 'Tolle, D V', 'Fritz, T E']","['Seed TM', 'Cullen SM', 'Kaspar LV', 'Tolle DV', 'Fritz TE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Granulocytes/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male']",,1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64979-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1980 Jul;56(1):42-51.,,,,,,

The framework recognizes the part played by the clinical-scientific community in the weighing of a new result provided by a clinical trial.

The analysis based on this value system reveals some limitations of the present clinical-trials mechanism, especially if success is defined exclusively in terms of cure, and other dimensions of the health system, such as explanatory, care, cost or prevention variables are neglected. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that: (a) If randomized clinical trials are to be ethically acceptable, they will necessarily yield a large proportion of null results. (b) Positive results from ethically acceptable clinical trials would be expected to have less impact than null results; unless this is the case, there will be a tendency to encourage false hopes.

Biological and molecular evidence for two distinct viral genomes.,1477-92,"Two distinct clones of Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV), differing in their erythroleukemic potential, are described. These isolates have been cloned free of their associated helper viruses and shown to be replication-defective. Both SFFV isolates have been rescued from rat fibroblast nonproducer cell clones with cloned replication-competent viruses, F-MuLVA and F-MuLVP, obtained from the anemia- or polycythemia-inducing isolates of Friend virus complex, respectively. These rescued viruses induce a rapid proliferative disease associated with the appearance of macroscopic spleen foci and splenomegaly. In addition, each is subject to regulation by the W, Steel (Sl), and Fv-2 host gene loci. These two isolates of SFFV can, however, be distinguished by both biological and molecular criteria. Friend SFFVP induces a rapid polycythemia associated with the appearance of large numbers of erythropoietin (EPO)-independent erythroid colony-forming cells in the marrow and spleen. In contrast, SFFVA induces a rapid anemia associated with a progressive decrease in the number of EPO-dependent erythroid colony-forming cells in marrow, and a rapid increase in the number of EPO-dependent erythroid colony-forming cells in spleen. Furthermore, the nature of the disease induced by the two isolates of SFFV is independent of the Friend helper virus: SFFVP, rescued from a nonproducer cell clone with either F-MuLVA or F0MuLVP, induced a polycythemic transformation, whereas SFFVA, rescued with either F-MuLVA or F-MuLVP, induced an anemic transformation. The two Friend SFFV isolates can also be discriminated on the basis of translational products encoded by their gag and env genes: SFFVP encodes the amino-terminal gag-gene protein p15, whereas SFFVA encodes the gag-gene proteins p15, p12, and p30. In addition, the SFFV isolates encode nonidentical 55,000-mol wt env gene-related proteins that can be distinguished by analysis of their methionine-containing tryptic peptides.","['MacDonald, M E', 'Reynolds, F H Jr', 'Van de Ven, W J', 'Stephenson, J R', 'Mak, T W', 'Bernstein, A']","['MacDonald ME', 'Reynolds FH Jr', 'Van de Ven WJ', 'Stephenson JR', 'Mak TW', 'Bernstein A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Anemia/microbiology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells/microbiology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Genes, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Polycythemia/microbiology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",PMC2185875,1980/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1980/06/01 00:00'],"['1980/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1980/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.151.6.1477 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1980 Jun 1;151(6):1477-92. doi: 10.1084/jem.151.6.1477.,,,,,,

Therapeutically synergistic effect was observed either definitely against 1- or 2-day-old Lewis lung carcinoma and 6-day-old L1210 leukemia or moderately against 1-day-old B16 melanoma. Single intravenous treatment on day 7 after subcutaneous implantation of Lewis lung carcinoma, when the tumors had already metastasized to the lungs, produced a significant regression of tumor and a significant increment in survival time of tumor-bearing mice. In comparative studies, the combination of ACNU and 6-thioguanine showed a greater and a wider spectrum of antitumor activities against these tumors than those obtained by the combination with ACNU and a single dose of 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, or 6-mercaptopurine. Increment in lethal toxicity for normal and tumor-bearing mice was not observed by the combination of ACNU and 6-thioguanine in contrast to definite increases in this toxicity by the combination of ACNU and 5-fluorouracil.

Neurotoxicity was insidious and hardly reversible. Patients with liver dysfunction appeared to develop more neurotoxicity. Other toxic effects included a decrease in hemoglobin level, transient hepatic dysfunction, cellulitis or phlebitis at the iv site, stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting.

Two previously established cell lines, a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, B35M, and a B-lymphoblastoid cell line, B411-4, derived from a hematologically normal person, were used for comparison. Ten million cells were needed in order for the BALM-2 cell line to grow with 74% success in the immunosuppressed mice, but 1000 million cells were needed in order for the NALM-1 cell line to grow with 74% success in those mice. As in the case of the BALM-2 line, 10 million cells of the B35M cell line were needed for 100% success in heterotransplantation, whereas 30 million cells of the B411-4 cell line resulted in 20% success of heterotransplantation. In a semisolid agarose (0.15%) medium, the cloning efficiencies of BALM-2, B35M, and B411-4 were 1.52--2.08, 26.31--38.46, and 0.09--0.12, respectively. With as many as 25,000 cells per well plated, NALM-1 did not produce any colonies in the semisolid agarose medium.

Recently, a 52% incidence of abnormal computed tomography (CT) brain scans was found in asymptomatic children with ALL whose CNS prophylaxis consisted of CRT and either IT MTX or intrathecal cytosine arabinoside (IT Ara-C). In the present study, CT brain scans were studied in 43 asymptomatic children with ALL in continuous complete remission. The CNS prophylaxis consisted of IT MTX alone in 10 patients and IT MTX combined with intermediate-dose intravenous MTX in 33 patients. No patient had received CRT. The patients' ages at the time of diagnosis ranged from 22 months to 17 years, 7 months. The time interval from completion of CNS prophylaxis to CT scanning ranged from ten to 59 months. Only one CT scan was clearly abnormal; it showed mildly dilated ventricles and visualization of the cortical sulci. The CT scans of 7 additional patients were classified as abnormal because of borderline dilatation of the lateral ventricles (3 patients) and/or visualization of the cortical sulci (7 patients). No patient demonstrated areas of decreased cerebral attenuation coefficient or intracerebral calcification--findings previously ascribed to the use of methotrexate. Clinical leukoencephalopathy has not been observed in any of our patients. This would suggest that MTX alone in the absence of CNS leukemia or CRT is highly unlikely to produce structural CNS abnormalities detectable by CT.","['Ochs, J J', 'Berger, P', 'Brecher, M L', 'Sinks, L F', 'Kinkel, W', 'Freeman, A I']","['Ochs JJ', 'Berger P', 'Brecher ML', 'Sinks LF', 'Kinkel W', 'Freeman AI']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*diagnostic imaging', 'Brain Diseases/diagnosis', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19800501)45:9<2274::aid-cncr2820450909>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1980 May 1;45(9):2274-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19800501)45:9<2274::aid-cncr2820450909>3.0.co;2-6.,,,,,,

Mean neutrophil counts were lower in the intermittent group and fell significantly at 6 week intervals, after courses which included prednisolone and vincristine in addition to methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. Mean lymphocyte counts, mitotic response to phytohaemagglutinin and plasma immunoglobulin levels were significantly lower in the continuous group. The results in the intermediate group fell between those of the other two groups. All six remission deaths occurred in the 42 patients in the continuous group, who had a much higher incidence of infections (mostly viral and protozoal) than the other two groups.

In seven of nine CML patients, but not in controls, total histamine content of separated peripheral blood cells suspended in a modified Marbrook system was shown to rise after 7 d in vitro. Further study showed that both histamine (mean, five-fold increase) and basophils (mean, three-fold increase) were significantly elevated over control values at 1, 2 and 3 weeks in vitro. Total cell-associated histamine content (in pg per 100 viable cells) was greater in CML cultures than in controls at 3 weeks (P less than 0.01). Serial cultures of cells from one patient revealed substantial in vitro rises in basophils and histamine at an accelerated, but not at a chronic, phase of disease. Cells from this patient and two others studied at the time of blast crisis demonstrated higher indices of basophil and histamine increases when compared to the group of CML patients in chronic phases of the disease (P less than 0.05).

Thirty-nine newly diagnosed patients with AGL underwent cytocentrifuge examination of cerebral spinal fluid. Seven of the 39 patients had blast cells in their cerebral spinal fluid. All seven of these patients had acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML). No patients with other variants of AGL demonstrated blast cells in their cerebral spinal fluid. Other high risk factors associated with meningeal infiltration were elevated serum lysozyme levels, high peripheral white blood cell count, low age, splemomegaly and the presence of infiltration in other organs. The admission rates for patients with meningeal leukemia were lower and the survival time was shorter than in both the 32 noninvolved patients and the noninvolved patients with AMML.

Either one of the viruses induced, at 7-10 days after infection, a massive increase in the number of BFU-Es in peripheral blood, in parallel with their depletion in tibial marrow and increase in spleen. A comparable increase in the blood BFU-E number was observed in splenectomized FLV-infected mice. These results indicate a marrow-spleen migration of BFU-Es. In spleen, the increase of the BFU-E number was associated with an increase in the CFU-E pool. In tibial marrow, a sequence of expansion/depletion waves occurred reciprocally at the level of BFU-E and CFU-E. The cycling of BFU-E([(3)H]thymidine in vitro suicide index) in marrow, blood, and spleen was enhanced, whereas that of CFU-E and CFU-C showed little or no modification. These kinetic data suggest that the main target cell of FLV may be the BFU-E or a closely related element. In plates without added erythropoietin (but containing it in fetal calf serum), expression of CFU-E from FLV-P-treated animals was maximal; that of CFU-E from FLV-A-injected mice was either virtually absent or only slight in marrow or spleen, respectively. BFU-E growth always was fully dependent upon erythropoietin addition. Control studies in FLV-infected resistant mice and in susceptible mice given diluted or heat-inactivated virus provide convincing evidence that the phenomena described are induced by FLV.","['Peschle, C', 'Migliaccio, G', 'Lettieri, F', 'Migliaccio, A R', 'Ceccarelli, R', 'Barba, P', 'Titti, F', 'Rossi, G B']","['Peschle C', 'Migliaccio G', 'Lettieri F', 'Migliaccio AR', 'Ceccarelli R', 'Barba P', 'Titti F', 'Rossi GB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Spleen/pathology']",PMC348650,1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.4.2054 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Apr;77(4):2054-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.4.2054.,,,,,,

The nonproducer cells were inoculated into the tails of athymic nude mice that were subsequently incubated at 28 or 36 degrees C. CP27-infected cells induced tumors only at 28 degrees C, whereas cells infected with wild-type Moloney sarcoma virus were tumorigenic at both temperatures. Tumors induced at 28 degrees C by wild-type virus-infected cells grew faster after shift of the mice to 36 degrees C. In contrast, tumors induced by CP27-infected cells regressed upon shift to 36 degrees C, indicating that continuous expression of viral functions is required for persistence and growth of the tumors. After regression, secondary tumor growth was observed late after upshift of temperature-sensitive tumors. Cells recovered from these late-appearing tumors were tumorigenic at the nonpermissive temperature, and tumors induced by these cells did not regress after upshift. Virus rescued from these recovered cells retained the temperature-sensitivity for focus formation, indicating that the occurrence of the phenotypically wild-type cells was due to host cell modifications rather than to reversion of the CP27 genome.","['Klarlund, J K', 'Forchhammer, J']","['Klarlund JK', 'Forchhammer J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous', 'Rats', '*Temperature']",PMC348523,1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.3.1501 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Mar;77(3):1501-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.3.1501.,,,,,,

Human chromosome 16, which has been shown to bear the human alpha-globin genes, is introduced by cell fusion into mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells to generate continuously proliferating cell lines that retain permanently the human alpha-globin genes. We have shown that hybrid diploid MEL cells with human alpha-globin genes from erythroid donor cells express these genes fully through globin chain synthesis, while hybrid diploid MEL cells containing human alpha-globin genes from non-erythroid human haematopoietic donor cells contain very low levels of human alpha-globin mRNA and no detectable human alpha-globin chains. The levels of human alpha-globin mRNA in these hybrid cells were found to depend on factors present in the MEL recipient cell as well as on the differentiated state of the human donor cell, suggesting that this system may be suitable for characterisation of mechanisms governing haematopoietic differentiation in man.","['Deisseroth, A', 'Bode, U', 'Fontana, J', 'Hendrick, D']","['Deisseroth A', 'Bode U', 'Fontana J', 'Hendrick D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,['9004-22-2 (Globins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Hybrid Cells', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice']",,1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/285036a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1980 May 1;285(5759):36-8. doi: 10.1038/285036a0.,,,,,,

Little difference in survival was noted regardless of the route of inoculation. A decrease in hamatocrit occurred in all SCL rats during approximately the final 48 hours of the disease; however, the anemia was more severe in SC- and IP-inoculated terminal rats than in SCL rats inoculated IV. A reduction in the numbers of normal cellular elements was noted in the femoral bone marrow of most terminal rats studied which was found to correlate inversely with the leukemic blast cell content of the marrow. No correlation was observed between the erythroblast content of the marrow and the degree of anemia. The number of erythroblasts varied from greatly reduced to normal in terminal SCL rats despite severe anemia. Moreover, the greatest reduction of both normal marrow cellularity and erythroblast numbers was observed in IV inoculated rats which consistently displayed the highest hematocrits in the terminal stage of the disease. Thus, the terminal anemia appears to be due primarily to excessive red cell loss. The decrease in erythroblasts, when observed, was most striking in the orthochromatophilic and polychromatophilic stages of erythroid maturation.","['Derelanko, M J', 'Khouri, J A', 'Lobue, J', 'Gordon, A S']","['Derelanko MJ', 'Khouri JA', 'Lobue J', 'Gordon AS']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Rats']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jso.2930130402 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 1980;13(4):275-86. doi: 10.1002/jso.2930130402.,,,,,,

In an attempt to investigate its applicability in human leukemias we have studied glucocorticoid receptors in the leukemic cells from 23 patients with various hematologic neoplasias and in the lymphocytes from 18 normal donors. Specific glucocorticoid binding in intact cells was determined by a whole cell competitive binding assay. Normal lymphocytes have about 4,611 specific binding sites per cell. The blasts from 9 patients with acute myelogenous leukemias (AML) have strongly varying high levels of specific binding sites, ranging from 4,817 to 15,416 per cell. Of the 13 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 5 have received glucocorticoid treatment for years and were clinically resistant to glucocorticoid. Their lymphocytes have lower specific binding sites (range: 2,047 to 3,999) than the other CLL cases which were newly diagnosed (range: 3,734 to 11,020).

Fractions obtained in this way were plated in methyl cellulose with a growth stimulator present in media conditioned by leukocytes in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (PHA-LCM). Colonies of blast cells form under these conditions. Pooled cell suspensions from such colonies were plated in microwells; the plating efficiency of such suspensions is a measure of blast progenitor self-renewal occurring in the original blast colonies. Self-renewal assays on each fraction indicated that self renewal among blast progenitors is heterogeneously distributed with subpopulations differing in renewal capacities. The results are consistent with the view that blast cell subpopulations in AML undergo a series of transitions associated with decreasing self renewal capacity, analogous to that observed in normal hemopoiesis, where proliferative capacity decreases with increasing differentiation.","['Chang, L J', 'Till, J E', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Chang LJ', 'Till JE', 'McCulloch EA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Cell Count', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukocytes', 'Phytohemagglutinins']",,1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041020213 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1980 Feb;102(2):217-22. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041020213.,,,,,,

The compounds differed in their ability to induce specific differentiation-associated properties. Effectiveness of induction of Fc and C3 rosettes was of the order actinomycin C greater than cytosine arabinoside greater than mitomycin-C greater than adriamycin greater than bromodeoxyuridine greater than hydroxyurea. Induction of rosettes by actinomycin-D required a 8212-fold lower concentration than induction by hydroxyurea. All these compounds, except bromodeoxyuridine, induced the synthesis and secretion of lysozyme with the same order of effectiveness as for rosettes, but only actinomycin-D and to a lesser extent bromodeoxyuridine induced the formation of mature granulocytes. Vincristine induced only a small increase in lysozyme. The results indicate that actinomycin-D was the most potent inducer of differentiation in these human myeloid leukemic cells. It is suggested that pre-screening of individual patients for the most effective compounds that can induce differentiation of their myeloid leukemic cells in culture, may prove beneficial for treatment in a form of chemotherapy based on the induction of normal differentiation in leukemic cells.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Complement C3', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'Muramidase/biosynthesis', 'Rosette Formation']",,1980/05/15 00:00,1980/05/15 00:01,['1980/05/15 00:00'],"['1980/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910250503 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1980 May 15;25(5):561-4. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910250503.,,,,,,

The assay procedure was based on enzymes oxidizing polyamines isolated from Russell's viper venom. Serial determination of polyamines in the sera of eight cases of Hodgkin's disease done before and after chemotherapy or radiotherapy showed positive correlation with clinical status of the disease. Analysis of individual polyamines in four patients with Hodgkin's disease indicated that putrescine may be a more sensitive marker of the diseased state. By the present method it was undetected in the control sera but rose significantly in the sera of patients with Hodgkin's disease. Overall data suggest that serum polyamines may be useful as indicators of onset of relapse in patients with Hodgkin's disease and could thus be helpful in early start of treatment.","['Hospattankar, A V', 'Advani, S H', 'Vaidya, N R', 'Electricwalla, S E', 'Braganca, B M']","['Hospattankar AV', 'Advani SH', 'Vaidya NR', 'Electricwalla SE', 'Braganca BM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Venoms)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Lymphoma/*blood', 'Male', 'Methods', 'Oxidoreductases', 'Polyamines/*blood', 'Putrescine/blood', 'Spermidine/blood', 'Spermine/blood', 'Venoms/enzymology']",,1980/04/15 00:00,1980/04/15 00:01,['1980/04/15 00:00'],"['1980/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910250407 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1980 Apr 15;25(4):463-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910250407.,,,,,,

A single in vitro exposure of the sensitive tumor cells to a cytotoxic concentration of melphalan was not accompanied by a change in modal number but resulted in chromatid exchange. No alterations were found in resistant tumor cells which were exposed to the same drug concentration. However, exposure of resistant tumor cells to higher doses of melphalan resulted in chromatid breaks, chromatid gaps and the formation of acentric chromosomes. The resistant tumor, transplanted once without drug injection, maintained a sharp mode of 40 chromosomes.","['Schuette, B P', 'Rabinovitz, M', 'Vistica, D T']","['Schuette BP', 'Rabinovitz M', 'Vistica DT']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Genetic Markers', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-3835(80)90150-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(80)90150-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1980 Feb;8(4):335-41. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(80)90150-0.,,,,,,

There were 107 myeloblastic, 10 promyelocytic, 142 lymphocytic, and 37 undifferentiated leukemias, Forty-five cases at age 3 represented the peak. These long-term survivors have shown a yearly increase in number. In 1972, the number of childhood ALL cases reached 38 with no great changes in ANLL cases. With respect to prognosis among long-term survivors, it seemed that neither type of leukemia nor age at diagnosis were factors influencing the future survival. CNS relapse occurring before the third year was an unfavorable complication for a prognosis beyond five years. Only 8 patients died of leukemia among 155 patients who reached five years in their initial complete remission; 49 of 90 patients who had relapse within five years after diagnosis died of leukemia. From these findings, it seems very important to follow patients for five years in their initial complete remission.","['Kawashima, K', 'Suzuki, H', 'Yamada, K', 'Kato, Y', 'Watanabe, E', 'Morishima, Y', 'Takeyama, H', 'Kobayashi, M']","['Kawashima K', 'Suzuki H', 'Yamada K', 'Kato Y', 'Watanabe E', 'Morishima Y', 'Takeyama H', 'Kobayashi M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors']",,1980/04/15 00:00,1980/04/15 00:01,['1980/04/15 00:00'],"['1980/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19800415)45:8<2181::aid-cncr2820450829>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1980 Apr 15;45(8):2181-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19800415)45:8<2181::aid-cncr2820450829>3.0.co;2-9.,,,,,,

The rate of CR was 52%. Maintenance therapy was very simple and the only association with stanozolol during this period suggested to us that an androgen, at low dosages, might be responsible for the unusual long-term survival time (45 months with a 95% confidence limit from 30 to 86 months). On the basis of our first observation, high dosages of the androgen were used during the induction phase of treatment but failed to demonstrate any advantage when associated with a drug regimen, including cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). The reevaluation of each parameter for our group of patients did not allow selection of patients in terms of their age or the hematologic data obtained at presentation. Effects of androgen on the socalled normal hemopoietic cells and on the leukemic cells are discussed, particularly the possible antagonistic effect with ARA-C. A prospective statement is made concerning the possible condition of the prolongation of the complete remission in AML according to some experimental data which enforce the stimulative activity of androgen on the myeloid proliferation.","['Hollard, D', 'Sotto, J J', 'Berthier, R', 'Leger, J', 'Michallet, M']","['Hollard D', 'Sotto JJ', 'Berthier R', 'Leger J', 'Michallet M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4R1VB9P8V3 (Stanozolol)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Stanozolol/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Virilism/chemically induced']",,1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19800401)45:7<1540::aid-cncr2820450705>3.0.co;2-# [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1980 Apr 1;45(7):1540-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19800401)45:7<1540::aid-cncr2820450705>3.0.co;2-#.,,,,,,

The inhibition of hemoglobin production was due to an inhibition of globin mRNA accumulation. Heme can partially overcome the effects of the lymphoma X chromosome and induce globin mRNA and hemoglobin accumulation in the dimethylsulfoxide-treated hybrid cells. The data suggests that the X chromosome contributed by the lymphoma cells inhibits hemoglobin production by inhibiting both inducible globin mRNA accumulation as well as inducible heme biosynthesis, most likely at a step after the formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid. The properties of erythroleukemia x lymphoma cell hybrids are compared with those of a series of erythroleukemia x bone marrow cell hybrids.

In addition, labelled and unlabelled neutrophils showed a linear and parallel increase of LAP activity during the 24 h following cortisol injection.

Transmission electron microscopic observations of thin-sectioned cells suggested that this increased RNA content in ANT-treated cells was mostly due to an approximately 50% increased cell diameter and partly due to a disproportionate increase in nucleolar size.

This finding demonstrates that higher doses of MTX delivered by liposomes could be potentially useful in overcoming drug-transport resistance.","['Todd, J A', 'Levine, A M', 'Tokes, Z A']","['Todd JA', 'Levine AM', 'Tokes ZA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Ions)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Ions', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes/*administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/metabolism']",,1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1980 Apr;64(4):715-9.,,,,,,

Neutralization rates of the two viruses differed in the presence of monospecific anti-gp70 antiserum and sera from regressed or immunized mice. Neutralization of regressing Friend virus, but not conventional Friend virus, occurred when the viruses were incubated with anti-p15(E) and complement. Human serum inactivated conventional Friend virus more rapidly than regressing Friend virus, probably as a result of virolysis induced by the reaction of viral p15(E) with human complement component C1. Structural differences between the viruses were detected in their gp70 viral glycoproteins and p15(E) and p12 proteins. Analysis of different stocks and clonal isolates of the viruses showed that the differences between the gp70 and p15(E), but not the p12 proteins, were associated with the regressing phenotype of the regressing strain of Friend virus.","['Furmanski, P', 'Longley, C', 'Bolles, C S', 'Hines, D L', 'Dietz, M']","['Furmanski P', 'Longley C', 'Bolles CS', 'Hines DL', 'Dietz M']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*analysis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology/pathology', '*Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis/immunology']",PMC288641,1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.33.3.1083-1096.1980 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1980 Mar;33(3):1083-96. doi: 10.1128/JVI.33.3.1083-1096.1980.,,,,,,

Sequences representing the defective component of FV continued to be transcribed in cells regardless of virus production.

Molecular hybridization with cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA extracted from the H-2 congenic clones representing various stages of viral expression demonstrated a direct correlation between the level of transcription of FMuLV-specific sequences and the degree of virus expression.

These characteristics are similar to those of the formyl peptide chemotactic receptor on human peripheral blood neutrophils. The relative potencies of a series of synthetic peptides in inhibiting binding to the HL-60 cell receptor correlate closely with their potencies in inhibiting binding to the peripheral neutrophil receptor. However, whereas all peripheral human neutrophils display the receptor, only a subpopulation of the cultured cells will bind and internalize tetramethylrhodamine-labeled N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys.

(1976) J. Virol. 30, 564-573]. Several lines of evidence suggest that a small proportion of the gp55 in infected cells is located on the surface membranes. First, different nonproducer cell lines infected with cloned Friend spleen focus-forming virus were efficiently killed in the presence of complement by cytotoxic antisera that react with gp55. Furthermore, a clone of cells selected for resistance to the cytotoxic antibody synthesized an altered intracellular form of gp55. This immunoselection procedure appears to also be useful for isolating glycoprotein mutants of other RNA tumor viruses. Analysis of cell surface proteins labeled with [125I]iodine supported the idea that gp55 occurs on the plasma membranes. However, the cell surface gp55 had more highly processed oligosaccharides than the majority of the gp55, which occurs within the infected cells. In addition, we have found that leukemia cells from mice infected with the erythroleukemic Rauscher virus complex contain a membrane glycoprotein that appears similar to the gp55 encoded by Friend spleen focus-forming virus. The encoding of similar glycoproteins by independently isolated acute erythroleukemia viruses suggests that these glycoproteins may be important in leukemogenesis.","['Kabat, D', 'Ruta, M', 'Murray, M J', 'Polonoff, E']","['Kabat D', 'Ruta M', 'Murray MJ', 'Polonoff E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/immunology', '*Genes, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",PMC348207,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.1.57 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Jan;77(1):57-61. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.1.57.,,,,,,

At 0.1-1.0 microgram/ml, it induced differentiation of both HL-60 and M1 cells, characterized by increase in phagocytic cells and changes to resemble mature myeloid cells. Fc receptors were also induced in M1 but not in HL-60 cells; induction of intracellular lysozyme activity was not detected in either HL-60 or M1 cells. With this concentration of tunicamycin, there was marked decrease in rate of incorporation of radioactive glucosamine into macromolecules and a decrease in the rate of DNA synthesis.

The results also indicate that induction of phagocytosis in both HL-60 and M1 myeloid leukemia cells and of Fc receptors in M1 cells does not require continued synthesis of the oligosaccharide portions of cellular proteins by the lipid-linked pathway.","['Nakayasu, M', 'Terada, M', 'Tamura, G', 'Sugimura, T']","['Nakayasu M', 'Terada M', 'Tamura G', 'Sugimura T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Glucosamine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Fc/metabolism', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology']",PMC348280,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.1.409 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Jan;77(1):409-13. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.1.409.,,,,,,

The authors compared the platelet volume of these patients by use of peak platelet volume (PPV or mode of the platelet volume), mean platelet volume (MPV) and the percent of large platelets (PLP) as parameters of the platelet volume, and then studied the relationship between the platelet volume and the specific gravity of platelets from these patients. The following was the platelet volume of normal children: PPV was 6.7 +/- 1.1 micrometer 3, MPV was 9.9 +/- 1.6 micrometer 3, PLP was 26.0 +/- 7.7%. All parameters of the platelet volume were remarkably large in chronic ITP, but only PPV was small in acute ITP. On the other hand, all parameters were small in both aplastic anemia and acute leukemia. In acute ITP and chronic ITP, the platelet volume returned to normal value after these thrombocytopenias disappeared. The platelet volume, however, still remained small even after remission in acute leukemia. There was better correlation between MPV and PLP than PPV and PLP. The density analysis of the platelets obtained from platelet-rich plasma (PRP) revealed that PLP in each medium (1.010 approximately 1.052) of normal PRP increased slowly in proportion to the increase of specific density of the media. On the contrary, most of large platelets obtained from the patients with acute ITP and chronic ITP were especially contained in the medium of high specific density (1.052). Large platelets of aplastic anemia and acute leukemia, however, were found in both low and high density media. The authors believe that analysis of the platelet volume using above mentioned three parameters would provide good weapon in early differential diagnosos of acute ITP, chronic ITP, and aplastic anemia. And these findings also may suggest the difference of thrombopoiesis between acute ITP and chronic ITP.","['Tomita, E', 'Akatsuka, J I', 'Kokubun, Y']","['Tomita E', 'Akatsuka JI', 'Kokubun Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*blood', '*Blood Platelets', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic/*blood']",,1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-198002000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1980 Feb;14(2):133-7. doi: 10.1203/00006450-198002000-00013.,,,,,,

A check conducted in 90 children treated between 1966--1975 yields a correlation only between a very short pre-diagnostic duration of signs (less than 2 weeks) and the duration of the first complete remission (as well as the survival time). However, even those prognostic factors which are already generally recognised, possess merely limited reliability, because they do not take the individual response to therapy into account. Hence, improvement of prognosis of the course of the disease can be expected only if the continuous decrease of the remaining population of blasts during the early phase of remission can be determined with greater accuracy than before.","['Schwenk, H U', 'Seiler, G', 'Engelhardt, K', 'Kuhner, U']","['Schwenk HU', 'Seiler G', 'Engelhardt K', 'Kuhner U']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1033857 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1980 Jan;192(1):39-44. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1033857.,,Prognostische Faktoren bei der akuten Lymphoblastenleukamie--unter besonderer Berucksichtigung der pradiagnostischen Symptomendauer.,,,,

In seven of 28 patients (25%), the numbers of leukemic cell colonies grown in culture were reduced to 21% of control by the addition of L-ascorbic acid (0.3 mM) to the culture medium. Glutathione did not suppress leukemic cell colonies although it has a similar oxidation-reduction potential to that of L-ascorbic acid. The addition of L-ascorbic acid reduced the pH of the medium. However, a comparable reduction of pH by the addition of HCl did not suppress leukemic cell colonies. In simultaneous cultures for leukemic and normal marrow cells, the suppression of leukemic cell colony was noted with a concentration of L-ascorbic acid as low as 0.1 mM (a concentration achievable in vivo), but normal myeloid colonies were not suppressed until the concentration of L-ascorbic acid reached an extremely high level (1 mM). In conclusion, growth of leukemic cells in culture was suppressed by L-ascorbic acid in a substantial proportion of patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. This suppression was a specific effect of L-ascorbic acid and was not due to its oxidation-reduction potential or pH change. Leukemic cells were selectively affected at an L-ascorbic acid concentration attainable in vivo while normal hemopoietic cells were not suppressed.","['Park, C H', 'Amare, M', 'Savin, M A', 'Hoogstraten, B']","['Park CH', 'Amare M', 'Savin MA', 'Hoogstraten B']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ascorbic Acid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Apr;40(4):1062-5.,,,,,,

The drug-antibody conjugates were then tested against myelosarcomas made up of K-562 cells growing in nude mice and their efficacy was compared with that of the drug alone, gamma-globulins, a mixture of the two, or conjugates of drugs with normal goat gamma-globulin. Conjugation methods for methotrexate and daunomycin abrogate the antibody activity as indicated by the absence of complement-mediated cytotoxicity of the conjugates in vitro and the lack of effect on myelosarcomas in vivo. Simultaneous administration of either of these drugs and antibody partially abrogated the development of myelosarcomas. Chlorambucil-antibody conjugates, however, retained their cytotoxicity in vitro and were found effective in vivo. It is the first successful attempt to covalently bind chlorambucil to gamma-globulins without the loss of drug or antibody biological activity. Although the simultaneous administration of chlorambucil and gamma-globulins and conjugated drug gamma-globulins reduced the growth of myelosarcomas considerably, the immune gamma-globulins alone either reduced their weight to a larger degree or eliminated their growth completely. Results of this study indicate that myelosarcomas made up of K-562 cells grown in nude mice are good and reproducible models for testing various therapeutic agents. The advantage of using human cells proliferating in an in vivo environment brings experimental therapy one step closer to clinical trials.","['Latif, Z A', 'Lozzio, B B', 'Wust, C J', 'Krauss, S', 'Aggio, M C', 'Lozzio, C B']","['Latif ZA', 'Lozzio BB', 'Wust CJ', 'Krauss S', 'Aggio MC', 'Lozzio CB']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*administration & dosage', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,1980/03/15 00:00,1980/03/15 00:01,['1980/03/15 00:00'],"['1980/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19800315)45:6<1326::aid-cncr2820450610>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1980 Mar 15;45(6):1326-33. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19800315)45:6<1326::aid-cncr2820450610>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (L1-2) was characterized by moderately increased RNA of G0/1 cells as compared to normal lymphocytes; acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (M 1-5) by very high RNA of G0/G1 cells. Both had either diploid or aneuploid DNA stemlines. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed diploid DNA, very low proliferation, and low RNA, similar to that found by use to be typical for normal B cells. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, two cell populations were distinguished, one with high RNA, the other with very low RNA and elongated nuclear diameter due to stripped, unfolded nuclei of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The number of leukemic blast cells, identified by aneuploid DNA values, correlates well with conventional microscopy counts and could be followed during the course of treatment. Thus, acridine orange flow cytometry can be used to discriminate subtypes of human leukemias, to determine cell cycle stages, and to detect and monitor aneuploid leukemia stemlines.","['Andreeff, M', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Sharpless, T K', 'Clarkson, B D', 'Melamed, M R']","['Andreeff M', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Sharpless TK', 'Clarkson BD', 'Melamed MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Separation', '*DNA', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Monocytes', '*RNA']",,1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72904-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1980 Feb;55(2):282-93.,,,,,,

In addition, the value of central nervous system prophylaxis (CNS-P) in adults has been assumed, but not established in a systematic fashion. The Southeastern Cancer Study Group has completed a prospective study in which the use of vincristine plus low-dose methotrexate and high-dose prednisone in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia has produced an 80% (79/99) complete remission rate in patients age 15 yr and over. Younger patients had a significantly higher remission rate but no increase in remission duration. This induction regimen was associated with minimal toxicity. Random assignment to CNS-P or to no prophylaxis, after a multidrug consolidation regimen, has demonstrated a significant prolongation of CNS relapse-free interval (p=0.008) in favor of CNS-P. CNS-P did not improve hematologic remission duration or survival. All complete remitters were maintained on mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide with pulses of prednisone and vincristine; the median time from remission to either hematologic or CNS relapse was 19.3 mo after CNS-P, and survival for these patients was 26.1 mo.

Hyperleukocytosis was very frequent and was significantly correlated with increased blood and urine levels of lysozyme, with renal failure and hypokalemia, and with coagulation abnormalities.

Attitudes toward cancer have altered, as seen by the rapid growth of the oncology specialty as well as the willingness of the community to allow those with cancer to return to a viable status. Even the individual who must face end-stage disease can now rest comfortably in the privacy of his or her own home, surrounded by loved ones. Improved nutritional efforts during periods of active therapy are reducing the side effects and improving the tolerance of highly cytotoxic drugs. Thus, acute episodes of treatment are shortened, allowing for earlier discharge. Individuals are demanding accurate information regarding their disease and its treatment. Patients are catalysts for their own recovery as they become more active participants in their care. Some are even choosing not to undergo suggested therapies and are returning home to put their lives in order and let disease processes take their natural course, even until death. As for leukemia, more supportive measures such as blood component therapy and evaluative work-ups are being offered on an outpatient basis. Patients are learning self-care measures to counteract or minimize side effects to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Thus, overwhelming infection is of less risk and hospitalization is shortened. Infection, especially from Staphylococcus aureus, still remains a major cause of death of patients with leukemia. However, one must consider how prevalent this organism is in the hospital environment.

(2) CDPcholine:diradylglycerol cholinephosphotransferases exhibit a strong preference for alkylacylglycerols with cis-8, cis-9 and cis-10-octadecenyl moieties, but no preference for the double bond position in the trans-octadecenylacylglycerols.

The rate of lymphocyte protein synthesis was lowered in a wide range (2-8-fold), in most of patients (7 out of 8).

Sixty-four isoaccepting species of tRNA for 16 amino acids were resolved by RPC-5 chromatography. The relative amounts of tRNAphe, tRNAile, and tRNAval species were maintained by the cells during differentiation; whereas the relative amounts of some of the isoacceptor tRNAs for the other 13 amino acids changed significantly. Fluctuations in amounts of isoacceptors occurred between 36 and 72 hr after addition of dimethysulfoxide, corresponding to globin mRNA appearance and hemoglobin synthesis, respectively. In most cases, thepredominant tRNA isoacceptors of uninduced cells were retained throughout differentiation. Notable exceptions were tRNA species for threonine, proline, and methionine. Some of the isoacceptors occurring in relatively smaller amounts were not expressed at all times. These changes possibly reflect the cell's functional adaptation of tRNA in differentiation for hemoglobin synthesis.","['Lin, V K', 'Agris, P F']","['Lin VK', 'Agris PF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'RNA, Transfer/*metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl/isolation & purification']",PMC324164,1980/08/11 00:00,1980/08/11 00:01,['1980/08/11 00:00'],"['1980/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/11 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/8.15.3467 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1980 Aug 11;8(15):3467-80. doi: 10.1093/nar/8.15.3467.,['IR01 CA16327/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

A phase I study was undertaken in 10 patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. Dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. With a median dose of 90 mg/m2 (75-148 mg/m2), median lowest WBC count was 1,000/mm3 (100-3,200) on day 11 and its recovery up to 4,000/mm3 was seen on day 21, while lowest platelet count was 42 X 10(3)/mm3 (7-300 X 10(3) on day 12 and its recovery up to 100 X 10(3)/mm3 was on day 20. Non-hematological toxicities were nausea (39%), vomiting (11%) and phlebitis (17%) in 18 courses of therapy. The result indicated that the recommended dose schedule for a phase II evaluation was 90 mg/m2, every three weeks. Therapeutic activity was observed in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (one partial response and two minor responses out of four). Two out of five breast, one ovarian, and one melanoma patients showed stable diseases. Five leukemic patients (three AMLs, one MoL, and one blastic CML) were treated with AMSA, and in these cases cytoreduction of peripheral and bone marrow blasts was seen, but it was not adequate to induce remission.

They must, therefore, call upon genes already present in the target cell. We have recently explored the possibility that these host genes share homology with specific nucleic acid sequences present in some of the known retroviruses. In one set of experiments we used a cloned DNA probe prepared from the oncogene (v-mos) of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV) to examine the state of integration, methylation, and transcription of the homologous cellular oncogene (c-mos) in normal murine cells and in murine cells transformed by radiation or chemical carcinogens. We found that in the transformed cells the c-mos sequence has not undergone rearrangement within the host genome and, as in normal cells, this sequence is hypermethylated and transcriptionally silent. These results are in sharp contrast to the situation in cells transformed by Mo-MSV in which the exogenous v-mos sequence is integrated at new sites within the host genome, is undermethylated and is extensively transcribed. In related studies, we have found that another one gene, c-ras (H), also fails to show any evidence for rearrangement in carcinogen or radiation transformed C3H 10T1/2 cells. Since there is evidence that eukaryotic cells contain numerous onc genes our results do not rule out the possibility that onc genes other than c-mos and c-ras (H) may play a role in the transformation of murine cells by chemicals or radiation. Additional studies utilizing probes to other onc genes are required to evaluate this possibility.","['Weinstein, I B', 'Gattoni-Celli, S', 'Kirschmeier, P', 'Dina, D']","['Weinstein IB', 'Gattoni-Celli S', 'Kirschmeier P', 'Dina D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Carcinogens', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/genetics/microbiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', '*Oncogenes/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1982;12:139-51.,"['CA 02111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

These cells serve as a model system to study in detail the expression of a specific gene product at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this report we describe experiments in which the transcription rate of globin and non-globin genes, as well as their cytoplasmic appearance, was measured during the differentiation process. Two independent steps for regulating the abundance of globin mRNA were observed. On the transcriptional level we have observed that, in contrast to the transcription of globin genes, the transcription rate of non-globin genes is dramatically reduced throughout the period of induction. When the rate of cytoplasmic appearance was measured newly synthesized globin RNA molecules were found to be preferentially transported into the cytoplasm. It was shown that the reduction in cytoplasmic appearance of nonglobin genes is not a result of a shut-off in their transcriptional activity. In cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate the transcription rate remains constant while a continuous reduction in the cytoplasmic appearance is observed. These two independent phenomena which affect the non-globin genes, i.e. the suppression of their transcription and reduced cytoplasmic appearance, lead to the reduction in the relative amounts of the stable poly(A)-rich mRNA population and to the accumulation of globin sequences in the cytoplasm of the differentiated erythroid cells. These observations are in agreement with our previous model, which claimed that disappearance of the stable poly(A)-rich mRNA population is an obligatory process leading to the final differentiation of MEL cells.","['Shaul, Y', 'Ginzburg, I', 'Aviv, H']","['Shaul Y', 'Ginzburg I', 'Aviv H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Genes', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,1982/11/15 00:00,1982/11/15 00:01,['1982/11/15 00:00'],"['1982/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb07011.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1982 Nov 15;128(2-3):637-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb07011.x.,,,,,,

The aetiological implications of clusters over space of certain sites of cancer are discussed. Finally, temporal change over the years 1964-79 shows a significant decrease overall (P less than 0.01) in cases of lymphosarcomas and colo-rectal cancers and an increase (P less than 0.05) in stomach cancer. The rare tumour, Kaposi's sarcoma, has also decreased significantly between the 2 periods studied.","['McGlashan, N D', 'Harington, J S', 'Bradshaw, E']","['McGlashan ND', 'Harington JS', 'Bradshaw E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['7440-57-5 (Gold)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Africa, Southern', 'Blacks', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/epidemiology', '*Gold', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Mining', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/epidemiology']",PMC2011229,1982/12/01 00:00,1982/12/01 00:01,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1982.306 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1982 Dec;46(6):947-54. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1982.306.,,,,,,
