We first found that auranofin (AF), a coordinated gold compound, induced a significant level of cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and subsequent apoptosis of myeloma cells. Further, AF inhibited constitutive and IL-6-induced activation of JAK2 and phosphorylation of STAT3 followed by the decreased expression of Mcl-1. AF down-regulated the activation of NF-kappaB, and the combination of AF and a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor resulted in a marked decrease of Mcl-1 expression. These results suggest that AF inhibits both IL-6 induced-JAK/STAT pathway and NF-kappaB activation in myeloma cells.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Treatment was either given because of hematologic relapse (n = 44), molecular/cytogenetic relapse (n = 52), or other causes (n = 22). Molecular relapse was in most cases based on leukemia lineage-specific chimerism analysis. Patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome showed a 3-year survival of 42% if DLI treatment was given because of molecular relapse, compared to 16% in hematologic relapse (P < .006). In multivariate analysis, there was a correlation between response to DLI and nonhematologic relapse (risk ratio [RR] 3.36, P = .001), chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) (RR = 1.51, P = .005), and late relapse (RR = 2.06, P = .017). The overall incidences of acute GVHD (aGVHD) grades I-II and grades III-IV aGVHD were 33% and 8.5%, respectively. Probability of cGVHD was 33%. The development of aGVHD or cGVHD did not significantly influence the response of DLI in patients with molecular/cytogenetic relapse. However, the development of cGVHD was significantly associated with a better response in patients with hematologic relapse because only 4 of 29 patients without cGVHD responded compared to 7 of 12 with cGVHD (P = .007). The development of cGVHD increased significantly if DLI was given >12 months after ASCT (46% versus 27%, P = .04). In contrast, time between ASCT and start of DLI treatment had no significant influence on the risk of developing aGVHD. To conclude, monitoring of leukemia lineage-specific chimerism is of utmost importance for DLI response after ASCT.","['Copyright (c) 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The mechanisms of MLL fusion protein-mediated transcriptional activation are poorly understood. Here we show MLL interacts directly with the polymerase associated factor complex (PAFc) through sequences flanking the CxxC domain. PAFc interacts with RNA polymerase II and stimulates posttranslational histone modifications. PAFc augments MLL and MLL-AF9 mediated transcriptional activation of Hoxa9.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, the presence of clinical and laboratory parameters suggestive of ATL was evaluated in a cohort of 30 patients with IDH. STUDY DESIGN: Over a period of 33 months, the patients were submitted to three-monthly clinical evaluations, routine laboratory exams, full blood count and blood smears, and to six-monthly blood sampling for HTLV-1 proviral load determination. HTLV-1 proviral load was quantified using real-time TaqMan PCR assay. RESULTS: Abnormal cells (Ably) were found in the peripheral blood smears of nine patients (30%), flower cells being detected in five of these cases (16.6%). The presence of Ably and flower cells was not associated with a higher proviral load in those patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the presence of flower cells in HTLV-1-infected children and adolescents. Furthermore, these cells have not previously been reported in IDH patients. The cases with flower cells probably represent precursory ATL cases, these patients being at a greater risk of developing ATL.",['Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In a systematic analysis of MLL1 domain recruitment activity, we identified an essential MLL1 recruitment domain that includes the CXXC domain and PHD fingers and is controlled by direct interactions with the PAF elongation complex and H3K4Me2/3. MLL1 fusion proteins lack the PHD fingers and require prebinding of a wild-type MLL1 complex and CXXC domain recognition of DNA for stable HoxA9 association. Together, these results suggest that specific recruitment of MLL1 requires multiple interactions and is a precondition for stable recruitment of MLL1 fusion proteins to HoxA9 in leukemogenesis.

METHODS: Thirteen cases of CD4(+) CD56(+) hematologic malignancies were prospectively encountered in the routine and referral practices of the authors. RESULTS: Patients 1 and 2 were elderly men exhibiting an acute onset of skin, bone-marrow, and peripheral blood involvement, both dying of their disease within less than 12 months. CD3(+) phenotype and a clonal T-cell receptor beta rearrangement indicated categorization as a CD4(+) natural killer T-cell lymphoma. Patient 3 developed a CD56(+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma and is without disease after excision and radiation. Indolent CD4(+) CD56(+) poikilodermatous mycosis fungoides defined case 4. There were 7 patients with CD123(+) CD4(+) CD56(+) hematodermic neoplasm, 4 dying within 18 months of presentation with peripheral blood/marrow involvement in 6 of the 7 cases. Two patients with granulocytic sarcoma dying within 100 days of presentation defined the last two cases. LIMITATIONS: There were relatively small numbers in each of the categories and the follow-up was limited in those cases where death was not reported. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous malignancies composed of CD4(+) CD56(+) hematopoietic cells define a varied group and oftentimes have an aggressive clinical course although not in every case.","['Copyright 2009 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Here, we report on structure-function studies that elucidate molecular events in MLL1 binding of histone H3K4me3/2 marks and recruitment of the cyclophilin CyP33. CyP33 contains a PPIase and a RRM domain and regulates MLL1 function through HDAC recruitment. We find that the PPIase domain of CyP33 regulates the conformation of MLL1 through proline isomerization within the PHD3-Bromo linker, thereby disrupting the PHD3-Bromo interface and facilitating binding of the MLL1-PHD3 domain to the CyP33-RRM domain. H3K4me3/2 and CyP33-RRM target different surfaces of MLL1-PHD3 and can bind simultaneously to form a ternary complex. Furthermore, the MLL1-CyP33 interaction is required for repression of HOXA9 and HOXC8 genes in vivo.

Humans are commonly exposed to viruses that naturally infect and cause cancer in food animals such as poultry that constitute part of the biological environment. It is not known if these viruses cause cancer in humans. OBJECTIVE: To study cancer mortality in the largest cohort to date, of 20,132 workers in poultry slaughtering and processing plants, a group with the highest human exposures to these viruses. METHODS: Mortality in poultry workers was compared with that in the US general population through the estimation of standardized mortality ratios. RESULTS: Significantly increased risks were observed in the cohort as a whole or in subgroups, for several cancer sites, viz: cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx; pancreas; trachea/bronchus/lung; brain; cervix; lymphoid leukemia; monocytic leukemia; and tumors of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems. Elevated SMRs that were not statistically significant were observed for cancers of the liver, nasopharynx, myelofibrosis, and myeloma. New sites observed to be significantly in excess in this study were cancers of the cervix and penis. CONCLUSION: This large study provides evidence that a human group with high exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses has increased risk of dying from several cancers. Other occupational carcinogenic exposures could be of importance in explaining some of the findings, such as fumes from wrapping machines.

These non-hematopoietic cells include cells of the osteoblast lineage, adipocytes and endothelial cells.

Patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) show a high prevalence of HLA-DR15 and express high levels of TNF-alpha in the bone marrow. The present analysis involving 7950 patients showed an HLA-DR15 frequency of 31% in patients with MDS, compared with only 23% in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). HLA-DR15 was more prevalent in Caucasian patients than in non-Caucasian patients (P = .01). The numbers of patients in the non-Caucasian subgroups were too small to allow further analysis. Among Caucasian patients with MDS and CML, the presence of HLA-DR15 did not significantly affect the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease, relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), or survival. However, there was a significant correlation between DR15 and TNF polymorphisms at position -308 among patients with MDS, and the TNF-308 AG genotype conferred an increased risk of NRM compared with the GG genotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49; P = .02), even after adjusting for DR15. Conversely, the TNF-863 AA genotype was correlated with decreased overall mortality and NRM compared with the CC genotype (HR, 0.36, P = .04 vs HR, 0.13, P = .04), even after adjusting for DR15. There was no significant association between TNF-308 or -863 polymorphisms and transplantation outcome in CML patients. These results suggest that TNF polymorphisms, but not DR15, affect transplantation outcome in a disease-dependent manner.","['Copyright (c) 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of cytotoxicity and cell proliferation was conducted using the MTS assay, cell-cycle analysis, and division tracking. Apoptosis was investigated by Annexin-V/7-aminoactinomycin D and caspase-3 expression. The effect of GSK-3beta inhibitors was also tested in vivo in an animal model of leukemia. Gene expression analysis was performed to identify the genes modulated by GSK-3beta inhibition in leukemia cells. RESULTS: GSK-3beta inhibitors suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis in seven leukemia cell lines of diverse origin, four acute myeloid leukemia, one myelodysplastic syndrome, and one acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. GSK-3beta inhibitors are cytotoxic for rapidly dividing clonogenic leukemia blasts, and higher doses of the inhibitors are needed to eliminate primitive leukemia progenitor/stem cells. Slow cell-division rate, low drug uptake, and interaction with bone marrow stroma make leukemia cells more resistant to apoptosis induced by GSK-3beta inhibitors. Global gene expression analysis combined with functional approaches identified multiple genes and specific signaling pathways modulated by GSK-3beta inhibition. An important role for Bcl2 in the regulation of apoptosis induced by GSK-3beta inhibitors was defined by expression analysis and confirmed by using pharmacological inhibitors of the protein. In vivo administration of GSK-3beta inhibitors delayed tumor formation in a mouse leukemia model. GSK-3beta inhibitors did not affect hematopoietic recovery following irradiation.

The N-terminus of Mcl-1 is unique amongst the Bcl-2 family, in that it is rich in experimentally confirmed and putative regulatory residues and motifs. These include sites for ubiquitination, cleavage and phosphorylation, which influence the protein's stability, localisation, dimerization and function.

We measured markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis in plasma collected from APL rats with overt leukaemia using conventional assays.

Treatment of leukaemic rats with the siRNA reduced (p < 0.05) the concentration of thrombin-anti-thrombin complex (a marker of coagulation) by 40% compared with rats treated with an inactive, control siRNA. Substantial reductions (p < 0.05) were also obtained for two markers of fibrinolysis: D-dimer (72%) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (51%).

A 44-year-old male presented with isolated recurrence of granulocytic sarcoma mimicking a falx meningioma two years after complete remission by allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transfusion (PBSCT) in the acute myelomonoblastic leukemia (FAB, M4).

Surface-immobilized growth factors can be presented over a wide range of concentrations (5-150 ng cm(-2)), as we have previously shown for leukemia inhibitory factor and stem cell factor. Cell activation can be achieved in the presence of adhesion-promoting extracellular matrix proteins. Depending on the methods used, the overall procedure takes 1.5-3 d. In general, the approach can be used to investigate the effect of defined amounts of immobilized growth factors on stem cells and on the maintenance, growth and differentiation of other cell types.",,"['Pompe, Tilo', 'Salchert, Katrin', 'Alberti, Kristin', 'Zandstra, Peter', 'Werner, Carsten']","['Pompe T', 'Salchert K', 'Alberti K', 'Zandstra P', 'Werner C']","['Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, Max Bergmann Center of Biomaterials, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100513,England,Nat Protoc,Nature protocols,101284307,"['0 (Coated Materials, Biocompatible)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immobilized Proteins)', '0 (Polymers)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coated Materials, Biocompatible', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immobilized Proteins/pharmacology', 'Polymers', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism']",2010/06/12 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/06/12 06:00'],"['2010/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['nprot.2010.70 [pii]', '10.1038/nprot.2010.70 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Protoc. 2010 Jun;5(6):1042-50. doi: 10.1038/nprot.2010.70.

Recent evidence suggests that MLL gene partners may influence prognosis. Five translocations account for approximately 80% of MLL rearrangements: t(4;11)(q21;q23), AFF1/MLL; t(6;11)(q27;q23), MLLT4/MLL; t(9;11)(p22;q23), MLLT3/MLL; t(11;19)(q23;p13.1), MLL/ELL; and t(11;19)(q23;p13.3), MLL/MLLT1. We have designed dual-color, double-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) probe sets to identify these translocations. A blinded study was performed for each probe set using 25 normal bone marrow samples, 25 t(4;11), 20 t(6;11), 20 t(9;11), 18 t(11;19p13.1), and 20 t(11;19p13.3) leukemia specimens as defined by chromosome analysis.

Our D-FISH assays were more accurate than chromosome analysis at distinguishing disruption of 19p13.1/ELL from that of 19p13.3/MLLT1. We also demonstrated a statistically significant increase in complex/unbalanced MLL/partner translocations occurring in pediatric patients versus adult patients (P = 0.02).

Since 1985, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is widely recommended for patients who have a matched sibling donor. However, it remains controversial whether allo-SCT is superior to chemotherapy for children with newly diagnosed AML. This review summarizes phase 3 clinical trials that compared allo-SCT with chemotherapy (including autologous SCT) in pediatric AML, excluding studies that did not use the intention-to-treat analysis or correct for time-to-transplantation. Although allo-SCT might prevent more relapses than chemotherapy, the number needed for transplantation (with allo-SCT) to prevent one relapse is in the order of 10 patients. Moreover, overall survival is similar with both methods in most recent studies, apparently because of increased salvagability of a relapse when initial therapy concerned chemotherapy only, and because of a higher treatment-related mortality with allo-SCT. Because allo-SCT also gives more severe side effects and results more often in secondary malignancies than chemotherapy, we do not recommend allo-SCT in first remission for pediatric AML in general. Further research should focus on the possibility that subgroups might benefit from allo-SCT, aiming at further improvements in the prognosis of pediatric AML.",,"['Niewerth, Denise', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Bierings, Marc B', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['Niewerth D', 'Creutzig U', 'Bierings MB', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100610,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/economics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/12 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/06/12 06:00'],"['2010/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34539-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-261800 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 30;116(13):2205-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-261800.

While the phase 1-phase 2-phase 3 sequence of clinical drug testing has remained inviolate for decades, it appears intrinsically inefficient, and scientific flaws have been noted by many authors. Of major concern is the high frequency of false-positive results obtained in phase 2 studies. Here, we review features of phase 2 trials in AML that may contribute to this problem, particularly lack of control groups, patient heterogeneity, selection bias, and choice of end points.

The cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery was 90% at day +60. CIs of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 12% and 10% at 2 years, respectively. At 5 years, CIs of nonrelapse mortality and relapse were 9% and 47%, respectively; the probability of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival were 44% and 55%, respectively. Among other factors, higher TNCs infused was associated with rapid neutrophil recovery and improved DFS. The use of methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis decreased the CI of engraftment. Patients without advanced disease had improved DFS. These results support banking and use of CB units for RCBT. Cell dose, GVHD prophylaxis not including methotrexate, and disease status are important factors for outcomes after RCBT.",,"['Herr, Andree-Laure', 'Kabbara, Nabil', 'Bonfim, Carmem M S', 'Teira, Pierre', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Tiedemann, Karin', 'Lankester, Arjan', 'Jouet, Jean-Pierre', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Diaz de Heredia, Cristina', 'Peters, Christina', 'Chaves, Wagnara', 'Nabhan, Samir K', 'Ionescu, Irina', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Herr AL', 'Kabbara N', 'Bonfim CM', 'Teira P', 'Locatelli F', 'Tiedemann K', 'Lankester A', 'Jouet JP', 'Messina C', 'Bertrand Y', 'Diaz de Heredia C', 'Peters C', 'Chaves W', 'Nabhan SK', 'Ionescu I', 'Gluckman E', 'Rocha V']","['Eurocord, Hopital Saint-Louis, 1 ave Claude Vellefaux, Quadrilatere porte 5, Paris cedex 10, France. andree-laure.herr-bellon@sls.aphp.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100610,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/12 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/06/12 06:00'],"['2010/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)32987-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-271692 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 16;116(11):1849-56. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-271692.

Our work identified the shortest telomeres ever recorded in primary human tissue, reinforcing the concept that there is significant cell division in CLL. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that critical telomere shortening, dysfunction, and fusion contribute to disease progression. The frequency of short telomeres and fusion events increased with advanced disease, but importantly these were also found in a subset of early-stage patient samples, indicating that these events can precede disease progression. Sequence analysis of fusion events isolated from persons with the shortest telomeres revealed limited numbers of repeats at the breakpoint, subtelomeric deletion, and microhomology. Array-comparative genome hybridization analysis of persons displaying evidence of telomere dysfunction revealed large-scale genomic rearrangements that were concentrated in the telomeric regions; this was not observed in samples with longer telomeres. The telomere dynamics observed in CLL B cells were indistinguishable from that observed in cells undergoing crisis in culture after abrogation of the p53 pathway. Taken together, our data support the concept that telomere erosion and subsequent telomere fusion are critical in the progression of CLL and that this paradigm may extend to other malignancies.",,"['Lin, Thet Thet', 'Letsolo, Boitelo T', 'Jones, Rhiannon E', 'Rowson, Jan', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Hewamana, Saman', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Baird, Duncan M']","['Lin TT', 'Letsolo BT', 'Jones RE', 'Rowson J', 'Pratt G', 'Hewamana S', 'Fegan C', 'Pepper C', 'Baird DM']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100610,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prognosis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Telomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/06/12 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/06/12 06:00'],"['2010/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)32993-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-272104 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 16;116(11):1899-907. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-272104.

Although the way HDACi exert their antileukemia effect is not fully understood, it is accepted that induction of apoptosis is important. We hypothesized, therefore, that combination of an HDACi with a proapoptotic agent, such as the Bcl-2 homology domain-3 mimetic GX15-070, could result in enhanced antileukemia activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed the cellular and molecular effects of two different HDACi (MGCD0103 and vorinostat) in combination with GX15-070 in leukemia cell lines and primary acute myelogenous leukemia cells. RESULTS: We showed that the combination had synergistic antileukemia effect both in leukemia cell lines and in primary acute myelogenous leukemia cells. Using molecular markers and electron microscopy, we observed that in addition to apoptosis, autophagy accounts for the nonapoptotic decrease in cell viability, an effect that could be inhibited by chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagy. Finally, we established a role for calpain activity in the induction of both autophagy and apoptosis by this combination. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of an HDACi and GX15-070 has synergistic antileukemia activity, and the effect is mediated by induction of apoptosis and autophagy. The combination should be studied in clinical trials of leukemia and the role of autophagy in leukemia therapy needs to be better understood.",['(c) 2010 AACR.'],"['Wei, Yue', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Tong, Weigang', 'Zhang, Ming', 'Jia, Yu', 'Yang, Hui', 'Hu, Yumin', 'Tambaro, Francesco Paolo', 'Viallet, Jean', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Wei Y', 'Kadia T', 'Tong W', 'Zhang M', 'Jia Y', 'Yang H', 'Hu Y', 'Tambaro FP', 'Viallet J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100610,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'A6GWB8T96J (mocetinostat)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrroles/*administration & dosage', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vorinostat']",2010/06/12 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/06/12 06:00'],"['2010/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0032 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0032 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 1;16(15):3923-32. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0032.

Nizp1 includes a SCAN-domain, a KRAB-domain, four C2H2 Kruppel related zinc fingers, and a C2HR transcriptional repression and protein interaction domain required for NSD1 interaction. In this study we have identified alternative splicing of the Nizp1 gene resulting in transcripts encoding Nizp1 protein isoforms with a short N-terminal deletion or a SCAN-domain deletion. The alternative Nizp1 transcripts are expressed in lower levels relative to the canonical Nizp1 transcript. The Nizp1 SCAN-domain mediates Nizp1 self-association but lacks intrinsic transcriptional activating or repressing capacity and has no influence on the transcriptional repression activity of Nizp1 in reporter assays. Sub-cellular localization analysis showed that a fraction of Nizp1 localizes to CBP nuclear bodies and that the SCAN-domain is required for the localization to nuclear bodies. The presented results show that alternative splicing is a functional mechanism to generate Nizp1 protein isoforms with different SCAN-domain compositions and accordingly different sub-cellular localizations.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we have studied the effect of low oxygen levels (2% O(2)), or hypoxia, in the expansion of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cell proliferation was reduced under hypoxia and a simultaneous reduction in cell viability was also observed. Morphological changes and different cell cycle patterns were observed, suggesting some early differentiation under hypoxic conditions. However, when cells were maintained in a ground state of pluripotency, by inhibition of autocrine FGF4/ERK and GSK3 signaling, hypoxia did not affect cell proliferation, and did not induce early differentiation. As expected, there was an increase in lactate-specific production rate and a significant increase in the glucose consumption under hypoxic conditions. Nevertheless, during neural commitment, low oxygen tension exerted a positive effect on early differentiation of ground-state ES cells, resulting in a faster commitment toward neural progenitors.

The experimental results have revealed that well electrochemical response can be observed only under the condition that both of the tumor markers are identified on the surface of the tumor cells. With this method, breast cancer cell MCF-7 can be easily distinguished from other kinds of cells, such as acute leukemia cells CCRF-CEM and normal cells islet beta cells.

To address the role of myc genes in ESC and in pluripotency generally, we conditionally knocked out both c- and N-myc using myc doubly homozygously floxed mESC lines (cDKO). Both lines of myc cDKO mESC exhibited severely disrupted self-renewal, pluripotency, and survival along with enhanced differentiation. Chimeric embryos injected with DKO mESC most often completely failed to develop or in rare cases survived but with severe defects. The essential nature of myc for self-renewal and pluripotency is at least in part mediated through orchestrating pluripotency-related cell cycle and metabolic programs. This study demonstrates that endogenous myc genes are essential for mESC pluripotency and self-renewal as well as providing the first evidence that myc genes are required for early embryogenesis, suggesting potential mechanisms of myc contribution to iPS cell formation.","['Copyright 2010 International Society of Differentiation.

Epidemiologic data indicates that almost 5000 new cases are reported every year and 10% of these patients eventually succumb to the disease. The treatment of CML was revolutionized by the introduction of imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec), a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The clinical use of specific BCR-ABL inhibitors has resulted in a significantly improved prognosis, response rate, overall survival, and patient outcome in CML patients compared to previous therapeutic regimens. However, the complete eradication of CML in patients receiving imatinib was limited by the emergence of resistance mostly due to mutations in the ABL kinase domain and to a lesser extent by molecular residual disease after treatment. The second-generation BCR-ABL TKIs nilotinib (Tasigna) and dasatinib (Sprycel), showed significant activity in clinical trials in patients intolerant or resistant to imatinib therapy, except in those patients with the T315I BCR-ABL mutation. Identifying key components involved in the CML pathogenesis may lead to the exploration of new approaches that might eventually overcome resistance mediated to the BCR-ABL TKIs.

All of 64 donor-recipient pairs were serologically matched for HLA-A, -B, and -DR loci. Only substitution at residue 9 resulting from an HLA-A*02 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of severe acute GVHD in patients (OR=7.0, P=0.033) on multivariate analysis. Recipients of this mismatched HLA also showed shortened overall survival (HR=9.7, P<0.001) and increased risk for transplant-related mortality (HR=9.1, P=0.027). Structural modeling showed that the amino acid substitution could alter the peptide preference of the ligand-binding pocket. A single amino acid substitution at position 9 was a major predictor of severe acute GVHD in Korean pediatric patients.","['(c) 2010 The Authors.

However, in the case of bovine diseases, there have been no reports on this molecule due to lack of information about bovine PD-1. In this study, we performed identification and preliminary characterization of the bovine PD-1 gene in two breeds of cattle. We cloned full cDNA sequences encoding for PD-1 from both Holstein-Friesian and Japanese Black breeds, and found that both of the genes encoded a 282-amino acid protein, which had a signal sequence, transmembrane domain and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. This bovine PD-1 showed 72.9% and 65.6% homology to human and mouse PD-1, respectively, both of which have been well characterized and documented. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that bovine PD-1 is expressed predominantly in T-cells (such as CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells) and among PBMCs, and is strongly upregulated on T-cell stimulation via ConA. A limited number of cattle were tested yet, as expected, the degree of PD-1 mRNA expression in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells was greater in cattle with bovine leukemia virus-induced lymphoma than in uninfected cattle.

In this paper, we report a case of cutaneous endometriosis in the umbilical region found in a 37-year-old woman with no history of pregnancy. The lesion was a brown, firm and elastic nodule, 9 mm x 7 mm in size, and caused bleeding as well as pain which increased during menstruation. Histopathological findings revealed that there were small and large glandular cavity structures in the dermis and the edematous interstitium around it. On immunohistochemical staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors, the cellular nuclei of glandular cavity walls were mainly found to be positive for both, and cells in the edematous interstitium around the glandular cavity were positive for CD10. Consequently, we diagnosed this case as cutaneous endometriosis in the umbilical region. CD10 was initially described as a tumor-specific antigen found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

To determine the contributions of these structural components of ATRA to its clinical efficacy, we synthesized three novel retinoids. These consisted of either a modified conjugated alkene backbone with an intact acid moiety (13a) or a modified conjugated alkene backbone and conversion of the acid group to either an ester (13b) or an aromatic amide (13c). Reporter assays demonstrated that compound 13a successfully relieved transcriptional repression by RAR-alpha, while 13b and 13c could not, demonstrating the critical role of the acid moiety in this binding.

The frequencies of alleles in both populations are distributed rather evenly: the frequencies of the most widely represented alleles (*18, *20, and *28) in the Mongolian cattle varied from 7.75 to 8.45%. The most frequent alleles in the Kalmyk cattle were *28(14.52%), *24(7.26%), and *12(6.45%). Only five alleles were identified in the Yakut cattle breed. The prevailing allele was *29 (77.3%); a relatively frequent allele was *1(13.1%), and the remaining three alleles constituted only 9.6%. Such a low level of diversity of BoLA-DRB3 gene alleles was not observed earlier in any other cattle breed. The Mongolian and Kalmyk breeds showed a wide diversity of BoLA-DRB3 genotypes (56 and 51 genotypes, respectively) and a high level of expected heterozygosity (He = 0.953 and 0.946, respectively). Both breeds had a deficiency of heterozygotes (Mongolian cattle: Ho = 0.775, D = -0.187; Kalmyk cattle: Ho = 0.708, D= -0.252). A low level ofgenotypic diversity for the BoLA-DRB3 locus (only seven genotypes; the frequency for the genotype *29/*29 is 71.4%) and a very low level of observed heterozygosity (Ho = 0.12) were revealed in the Yakut breed. BoLA-DRB3.2 alleles associated with resistance to persistent lymphocytosis caused by the bovine leukemia virus (total frequencies 15.49 and 24.19%) and to various forms of mastitis (total frequencies 12.68 and 20.96%, respectively) were identified in the Mongolian and Kalmyk animals. In the Yakut breed, alleles associated with resistance to diseases are represented only by the BoLA-DRB3.2 allele *7 (1.2%).

In contrast, the population of Yakut cattle from the Verkhoyanskii raion of the Republic of Sakha has a poor diversity of alleles and genotypes for the BoLA-DRB3 gene and a very low level of heterozygosity, suggesting an unfavorable state of the population that is probably caused by inbreeding depression due to a long-term isolation and a small number of animals.",,"['Ruzina, M N', 'Shtyfurko, T A', 'Mohammadabadi, M R', 'Gendzhieva, O V', 'Tsedev, Tsenduren', 'Sulimova, G E']","['Ruzina MN', 'Shtyfurko TA', 'Mohammadabadi MR', 'Gendzhieva OV', 'Tsedev T', 'Sulimova GE']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Russia (Federation),Genetika,Genetika,0047354,"['0 (BoLA-DRB3 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Breeding', 'Cattle/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Frequency', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mongolia', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Russia', 'Species Specificity']",2010/06/12 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2010/06/12 06:00'],"['2010/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Genetika. 2010 Apr;46(4):517-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extramedullary disease is rarely reported in patients with ALL. The most common sites are bone, followed by soft tissue, skin and lymph nodes. We describe a child with common B-lineage ALL who presented with a mass in the spinal epidural space. She was initially treated with intrathecal chemotherapy and intravenous dexamethasone with total resolution of her clinical symptoms but a persistent epidural mass. An open biopsy of the residual epidural mass was performed 7 months after diagnosis. The histological examination did not reveal any tumor infiltration, only fibrosis. We conclude that a persistent epidural mass in patients with ALL may not indicate resistant disease and may require over a year for resolution, even when response to therapy is adequate.","['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Molina, Blanca', 'Lassaletta, Alvaro', 'Andion, Maitane', 'Gonzalez-Vicent, Marta', 'Lopez-Pino, Miguel A', 'Madero, Luis']","['Molina B', 'Lassaletta A', 'Andion M', 'Gonzalez-Vicent M', 'Lopez-Pino MA', 'Madero L']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology Department, Hospital Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Epidural Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",2010/06/11 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/06/11 06:00'],"['2010/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22682 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Oct;55(4):727-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22682.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ALL2000 study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of augmented chemotherapy based on MRD-restratification in childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: Between 2000 and 2004, 305 eligible patients with precursor B or T-cell ALL were enrolled in the ALL2000 study. The ALL941-based therapy protocol utilized PCR MRD assays using Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. They were initially stratified into three risk-groups according to leukocyte count and age, and MRD levels were measured at weeks 5 (TP1) and 12 (TP2) for a second stratification. From week 14, patients with MRD levels >/= 10(-3) received an increase in therapy (one risk group higher), while the remainder continued to receive the initial risk-adapted therapy. RESULTS: The overall 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for ALL2000 was 79.7 +/- 2.4%. MRD stratification was feasible for 234 of 301 patients (77%) who achieved complete remission. The EFS rate of the MRD stratifiable (MRD) group was 82.5 +/- 2.6%, considerably superior to the 74.7 +/- 5.7% of MRD non-stratifiable (Non-MRD) group (P = 0.084) and the 74.4 +/- 2.1% for ALL 941 (P = 0.012). MRD-positive patients at TP2 showed inferior outcomes as compared with MRD-negative cases, but the difference did not reach a statistically significant level in any risk groups or immunophenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that augmented therapy for MRD-positive patients at TP2 contributed to better outcomes of the ALL2000 study.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Yamaji, Kazutaka', 'Okamoto, Tomomi', 'Yokota, Shohei', 'Watanabe, Arata', 'Horikoshi, Yasuo', 'Asami, Keiko', 'Kikuta, Atsushi', 'Hyakuna, Nobuyuki', 'Saikawa, Yutaka', 'Ueyama, Junichi', 'Watanabe, Tsutomu', 'Okada, Masahiko', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu', 'Kogawa, Kazuhiro', 'Chin, Motoaki', 'Iwai, Asayuki', 'Matsushita, Takeshi', 'Shimomura, Yasuto', 'Hori, Toshinori', 'Tsurusawa, Masahito']","['Yamaji K', 'Okamoto T', 'Yokota S', 'Watanabe A', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Asami K', 'Kikuta A', 'Hyakuna N', 'Saikawa Y', 'Ueyama J', 'Watanabe T', 'Okada M', 'Taga T', 'Kanegane H', 'Kogawa K', 'Chin M', 'Iwai A', 'Matsushita T', 'Shimomura Y', 'Hori T', 'Tsurusawa M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Aichi-gun, Aichi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/11 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/11 06:00'],"['2010/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22620 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Dec 15;55(7):1287-95. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22620.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Japanese Childhood Cancer Leukemia Study Group'],,,,,

A retrospective analysis of allo-SCT in 30 patients with CLL whose risk profile was unfavourable and who were treated in the years 2000-2009 was performed. The aim was to compare the results of allo-SCT by prognostic factors and conditioning type and evaluate the results of unrelated transplantation. The median age was 54 years. Donors were 8 HLA-matched siblings and 22 unrelated volunteers, 11 of whom were mismatched. Eighteen patients were treated with reduced intensity conditioning. Twelve patients received myeloablative conditioning. Estimated overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 78%, progression-free survival (PFS) 71%, relapse incidence 10% and non-relapse mortality (NRM) 16%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 35 months. According to molecular/cytogenetic characteristics, OS and PFS for the high risk group (17p- or 11q-) were 89 and 77%, respectively, not significantly different from those with standard risk. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was associated with greater toxicity; significantly higher NRM for patients with aGVHD (p = 0.04) and worse PFS for patients with cGVHD (p = 0.04). Our results for the refractory disease group (77% responses) indicate that chemoresistance may be overcome by the GVL effect.

A persistently active mutant of STAT5 (STAT5a(S711F)) associates with Grb2-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2) in myeloid leukemias and promotes growth in vitro through AKT activation. Here we have retrovirally transduced wild-type or Gab2(-/-) mouse bone marrow cells expressing STAT5a(S711F) and transplanted into irradiated recipient mice to test an in vivo myeloproliferative disease model. To target Gab2-independent AKT/mTOR activation, we treated wild-type mice separately with rapamycin. In either case, mice lacking Gab2 or treated with rapamycin showed attenuated myeloid hyperplasia and modestly improved survival, but the effects were not cytotoxic and were reversible. To improve on this approach, we combined in vitro targeting of STAT5-mediated AKT/mTOR using rapamycin with inhibition of the STAT5 direct target genes bcl-2 and bcl-X(L) using ABT-737. Striking synergy with both drugs was observed in mouse BaF3 cells expressing STAT5a(S711F), TEL-JAK2 or BCR-ABL and in the relatively single agent-resistant human BCR-ABL-positive K562 cell line. Therefore, targeting distinct STAT5-mediated survival signals, for example, bcl-2/bcl-X(L) and AKT/mTOR may be an effective therapeutic approach for human myeloproliferative neoplasms.",,"['Li, G', 'Miskimen, K L', 'Wang, Z', 'Xie, X Y', 'Tse, W', 'Gouilleux, F', 'Moriggl, R', 'Bunting, K D']","['Li G', 'Miskimen KL', 'Wang Z', 'Xie XY', 'Tse W', 'Gouilleux F', 'Moriggl R', 'Bunting KD']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100610,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Nitrophenols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/drug effects/*physiology', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2010/06/11 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/06/11 06:00'],"['2010/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010131 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.131 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Aug;24(8):1397-405. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.131.

To identify BAALC-associated genes that give insights into its functional role in chemotherapy resistance, gene expression signatures differentiating high from low BAALC expressers were generated from normal CD34(+) progenitors, T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and AML samples. The insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) was one of the four genes (CD34, CD133, natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR3), IGFBP7) coexpressed with BAALC and common to the three entities. In T-ALL, high IGFBP7-expression was associated with an immature phenotype of early T-ALL (P<0.001), expression of CD34 (P<0.001) and CD33 (P<0.001). Moreover, high IGFBP7-expression predicted primary therapy resistance (P=0.03) and inferior survival in T-ALL (P=0.03). In vitro studies revealed that IGFBP7 protein significantly inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cell lines (Jurkat cells: 42% reduction, P=0.002; KG1a cells: 65% reduction, P<0.001). In conclusion, IGFBP7 was identified as a BAALC coexpressed gene. Furthermore, high IGFBP7 was associated with stem cell features and treatment failure in T-ALL. In contrast to BAALC, which likely represents only a surrogate marker of treatment failure in acute leukemia, IGFBP7 regulates the proliferation of leukemic cells and might be involved in chemotherapy resistance.",,"['Heesch, S', 'Schlee, C', 'Neumann, M', 'Stroux, A', 'Kuhnl, A', 'Schwartz, S', 'Haferlach, T', 'Goekbuget, N', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Thiel, E', 'Hofmann, W-K', 'Baldus, C D']","['Heesch S', 'Schlee C', 'Neumann M', 'Stroux A', 'Kuhnl A', 'Schwartz S', 'Haferlach T', 'Goekbuget N', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E', 'Hofmann WK', 'Baldus CD']","['Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Medizinische Klinik III, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100610,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Replication', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2010/06/11 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/06/11 06:00'],"['2010/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010130 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.130 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Aug;24(8):1429-36. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.130.

To determine whether the presence of the telomerase-independent alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALTs) mechanism is a significant prognostic factor for survival, we performed a retrospective analysis of 573 GBM patients. The presence of ALT was identified in paraffin sections using a combination of immunofluorescence for promyelocytic leukemia body and telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization. Alternative lengthening of telomere was present in 15% of the GBM patients. Patients with ALT had longer survival that was independent of age, surgery, and other treatments. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1mut) 1 frequently accompanied ALT, and in the presence of both molecular events, there was significantly longer overall survival. These data suggest that most ALT+ tumors may be less aggressive proneural GBMs, and the better prognosis may relate to the set of genetic changes associated with this tumor subtype.

We sought to study the mechanism involved in this effect and whether ATO is suitable for combination therapies with protein kinase inhibitors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: B-CLL cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of 28 patients. Cell viability studies with ATO alone or in combination with kinase inhibitors were done by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analyses. RESULTS: After 48 hours, 3 mumol/L ATO induced apoptosis (average 75%) in all B-CLL samples studied and with minimal effect on normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Apoptosis entailed Akt and NF-kappaB inactivation, XIAP downregulation, and PTEN upregulation, thus implying inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) survival pathway. Indeed, the combination of ATO and PI3K inhibitors increased the apoptotic effect of either agent alone. ATO also induced c-jun-NH(2) terminal kinase (JNK) activation, and this was crucial and required for subsequent apoptotic events, as inhibiting JNK activity by either gene silencing or specific inhibitors prevented Akt and NF-kappaB inactivation, caspase activation, and mitochondrial damage. Moreover, JNK activation was the earliest response to ATO, preceding and determining reactive oxygen species production. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the mechanism involved in ATO action on B-CLL cells and show that the combination of low doses of ATO and PI3K inhibitors efficiently induces B-CLL cell death. ATO may therefore constitute an efficient treatment for B-CLL, particularly in combined therapies.",,"['Redondo-Munoz, Javier', 'Escobar-Diaz, Elizabeth', 'Hernandez Del Cerro, Mercedes', 'Pandiella, Atanasio', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Redondo-Munoz J', 'Escobar-Diaz E', 'Hernandez Del Cerro M', 'Pandiella A', 'Terol MJ', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Departamento de Medicina Celular y Molecular, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100609,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2010/06/11 06:00,2011/03/01 06:00,['2010/06/11 06:00'],"['2010/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0072 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0072 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Sep 1;16(17):4382-91. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0072.

Several reports have described an unexpected effect of iron chelators, such as an improvement in hemoglobin levels, in patients affected by myelodysplastic syndromes. Furthermore, the novel chelator deferasirox induces a similar improvement more rapidly. Nuclear factor-kappaB is a key regulator of many cellular processes and its impaired activity has been described in different myeloid malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated deferasirox activity on nuclear factor-kappaB in myelodysplastic syndromes as a possible mechanism involved in hemoglobin improvement during in vivo treatment. Forty peripheral blood samples collected from myelodysplastic syndrome patients were incubated with 50 muM deferasirox for 18h. RESULTS: Nuclear factor-kappaB activity dramatically decreased in samples showing high basal activity as well as in cell lines, whereas no similar behavior was observed with other iron chelators despite a similar reduction in reactive oxygen species levels. Additionally, ferric hydroxyquinoline incubation did not decrease deferasirox activity in K562 cells suggesting the mechanism of action of the drug is independent from cell iron deprivation by chelation. Finally, incubation with both etoposide and deferasirox induced an increase in K562 apoptotic rate. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear factor-kappaB inhibition by deferasirox is not seen from other chelators and is iron and reactive oxygen species scavenging independent.

A report on behalf of the GIMEMA Acute Leukemia Working Party.,1683-90,10.3324/haematol.2009.020792 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Recently, in genome-wide analyses of DNA copy number abnormalities using single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays, genetic alterations targeting PAX5 were identified in over 30% of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. So far the occurrence of PAX5 alterations and their clinical correlation have not been investigated in adults with BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to characterize the rearrangements on 9p involving PAX5 and their clinical significance in adults with BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Eighty-nine adults with de novo BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled into institutional (n=15) or GIMEMA (Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell'Adulto) (n=74) clinical trials and, after obtaining informed consent, their genome was analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (Affymetrix 250K NspI and SNP 6.0), genomic polymerase chain reaction analysis and re-sequencing. RESULTS: PAX5 genomic deletions were identified in 29 patients (33%) with the extent of deletions ranging from a complete loss of chromosome 9 to the loss of a subset of exons. In contrast to BCR-ABL1-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia, no point mutations were found, suggesting that deletions are the main mechanism of inactivation of PAX5 in BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The deletions were predicted to result in PAX5 haploinsufficiency or expression of PAX5 isoforms with impaired DNA-binding. Deletions of PAX5 were not significantly correlated with overall survival, disease-free survival or cumulative incidence of relapse, suggesting that PAX5 deletions are not associated with outcome.

Here we investigated the cytokine requirements for NK-22 cell expansion. IL-7 maintained the survival of NK-22 cells and IL-22 production in response to IL-23 but was insufficient to induce robust expansion. Proliferation of NK-22 cells was increased markedly by adding either IL-1beta or IL-2 to IL-7 and was even stronger in the presence of IL-1beta plus IL-2. In contrast to IL-7, continuous culture in IL-1beta and IL-2 modified NK-22 cytokine profiles. IL-1beta promoted constitutive IL-22 secretion rather than acute IL-22 production in response to IL-23 and induced IL-17 in some cells. IL-2 reduced secretion of IL-22 and IL-17, increasing production of IFN-gamma and leukemia inhibitory factor.

These results demonstrate the functional plasticity of NK-22 cells, which may allow flexible responses to different pathogens.

They have been shown to inhibit chemical carcinogenesis by a wide variety of chemical carcinogens in animal models. Recent studies have also shown that isothiocyanates have antitumor activity, inhibiting the growth of several types of cultured human cancer cells. Our previous study showed that PEITC inhibited human leukemia cells growth by inducing apoptosis. However, the effect of isothiocyanates on lung cancer cell metastasis has not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of BITC and PEITC on metastatic potential of highly metastatic human lung cancer L9981 cells. METHODS: Cell migration and invasion were measured by wound healing assay and transwell chemotaxis assay. Expression of metastasis-related genes was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The mechanisms of action were evaluated by flow cytometry, reporter assay and Western blotting. RESULTS: Our data showed that both BITC and PEITC inhibited L9981 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 values were 5.0 and 9.7 microM, respectively. Cell migrations were reduced to 8.1% and 16.5% of control, respectively; and cell invasions were reduced to 2.7% and 7.3% of control, respectively. Metastasis-related genes MMP-2, Twist and beta-catenin were also modulated. BITC and PEITC inhibited cell survival signaling molecules Akt and NFkappaB activation. Moreover, BITC and PEITC increased ROS generation and caused GSH depletion. Pretreatment with NAC blocked BITC and PEITC induced ROS elevation and NFkappaB inhibition. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that BITC and PEITC suppress lung cancer cell metastasis potential by modulation of metastasis-related gene expression, inhibition of Akt/NFkappaB pathway.

Despite this, data are limited to define the incidence of ARF in this population. This study aims to evaluate the rate of ARF in AML patients and to delineate the impact of age, race, various co-morbid conditions and antimicrobial agents on the development of ARF. METHODS: A cohort of newly diagnosed AML patients from children's hospitals across the United States was identified using the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Information regarding demographics, discharge diagnoses, pharmaceutical exposures, and hospital resource utilization were collected for each hospitalization for up to 1 year from AML diagnosis. Cox regression analysis was used to define the hazard ratios for development of ARF by demographic variables, co-morbid conditions, and exposure to various antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Within 1 year of AML diagnosis, 135 (16.2%) patients were diagnosed with ARF. After adjustment for the presence of co-morbid conditions, the risk for ARF was greater in older patients and in black patients. Vancomycin exposure duration of greater than 48 hr and carbapenem exposure duration greater than 10 days were associated with an increased risk for ARF. CONCLUSION: ARF is a relatively common problem in children with AML. Future studies should address the different risks of ARF by age and race. Empiric therapy with potentially nephrotoxic agents did not increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Patients on prolonged vancomycin therapy should be monitored closely for development of ARF.","['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Fisher, Brian T', 'Zaoutis, Theoklis E', 'Leckerman, Kateri H', 'Localio, Russell', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Fisher BT', 'Zaoutis TE', 'Leckerman KH', 'Localio R', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. fisherbria@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*etiology', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2010/06/10 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22601 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Oct;55(4):655-61. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22601.,['R01 CA133881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3909928,['NIHMS550157'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy is rarely curative and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induce only transient responses. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a chaperone protein that is important in signal transduction, cell cycle control, and transcription regulation in both normal and leukemia cells. In the current study, we tested the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of a novel Hsp90 inhibitor, EC141 on the Ph+ ALL lines Z-119, Z-181, and Z-33, as well as primary bone marrow-derived blasts from patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. We found that EC141 inhibited the growth of Ph+ ALL cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC(50) ranged from 1 to 10 nM. EC141 also inhibited the proliferation of primary bone marrow-derived blasts using the ALL blast colony assay. EC141 down-regulated Hsp90 and up-regulated Hsp70 protein levels, inhibited CrkL phosphorylation, and induced degradation of Bcr-Abl p190 protein through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway. Furthermore, exposure of Ph+ ALL cells to EC141 resulted in activation of caspase-3, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that EC141 is a potent Hsp90 inhibitor with activity against Ph+ ALL. Further studies to investigate the anticancer effect of EC141 either as a single agent, or in combination in Ph+ ALL and other hematological malignancies are warranted.",,"['Tong, Wei-Gang', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Wang, Yongtao', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Harris, David M', 'Van Pham, Quin', 'Hazan-Halevy, Inbal', 'Liu, Zhiming', 'Koch, Patricia', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra']","['Tong WG', 'Estrov Z', 'Wang Y', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Harris DM', 'Van Pham Q', 'Hazan-Halevy I', 'Liu Z', 'Koch P', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating MJ', 'Ferrajoli A']","['Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas M.

Many patients never achieve significant cytogenetic or molecular responses. Some develop resistance to the drug, while others are simply unable to tolerate it. Unfortunately, most will relapse if the drug is discontinued. This is particularly true in patients with advanced disease, who tend to develop resistance rapidly and are unlikely to achieve durable remission with single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. A growing body of evidence suggests that the reason imatinib does not cure CML is that it is unable to eradicate the leukemic stem cells (LSC). LSC are a tiny population of cancer cells with the capacity to recapitulate the disease. These quiescent cells have subverted properties of normal hematopoietic stem cells, allowing them to avoid apoptosis, evade innate immunity, renew themselves, and survive long term.

Moreover, if the imatinib treatment is stopped, most patients eventually relapse (Cortes et al. in Clin. Cancer Res. 11:3425-3432, 2005). In Kim et al. (PLoS Comput. Biol. 4(6):e1000095, 2008), the authors presented a mathematical model for the dynamics of CML under imatinib treatment that incorporates the anti-leukemia immune response. We use the mathematical model in Kim et al. (PLoS Comput. Biol. 4(6):e1000095, 2008) to study and numerically simulate strategic treatment interruptions as a potential therapeutic strategy for CML patients. We present the results of numerous simulated treatment programs in which imatinib treatment is temporarily stopped to stimulate and leverage the anti-leukemia immune response to combat CML. The simulations presented in this paper imply that treatment programs that involve strategic treatment interruptions may prevent leukemia from relapsing and may prevent remission for significantly longer than continuous imatinib treatment. Moreover, in many cases, strategic treatment interruptions may completely eliminate leukemic cells from the body. Thus, strategic treatment interruptions may be a feasible clinical approach to enhancing the effects of imatinib treatment for CML. We study the effects of both the timing and the duration of the treatment interruption on the results of the treatment.

To date, the number of children exposed to biologicals is small. In addition, knowledge about the background incidence of malignancies in children with JIA and the influence of co-medication is limited. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2009 five cases of malignancy were documented in the German JIA Etanercept in Children Registry covering 1200 patients, including one case each of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, thyroid cancer, yolk sac cancer, and cervical dysplasia. All five patients had been treated with a number of other drugs including cytotoxic drugs (methotrexate, leflunomide, azathioprine, cyclosporine A) before institution of etanercept therapy. All patients were treated with etanercept, while two patients were also treated with adalimumab or infliximab. Malignancy appeared after an etanercept treatment period of between 3 weeks and more than 6 years. At the time of diagnosis, three patients were still on etanercept, five on methotrexate and one on infliximab. In three patients malignancy first occurred in adulthood. All patients recovered. CONCLUSION: This case series of JIA and malignancy shows that prior to starting treatment with TNF-inhibitors careful consideration needs to be given to the possible benefits and risks. Patients need to be observed long-term and observation should to be continued in adulthood. Although a temporal association has been described to date, a causal role of TNF inhibitors cannot be excluded and parents and/or patients should be appropriately informed about this risk.",,"['Horneff, G']",['Horneff G'],"['Asklepios Kinderklinik St Augustin GmbH, Arnold-Janssen-Str 29, 53757 St Augustin. g.horneff@asklepios.com']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Z Rheumatol,Zeitschrift fur Rheumatologie,0414162,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'FYS6T7F842 (Adalimumab)', 'OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)']",IM,"['Adalimumab', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Biological Products/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Etanercept', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/therapeutic use', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2010/06/10 06:00,2011/01/22 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00393-010-0655-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Z Rheumatol. 2010 Aug;69(6):516-26. doi: 10.1007/s00393-010-0655-8.,,,,,,,,,,,Malignome und Tumor-Nekrose-Faktor-Inhibitoren bei der juvenilen idiopathischen Arthritis.,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 250 patients having thrombocytosis (defined as platelet count >500 x 10(9)/L) on haematological investigations were studied over one yr period. All patients were evaluated clinically and were subjected to investigations, including complete blood counts (CBC) with peripheral smear examination. To elucidate the possible role of inflammatory cytokines in pathogenesis of RT, levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C - reactive protein (CRP) were estimated. RESULTS: Infants and young children (<2 yr age) were most common group, contributing 60% of total cases. Out of total 250 cases, only 3 (1.2%) cases were found to have primary thrombocytosis and remaining 98.8% cases were having RT. Among RT patients, infections (alone or in association with iron deficiency anemia) were most common cause, accounting for 65% cases, while iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was second most common cause accounting for 41.3% cases (12.6% IDA alone and 28.7 % in association with infections). Other causes included nutritional dimorphic anemia and patients on treatment for megaloblastic anemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (during treatment) and lymphoma. Among various groups of RT, IL-6 and CRP levels were higher in patients with infection with or without IDA than IDA alone. One child with essential thrombocytosis and one child with RT had thrombotic complications. On follow up, platelet counts normalized in most of the patients with treatment of underlying conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that essential thrombocytosis is extremely rare in children. Infections and IDA (alone or in association with infections) are common causes of RT. IL-6 and CRP levels are increased in patients with RT, to a higher level in patients with infections than in patients with IDA. Most patients with RT have uneventful recovery of platelet counts to normal range with treatment for underlying condition.",,"['Yadav, Dinesh', 'Chandra, Jagdish', 'Sharma, Sunita', 'Singh, Varinder']","['Yadav D', 'Chandra J', 'Sharma S', 'Singh V']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Associated Kalawati Saran, Children's Hospital, New Delhi, India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100608,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/complications', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Cell Count', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/complications', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytosis/*blood/etiology/immunology']",2010/06/10 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12098-010-0091-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2010 Jun;77(6):643-7. doi: 10.1007/s12098-010-0091-4.

We therefore investigated the novel DAC inhibitor AR-42 to determine its efficacy in B-cell malignancies. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In mantle cell lymphoma (JeKo-1), Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (697) cell lines, the 48-hr IC(50) (50% growth inhibitory concentration) of AR-42 is 0.61 microM or less. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient cells, the 48-hr LC(50) (concentration lethal to 50%) of AR-42 is 0.76 microM. AR-42 produces dose- and time-dependent acetylation both of histones and tubulin, and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis that is not reduced in the presence of stromal cells. AR-42 also sensitizes CLL cells to TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), potentially through reduction of c-FLIP. AR-42 significantly reduced leukocyte counts and/or prolonged survival in three separate mouse models of B-cell malignancy without evidence of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these data demonstrate that AR-42 has in vitro and in vivo efficacy at tolerable doses. These results strongly support upcoming phase I testing of AR-42 in B-cell malignancies.",,"['Lucas, David M', 'Alinari, Lapo', 'West, Derek A', 'Davis, Melanie E', 'Edwards, Ryan B', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Hofmeister, Craig C', 'Freitas, Michael A', 'Parthun, Mark R', 'Wang, Dasheng', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Kulp, Samuel K', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Baiocchi, Robert A', 'Byrd, John C']","['Lucas DM', 'Alinari L', 'West DA', 'Davis ME', 'Edwards RB', 'Johnson AJ', 'Blum KA', 'Hofmeister CC', 'Freitas MA', 'Parthun MR', 'Wang D', 'Lehman A', 'Zhang X', 'Jarjoura D', 'Kulp SK', 'Croce CM', 'Grever MR', 'Chen CS', 'Baiocchi RA', 'Byrd JC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100603,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (OSU-HDAC42 compound)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*pathology', 'Phenylbutyrates/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",2010/06/10 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0010941 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jun 3;5(6):e10941. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0010941.,"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025755/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2880605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its beneficial effects rely on donor-derived T cell-targeted leukemic cells, the so-called graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Induction of GVL is usually associated with concomitant development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major complication of allogeneic HSCT. The T cells that mediate GVL and GVHD are activated by alloantigen presented on host antigen-presenting cells of hematopoietic origin, and it is not well understood how alloantigen expression on non-hematopoietic cells affects GVL activity. Here we show, in mouse models of MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched bone marrow transplantation, that alloantigen expression on host epithelium drives donor T cells into apoptosis and dysfunction during GVHD, resulting in a loss of GVL activity. During GVHD, programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD ligand-1 (PD-L1), molecules implicated in inducing T cell exhaustion, were upregulated on activated T cells and the target tissue, respectively, suggesting that the T cell defects driven by host epithelial alloantigen expression might be mediated by the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Consistent with this, blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions partially restored T cell effector functions and improved GVL. These results elucidate a previously unrecognized significance of alloantigen expression on non-hematopoietic cells in GVL and suggest that separation of GVL from GVHD for more effective HSCT may be possible in human patients.",,"['Asakura, Shoji', 'Hashimoto, Daigo', 'Takashima, Shuichiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruko', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Teshima, Takanori']","['Asakura S', 'Hashimoto D', 'Takashima S', 'Sugiyama H', 'Maeda Y', 'Akashi K', 'Tanimoto M', 'Teshima T']","['Biopathological Science, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100607,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/transplantation', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation']",2010/06/10 06:00,2010/07/28 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2009/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['39165 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI39165 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2010 Jul;120(7):2370-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI39165.

The only significant, though weak, dose-related associations found were for leukaemia and multiple myeloma. The results for the Canadian cohort, which comprised workers from the facilities of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), were compatible with those for the other national cohorts. In 2005, IARC completed a further study, involving nuclear workers from 15 countries, including Canada. In these results, the dose-related risk for leukaemia was not significant but the prominent finding was a statistically significant excess relative risk per sievert (ERR Sv(-1)) for 'all cancers excluding leukaemia'. Surprisingly, the risk ascribed to the Canadian cohort for all cancers excluding leukaemia, driven by the AECL sub-cohort, was significantly higher than the risk estimate for the 15-country cohort as a whole. We have attempted to identify why the results for the AECL cohort were so discrepant and had such a remarkable influence on the 15-country risk estimate. When considering the issues associated with data on the AECL cohorts and their handling, we noted a striking feature: a major change in outcome of studies that involved Canadian nuclear workers occurred concomitantly with the shift to when data from the National Dose Registry (NDR) of Canada were used directly rather than data from records at AECL. We concluded that an important contributor to the considerable upward shift in apparent risk in the 15-country and other Canadian studies that have been based on the NDR probably relates to pre-1971 data and, in particular, the absence from the NDR of the person-years of workers who had zero doses in the calendar years 1956 to 1970. Our recommendation was for there to be a comprehensive evaluation of the risks from radiation in nuclear industry workers in Canada, organisation by organisation, in which some of the anomalies that we have identified might be addressed.",,"['Ashmore, J Patrick', 'Gentner, Norman E', 'Osborne, Richard V']","['Ashmore JP', 'Gentner NE', 'Osborne RV']","['Ponsonby & Associates, Manotick, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100609,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bias', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Internationality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Nuclear Power Plants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/10 06:00,2010/10/14 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0952-4746(10)40499-1 [pii]', '10.1088/0952-4746/30/2/001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2010 Jun;30(2):121-9. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/30/2/001.

We reasoned that up-regulation of epigenetically silenced tumor antigens may induce an immunologically mediated antitumor response and contribute to their clinical activity. In this study, we demonstrate that azacitidine (AZA) and sodium valproate (VPA) up-regulate expression of melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE antigens) on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloma cell lines. In separate studies, we observed that prior exposure to AZA/VPA increased recognition of myeloma cell lines by a MAGE-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone. We therefore measured CTL responses to MAGE antigens in 21 patients with AML or myelodysplasia treated with AZA/VPA. CTL responses to MAGE antigens were documented in only 1 patient before therapy; however, treatment with AZA/VPA induced a CTL response in 10 patients. Eight of the 11 patients with circulating MAGE CTLs achieved a major clinical response after AZA/VPA therapy. This is the first demonstration of a MAGE-specific CTL response in AML.

To investigate its role in migration, trafficking, and homing of leukemic B lymphocytes we have used B cells from HS1(-/-) mice, the HS1-silenced human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) MEC1 cell line and primary leukemic B cells from patients with CLL. We have used both in vitro and in vivo models and found that the lack of expression of HS1 causes several important functional effects. In vitro, we observed an impaired cytoskeletal remodeling that resulted in diminished cell migration, abnormal cell adhesion, and increased homotypic aggregation. In vivo, immunodeficient Rag2(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) mice injected with HS1-silenced CLL B cells showed a decreased organ infiltration with the notable exception of the bone marrow (BM). The leukemic-prone Emu-TCL1 transgenic mice crossed with HS1-deficient mice were compared with Emu-TCL1 mice and showed an earlier disease onset and a reduced survival.

Proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) by gamma-secretase plays a key role in Notch-dependent nuclear signaling. gamma-Secretase is an attractive pharmaceutical target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. We describe the potent antitumor effects of PF-03084014, a small molecule that is a reversible, noncompetitive, and selective gamma-secretase inhibitor. The ability of PF-03084014 to inhibit gamma-secretase activity was shown by the reduction of endogenous NICD levels and by the downregulation of Notch target genes Hes-1 and cMyc in the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line HPB-ALL. PF-03084014 caused cell growth inhibition of several T-ALL cell lines via cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. PF-03084014 treatment also resulted in robust NICD reduction in HBP-ALL xenograft models. Broad antitumor efficacy at well-tolerated dose levels was observed in six Notch-dependent models. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in HPB-ALL tumors, suggesting that the antitumor activity of PF-03084014 may be mediated by its direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival. Further studies on PF-03084014-induced gastrointestinal toxicity identified an intermittent dosing schedule that displayed reduced body weight loss and sustained antitumor efficacy. We also showed that glucocorticoids abrogated PF-03084014-induced gastrointestinal toxicity and delayed administration of glucocorticoids did not compromise its protection effect. Collectively, the results show that inhibition of Notch signaling by PF-03084014 while minimizing gastrointestinal toxicity presents a promising approach for development of therapies for Notch receptor-dependent cancers.

Therefore, a novel deimmunized bispecific ligand-directed toxin targeted by dual high-affinity single-chain Fvs (scFv) spliced to PE38 with a KDEL COOH-terminus was genetically engineered. The aims were to reduce toxin immunogenicity using mutagenesis, measure the ability of mutated drug to elicit antitoxin antibody responses, and show that mutated drug was effective against systemic B-cell lymphoma in vivo. Both human anti-CD22 scFv and anti-CD19 scFv were cloned onto the same single-chain molecule with truncated pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38) to create the drug. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to mutate amino acids in seven key epitopic toxin regions that dictate B-cell generation of neutralizing antitoxin antibodies. Bioassays were used to determine whether mutation reduced potency, and ELISAs were done to determine whether antitoxin antibodies were reduced. Finally, a powerful genetically altered luciferase xenograft model was used that could be imaged in real time to determine the effect on systemic malignant human B-cell lymphoma, Raji-luc. Patient B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and B lymphoma were high in CD22 and CD19 expression. 2219KDEL7mut was significantly effective against systemic Raji-luc in mice and prevented metastatic spread. Mutagenesis reduced neutralizing antitoxin antibodies by approximately 80% with no apparent loss in in vitro or in vivo activity. Because 2219KDEL7mut immunogenicity was significantly reduced and the drug was highly effective in vivo, we can now give multiple drug treatments with targeted toxins in future clinical trials.",,"['Vallera, Daniel A', 'Oh, Seunguk', 'Chen, Hua', 'Shu, Yanqun', 'Frankel, Arthur E']","['Vallera DA', 'Oh S', 'Chen H', 'Shu Y', 'Frankel AE']","['Masonic Cancer Center, Section on Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. valle001@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100608,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'Bacterial Toxins/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Bioengineering/*methods', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Exotoxins/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*metabolism', 'Virulence Factors/*immunology/pharmacology']",2010/06/10 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0203 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0203 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Jun;9(6):1872-83. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0203.

In this work, we pursued TfR antibodies as potential cancer therapeutics, characterizing human single-chain variable antibody fragments (scFv) specific for the human TfR isolated from a phage display library. We hypothesized that many of these antibodies would function as ligand mimetics because scFvs from the library were selected for binding and internalization into living cells. In support of this hypothesis, the anti-TfR scFvs identified were antagonists of TfR binding to holo-Tf, particularly two of the most potent antibodies, 3TF12 and 3GH7, which blocked the in vitro proliferation of a number of hematopoietic cancer cell lines. We optimized this activity of 3TF12 and 3GH7 by engineering 55-kDa bivalent antibody formats, namely, F12CH and H7CH, which could block cell proliferation with an IC(50) of 0.1 microg/mL. We found that the mechanism of the scFv antibody cytotoxicity was unique compared with cytotoxic anti-TfR monoclonal antibodies that have been described, causing cell surface upregulation of TfR along with the inhibition of holo-Tf cell uptake and induction of cell death. In a nude mouse model of erythroleukemia, administration of F12CH reduced tumor growth.

Despite significant advances in applicability, DLI has not been available for single-unit recipients of unrelated cord blood transplant. Ex vivo expansion of cord blood T cells can be achieved with interleukin (IL)-2 and CD3/CD28 costimulatory beads. However, significant apoptosis occurs in proliferating T cells, diminishing the yield and skewing the CD4/CD8 ratio in the T-cell population, jeopardizing the potential efficacy of DLI. In this study, we show that interleukin (IL)-7 not only reduces apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes and enhances their proliferation but also promotes functional maturation, leading to secretion of IFN-gamma and other key cytokines. Recognizing that infused T lymphocytes will need to meet microbial antigens in secondary lymphoid organs to generate effectors, we also show that expansion with IL-7 promotes the preservation of a polyclonal broad T-cell receptor repertoire and a surface phenotype that favors lymph node homing. Expanded lymphocytes lack alloreactivity against recipient and other allogeneic cells, indicating a favorable safety profile from graft-versus-host disease. Nevertheless, expanded T cells can be primed subsequently against lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells to generate tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells. Taken together, our findings offer a major step in fulfilling critical numerical and biological requirements to quickly generate a DLI product ex vivo using a negligible fraction of a cord blood graft that provides a flexible adoptive immunotherapy platform for both children and adults.",['Copyright 2010 AACR.'],"['Davis, Craig C', 'Marti, Luciana C', 'Sempowski, Gregory D', 'Jeyaraj, Durairaj A', 'Szabolcs, Paul']","['Davis CC', 'Marti LC', 'Sempowski GD', 'Jeyaraj DA', 'Szabolcs P']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100608,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/*transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Perforin/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Th1 Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/biosynthesis/immunology']",2010/06/10 06:00,2010/08/10 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-2860 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2860 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Jul 1;70(13):5249-58. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2860.

Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug is successfully being used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Several clinical trials also suggest its ineffectiveness on solid tumors. We proposed that arsenic trioxide may be used as chemosensitizer, especially to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The effect of arsenic trioxide on cell proliferation of 5-FU-sensitive and -resistant HT29 colorectal cancer cells in vitro was tested by trypan blue dye exclusion assay, 2, 3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-S-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) cell proliferation assay and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. Gene expression was analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot methods. There was a dose-dependent increase in cell detachment and proliferation in HT29 and HT29FU cells. As a single agent, arsenic trioxide also down-regulated thymidylate synthase (TS) expression without affecting the expression of some other genes analyzed in the above cell lines.

Diagnoses were follicular lymphoma (n = 17), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 13), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 8), marginal zone lymphoma (n = 1), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (n = 1). Median age was 55 years (range, 34-68 years). All patients were high risk with refractory disease or relapse after preceding autologous HCT. No additional toxicities attributable to RIT were observed. Engraftment was rapid and sustained.

Here, we show that the uncoating process requires the interaction of the capsid (CA) protein with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated serine/threonine residue followed by proline. We found that the HIV-1 core is composed of some isoforms of the CA protein with different isoelectric points, and one isoform is preferentially phosphorylated in the Ser(16)-Pro(17) motif. The mutant virus S16A/P17A shows a severely attenuated HIV-1 replication and an impaired reverse transcription. The S16A/P17A change increased the amount of particulate CA cores in the cytosol of target cells and correlated with the restriction of HIV-1 infection. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays demonstrated a direct interaction between Pin1 and the HIV-1 core via the Ser(16)-Pro(17) motif. Suppression of Pin1 expression by RNA interference in a target cell results in an attenuated HIV-1 replication and increases the amount of particulate CA cores in the cytosol of target cells. Furthermore, heat-inactivated, inhibitor-treated, or W34A/K63A Pin1 causes an attenuated in vitro uncoating of the HIV-1 core. The Pin1-dependent uncoating is inhibited by antisera raised against a CA peptide phosphorylated at Ser(16) or treatment of the HIV-1 core with alkaline phosphatase. These findings provide insights into this obscure uncoating process in the HIV-1 life cycle and a new cellular target for HIV-1 drug development.",,"['Misumi, Shogo', 'Inoue, Mutsumi', 'Dochi, Takeo', 'Kishimoto, Naoki', 'Hasegawa, Naomi', 'Takamune, Nobutoki', 'Shoji, Shozo']","['Misumi S', 'Inoue M', 'Dochi T', 'Kishimoto N', 'Hasegawa N', 'Takamune N', 'Shoji S']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 862-0973, Japan. misumi@gpo.kumamoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100607,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)']",IM,"['Capsid Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/physiology', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Threonine/metabolism']",2010/06/10 06:00,2010/08/31 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)59902-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.114256 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Aug 13;285(33):25185-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.114256.

Here, we provide evidence that gossypol induces autophagy followed by apoptotic cell death in both the MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma and HeLa cell lines. We first show that knockdown of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein Beclin 1 reduces gossypol-induced autophagy in MCF-7 cells, but not in HeLa cells. Gossypol inhibits the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2), antagonizes the inhibition of autophagy by Bcl-2, and hence stimulates autophagy. We then show that knockdown of Vps34 reduces gossypol-induced autophagy in both cell lines, and consistent with this, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein WIPI-1 is recruited to autophagosomal membranes. Further, Atg5 knockdown also reduces gossypol-mediated autophagy. We conclude that gossypol induces autophagy in both a canonical and a noncanonical manner. Notably, we found that gossypol-mediated apoptotic cell death was potentiated by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor wortmannin or with small interfering RNA against essential autophagy genes (Vps34, Beclin 1, and Atg5).

The hallmark of CML is an acquired chromosomal translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) that results in the synthesis of the BCR-ABL fusion protein, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (TK). The introduction of imatinib, a TK inhibitor (TKI) specific for BCR-ABL, was a major breakthrough in CML therapy. Although most patients respond to first-line imatinib therapy, some experience a loss of response (resistance) or require treatment discontinuation because of toxicity (intolerance). In patients for whom standard-dose imatinib therapy (400 mg/day) fails, imatinib dose escalation (600-800 mg/day) is a second-line option. However, high-dose imatinib is not an appropriate approach for patients experiencing drug toxicity, and there remain questions over the durability of responses achieved with this strategy. Alternative second-line options include the newer TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib. A substantial amount of long-term data for these agents is available. Although both are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit unique pharmacologic profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCR-ABL mutational status.

Combination of conventional chemotherapy with immunotherapeutic agents is currently considered the most active strategy, with improved progression-free survival and overall survival. However, patients are not cured and invariably experience relapsing disease requiring treatment. In contrast to the advances made in first-line treatment strategies, much less progress has been made for patients with relapsed and especially refractory CLL. The activity of most chemotherapeutic drugs used in CLL rely on intact p53 function, and repeated cycles of therapy might eventually result in drug resistance because of acquired cytogenetic alterations, mainly affecting genes involved in the p53 response. As a consequence, most commonly used treatment regimens are ineffective in patients with refractory disease. A number of promising alternative treatment approaches are currently under investigation.

Dramatic results from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) clinical trials spurred the development of TKIs for other malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia as well as kidney and lung cancer. In CML, imatinib resistance led to the rapid development of dasatinib and nilotinib, more potent second-generation ABL kinase inhibitors that can often overcome imatinib resistance. While the clinical efficacy of TKIs in CML is well established, a number of important questions remain about the optimal dose and duration of therapy. Even the best initial dose for imatinib is still under investigation. Although laboratory and clinical studies had led to the prevailing view that continual inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase was required for optimal efficacy, recent data on dasatinib have upended this notion and have led to a change in the recommended dosing schedule. The availability of dasatinib and nilotinib also begs the question of whether they might be superior to imatinib as first-line agents. Finally, the question of whether it may be possible to stop TKI therapy at least in some patients with CML has attracted considerable attention.

Cytofluorometric measurements demonstrated that ATP induced ethidium+ uptake into MEL cells in a concentration-dependent fashion and with an EC(50) of approximately 154 microM. The most potent P2X7 agonist 2'- and 3'-0(4-benzoylbenzoyl) ATP, but not ADP or UTP, induced ethidium+ uptake. ATP-induced ethidium+ and YO-PRO-1(2+) uptake were impaired by the P2X7 antagonist, A-438079. A colourmetric assay demonstrated that ATP impaired MEL cell growth. A cytofluorometric assay showed that ATP induced MEL cell death and that this process was impaired by A-438079.

This hypothesis was tested by correlating numbers of DC precursors and T cells in the blood before and during ECP therapy with response of cGVHD. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with cGVHD were treated with ECP. Data were collected with emphasis on blood cellular markers, clinical response to ECP, and overall survival. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (56%) responded and had better 2-year survival than nonresponders (88% vs. 18%, p=0.003). Responders had higher baseline circulating myeloid DC (mDC) and plasmacytoid DC precursors and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared with nonresponders. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that the best baseline cutoff values to predict response to ECP were mDC counts of 3.7 cells/microL (79% sensitivity, 82% specificity) and CD4+ T-cell counts of 104 cells/microL (71% sensitivity, 82% specificity).

HA22 (CAT-8015) is an immunotoxin composed of an anti-CD22 variable fragment linked to a 38 kDa truncated protein derived from Pseudomonas exotoxin A. Using a bone marrow mesenchymal cell culture assay to support ALL cell viability, we investigated the in vitro cytotoxicity of HA22 against ALL blasts from newly diagnosed (n = 13) and relapsed patients (n = 22). There was interpatient variability in sensitivity to HA22. Twenty-four of 35 patient samples tested were sensitive (median 50% lethal concentration 3 ng/ml, range 1-80 ng/ml). Blasts from the other 11 patients were not killed by 500 ng/ml HA22. The median 50% lethal concentration was 20 ng/ml for all patients. There was no significant difference in HA22 sensitivity between diagnosis and relapse samples but peripheral blood ALL blasts were more sensitive to HA22 than those from bone marrow (P = 0.008). Thus, HA22, at concentrations achievable in patients, is highly cytotoxic to B-lineage ALL cells.

Scientists have tried for decades to understand leukemia development in the context of therapeutic strategies. The existence of ""leukemic stem cells"" and their possible role in leukemogenesis have only recently been identified and it has changed the perspective with regard to new approaches for treating the disease. However the relationship between leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and leukemogenesis requires further investigation. In this present study, we have experimentally induced leukemia in mice by means of N-N' Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) to investigate the alterations in normal bone marrow cellular phenotype and associated changes in the stromal hematopoietic microenvironment under the event of leukemic disease progression. We have identified a significant decrease in the normal HSC phenotype in terms of Sca1 and c-kit receptor expression and subsequent sharp increase in certain leukemic cell specific receptor expression like CD123, CXCR4 and CD44 in the leukemic bone marrow. The decreased HSC receptor (Sca1 and c-kit) expression profile with concurrent increase in the expression of leukemic cell specific receptors (CD123, CXCR4, CD44) by the bone marrow cells of leukemic mice may account for the possible transformation of the normal hematopoietic cells that is necessary for the disease initiation and progression. Some of these receptors like CXCR4 and CD44 are also known to play an important role in maintaining leukemic cells and their complex crosstalk with the surrounding stromal microenvironment. Thus up-regulation in CXCR4 and CD44 receptor expression essentially pointed towards the stroma dependent surveillance of the leukemic bone marrow cells in leukemia. Leukemic bone marrow cells documented a rapid generation of stromal feeder layer in culture. The rapid stroma generation further supported the fact that leukemic stromal microenvironment gets altered in possible ways to support leukemic cell generation and fueling leukemogenesis. The study presented here, has tried to hint at exploring new therapeutic strategies by not only identifying the expression profile of cell surface receptors unique to cells involved in leukemic progression but also targeting the specific components of the stromal microenvironment that would facilitate therapeutic management of the disease.",,"['Basak, Pratima', 'Chatterjee, Sumanta', 'Das, Madhurima', 'Das, Prosun', 'Pereira, Jacintha Archana', 'Dutta, Ranjan Kumar', 'Chaklader, Malay', 'Chaudhuri, Samaresh', 'Law, Sujata']","['Basak P', 'Chatterjee S', 'Das M', 'Das P', 'Pereira JA', 'Dutta RK', 'Chaklader M', 'Chaudhuri S', 'Law S']","['Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, Calcutta-700073, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Ethylnitrosourea/administration & dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/physiology']",2010/06/10 06:00,2011/06/02 06:00,['2010/06/10 06:00'],"['2010/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ABSTRACT # 62 [pii]', '10.2174/157488810793351677 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2010 Dec;5(4):379-86. doi: 10.2174/157488810793351677.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is generally accepted that myelodysplastic syndromes originate as a result of multistep leukemogenesis, implicating genetic, epigenetic and immune-mediated alterations of an early hematopoietic stem cell. However, alterations in the BM microenvironment in terms of abnormal hematopoietic-to-stromal cell interactions, relative deficiency of hematopoietic growth factors and aberrant release of inhibitors may also have a role in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) pathogenesis. The possible involvement of the BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the pathogenetic/pathophysiologic process of MDS has been recently studied but existing data on MSCs' cytogenetic and functional integrity are controversial. Notably, in our study we did not find any significant quantitative or qualitative deficits in MDS-derived MSCs. As no conclusive data on the characteristics of BM MSCs have been reported so far, future studies should aim at elucidating whether BM MSCs belong primarily to the abnormal clone or whether they are indirectly damaged and whether they might be safely used for therapeutic purposes in MDS patients.

CPX-351 has demonstrated markedly superior anti-leukemic activity over free Cyt:Daun drug cocktails in preclinical models. Given the prolonged plasma lifetime of CPX-351, we examined the relationship between therapeutic efficacy and the frequency of treatment in the consolidation setting using a bone marrow-engrafting human leukemia xenograft model. Adding a day 1,3,5 consolidation treatment course for CPX-351 therapy improved the increase in lifespan (ILS) from 116% and no cures for a single induction course, to 268% plus a 33% cure rate for an induction plus consolidation course. In contrast, free Cyt:Daun cocktail treatment provided much lower ILS values with no cures. Administering CPX-351 as consolidation therapy starting on day 42 using a day 1,3, day 1,5, or day 1,7 schedule yielded ILS values of 154%, 185%, and 108%, respectively. The increased efficacy observed for the day 1,3 and day 1,5 consolidation schedules was associated with elevated bone marrow drug accumulation for the second doses.

The histopathological and molecular genetic characterization of anaplastic plasmacytoma (APCT) in strain NSF.V(+) mice provides an example to achieve this goal for a specific lymphoma subtype. Firstly, it demonstrates that, like plasma-cell neoplasms in humans, those in mice occur as distinct subtypes. Secondly, it shows that mouse APCT exhibits striking parallels to possible human tumour counterparts for which good mouse models of de novo tumour development are sorely needed: IgM(+) multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia. Thirdly, it strongly suggests that insertional somatic mutagenesis, by either a murine leukaemia virus or an oncogenic transposon, would be an effective experimental approach to accelerating malignant transformation of mature B cells and plasma cells in mice and, thereby, tagging and uncovering cancer driver genes that may be of great relevance for the tumour initiation and progression in lymphoma.","['(c) 2010 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Trichostatin A, originally identified as an anti-fungal drug, is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) with potential anti-tumor activity. In this study, we investigated the effect of M344, an amide analogues of trichostatin A, on the growth and differentiation of THP-1 human leukemia cells. We showed that at low doses, (< 0.2 muM), M344 could inhibit the growth of THP-1 cells at G1 phase in vitro with low cytotoxic effect. Low dose of M344 exerted some differentiating effect on THP-1 cells as judged by the expression of c-fms proto-oncogene (M-CSF receptor) and appearance of adherent cells. Growth arrest induced by M344 is associated with increased levels of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor p21 and cyclin E, in agreement with G1 phase arrest. At higher doses (2 muM), M344 could induce THP-1 cells to undergo apoptosis, which was associated with the cleavage of PARP, cytochrome c release and activation of both caspases-8, -9, followed by the activation of caspase-3. In addition, M344 could increase the levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax but decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic protein XIAP. M344 is a potent activator of NF-kappaB transcription factor. RT-PCR assay showed that the M344 could transiently increase IL-1 expression yet markedly decreased TNF-alpha expression. Our results show that M344 is a potent growth inhibitor and inducer of apoptosis in human leukemia cells and suggest potential therapeutic strategies of HDAC inhibitors for patients with leukemias.",,"['Li, Xiaohua', 'Chen, Ben D']","['Li X', 'Chen BD']","['Department of Internal medicine and Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 550 E.

Recently, rare targetable gene fusions involving the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene, have been identified in 1-5% of lung cancers, suggesting that similar rare gene fusions may occur in other common epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer. Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to screen ETS rearrangement-negative prostate cancers for targetable gene fusions and identified the SLC45A3-BRAF (solute carrier family 45, member 3-v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) and ESRP1-RAF1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein-1-v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog-1) gene fusions. Expression of SLC45A3-BRAF or ESRP1-RAF1 in prostate cells induced a neoplastic phenotype that was sensitive to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K1) inhibitors. Screening a large cohort of patients, we found that, although rare, recurrent rearrangements in the RAF pathway tend to occur in advanced prostate cancers, gastric cancers and melanoma. Taken together, our results emphasize the key role of RAF family gene rearrangements in cancer, suggest that RAF and MEK inhibitors may be useful in a subset of gene fusion-harboring solid tumors and demonstrate that sequencing of tumor transcriptomes and genomes may lead to the identification of rare targetable fusions across cancer types.",,"['Palanisamy, Nallasivam', 'Ateeq, Bushra', 'Kalyana-Sundaram, Shanker', 'Pflueger, Dorothee', 'Ramnarayanan, Kalpana', 'Shankar, Sunita', 'Han, Bo', 'Cao, Qi', 'Cao, Xuhong', 'Suleman, Khalid', 'Kumar-Sinha, Chandan', 'Dhanasekaran, Saravana M', 'Chen, Ying-bei', 'Esgueva, Raquel', 'Banerjee, Samprit', 'LaFargue, Christopher J', 'Siddiqui, Javed', 'Demichelis, Francesca', 'Moeller, Peter', 'Bismar, Tarek A', 'Kuefer, Rainer', 'Fullen, Douglas R', 'Johnson, Timothy M', 'Greenson, Joel K', 'Giordano, Thomas J', 'Tan, Patrick', 'Tomlins, Scott A', 'Varambally, Sooryanarayana', 'Rubin, Mark A', 'Maher, Christopher A', 'Chinnaiyan, Arul M']","['Palanisamy N', 'Ateeq B', 'Kalyana-Sundaram S', 'Pflueger D', 'Ramnarayanan K', 'Shankar S', 'Han B', 'Cao Q', 'Cao X', 'Suleman K', 'Kumar-Sinha C', 'Dhanasekaran SM', 'Chen YB', 'Esgueva R', 'Banerjee S', 'LaFargue CJ', 'Siddiqui J', 'Demichelis F', 'Moeller P', 'Bismar TA', 'Kuefer R', 'Fullen DR', 'Johnson TM', 'Greenson JK', 'Giordano TJ', 'Tan P', 'Tomlins SA', 'Varambally S', 'Rubin MA', 'Maher CA', 'Chinnaiyan AM']","['Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100606,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (ESRP1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (SLC45a3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*genetics', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2010/06/08 06:00,2010/07/30 06:00,['2010/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2166 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2166 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2010 Jul;16(7):793-8. doi: 10.1038/nm.2166.

In this report, we show that the level of the human anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 is regulated during the cell cycle and peaks at mitosis. Mcl-1 is phosphorylated at two sites in mitosis, Ser64 and Thr92. Phosphorylation of Thr92 by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)-cyclin B1 initiates degradation of Mcl-1 in cells arrested in mitosis by microtubule poisons. Mcl-1 destruction during mitotic arrest requires proteasome activity and is dependent on Cdc20/Fizzy, which mediates recognition of mitotic substrates by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase. Stabilisation of Mcl-1 during mitotic arrest by mutation of either Thr92 or a D-box destruction motif inhibits the induction of apoptosis by microtubule poisons. Thus, phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by CDK1-cyclin B1 and its APC/C(Cdc20)-mediated destruction initiates apoptosis if a cell fails to resolve mitosis. Regulation of apoptosis, therefore, is linked intrinsically to progression through mitosis and is governed by a temporal mechanism that distinguishes between normal mitosis and prolonged mitotic arrest.",,"['Harley, Margaret E', 'Allan, Lindsey A', 'Sanderson, Helen S', 'Clarke, Paul R']","['Harley ME', 'Allan LA', 'Sanderson HS', 'Clarke PR']","['Biomedical Research Institute, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100604,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Apc3 Subunit, Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome)', '0 (CDC27 protein, human)', '0 (Cdc20 Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '156288-95-8 (CDC20 protein, human)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apc3 Subunit, Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cdc20 Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin B1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphopeptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Threonine/metabolism']",2010/06/08 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/06/08 06:00'],"['2009/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2010112 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2010.112 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2010 Jul 21;29(14):2407-20. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2010.112.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of dasatinib, as compared with imatinib, for the first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML. METHODS: In a multinational study, 519 patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML were randomly assigned to receive dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg once daily (259 patients) or imatinib at a dose of 400 mg once daily (260 patients). The primary end point was complete cytogenetic response by 12 months, confirmed on two consecutive assessments at least 28 days apart. Secondary end points, including major molecular response, were tested at a significance level of 0.0001 to adjust for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: After a minimum follow-up of 12 months, the rate of confirmed complete cytogenetic response was higher with dasatinib than with imatinib (77% vs. 66%, P=0.007), as was the rate of complete cytogenetic response observed on at least one assessment (83% vs. 72%, P=0.001). The rate of major molecular response was higher with dasatinib than with imatinib (46% vs. 28%, P<0.0001), and responses were achieved in a shorter time with dasatinib (P<0.0001). Progression to the accelerated or blastic phase of CML occurred in 5 patients who were receiving dasatinib (1.9%) and in 9 patients who were receiving imatinib (3.5%). The safety profiles of the two treatments were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib, administered once daily, as compared with imatinib, administered once daily, induced significantly higher and faster rates of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response. Since achieving complete cytogenetic response within 12 months has been associated with better long-term, progression-free survival, dasatinib may improve the long-term outcomes among patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of nilotinib, as compared with imatinib, in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study, we assigned 846 patients with chronic-phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive nilotinib (at a dose of either 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily) or imatinib (at a dose of 400 mg once daily). The primary end point was the rate of major molecular response at 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months, the rates of major molecular response for nilotinib (44% for the 300-mg dose and 43% for the 400-mg dose) were nearly twice that for imatinib (22%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The rates of complete cytogenetic response by 12 months were significantly higher for nilotinib (80% for the 300-mg dose and 78% for the 400-mg dose) than for imatinib (65%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Patients receiving either the 300-mg dose or the 400-mg dose of nilotinib twice daily had a significant improvement in the time to progression to the accelerated phase or blast crisis, as compared with those receiving imatinib (P=0.01 and P=0.004, respectively). No patient with progression to the accelerated phase or blast crisis had a major molecular response. Gastrointestinal and fluid-retention events were more frequent among patients receiving imatinib, whereas dermatologic events and headache were more frequent in those receiving nilotinib. Discontinuations due to aminotransferase and bilirubin elevations were low in all three study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib at a dose of either 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily was superior to imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML.

We report a role for the Bcl-2 family member myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) as an indispensable regulator of self-renewal in human stem cells and show that a functional dependence on Mcl-1 defines the human stem cell hierarchy. In vivo pharmacologic targeting of the Bcl-2 family members in human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and human leukemic stem cells reduced stem cell regenerative and self-renewal function. Subsequent protein expression studies showed that, among the Bcl-2 family members, only Mcl-1 was up-regulated exclusively in the human HSC fraction on in vivo regeneration of hematopoiesis. Short hairpin RNA-knockdown of Mcl-1 in human cord blood cells did not affect survival in the HSC or hematopoietic progenitor cell fractions in vitro but specifically reduced the in vivo self-renewal function of human HSCs. Moreover, knockdown of Mcl-1 in ontogenetically primitive human pluripotent stem cells resulted in almost complete ablation of stem cell self-renewal function. Our findings show that Mcl-1 is an essential regulator of stem cell self-renewal in humans and therefore represents an axis for therapeutic interventions.",,"['Campbell, Clinton J V', 'Lee, Jung Bok', 'Levadoux-Martin, Marilyne', 'Wynder, Tracy', 'Xenocostas, Anargyros', 'Leber, Brian', 'Bhatia, Mickie']","['Campbell CJ', 'Lee JB', 'Levadoux-Martin M', 'Wynder T', 'Xenocostas A', 'Leber B', 'Bhatia M']","['Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100604,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/physiology']",2010/06/08 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)33054-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-12-258095 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 2;116(9):1433-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-12-258095.

Its function in hematopoiesis has not yet been revealed. Mkl1, a cofactor of Srf, is part of the t(1;22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, and plays a critical role in megakaryopoiesis. To test the role of Srf in megakaryocyte development, we crossed Pf4-Cre mice, which express Cre recombinase in cells committed to the megakaryocytic lineage, to Srf(F/F) mice in which functional Srf is no longer expressed after Cre-mediated excision. Pf4-Cre/Srf(F/F) knockout (KO) mice are born with normal Mendelian frequency, but have significant macrothrombocytopenia with approximately 50% reduction in platelet count. In contrast, the BM has increased number and percentage of CD41(+) megakaryocytes (WT: 0.41% +/- 0.06%; KO: 1.92% +/- 0.12%) with significantly reduced ploidy. KO mice show significantly increased megakaryocyte progenitors in the BM by FACS analysis and CFU-Mk. Megakaryocytes lacking Srf have abnormal stress fiber and demarcation membrane formation, and platelets lacking Srf have abnormal actin distribution. In vitro and in vivo assays reveal platelet function defects in KO mice. Critical actin cytoskeletal genes are down-regulated in KO megakaryocytes. Thus, Srf is required for normal megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production partly because of regulation of cytoskeletal genes.",,"['Halene, Stephanie', 'Gao, Yuan', 'Hahn, Katherine', 'Massaro, Stephanie', 'Italiano, Joseph E Jr', 'Schulz, Vincent', 'Lin, Sharon', 'Kupfer, Gary M', 'Krause, Diane S']","['Halene S', 'Gao Y', 'Hahn K', 'Massaro S', 'Italiano JE Jr', 'Schulz V', 'Lin S', 'Kupfer GM', 'Krause DS']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Section of Hematology, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA. stephanie.halene@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100604,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bleeding Time', 'Blood Platelets/cytology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serum Response Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thrombocytopenia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/06/08 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)32998-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-261743 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 16;116(11):1942-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-261743.

In asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1 and in patients with HTLV-1-associated inflammatory and malignant diseases, a high FoxP3(+) cell frequency correlated with inefficient cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing of HTLV-1-infected cells. In adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), the FoxP3(+) population was distinct from the leukemic T cell clones. However, the cause of the increase in FoxP3(+) cell frequency in HTLV-1 infection was unknown. In this study, we report that the plasma concentration of the chemokine CCL22 is abnormally high in HTLV-1-infected subjects and that the concentration is strongly correlated with the frequency of FoxP3(+) cells, which express the CCL22 receptor CCR4. Further, we show that CCL22 is produced by cells that express the HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax, and that the increased CCL22 enhances the migration and survival of FoxP3(+) cells in vitro. Finally, we show that FoxP3(+) cells inhibit the proliferation of ex vivo, autologous leukemic clones from patients with ATLL. We conclude that HTLV-1-induced CCL22 causes the high frequency of FoxP3(+) cells observed in HTLV-1 infection; these FoxP3(+) cells may both retard the progression of ATLL and HTLV-1-associated inflammatory diseases and contribute to the immune suppression seen in HTLV-1 infection, especially in ATLL.",,"['Toulza, Frederic', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Schioppa, Tiziana', 'Balkwill, Frances', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Toulza F', 'Nosaka K', 'Tanaka Y', 'Schioppa T', 'Balkwill F', 'Taylor GP', 'Bangham CR']","['Department of Immunology, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom. f.toulza@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100604,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CCL22 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL22)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['CD4 Lymphocyte Count', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Chemokine CCL22/biosynthesis/blood/*physiology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/blood/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology/*immunology/virology']",2010/06/08 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0903846 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0903846 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Jul 1;185(1):183-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0903846.

The existence of donor-derived alloreactive NK cells can be predicted on the basis of donor killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) gene profile and HLA class I typing of both donor and recipient. Moreover, the size of the alloreactive NK cell population can be directly assessed by the combined use of anti-KIR-specific mAb. In this study, in an attempt to improve the definition of alloreactive NK cell subsets, we assessed the KIR genotype and phenotype in a cohort of 44 donors. This approach allowed the identification of two different KIR2DL3 alleles (KIR2DL3*005 and the novel allele KIR2DL3*015) that did not react with the anti-KIR2DL3-specific ECM41 mAb. In contrast, both alleles were recognized at the cell surface by several mAb reacting with KIR2DL2/L3/S2. Notably, KIR2DL3*005 was also stained by the anti-KIR2DL1/S1-specific EB6B and 11PB6 mAb. Functional analysis revealed that, despite its particular mAb reactivity, the specificity of KIR2DL3*005 for HLA-C molecules did not differ from that of other KIR2DL2/L3 alleles. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that glutamine at position 35 is required for ECM41 staining, whereas glutamic acid 35 and arginine 50 are relevant for staining with EB6B or 11PB6 mAb. Our present data represent a substantial progress in the characterization of the NK cell repertoire and an improved phenotypic/functional definition of given KIR(+) subsets.",,"['Falco, Michela', 'Romeo, Elisa', 'Marcenaro, Stefania', 'Martini, Stefania', 'Vitale, Massimo', 'Bottino, Cristina', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina', 'Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Moretta, Alessandro', 'Pende, Daniela']","['Falco M', 'Romeo E', 'Marcenaro S', 'Martini S', 'Vitale M', 'Bottino C', 'Mingari MC', 'Moretta L', 'Moretta A', 'Pende D']","['Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100604,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C*03 antigen)', '0 (HLA-C*04 antigen)', '0 (KIR2DL3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL3)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genotype', 'HLA-C Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Receptors, KIR2DL3/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism', '*Sequence Analysis, Protein/methods', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",2010/06/08 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0903632 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0903632 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Jul 1;185(1):433-41. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0903632.

However, no methods exist to predict with high accuracy at the individual patient level the response to standard AML induction therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We applied single-cell network profiling (SCNP) using flow cytometry, a tool that allows a comprehensive functional assessment of intracellular signaling pathways in heterogeneous tissues, to two training cohorts of AML samples (n = 34 and 88) to predict the likelihood of response to induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: In the first study, univariate analysis identified multiple signaling ""nodes"" (readouts of modulated intracellular signaling proteins) that correlated with response (i.e., AUC(ROC) > or = 0.66; P < or = 0.05) at a level greater than age. After accounting for age, similar findings were observed in the second study. For patients <60 years old, complete response was associated with the presence of intact apoptotic pathways. In patients > or =60 years old, nonresponse was associated with FLT3 ligand-mediated increase in phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Results were independent of cytogenetics, FLT3 mutational status, and diagnosis of secondary AML. CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasize the value of performing quantitative SCNP under modulated conditions as a basis for the development of tests highly predictive for response to induction chemotherapy. SCNP provides information distinct from other known prognostic factors such as age, secondary AML, cytogenetics, and molecular alterations and is potentially combinable with the latter to improve clinical decision making.

Lipid-droplet binding thalidomide analogs (2,6-dialkylphenyl-4/5-amino-substituted-5,6,7-trifluorophthalimides) with potent anticancer activities were synthesized. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity was detected in different cell lines including melanoma, leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma at micromolar concentrations. The synthesized analogs are non-toxic to adult animals up to 1 g/kg but are teratogenic to zebrafish embryos at micromolar concentrations with defects in the developing muscle. Treatment of tumor cells resulted in calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ER stress and cell death. Antioxidants could partially, while an intracellular calcium chelator almost completely diminish ROS production. Exogenous docosahexaenoic acid or eicosapentaenoic acid induced calcium release and ROS generation, and synergized with the analogs in vitro, while oleic acid had no such an effect. Gene expression analysis confirmed the induction of ER stress-mediated apoptosis pathway components, such as GADD153, ATF3, Luman/CREB3 and the ER-associated degradation-related HERPUD1 genes. Tumor suppressors, P53, LATS2 and ING3 were also up-regulated in various cell lines after drug treatment. Amino-phthalimides down-regulated the expression of CCL2, which is implicated in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.

To deliver these factors, murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors have been broadly used in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, MLV vectors have been implicated in malignancy induced by insertional mutagenesis, whereas lentiviral vectors have not. Furthermore, the infectivity of MLV vectors is limited to dividing cells, whereas lentiviral vectors can also transduce nondividing cells. One important characteristic of MLV vectors is a self-silencing property of the promoter element in pluripotent stem cells, allowing temporal transgene expression in a nonpluripotent state before iPSC derivation. Here we test iPSC generation using a novel chimeric vector carrying a mutant MLV promoter internal to a lentiviral vector backbone, thereby containing the useful properties of both types of vectors. Transgene expression of this chimeric vector was highly efficient compared with that of MLV vectors and was silenced specifically in human embryonic stem cells. Human fetal fibroblasts transduced with the vector encoding each factor were efficiently reprogrammed into a pluripotent state, and these iPSCs had potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types. To explore the possibility of iPSCs for gene therapy, we established iPSC clones expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), the main coreceptor for HIV-1. Using a reporter construct for CCR5 expression, we confirmed that CCR5 shRNA was expressed and specifically knocked down the reporter expression in iPSCs. These data indicate that our chimeric lentiviral vector is a valuable tool for generation of iPSCs and the combination with vectors encoding transgenes allows for rapid establishment of desired genetically engineered iPSC lines.",,"['Kamata, Masakazu', 'Liu, Shirley', 'Liang, Min', 'Nagaoka, Yoshiko', 'Chen, Irvin S Y']","['Kamata M', 'Liu S', 'Liang M', 'Nagaoka Y', 'Chen IS']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of California at Los Angeles, David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101006,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, CCR5)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*metabolism', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, CCR5/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes']",2010/06/08 06:00,2011/03/18 06:00,['2010/06/08 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2010.050 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2010 Nov;21(11):1555-67. doi: 10.1089/hum.2010.050.

We reviewed clinical and laboratory data of the patients who were diagnosed with non-severe aplastic anemia from 1997 to 2007 at Seoul National University Hospital and analyzed the clinical course and outcomes in these patients. We defined non-severe aplastic anemia as hypocellular marrow with cytopenia in the peripheral blood, which does not meet the criteria for severe aplastic anemia (at least two of the following: ANC < 500/microl, platelet < 20,000/microl or reticulocyte < 20,000/microl). Among a total of 96 patients, 53 (55.2%) were male and the median age was 37.6 years old. As much as 41.7% (40) of the patients were initially asymptomatic. Sixty-two patients who were treated with oxymetholone, ATG/ALG, cyclosporin or other agents after initial diagnosis showed significantly lower levels of initial hemoglobin, red blood cell count and platelet count than those who did not receive any treatment. During the follow-up period, 18 patients progressed to severe aplastic anemia. Their median age was 29.9 years and the median progression time was 18 months. Initial white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count in the evolution group tended to be lower than in the other group. The patients whose thrombocytopenia did not respond to treatment showed markedly higher frequency of progression to severe aplastic anemia. Treatment itself and responsiveness in reticulocyte and absolute neutrophil count were not correlated with their clinical courses. Sixteen patients showed overall improvement, whereas three patients developed secondary hematologic disease, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Non-severe aplastic anemia has a relatively indolent and mild clinical course. However, 18.8% of the study population progressed to severe disease. White blood cell and absolute neutrophil count at diagnosis and treatment responsiveness of thrombocytopenia were associated with disease progression.

The aim of this study is to describe a case of synchronous occurrence of neuroendocrine colon carcinoma and hairy cell leukemia. METHODS: A 69-year-old man presented with rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed a rectal tumor, whereas biopsy specimens revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma. During the preoperative evaluation, pancytopenia was detected. RESULTS: At laparotomy, a mass was detected 16 cm from the anal verge and an anterior resection of the rectum was performed. Detailed histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the rectum. Postoperative evaluation of pancytopenia revealed hairy cell leukemia. The patient was initially treated with chemotherapy for hairy cell leukemia followed by chemotherapy for neuroendocrine colon carcinoma. Survival was 44 months. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, synchronous occurrence of neuroendocrine colon carcinoma and hairy cell leukemia has not been previously reported in the literature. Given the rare incidence of both entities in the general population, it is highly unlikely that they occurred together by chance. Further research is needed to determine what would be the optimal management options of patients with simultaneous hairy cell leukemia and a neuroendocrine colon cancer.",,"['Salemis, Nikolaos S', 'Pinialidis, Dionisios', 'Tsiambas, Evangelos', 'Gakis, Christos', 'Nakos, Georgios', 'Sambaziotis, Dimitrios', 'Christofyllakis, Charalambos']","['Salemis NS', 'Pinialidis D', 'Tsiambas E', 'Gakis C', 'Nakos G', 'Sambaziotis D', 'Christofyllakis C']","['2nd Department of Surgery, Army General Hospital, Athens, Greece. nikos_salemis@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Gastrointest Cancer,Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,101479627,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Colonoscopy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Risk Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/05 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2010/06/05 06:00'],"['2010/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12029-010-9167-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gastrointest Cancer. 2011 Sep;42(3):131-6. doi: 10.1007/s12029-010-9167-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antitumor agents used in chemotherapy are aimed at inducing malignant cell death, thus limiting the growth and spreading of these cells. However, the lack of specificity for tumor cells exhibited by these agents causes undesirable side effects that have led to the investigation of new therapeutic strategies designed to specifically target malignant cells and thus trigger selective cell destruction. Dequalinium (DQA) is an antitumoral agent that selectively accumulates in the mitochondria and has been shown to display anticancer activity in cells from different malignancies. In the present study, the DQA-induced cytotoxicity in B-CLL cells was analyzed by measuring cell viability and cell death, either by necrosis or apoptosis. Our results support the importance of DQA as a selective and potential antileukemic drug with a higher cytotoxic effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from B-CLL patients than in those from healthy donors and encourage the performance of further studies in combination with other agents.",,"['Pajuelo, Lucia', 'Calvino, Eva', 'Diez, Jose Carlos', 'Boyano-Adanez, Maria Del Carmen', 'Gil, Juana', 'Sancho, Pilar']","['Pajuelo L', 'Calvino E', 'Diez JC', 'Boyano-Adanez Mdel C', 'Gil J', 'Sancho P']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100605,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'E7QC7V26B8 (Dequalinium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dequalinium/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Necrosis/chemically induced']",2010/06/05 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2010/06/05 06:00'],"['2010/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-010-9454-y [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2011 Dec;29(6):1156-63. doi: 10.1007/s10637-010-9454-y.

It presents almost complete bioavailability, is eliminated via P450-mediated metabolism and is well tolerated. However, a few severe drug-drug interactions have been reported in cancer patients taking acetaminophen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male ICR mice were given 100 mg/kg single dose of imatinib orally or imatinib 100 mg/kg (orally) coadministered with acetaminophen intraperitoneally (700 mg/kg). Mice were euthanized at predetermined time points, blood samples collected, and imatinib plasma concentration measured by HPLC. RESULTS: Imatinib AUC(0-12) was 27.04 +/- 0.38 mg.h/ml, C(max) was 7.21 +/- 0.99 mg/ml and elimination half-life was 2.3 hours. Acetaminophen affected the imatinib disposition profile: AUC(0-12) and C(max) decreased 56% and 59%, respectively and a longer half-life was observed (5.6 hours).

In addition, Nkx2.5 has an essential role in cardiomyogenesis. However, the expression of Nkx2.5 in the skin has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: In an attempt to screen the differentially regulated genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation, using a cDNA microarray, we identified Nkx2.5 as one of the transcription factors controlling the expression of proteins associated with keratinocyte differentiation. METHODS: To investigate the expression of Nkx2.5 during keratinocyte differentiation, we used a calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation model. RESULTS: RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of Nkx2.5, in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes, increased with calcium treatment in a time-dependent manner. In normal skin tissue, the expression of Nkx2.5 was detected in the nuclei of the keratinocytes in all layers of the epidermis except the basal layer by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the expression of Nkx2.5 was significantly increased in psoriasis and squamous cell carcinoma, but was barely detected in atopic dermatitis and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Nkx2.5 may play a role in the change from proliferation to differentiation of keratinocytes and in the pathogenesis of skin disease with aberrant keratinocyte differentiation.",,"['Hwang, Chul', 'Jang, Sunhyae', 'Choi, Dae Kyoung', 'Kim, Sujong', 'Lee, Joong Hwa', 'Lee, Young', 'Kim, Chang Deok', 'Lee, Jeung Hoon']","['Hwang C', 'Jang S', 'Choi DK', 'Kim S', 'Lee JH', 'Lee Y', 'Kim CD', 'Lee JH']","['Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091130,Korea (South),Ann Dermatol,Annals of dermatology,8916577,,,,2010/06/05 06:00,2010/06/05 06:01,['2010/06/05 06:00'],"['2009/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5021/ad.2009.21.4.376 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Dermatol. 2009 Nov;21(4):376-81. doi: 10.5021/ad.2009.21.4.376.

The causes may vary in different patients and in diverse areas of the world. There are no reports in the literature describing these etiologies in a developed country. Our review focused on children presenting with pancytopenia at a children's hospital in the United States with the purpose to allow us to better evaluate and care for children. PROCEDURE: Charts of children aged 2 months to 18 years who were admitted to our hospital over a 5-year period were retrospectively reviewed to identify the diagnosis of pancytopenia. The diagnosis of pancytopenia was confirmed by laboratory values showing neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. These etiologies and patient characteristics were reported in our review. RESULTS: A total of 64 children were identified with the diagnosis of pancytopenia. The most common diagnoses were infectious in origin (64%), followed by hematologic (28%), and miscellaneous (8%) etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: The most common etiology of pancytopenia in hospitalized children without cancer was infections.

METHODS: Survival and late toxicity were analyzed in 55 patients enrolled to receive 4 x adriamycin 60 mg/m(2), 4 x paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2), 4 x cyclophosphamide 800 mg/m(2), every 2 weeks, with cardioxane and filgrastim support. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze relapse-free survival (RFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS). Survival analyses were performed according to the presence of casting-type calcifications on the mammogram. RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 78.5 (64.3-100.0) months, 29 (52.7%) patients were free of relapse (local, regional, distant or contralateral breast cancer), 34 (61.8%) patients were free of distant metastases, and 36 patients (65.5%) survived. The median times of RFS, DDFS and OS were not yet reached at 100.0 months. The median RFS, DDFS and OS times among breast cancer patients with tumors not associated with casting-type calcifications were >100.0 months, the corresponding parameters among patients with tumors accompanied by casting calcifications were 11.5 (p < 0.001), 11.5 (p < 0.001) and 29.6 months (p = 0.035), respectively. None of the patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia. No cardiac failure occurred during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that adjuvant sequential ddATC is an efficient and less toxic chemotherapy regimen in high-risk breast cancer. The presence of casting-type calcifications on the mammogram points to a special biologic nature with very poor prognosis.","['Copyright 2010 S.

It was found that donepezil induced the apoptosis of HL-60 and U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as evidenced by the formation of DNA fragmentation and the accumulation of positive cells for Annexin V. In addition, the activations of caspase-8, -9, and -3 were significantly increased 36 h after donepezil treatment. Furthermore, the broad caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) blocked donepezil-induced apoptosis. In addition, donepezil was found to cause the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), to increase the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and to alter the expressions of Bcl-2 family proteins.

We studied effect of VEGFC on treatment outcome and investigated gene expression profiles associated with VEGFC using microarray data of 525 adult and 100 pediatric patients with AML. High VEGFC expression appeared strongly associated with reduced complete remission rate (P = .004), reduced overall and event-free survival (OS and EFS) in adult AML (P = .002 and P < .001, respectively). Multivariable analysis established high VEGFC as prognostic indicator independent of cytogenetic risk, FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, age, and white blood cell count (P = .038 for OS; P = .006 for EFS). Also, in pediatric AML high VEGFC was related to reduced OS (P = .041). A unique series of differentially expressed genes was identified that distinguished AML with high VEGFC from AML with low VEGFC, that is, 331 up-regulated genes (representative of proliferation, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor activity, signal transduction) and 44 down-regulated genes (eg, related to apoptosis) consistent with a role in enhanced chemoresistance.

Unlike CML, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lacks an aberrant fusion protein kinase but instead displays increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. To date, PI3K inhibitor development has been limited because of the requirement of this pathway for many essential cellular functions. Identification of the hematopoietic-selective isoform PI3K-delta unlocks a new therapeutic potential for B-cell malignancies. Herein, we demonstrate that PI3K has increased enzymatic activity and that PI3K-delta is expressed in CLL cells. A PI3K-delta selective inhibitor CAL-101 promoted apoptosis in primary CLL cells ex vivo in a dose- and time-dependent fashion that was independent of common prognostic markers. CAL-101-mediated cytotoxicity was caspase dependent and was not diminished by coculture on stromal cells. In addition, CAL-101 abrogated protection from spontaneous apoptosis induced by B cell-activating factors CD40L, TNF-alpha, and fibronectin. In contrast to malignant cells, CAL-101 does not promote apoptosis in normal T cells or natural killer cells, nor does it diminish antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, CAL-101 did decrease activated T-cell production of various inflammatory and antiapoptotic cytokines. Collectively, these studies provide rationale for the clinical development of CAL-101 as a first-in-class targeted therapy for CLL and related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.",,"['Herman, Sarah E M', 'Gordon, Amber L', 'Wagner, Amy J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Flynn, Joseph M', 'Jones, Jeffrey', 'Andritsos, Leslie', 'Puri, Kamal D', 'Lannutti, Brian J', 'Giese, Neill A', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Wei, Lai', 'Byrd, John C', 'Johnson, Amy J']","['Herman SE', 'Gordon AL', 'Wagner AJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Zhao W', 'Flynn JM', 'Jones J', 'Andritsos L', 'Puri KD', 'Lannutti BJ', 'Giese NA', 'Zhang X', 'Wei L', 'Byrd JC', 'Johnson AJ']","['Integrated Biomedical Science Graduate Program, TheOhio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100603,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/06/05 06:00,2010/10/28 06:00,['2010/06/05 06:00'],"['2010/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)32957-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-271171 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 23;116(12):2078-88. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-271171.

In response to gp130 receptor activation, Stat3 becomes phosphorylated by the receptor-associated Janus kinase, forms dimers, and enters the nucleus where it binds to Stat3 target genes and regulates their expression. In this report, we demonstrate that Stat3 binds directly to the promoters and regulates the expression of three genes that are essential for cardiac differentiation: Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and GATA4. We further demonstrate that Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and GATA4 expression is dependent on Stat3 in response to ligand treatment and during ligand-independent differentiation of P19CL6 cells into cardiomyocytes. Finally, we show that Stat3 is necessary for the differentiation of P19CL6 cells into beating cardiomyocytes.

METHODS: Children were audiotaped as they engaged in free play with their best friend and interactions were coded to assess their ability to maintain engagement with one another during play as well as the affective dimension of their play. RESULTS: Results indicated that dyads with survivors of childhood cancer were less likely to be highly engaged with their best friend and more likely to experience disengagement than dyads with healthy participants. There were no group differences in positive or negative affect. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data suggest that survivors of childhood cancer's relationships with their best friend may be compromised in some specific areas when compared to the relations of healthy children.

A statistically significant effect in favor of adjuvant chemotherapy was seen for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the subgroup of patients with tumors > or =4 cm. A laboratory companion study was conducted to see whether molecular and clinical factors could provide additional prognostic information. METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks were obtained for 250 of the 344 patients enrolled. Immunohistochemical staining for bcl-2, p53, blood group antigen A, and mucin was correlated with DFS and OS. RESULTS: The prevalence of the markers was bcl-2, 17%; p53, 47%; blood group antigen A, 25%; and mucin, 45%. Univariate analysis for DFS showed a statistically significant effect for the presence of mucin (p = 0.0005) and p53 (p = 0.05) and for OS showed a significant effect for mucin (p = 0.0005). In the multivariate Cox model, there was a statistically significant association between shorter DFS and presence of mucin (p = 0.002; hazard ratio [HR] 2.05) and p53 (p = 0.003; HR 1.95) and between shorter OS and presence of mucin (p = 0.004; HR 2.03) and p53 (p = 0.0005; HR 2.30). Of the clinical factors, male gender and larger tumor volume were also significant adverse prognostic factors (p 0.05).

Five-year age-specific rates, crude incidence rates (CR), world age-standardized rates (ASR), percent change (PC) and annual percent change (APC) were calculated using annual data on population size and its estimated age structure. A total of 6,975 incident cases of cancer were registered, with a male to-female sex ratio of 1.4:1. ASRs showed stable trends (-0.1% in males, and +1.0% in females). The leading cancer sites in rank were lung, breast, lymphoma, colon-rectum, bladder, prostate, leukemia, stomach and cervix uteri. For males, the incidence rates of lung, bladder and prostate cancers remained stable over time. While, cancers of colon-rectum showed a marked increase in incidence (APC: +4.8%; 95% CI: 1.2%, 8.4%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) showed a notable decline (APC: -4.4%; 95% CI: -8.2, -0.6).

The mechanism of this cytotoxicity is unknown. In order to gain insight into the mode of action of binaphthoquinones we performed a systematic high-throughput screen in a yeast isogenic deletion mutant array for enhanced or suppressed growth in the presence of binaphthoquinones. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exposure of wild type yeast strains to various BiQs demonstrated inhibition of yeast growth with IC(50)s in the microM range. Drug sensitivity and resistance screens were performed by exposing arrays of a haploid yeast deletion mutant library to BiQs at concentrations near their IC(50). Sensitivity screens identified yeast with deletions affecting mitochondrial function and cellular respiration as having increased sensitivity to BiQs. Corresponding to this, wild type yeast grown in the absence of a fermentable carbon source were particularly sensitive to BiQs, and treatment with BiQs was shown to disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential and lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, baseline ROS production in BiQ sensitive mutant strains was increased compared to wild type and could be further augmented by the presence of BiQ. Screens for resistance to BiQ action identified the mitochondrial external NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, NDE1, as critical to BiQ toxicity and over-expression of this gene resulted in increased ROS production and increased sensitivity of wild type yeast to BiQ. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In yeast, binaphthoquinone cytotoxicity is likely mediated through NAD(P)H:quonine oxidoreductases leading to ROS production and dysfunctional mitochondria. Further studies are required to validate this mechanism in mammalian cells.",,"['Emadi, Ashkan', 'Ross, Ashley E', 'Cowan, Kathleen M', 'Fortenberry, Yolanda M', 'Vuica-Ross, Milena']","['Emadi A', 'Ross AE', 'Cowan KM', 'Fortenberry YM', 'Vuica-Ross M']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100526,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)']",IM,"['Aerobiosis/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Fermentation/drug effects', '*Genetic Testing', 'Genome, Fungal/genetics', 'Isomerism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microbial Viability/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*cytology/*drug effects/enzymology/genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism']",2010/06/04 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/06/04 06:00'],"['2010/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0010846 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 May 26;5(5):e10846. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0010846.,,PMC2877097,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we provided evidence that fenofibrate, which is widely known as an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), can induce effective apoptosis in treating MCL cells. Addition of fenofibrate to MCL cell lines significantly decreased the number of viable cells by 50% at approximately 20 microM at 72 h. This decrease in cell growth was due to apoptosis, as evidenced by the cleavage of caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The fenofibrate-mediated effects were not significantly affected by GW6471, a specific PPARalpha antagonist. Using an apoptosis pathway-specific oligonucleotide array, we found that fenofibrate significantly downregulated several pro-survival genes, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Importantly, addition of recombinant TNF-alpha conferred partial protection against fenofibrate-induced apoptosis. Fenofibrate also decreased the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-p65 and significantly inhibited the DNA binding of NF-kappaB in a dose-dependent manner. To conclude, fenofibrate shows efficacy against MCL, and the mechanism can be attributed to its inhibitory effects on the TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling axis.

Gastric MALT lymphomas harboring such translocations usually do not respond to Helicobacter pylori eradication, while most of those without translocation can be cured by antibiotics. To understand the molecular mechanism of these different MALT lymphoma subgroups, we performed gene expression profiling analysis of 21 MALT lymphomas (13 translocation-positive, 8 translocation-negative). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the NF-kappaB target genes and 4394 additional gene sets covering various cellular pathways, biological processes and molecular functions have shown that translocation-positive MALT lymphomas are characterized by an enhanced expression of NF-kappaB target genes, particularly toll like receptor (TLR)6, chemokine, CC motif, receptor (CCR)2, cluster of differentiation (CD)69 and B-cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL)2, while translocation-negative cases were featured by active inflammatory and immune responses, such as interleukin-8, CD86, CD28 and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS). Separate analyses of the genes differentially expressed between translocation-positive and -negative cases and measurement of gene ontology term in these differentially expressed genes by hypergeometric test reinforced the above findings by GSEA. Finally, expression of TLR6, in the presence of TLR2, enhanced both API2-MALT1 and BCL10-mediated NF-kappaB activation in vitro.

Nilotinib and dasatinib, a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor also approved for second-line therapy in CML, have different patterns of kinase selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and cell uptake and efflux properties, and thus patients may respond to one following failure of the other. An international phase II study of nilotinib was conducted in CML patients (39 chronic phase (CP), 21 accelerated phase (AP)) after failure of both imatinib and dasatinib. Median times from diagnosis of CP or AP to nilotinib therapy were 89 and 83 months, respectively. Complete hematological response and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) rates in CP were 79% and 43%, respectively. Of 17 evaluable patients with CML-AP, 5 (29%) had a confirmed hematological response and 2 (12%) a MCyR. The median time to progression has not yet been reached in CP patients. At 18 months 59% of patients were progression-free. Median overall survival for both populations has not been reached, and the estimated 18-month survival rate in CML-CP was 86% and that at 12 months for CML-AP was 80%.

We hypothesized that presence of immunoglobin heavy chain (IgH) translocations leads to unbalanced production of light chains and more extreme abnormalities of FLC, and may explain the prognostic value of FLC. We studied 314 patients with newly diagnosed MM enrolled in a phase III trial, in whom results of fluorescence in situ hybridization testing and data on serum FLC levels were available. Cytogenetic analyses and FLC estimates were performed on stored samples and results were correlated with clinical data. The median ratio (FLC ratio) and the absolute difference (FLC diff) between the involved and uninvolved FLC were higher among those with IgH translocations, especially t(14;16). In multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of FLC estimates on progression-free and overall survival were independent of high-risk IgH translocations t(4;14) and t(14;16). A combination of the risk factors; either abnormal FLC estimate and/or the presence of high-risk IgH translocation, achieved better prognostic stratification. We conclude that patients with IgH translocations have higher FLC levels and abnormal ratios, but the prognostic effect of FLC is only partially explained by translocation status.

The molecular mechanisms leading from chronic phase (CP) to blast crisis (BC) are not understood. However, both the presence and the levels of BCR-ABL seem to be important for CML progression. BCR-ABL is under the transcriptional control of BCR promoter. Here we focused on the gene expression control of BCR and BCR-ABL upon myeloid differentiation in healthy donors (HDs), CP and BC patients. As previously reported, BCR-ABL is downregulated during myeloid maturation in CP patients. A similar pattern was detected for BCR (but not for ABL) in CP-CML and in HD, thus suggesting that the two genes may be under a similar transcriptional control. In BC this mechanism is similarly impaired for both BCR-ABL and BCR.

The binding site of proline and acidic amino acid-rich protein (PAR) transcription factors in the promoter of the LMO2 gene plays a central role in hematopoietic-specific expression. E2A-HLF fusion derived from t(17;19) in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has the transactivation domain of E2A and the basic region/leucine zipper domain of HLF, which is a PAR transcription factor, raising the possibility that E2A-HLF aberrantly induces LMO2 expression. We here demonstrate that cell lines and a primary sample of t(17;19)-ALL expressed LMO2 at significantly higher levels than other B-precursor ALLs did. Transfection of E2A-HLF into a non-t(17;19) B-precursor ALL cell line induced LMO2 gene expression that was dependent on the DNA-binding and transactivation activities of E2A-HLF.

It has also been shown in vitro that mutations outside the kinase domain in the neighboring linker, SH2, SH3, and Cap domains can confer imatinib resistance. In the context of ABL, these domains have an autoinhibitory effect on kinase activity, and mutations in this region can activate the enzyme. To determine the frequency and relevance to resistance of regulatory domain mutations in CML patients on imatinib, we screened for such mutations in a cohort of consecutive CML patients with various levels of response. Regulatory domain mutations were detected in 7 of 98 patients, whereas kinase domain mutations were detected in 29. One mutation (T212R) conferred in vitro tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance and was associated with relapse, whereas most other mutations did not affect drug sensitivity. Mechanistic studies showed that T212R increased the activity of ABL and BCR-ABL and that T212R-induced resistance may be partially the result of stabilization of an active kinase conformation.

They infect various cells and tissues in their natural host but are highly species specific. For instance, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) does not replicate in mouse cells, and human cells are not permissive for murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are so far poorly understood. In the present study we isolated and characterized a spontaneously occurring MCMV mutant that has gained the capacity to replicate rapidly and to high titers in human cells. Compared to the parental wild-type (wt) virus, this mutant formed larger nuclear replication compartments and replicated viral DNA more efficiently. It also disrupted promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein nuclear domains with greater efficiency but caused less apoptosis than did wt MCMV. Sequence analysis of the mutant virus genome revealed mutations in the M112/M113-coding region. This region is homologous to the HCMV UL112-113 region and encodes the viral early 1 (E1) proteins, which are known to play an important role in viral DNA replication. By introducing the M112/M113 mutations into wt MCMV, we demonstrated that they are sufficient to facilitate MCMV replication in human cells and are, at least in part, responsible for the efficient replication capability of the spontaneously adapted virus. However, additional mutations probably contribute as well.

This study demonstrates that transcription factor Yin Yang 1 binds to Moloney murine leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and avian sarcoma virus integrases. The results of coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro pulldown assays revealed that Yin Yang 1 interacted with the catalytic core and C-terminal domains of Moloney murine leukemia virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrases, while the transcriptional repression and DNA-binding domains of the Yin Yang 1 molecule interacted with Moloney murine leukemia virus integrase. Immunoprecipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction of virus-infected cells followed by Southern blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Yin Yang 1 associated with Moloney murine leukemia virus cDNA in virus-infected cells. Yin Yang 1 enhanced the in vitro integrase activity of Moloney murine leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and avian sarcoma virus integrases. Furthermore, knockdown of Yin Yang 1 in host cells by small interfering RNA reduced Moloney murine leukemia virus cDNA integration in vivo, although viral cDNA synthesis was increased, suggesting that Yin Yang 1 facilitates integration events in vivo.

Here we expand our characterization of LT effects on the DDR. Using comet assays, we demonstrate that LT induces overt DNA damage. The Fanconi anemia pathway, associated with replication stress, becomes activated, since FancD2 accumulates in foci, and monoubiquitinated FancD2 is detected on chromatin. LT also induces a distinct set of foci of the homologous recombination repair protein Rad51 that are colocalized with Nbs1 and PML. The FancD2 and Rad51 foci require neither Bub1 nor retinoblastoma protein binding. Strikingly, wild-type LT is localized on chromatin at, or near, the Rad51/PML foci, but the LT mutant in Bub1 binding is not localized there. SV40 infection was previously shown to trigger ATM activation, which facilitates viral replication. We demonstrate that productive infection also triggers ATR-dependent Chk1 activation and that Rad51 and FancD2 colocalize with LT in viral replication centers. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate that Rad51 and, to a lesser extent, FancD2 are required for efficient viral replication in vivo, suggesting that homologous recombination is important for high-level extrachromosomal replication. Taken together, the interplay of LT with the DDR is more complex than anticipated, with individual domains of LT being connected to different subcomponents of the DDR and repair machinery.",,"['Boichuk, Sergei', 'Hu, Liang', 'Hein, Jennifer', 'Gjoerup, Ole V']","['Boichuk S', 'Hu L', 'Hein J', 'Gjoerup OV']","['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100602,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Haplorhini', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Rad51 Recombinase/metabolism', 'Simian virus 40/*pathogenicity', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors/*physiology']",2010/06/04 06:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2010/06/04 06:00'],"['2010/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00334-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00334-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Aug;84(16):8007-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00334-10.

The inhibitors suppress differentiation and enable self-renewal of pluripotent cells that are ex vivo counterparts of naive epiblast cells in the mature blastocyst. Pluripotent stem cell lines can also be derived from unipotent primordial germ cells via a poorly understood process of epigenetic reprogramming. These are termed embryonic germ (EG) cells to denote their distinct origin. Here we investigate whether EG cell self-renewal and derivation are supported by 2i. We report that mouse EG cells can be established with high efficiency using 2i in combination with the cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Furthermore, addition of fibroblast growth factor or stem cell factor is unnecessary using 2i-LIF. The derived EG cells contribute extensively to healthy chimaeric mice, including to the germline. Using the same conditions, we describe the first derivations of EG cells from the rat. Rat EG cells express a similar marker profile to rat and mouse ES cells. They have a diploid karyotype, can be clonally expanded and genetically manipulated, and are competent for multilineage colonisation of chimaeras. These findings lend support to the postulate of a conserved molecular ground state in pluripotent rodent cells.

Such statistics require that a neighbourhood be defined around the location of interest. This is done by specifying weights for surrounding regions, and this is tantamount to specification of the scale at which the local dependence or clustering is tested. In practice, weights are usually assigned exogenously, with little thought given to their definition. Most common is the definition of binary adjacency - weights are set equal to one if the region is adjacent to the focal region and to zero otherwise. But this implies a spatial scale that may or may not be the best one to evaluate the variable under study - the actual scale of dependence or clustering is one that is smaller or larger. An alternative strategy is to try different sets of weights corresponding to different spatial scales. The purpose of this article is to provide statistical tests that allow for examination of several local statistics across multiple spatial scales, and yet avoid the need for simulation. Application of these tests leads to a choice of spatial scale through the weights, as well as an assessment of statistical significance.

These results show that the effect of ELF-EMF on biological systems depends on the status of the cell: while in cells not exposed to oxidative stress it is able to decrease the number of apoptotic cells by inducing an increase in hsp levels, it increases the number of apoptotic cells in oxidative stress-induced cells.",,"['Garip, Ayse Inhan', 'Akan, Z']","['Garip AI', 'Akan Z']",['Marmara University School of Medicine Department of Biophysics Istanbul Turkey. aysein9@yahoo.com'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Hungary,Acta Biol Hung,Acta biologica Hungarica,8404358,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Free Radicals', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxidative Stress', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",2010/06/04 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/06/04 06:00'],"['2010/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['R6076758457WW307 [pii]', '10.1556/ABiol.61.2010.2.4 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biol Hung. 2010 Jun;61(2):158-67. doi: 10.1556/ABiol.61.2010.2.4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, several up-to-date spot-segmentation techniques or software programs--proposed in the literature--are often characterized as ""automatic."" On the contrary, they are in effect not fully automatic since they require human intervention in order to specify mandatory input parameters or to correct their results. Human intervention, however, can inevitably modify the actual results of the cDNA microarray experiment and lead to erroneous biological conclusions. Therefore, the development of an automated spot-segmentation process becomes of exceptional interest. In this paper, an original and fully automatic approach to accurately segmenting the spots in a cDNA microarray image is presented. In order for the segmentation to be accomplished, each real spot of the cDNA microarray image is represented in a three-dimensional (3-D) space by a 3-D spot model. Each 3-D spot model is determined via an optimization problem, which is solved by using a genetic algorithm. The segmentation of real spots is conducted by drawing the contours of their 3-D spot models. The proposed method has been compared with various published and established techniques, using several synthetic and real cDNA microarray images that contain thousands of spots. The outcome has shown that the proposed method outperforms prevalent existing techniques. It is also noise resistant and yields excellent results even under adverse conditions such as the appearance of spots of various sizes and shapes.",,"['Zacharia, Eleni', 'Maroulis, Dimitris']","['Zacharia E', 'Maroulis D']","['Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, GR 15784 Panepistimiopolis, Ilisia, Greece. eezacharia@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100601,United States,IEEE Trans Nanobioscience,IEEE transactions on nanobioscience,101152869,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",2010/06/04 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/04 06:00'],"['2010/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1109/TNB.2010.2050900 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Nanobioscience. 2010 Sep;9(3):181-92. doi: 10.1109/TNB.2010.2050900.

In the study here, we analyzed HCV (as well as cytomegalovirus [CMV]) prevalence among Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP) accident sufferers--cleanup workers, local residents, NPP workers, and convalescent patients--who suffered acute radiation syndrome (ARS) as a result of the 1986 accident, and individuals who had not been exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). Serological analyses of antibodies against each pathogen (via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) revealed the highest HCV (i.e., 27.2%) and CMV (85.6%) prevalence in the convalescent hosts. Though the HCV prevalence (reflecting a current/past infection) among the cleanup workers (and other groups) was lower (i.e., 11-25%), viral presence was ""associated"" with a higher incidence of selected somatic diseases, for example, thyroiditis, goiter, hypertension, Type 1 diabetes, chronic hepatitis/gastritis, in the cleanup workers. A similar scenario with respect to CMV was also seen, i.e., lower prevalence rates [relative to in ARS patients] and ""association"" between CMV status and incidence of chronic gastritis, arthritis, and bronchitis, in the cleanup workers and IR-non-exposed controls. Further, irrespective of CMV status, there was a clear delineation between incidence rate(s) of each of the pathologies and whether or not the person was/was not exposed in 1986. We also investigated, due to a high incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) among Chernobyl sufferers, if there was homology between immunoglobulins (Igs) generated by these transformed cells and known antiviral and antimicrobial Igs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of Ig heavy-chain variable (IgHV) genes in cells from CLL patients who were/were not exposed in 1986 revealed a significant homology of some IgHV genes with Igs directed against infectious agents. However, no differences were found between the sequences from IR-exposed and IR-non-exposed CLL patients. Based on the findings here, we conclude that a past/ongoing presence of certain viral infections (i.e., CMV and/or HCV) in a host can modify (aggravate) the clinical course of certain somatic (i.e., non-tumor) diseases and promote malignancies (i.e., CLL), and that each of these outcomes could be modulated as a result of that host's past exposure to IR.",,"['Chumak, Anatolii A', 'Abramenko, Irina V', 'Bilous, Nadia I', 'Filonenko, Irina A', 'Kostin, Oleksii V', 'Pleskach, Oksana Y', 'Pleskach, Gleb V', 'Efremova, Nata', 'Yanko, Julia']","['Chumak AA', 'Abramenko IV', 'Bilous NI', 'Filonenko IA', 'Kostin OV', 'Pleskach OY', 'Pleskach GV', 'Efremova N', 'Yanko J']","['S.I.

The aim of this study is to display the pattern of HC by performing contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2006 and June 2008 HC was diagnosed in 12 patients (4 female, 8 male) by clinical and sonographic findings. The underlying diseases were acute leukemia (n = 10), aplastic anemia (n = 1), and testicular cancer (n = 1) in either the state of complete remission (n = 10) or relapse (n = 2). Due to neutropenic fever after chemotherapy all of the patients had received antifungal therapy. When HC was diagnosed all patients were afebrile and in a recovered hematological constitution. Additional diagnostic procedures were histological examination (n = 5), computed tomography (n = 8) and sonographic follow-up examinations (n = 12). All patients were examined with B-mode US and CEUS. RESULTS: In B-mode US the lesions were hypoechoic (n = 12), multiple (n = 10) and > 1 cm (n = 8) as well as > 2 cm (n = 4) in diameter. During CEUS no enhancement of contrast media in the centre of the lesions was seen in all cases during both phases. Additionally, in the arterial phase, the lesions showed no rim enhancement (n = 3) (type I), an isoechoic rim enhancement (n = 5) (type II), or a hyperechoic rim enhancement (n = 4) (type III).

It has been reported that berberine exerts its anti-inflammatory effect via suppressing nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) expression. Survivin and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) proteins may contribute to the causal relationship between anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic function. To investigate the mechanism of berberine-induced apoptotic activities, the human erythro-myeloblastoid leukemia cell line (K562 cell line) was treated with different concentrations of berberine (25-100 muM). The most significant cellular growth arrest and apoptotic effects were observed in the cells treated with 75 muM of berberine for 72 h. The results indicate that survivin and iNOS protein levels were decreased in berberine-treated cells. However, decrease in the iNOS activity did not affect the cell growth and apoptosis. Moreover, the addition of NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, to culture medium decreased the cell growth in the present cell line, but it seemed that its concentration was too low to induce apoptosis. So despite its production by iNOS in untreated cells, NO does not play a significant role in carcinogenesis in this cell line. These results indicate that the apoptotic activity of berberine may be mediated through the reduction of survivin in K562 cells, but iNOS level and its activity does not play a significant role in berberine-induced apoptosis.",,"['Pazhang, Yaghub', 'Ahmadian, Shahin', 'Mahmoudian, Massoud', 'Shafiezadeh, Mahshid']","['Pazhang Y', 'Ahmadian S', 'Mahmoudian M', 'Shafiezadeh M']","['Department of Biochemistry Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Enghelab Ave., P.O.

Ten days later, either APcK110 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was injected intraperitoneally every other day. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to calculate survival. RESULTS: We show that 1) all mice injected with OCI/AML3 cells developed a clinical and histological picture consistent with myelomonocytic AML; and 2) survival of APcK110-treated mice was significantly longer compared with mice injected with PBS (p = .02).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case series review was conducted of all children with cancer referred to the pediatric sleep clinic from 1994 to 2009 for evaluation of a sleep problem. Seventy children were seen and evaluated during this interval; all had a complete sleep history taken, and further objective sleep evaluations were performed as part of their evaluation only when clinically indicated. An overnight polysomnogram was performed in 53 children. In 36 children with a history of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), a multiple sleep latency study was performed the following day. Seven children had a 3-4-week actigraphic study. RESULTS: Children with neoplasms of central nervous system (CNS) involving the hypothalamus, thalamus, and brainstem were the most commonly referred children and had the most frequent and severe sleep problems. Excessive daytime sleepiness was the most common sleep problem, seen in 60% of children with cancer and in 80% of children with CNS neoplasms involving the hypothalamus, thalamus, and brainstem. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) was present in 40% of the entire group of children with cancer and 46% of children with neoplasms involving the hypothalamus, thalamus, and brainstem. Children with CNS neoplasms often had more than one sleep problem, most commonly EDS and SDB. In these children, correction of the SDB often did not eliminate the EDS. In children with leukemia, insomnia was the most common sleep problem identified, present in 39%. The causes of the sleep problems were varied and included neurologic injury caused by the neoplasm and/or the CNS-directed treatments; seizures, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, medication side effects, obesity, pain, anxiety, and drug abuse. Some of the sleep problems were present before the diagnosis of cancer, though most developed after treatment was begun. A wide range of intervention strategies were utilized to address the sleep problems and included sleep hygiene/sleep restriction, behavioral counseling, continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure, tracheotomy with and without a ventilator, diaphragmatic pacers, sedative hypnotics, stimulants, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. When the sleep problems and their causes were correctly identified and treatments were directed to the specific cause of the problem, the treatments were generally successful. CONCLUSIONS: The sleep problems of children with cancer span the full spectrum of clinical sleep disorders (hypersomnia, sleep disordered breathing, insomnia, parasomnias, and circadian rhythm disorders) and are often present in combinations. Children with neoplasms involving the brainstem, thalamus, and hypothalamus were the most frequently referred for a sleep evaluation, and their sleep problems were most commonly EDS or SDB.

At present, studies have detected XMRV at widely different rates in prostate cancer cases (0-27%) and in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; 0-67%). Indirect or direct modes of carcinogenesis by XMRV have been suggested depending on whether the virus was found in stroma or malignant epithelium. Viral replication in the prostate might be affected by androgens, which stimulate XMRV through a transcriptional enhancer site in viral DNA. By contrast, host restriction factors, such as APOBEC3 and tetherin, inhibit virus replication. Immune dysfunction mediated by XMRV has been suggested as a possible factor in CFS. Recent studies show that some existing antiretroviral drugs suppress XMRV infections and diagnostic assays are under development. Although other retroviruses of the same genus as XMRV (gammaretroviruses) cause cancer and neurological disease in animals, whether XMRV is a cause of either prostate cancer or CFS remains unknown.

Here we identify HIV-1 Rev-binding protein (Hrb), a component of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery, as a critical mediator of Notch-induced T-ALL development in mice. Hrb was found to be a direct transcriptional target of Notch1, and Hrb loss reduced the incidence or delayed the onset of T-ALL in mouse models in which activated Notch1 signaling either contributes to or drives leukemogenesis. Consistent with this observation, Hrb supported survival and proliferation of hematopoietic and T cell precursor cells in vitro. We demonstrated that Hrb accelerated the uptake of transferrin, which was required for upregulation of the T cell protooncogene p21. Indeed, iron-deficient mice developed Notch1-induced T-ALL substantially more slowly than control mice, further supporting a critical role for iron uptake during leukemogenesis. Taken together, these results reveal that Hrb is a critical Notch target gene that mediates lymphoblast transformation and disease progression via its ability to satisfy the enhanced demands of transformed lymphoblasts for iron. Further, our data suggest that Hrb may be targeted to improve current treatment or design novel therapies for human T-ALL patients.",,"['Khwaja, Shariq S', 'Liu, Hudan', 'Tong, Caili', 'Jin, Fang', 'Pear, Warren S', 'van Deursen, Jan', 'Bram, Richard J']","['Khwaja SS', 'Liu H', 'Tong C', 'Jin F', 'Pear WS', 'van Deursen J', 'Bram RJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Clathrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells/metabolism', 'Clathrin/genetics/metabolism', 'Endocytosis/genetics', 'HIV-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2010/06/03 06:00,2010/07/28 06:00,['2010/06/03 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['41277 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI41277 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2010 Jul;120(7):2537-48. doi: 10.1172/JCI41277.,"['T32 DK007780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK07780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2898592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment consisted of rituximab at 375 mg/m(2) administered intravenously on day 1; concomitant therapy consisted of rasburicase, intrathecally (IT) triple drug (methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisolone) on days 1 and 3 for CNS-positive patients and steroids only for anaphylaxis. Response criterion was the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters of one to three lesions and/or the percentage of blasts in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) within 24 hours before rituximab and on day 5. Responders had > or = 25% decrease of at least one lesion or BM or PB blasts and no disease progress at other sites. Response rate (RR) was set at 45% for unfavorable activity or at 65% for favorable activity. RESULTS: From April 2004 to August 2008, 136 patients were enrolled. National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 3/4 toxicities attributable to rituximab were general condition, 15%; fatigue, 13%; anaphylaxis, 7%; infection, 3%; glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, 8%; no capillary leakage; and no toxic death. Forty-nine patients were not evaluable for response because of withdrawal from the study (n = 16), IT therapy in CNS-negative patients (n = 8), corticosteroid treatment (n = 3), technical inadequacy of response evaluation (n = 21), or no evaluable lesion (n = 1). Of 87 evaluable patients, 36 were responders (RR, 41.4%; 95% CI, 31% to 52%); among them, 27 of 67 with Burkitt lymphoma and seven of 15 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A response was more frequently observed in BM (12 of 18) compared with solid tumor lesions (36 of 108; P = .007). CONCLUSION: Rituximab is active as a single-agent in pediatric B-NHL even though the RR was lower than requested in the phase II plan.",,"['Meinhardt, Andrea', 'Burkhardt, Birgit', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Kontny, Udo', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Berthold, Frank', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta', 'Klein, Christoph', 'Kabickova, Edita', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Reiter, Alfred']","['Meinhardt A', 'Burkhardt B', 'Zimmermann M', 'Borkhardt A', 'Kontny U', 'Klingebiel T', 'Berthold F', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Klein C', 'Kabickova E', 'Klapper W', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Schrappe M', 'Reiter A']","[""Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Center, Justus Liebig University Giessen, Giessen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100601,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/03 06:00,2010/08/12 06:00,['2010/06/03 06:00'],"['2010/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.26.6791 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.26.6791 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jul 1;28(19):3115-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.26.6791.

We examined relationships between preferences and chemotherapy use. METHODS: Older women (n = 934) diagnosed with invasive (> or = 1 cm), nonmetastatic breast cancer from 2004 to 2008 were recruited from 53 cooperative group sites. Data were collected from patient interviews (87% complete), physician survey (93% complete), and charts. Logistic regression and multiple imputation methods were used to assess associations between chemotherapy and independent variables. Chemotherapy use was also evaluated according to the following two groups: indicated (estrogen receptor [ER] negative and/or node positive) and possibly indicated (ER positive and node negative). RESULTS: Mean patient age was 73 years (range, 65 to 100 years). Unadjusted chemotherapy rates were 69% in the indicated group and 16% in the possibly indicated group. Women who would choose chemotherapy for an increase in survival of < or = 12 months had 3.9 times (95% CI, 2.4 to 6.3 times; P < .001) higher odds of receiving chemotherapy than women with lower preferences, controlling for covariates. Stronger preferences were seen when chemotherapy could be indicated (odds ratio [OR] = 7.7; 95% CI, 3.8 to 16; P < .001) than when treatment might be possibly indicated (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.8; P = .06). Higher patient rating of provider communication was also related to chemotherapy use in the possibly indicated group (OR = 1.9 per 5-point increase in communication score; 95% CI, 1.4 to 2.8; P < .001) but not in the indicated group (P = .15).

To understand the regulatory hierarchies within which Gfi1 operates to control these diverse biological functions, we used a combination of comparative genomics, locus-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, functional validation in cell lines, and extensive transgenic mouse assays to identify and characterize the complete ensemble of Gfi1 regulatory elements. This concerted effort identified five distinct regulatory elements spread over 100kb each driving expression in transgenic mice to a subdomain of endogenous Gfi1. Detailed characterization of an enhancer 35 kb upstream of Gfi1 demonstrated activity in the dorsal aorta region and fetal liver in transgenic mice, which was bound by key stem cell transcription factors Scl/Tal1, PU.1/Sfpi1, Runx1, Erg, Meis1, and Gata2.

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the genes encoding the TAL1/SCL and LMO1/2 transcription factors are recurring targets of chromosomal translocations, whereas NOTCH1 is activated in >50% of samples. Here we show that the SCL and LMO1 oncogenes collaborate to expand primitive thymocyte progenitors and inhibit later stages of differentiation. Together with pre-T-cell antigen receptor (pre-TCR) signaling, these oncogenes provide a favorable context for the acquisition of activating Notch1 mutations and the emergence of self-renewing leukemia-initiating cells in T-ALL. All tumor cells harness identical and specific Notch1 mutations and Tcrbeta clonal signature, indicative of clonal dominance and concurring with the observation that Notch1 gain of function confers a selective advantage to SCL-LMO1 transgenic thymocytes. Accordingly, a hyperactive Notch1 allele accelerates leukemia onset induced by SCL-LMO1 and bypasses the requirement for pre-TCR signaling. Finally, the time to leukemia induced by the three transgenes corresponds to the time required for clonal expansion from a single leukemic stem cell, suggesting that SCL, LMO1, and Notch1 gain of function, together with an active pre-TCR, might represent the minimum set of complementing events for the transformation of susceptible thymocytes.",,"['Tremblay, Mathieu', 'Tremblay, Cedric S', 'Herblot, Sabine', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Perreault, Claude', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Tremblay M', 'Tremblay CS', 'Herblot S', 'Aplan PD', 'Hebert J', 'Perreault C', 'Hoang T']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3C3J7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/physiology', '*Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', '*Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2010/06/03 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/06/03 06:00'],"['2010/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['24/11/1093 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1897910 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2010 Jun 1;24(11):1093-105. doi: 10.1101/gad.1897910.,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC2878648,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show its critical role in cancer maintenance and thus offer a new anticancer target. Taspase1 is overexpressed in primary human cancers, and deficiency of Taspase1 in cancer cells not only disrupts proliferation but also enhances apoptosis. Mechanistically, loss of Taspase1 induces the levels of CDK inhibitors (CDKI: p16, p21, and p27) and reduces the level of antiapoptotic MCL-1. Therapeutically, deficiency of Taspase1 synergizes with chemotherapeutic agents and ABT-737, an inhibitor of BCL-2/BCL-X(L), to kill cancer cells. Taspase1 alone or in conjunction with MYC, RAS, or E1A fails to transform NIH/3T3 cells or primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, respectively, but plays critical roles in cancer initiation and maintenance. Therefore, Taspase1 is better classified as a ""non-oncogene addiction"" protease, the inhibition of which may offer a novel anticancer therapeutic strategy. The reliance of oncogenes on subordinate non-oncogenes during tumorigenesis underscores the non-oncogene addiction hypothesis in which a large class of non-oncogenes functions to maintain cancer phenotypes and presents attractive anticancer therapeutic targets. The emergence of successful cancer therapeutics targeting non-oncogenes to which cancers are addicted supports the future development and potential application of small-molecule Taspase1 inhibitors for cancer therapy.",['Copyright 2010 AACR.'],"['Chen, David Y', 'Liu, Han', 'Takeda, Shugaku', 'Tu, Ho-Chou', 'Sasagawa, Satoru', 'Van Tine, Brian A', 'Lu, Dongsi', 'Cheng, Emily H-Y', 'Hsieh, James J-D']","['Chen DY', 'Liu H', 'Takeda S', 'Tu HC', 'Sasagawa S', 'Van Tine BA', 'Lu D', 'Cheng EH', 'Hsieh JJ']","['Departments of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100601,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endopeptidases/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, myc', 'Genes, ras', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2010/06/03 06:00,2010/08/10 06:00,['2010/06/03 06:00'],"['2010/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-0027 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0027 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Jul 1;70(13):5358-67. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0027.

Toxin-mediated activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response was shown to be instrumental in initiating apoptosis in THP-1 myeloid leukemia cells. THP-1 cells responded to Shiga toxin type 1 (Stx1) in a cell maturation-dependent manner, undergoing rapid apoptosis in the undifferentiated state but reduced and delayed apoptosis in differentiated cells. The onset of apoptosis was associated with calpain activation and changes in expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Bcl-2 family members, and death receptor 5 (DR5). Ligation of DR5 by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) activates the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. We show here that expression of TRAIL and DR5 is increased by Stx1 treatment. Addition of exogenous TRAIL enhances, and anti-TRAIL antibodies inhibit, Stx1-induced apoptosis of THP-1 cells. Silencing of CHOP or DR5 expression selectively prevented caspase activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and Stx1-induced apoptosis of macrophage-like THP-1 cells. In contrast, the rapid kinetics of apoptosis induction in monocytic THP-1 cells correlated with rates of calpain cleavage. The results suggest that CHOP-DR5 signaling and calpain activation differentially contribute to cell maturation-dependent Stx1-induced apoptosis.

Negative prognostic associations are found primarily in solid tumors such as ovarian carcinoma, while positive associations have been reported in various lymphomas, most prominently in those of germinal center (GC) B cell derivation. Most of these observations are correlative, however, as mechanistic studies have lagged behind descriptive observations because of a lack of informative animal models.

However, the cumulative cardiotoxicity limits its wide application in chemotherapy. METHOD: To provide an alternative strategy for reducing the cardiotoxicity, a novel THP liposome powder (L-THP), comprising distearoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylglycerol, cholesterol, and lactose was appropriately prepared based on the physicochemical properties of THP. And L-THP was characterized and evaluated. Comparative studies on pharmacokinetic and biodistribution behaviors between L-THP and commercialized THP injection were performed in normal mice through intravenous administration. RESULTS: When L-THP was reconstituted in a proper amount of normal saline for injection, it had a mean diameter of around 220.0 nm, a zeta potential of about -33.0 mV, and a high THP entrapment efficiency of more than 93.1%. Pharmacokinetics study showed that heart accumulation of THP could be reduced by 81.2% for L-THP.

We report four major findings here: i) both Cu(I) and Cu(II) could inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20S proteasome, but Cu(I) was more potent than Cu(II), ii) purified 20S proteasome protein was able to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), suggesting that Cu(I) is the oxidation status of copper that directly reacts with the proteasome, iii) when complexed with the copper ligand neocuproine, Cu(I) showed higher ability to induce ROS production in cancer cells, compared with Cu(II), iv) addition of a ROS scavenger in the cancer cell culture-blocked copper-induced ROS generation, but did not overcome copper-mediated proteasome-inhibitory and cell death-inducing events, demonstrating the ROS-independent proteasome-inhibitory property of copper complexes.",,"['Xiao, Yan', 'Chen, D I', 'Zhang, Xia', 'Cui, Qiuzhi', 'Fan, Yuhua', 'Bi, Caifeng', 'Dou, Q Ping']","['Xiao Y', 'Chen DI', 'Zhang X', 'Cui Q', 'Fan Y', 'Bi C', 'Dou QP']","['The Prevention Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, and Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Chemistry Engineering and Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Ocean University of China.', 'Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao 266101, P.R.

ZEB1 binds phosphorylated Smad2/3 to enhance transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) signaling. In addition to downregulation of ZEB1 mRNA, we found overexpression of inhibitory Smad, Smad7, in resistance of ATLL cells to growth suppression by TGF-beta1. A protein complex of Smad7 and histone deacetylase constantly bound to the promoter region of TGF-beta1 responsive genes with the Smad-responsive element (SRE) to inhibit TGF-beta1 signaling; however, ectopic expression of ZEB1 reactivated TGF-beta1 signaling by binding to Smad7 and recruiting the Smad3/p300 histone acetyltransferase complex to the promoter after TGF-beta1 stimulation in ATLL. Conversely, because ZEB1 mRNA was detected in the late stages of T-cell development, we used CTLL2 cells with ZEB1 expression, a murine peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and found that a complex of Smad3, Smad7 and ZEB1 was bound to the SRE of the p21(CDKN1A) promoter after the induction of Smad7 by TGF-beta1 treatment. Because the duration of TGF-beta1-induced transcriptional activation of PAI-1 and p21 was shortened in shZEB1-expressing CTLL2 cells, ZEB1 may have a role in enhancing TGF-beta1 signaling by binding not only to Smad3 but also to Smad7 in the nucleus. Altogether, these results suggest that both ZEB1 downregulation and Smad7 overexpression contribute to resistance to TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression in ATLL.",,"['Nakahata, S', 'Yamazaki, S', 'Nakauchi, H', 'Morishita, K']","['Nakahata S', 'Yamazaki S', 'Nakauchi H', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100531,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SMAD3 protein, human)', '0 (SMAD7 protein, human)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Smad7 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (ZEB1 protein, human)', '0 (Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad3 Protein/physiology', 'Smad7 Protein/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*metabolism', 'Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1']",2010/06/02 06:00,2010/08/28 06:00,['2010/06/02 06:00'],"['2010/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010172 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Jul 22;29(29):4157-69. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.172.

Tryptase has been known to be a key mediator in mast cell-mediated inflammatory reactions. In the present study, we investigated whether the transcription of tryptase gene in human mast cells was induced by microphthalmia (mi)-associated transcription factor (MITF). We observed that the human CD34+ progenitor-derived cultured mast cells and human mast cell line HMC-1 expressed strongly the transcripts of tryptase-beta1 and MITF-A, which is a MITF alterative splicing isoform. The transcriptional activity of tryptase gene was specifically higher in HMC-1 cells compared to the tryptase-negative cells. Using mutant constructs of tryptase promoter, we observed that two E-box (CANNTG) motifs including between -817 to -715 and -421 to -202 are able to involve in the transactivation of tryptase gene by MITF-A. In addition, the binding of these motifs-containing oligonucleotides to MITF proteins was detectable by EMGA using the nuclear extracts of HMC-1 cells and anti-MITF mAb. The overexpression of MITF-A elevated tryptase production by HMC-1 cells, while the introduction of specific siRNA against MITF attenuated the expression and enzymatic activity of tryptase.

The results were combined with previously published data sets, allowing us to ascertain genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 164 cases. In total, 45 recurrent CNAs were identified with an average number of 3.5 recurrent changes per case (range 0-13). Twenty-six percent of cases displayed a set of recurrent CNAs identical to that of other cases in the data set. The majority (74%), however, displayed a unique pattern of recurrent CNAs, indicating a large heterogeneity within this ALL subtype. As previously demonstrated, alterations targeting genes involved in B-cell development were common (present in 28% of cases). However, the combined analysis also identified alterations affecting nuclear hormone response (24%) to be a characteristic feature of ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL. Studying the correlation pattern of the CNAs allowed us to highlight significant positive and negative correlations between specific aberrations. Furthermore, oncogenetic tree models identified ETV6, CDKN2A/B, PAX5, del(6q) and +16 as possible early events in the leukemogenic process.",,"['Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Soneson, Charlotte', 'Andersson, Anna', 'Heldrup, Jesper', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Mitelman, Felix', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Fontes, Magnus', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Lilljebjorn H', 'Soneson C', 'Andersson A', 'Heldrup J', 'Behrendtz M', 'Kawamata N', 'Ogawa S', 'Koeffler HP', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B', 'Fontes M', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. henrik.lilljebjorn@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100531,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', '*Gene Dosage', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/classification/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2010/06/02 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/06/02 06:00'],"['2010/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ddq224 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddq224 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2010 Aug 15;19(16):3150-8. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddq224.

Identification of specific chromosome abnormalities led to the recognition of genetic subgroups based on modal chromosomal number, reciprocal translocations in B-cell ALL, or both. We report here the cytogenetic analysis of 208 patients with pre-B and B-cell ALL referred to a single laboratory between 1981 and 2008. Chromosome abnormalities were observed in 82.9% of L1/L2 ALL patients and in 83.3% of L3 patients with successful analysis at diagnosis. The proportion of diploid karyotypes tended to decrease during the period of study, from 26% to 13%, in association with technical progress and the introduction of FISH techniques. As previously reported, the incidence of high hyperdiploidy (51-67 chromosomes) was higher among children, whereas pseudodiploidy and hypodiploidy were higher among those >15 years of age. Structural chromosome abnormalities were more frequently observed among patients older than 15 years than in children (75.9% vs. 68.5%, respectively). As previously reported, t(9;22)(q34;q11) and t(12;21)(p13;q21) were the most frequent structural rearrangements among adults (26.9%) and children (19.7%), respectively. Almost 17% of the patients studied at diagnosis had further cytogenetic analyses at relapse, the majority showing clonal evolution toward a more complex karyotype. Although the detection of chromosome abnormalities by conventional cytogenetics and FISH techniques is an important tool in assessing risk stratification of ALL, some patients lack abnormalities with clinical relevance. The use of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) offers an alternative for identifying copy number alterations, but cannot detect balanced chromosomal rearrangements.",['2010 Elsevier Inc.

Immunocompromised children are at heightened risk for invasive aspergillosis. Children at highest risk include those with new-onset or relapsed hematologic malignancy and recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplants. Additional risk factors in stem cell transplant recipients include impaired lymphocyte engraftment and graft-versus-host disease. Pediatric invasive aspergillosis is associated with a high mortality rate (generally >50%) and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent dissemination and death. Tools available for diagnosis include radiologic examinations (primarily computed tomography), the galactomannan assay, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tissue biopsy. Age-related differences in computed tomography and galactomannan assay results have been suggested. Recommended primary therapy for pediatric invasive aspergillosis is voriconazole (7 mg/kg IV q12 hours). Currently approved alternative therapies include liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B lipid complex, and caspofungin.

A minority of acute leukemias however, show no clear evidence of differentiation along a single lineage. These are now classified under acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage by the most recent WHO classification and account for <4% of all cases of acute leukemia [1]. They include leukemias with no lineage specific antigens (acute undifferentiated leukemias) and those with blasts that express antigens of more than one lineage to such degree that it is not possible to assign the leukemia to any one particular lineage with certainty (mixed phenotype acute leukemias). The latter can either be leukemias with two distinct populations of blasts, each expressing antigens of a different lineage (historically referred to as ""bilineal"" leukemias) or a single blast population expressing antigens of multiple lineages (historically referred to as ""biphenotypic"" acute leukemias) [2]. Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage may harbor a variety of genetic lesions. Those with t(9;22)(q34;q11) or translocations associated with mixed lineage leukemias (MLL) gene, i.e., t(11;V)(q23;V), occur frequently enough and are associated with distinct features, that are considered as separate entities according to the recent WHO classification. Co-expression of myeloid and B-lymphoid antigens is most common in mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), followed by co-expression of myeloid and T-lymphoid antigens, accounting for 66-70% and 23-24% of MLLs, respectively. Coexpression of B- and T-lineage associated antigens or antigens of all three lineages is exceedingly rare, accounting for <5% of MLLs [3,4].

In addition, we also analyzed two other frequent mutations (FLT3/ITD and NPM1) in these patients and correlated them with C/EBPA gene alterations. 13/53 patients were FLT3/ITD+/NPM1-, 11/53 patients were FLT3/ITD+/NPM1+, 9/53 patients were FLT3/ITD-/NPM1+, and 20/53 patients were FLT3/ITD-/NPM1-. Four of 53 cases displayed C/EBPA mutations, whereas 49 cases had only C/EBPA wild-type alleles. Of the four positive cases, three patients had N-terminal mutations only, whereas one patient had mutations in both the N- and C-terminal region. Two of the four positive cases also harbored both FLT3/ITD and NPM1 mutation simultaneously, whereas the other two patients had neither FLT3/ITD nor NPM1 mutations. Furthermore, 7/53 cases displayed C/EBPA promoter hypermethylation. Interestingly, they were all in CN-AML cases without FLT3/ITD or NPM1 mutations. None of the seven patients with C/EBPA promoter hypermethylation showed C/EBPA mutation. In conclusion, C/EBPA mutation and promoter hypermethylation can be detected at a relatively low frequency in de novo CN-AML patients, suggesting they may contribute to leukemogenesis.

Still, this information is not used for classification of B-cell lymphomas (BCLs). Traditionally, BCLs are diagnosed based on a phenotypic resemblance to normal B-cells; assessed by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry, by using a handful of phenotypic markers. In the last decade, diagnostic and prognostic evaluation has been facilitated by global gene expression profiling (GEP), providing a new powerful means for the classification, prediction of survival, and response to treatment of lymphomas. However, most GEP studies have typically been performed on whole tissue samples, containing varying degrees of tumor cell content, which results in uncertainties in data analysis. In this study, global GEP analyses were performed on highly purified, flow-cytometry sorted tumor-cells from eight subgroups of BCLs. This enabled identification of TFs that can be uniquely associated to the tumor cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The identified transcription factors influence both the global and specific gene expression of the BCLs and have possible implications for diagnosis and treatment.","['2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Andreasson, Ulrika', 'Eden, Patrik', 'Peterson, Carsten', 'Hogerkorp, Carl-Magnus', 'Jerkeman, Mats', 'Andersen, Niels', 'Berglund, Mattias', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Borrebaeck, Carl A K', 'Ek, Sara']","['Andreasson U', 'Eden P', 'Peterson C', 'Hogerkorp CM', 'Jerkeman M', 'Andersen N', 'Berglund M', 'Sundstrom C', 'Rosenquist R', 'Borrebaeck CA', 'Ek S']","['Department of Immunotechnology, Lund University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2010/06/01 06:00,2010/06/22 06:00,['2010/06/01 06:00'],"['2010/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21701 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2010 Jun;85(6):418-25. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21701.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with pp65 antigenemia received pre-emptive anti-CMV treatment. Fifty-nine patients achieved complete remission. Baseline CMV serology results were available for 56 of the 59 patients: 52 patients (93%) were IgG positive. The overall incidence of pp65 antigenemia in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy was 35% (21/59): 9 patients after induction and 12 post-consolidation. Sixteen of the 21 pp65-positive patients received anti-CMV treatment: 15 as pre-emptive therapy and 1 for interstitial CMV pneumonitis. Five patients received no anti-CMV treatment and did not develop CMV disease.

However, resistance to this drug is common, making successful treatment more difficult. Previously, we introduced a novel phytosphingosine derivative, N,N-dimethyl phytosphingosine (DMPS), as a potent anticancer therapeutic agent in human leukemia cells. This study was performed to investigate whether DMPS can sensitize HL-60/MX2, a multidrug-resistant variant of HL-60, to Dox-induced apoptosis. Low concentrations of DMPS sensitized HL-60/MX2 cells to Dox-induced apoptosis. Combined Dox + DMPS treatment-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 as well as PARP cleavage. Cytochrome c and AIF release were also observed in Dox + DMPS-treated HL60/MX2 cells. Pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk markedly prevented caspase-3 activation and moderately suppressed apoptosis, suggesting that Dox + DMPS-induced apoptosis is somewhat (not completely) dependent on caspase. Cytochrome c and AIF release were not affected by pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk. The ROS scavenger NAC efficiently suppressed not only ROS generation, but also caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavage, apoptosis, and release of cytochrome c and AIF, indicating a role of ROS in combined Dox + DMPS treatment-induced apoptotic death signaling.

As the mechanism of its proapoptotic effects on human myeloid leukemia cells has not been extensively studied, we performed an in-depth evaluation of the effects of Tan I on apoptosis in human K562 and HL-60 cells. The results revealed that Tan I could inhibit the growth of leukemia cells and cause apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis was observed clearly by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining, as well as DNA fragmentation analysis. After treatment by Tan I for 48 h, the percentage of disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis demonstrated the cleavage of caspase-3 zymogen protein and a dose-dependent cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Tan I-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a significant decrease in survivin and an increase in Bax. Moreover, Tan I treatment remarkably downregulated the phosphorylation of both P85/PI3K and Akt in a time-dependent manner, and the PI3K/AKT-specific inhibitor (LY294002) mimicked the apoptosis-inducing effects of Tan I. We therefore conclude that the induction of apoptosis by Tan I in these leukemia cells is mainly related to the disruption of Deltapsim, the upregulation of Bax expression, and the activation of caspase-3. This process is highly correlated with the inactivation of PI3K/Akt/survivin signaling pathways. The results indicate that Tan I may serve as an effective adjunctive reagent in the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Liu, Jia-Jun', 'Liu, Wen-Da', 'Yang, Hong-Zhi', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Fang, Zhi-Gang', 'Liu, Pei-Qing', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Xiao, Ruo-Zhi', 'Hu, Yuan', 'Wang, Chun-Zhi', 'Li, Xu-Dong', 'He, Yi', 'Huang, Ren-Wei']","['Liu JJ', 'Liu WD', 'Yang HZ', 'Zhang Y', 'Fang ZG', 'Liu PQ', 'Lin DJ', 'Xiao RZ', 'Hu Y', 'Wang CZ', 'Li XD', 'He Y', 'Huang RW']","[""Hematological Department and Institute, Third Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. jiajunliu2002@yahoo.com.cn""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100530,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Abietanes', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phenanthrenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2010/06/01 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/06/01 06:00'],"['2009/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-0996-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Nov;89(11):1089-97. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-0996-z.

We examined the relationship of socioeconomic position with childhood cancer mortality in South Korea. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of South Koreans was conducted using data from the national birth register collected between 1995 and 2006, which was individually linked to mortality data. A cohort of 6,479,406 children was followed from birth until their death or through December 31, 2006. Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the rate ratios of childhood cancer death according to socioeconomic position. RESULTS: A total of 1,469 cancer deaths were observed during the study period. We found significantly increased cancer mortality to be associated with the educational level of mother (RR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.27-1.91) and father (RR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.15-1.70) in middle school graduate or below compared with those of college graduate or higher. The risks of cancer death increased among children born with fathers outside the workforce (RR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.69) and with mothers engaged in manual work (RR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.03-1.92), when compared with those of non-manual counterparts.

The aim of this study was to determine which of the available markers independently predicted outcome in patients requiring treatment and to use these to define new risk groups. DESIGN AND METHODS: A broad panel of clinical and laboratory markers, measured at randomization in patients entering the LRF CLL4 trial, was assessed with respect to treatment response, progression-free and overall survival, at a median follow-up of 68 months. RESULTS: Using the factors identified as independent predictors for progression-free survival, patients were subdivided into three risk groups: 6% had poor risk with known TP53 loss of greater than 10%; 72% had an intermediate risk without TP53 loss (</= 10%) and with at least one of: unmutated IGHV genes and/or IGHV3-21 usage, 11q deletion, beta-2 microglobulin greater than 4 mg/L; 22% had a good risk (with none of the above and mutated IGHV genes). The 5-year progression-free survival rates for these three groups were 0%, 12% and 34%, respectively, and the corresponding 5-year overall survival rates were 9%, 53% and 79% (both P<0.00005 independent of treatment allocation). In the intermediate risk group 250 patients, with data for all three risk factors, were further subdivided into intermediate-low (one risk factor) or intermediate-high (2 or 3 risk factors). The 5-year progression-free survival rates were 18% and 7% (P=0.0001) and the 5-year overall survival rates were 68% and 40% (P<0.00005), respectively.

This study tested the hypothesis that alteration of left ventricular myocardial deformation and mechanical dyssynchrony may occur in asymptomatic children after anthracycline therapy despite having left ventricular shortening fractions within the limits of normal. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary paediatric cardiac centre. METHODS: Left ventricular longitudinal, circumferential and radial myocardial deformation was determined using speckle tracking echocardiography in 45 patients aged 15.3+/-5.8 years. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic data were acquired for the measurement of left ventricular volumes and systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI), the latter derived from the dispersion of time-to-minimum regional volume using a 16-segment model. The results were compared with those of 44 controls. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients had reduced left ventricular global systolic longitudinal strain (p=0.012), circumferential strain (p<0.001), radial strain (p=0.006) and circumferential strain rate (SR; p=0.002). The cumulative anthracycline dose correlated negatively with global longitudinal (r=-0.33, p=0.027) and circumferential (r=-0.32, p=0.035) SR. The left ventricular SDI was significantly greater in patients than controls (4.46+/-1.52% vs 3.80+/-0.58%, p=0.03).

Aberrant activation of Notch target genes is observed in Ikaros-deficient thymocytes as well as leukemia cell lines. However, it is not known whether Notch deregulation plays a preferential or obligatory role in the leukemia that arise in Ikaros null (Ik(-/-)) mice. To answer this question, the expression of the DNA-binding Notch target gene activator RBP-Jkappa was abrogated in Ik(-/-) double-positive thymocytes. This was accomplished through conditional inactivation using CD4-Cre transgenic mice containing floxed RBP-Jkappa alleles (RBPJ(fl/fl)). Ik(-/-) x RBPJ(fl/fl) x CD4-Cre(+) transgenic mice develop clonal T cell populations in the thymus that escape to the periphery, with similar kinetics and penetrance as their CD4-Cre(-) counterparts. The clonal populations do not display increased RBP-Jkappa expression compared with nontransformed thymocytes, suggesting there is no selection for clones that have not fully deleted RBP-Jkappa. However, RBPJ-deficient clonal populations do not expand as aggressively as their RBPJ-sufficient counterparts, suggesting a qualitative role for deregulated Notch target gene activation in the leukemogenic process. Finally, these studies show that RBP-Jkappa plays no role in Notch target gene repression in double-positive thymocytes but rather that it is Ikaros that is required for the repression of these genes at this critical stage of T cell development.",,"['Chari, Sheila', 'Umetsu, Sarah E', 'Winandy, Susan']","['Chari S', 'Umetsu SE', 'Winandy S']","['Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100528,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Rbpj protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Silencing/immunology', '*Gene Targeting', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*deficiency/*genetics/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Notch/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2010/06/01 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/06/01 06:00'],"['2010/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0903688 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0903688 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Jul 1;185(1):410-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0903688.

Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), a cellular component of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) PICs, has been demonstrated to protect viral DNA from autointegration and stimulate the intermolecular integration activity of the PIC by its DNA binding activity. Recent studies reveal that the functions of BAF are regulated by phosphorylation via a family of cellular serine/threonine kinases called vaccinia-related kinases (VRK), and VRK-mediated phosphorylation causes a loss of the DNA binding activity of BAF. These results raise the possibility that BAF phosphorylation may influence the integration activities of the PIC through removal of BAF from viral DNA. In the present study, we report that VRK1 was able to abolish the intermolecular integration activity of MMLV PICs in vitro. This was accompanied by an enhancement of autointegration activity and dissociation of BAF from the PICs. In addition, in vitro phosphorylation of BAF by VRK1 abrogated the activity of BAF in PIC function. Among the VRK family members, VRK1 as well as VRK2, which catalyze hyperphosphorylation of BAF, could abolish PIC function. We also found that treatment of PICs with certain nucleotides such as ATP resulted in the inhibition of the intermolecular integration activity of PICs through the dissociation of BAF. More importantly, the ATP-induced disruption was not observed with the PICs from VRK1 knockdown cells. Our in vitro results therefore suggest the presence of cellular kinases including VRKs that can inactivate the retroviral integration complex via BAF phosphorylation.",,"['Suzuki, Yasutsugu', 'Ogawa, Kanako', 'Koyanagi, Yoshio', 'Suzuki, Youichi']","['Suzuki Y', 'Ogawa K', 'Koyanagi Y', 'Suzuki Y']","['Laboratory for Host Factors, Center for Emerging Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan. ysuzuki@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100528,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Vrk1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/*genetics', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Vaccinia virus/*enzymology', 'Virus Integration']",2010/06/01 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/06/01 06:00'],"['2010/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)61870-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.116640 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jul 30;285(31):24032-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.116640.

Temozolomide's inhibition of AGT may sensitize leukemia cells to the novel alkylator laromustine. We conducted a phase I translational study to evaluate the toxicities and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of laromustine when administered with temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TMZ was delivered twice daily for 5 doses followed by a single infusion of laromustine. The target TMZ dose was the dose that would reliably result in > 90% AGT depletion. Once the target TMZ dose was identified, the laromustine dose was escalated. A total of 35 patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia were treated. RESULTS: Treatment with TMZ 300 mg for 5 doses resulted in > 90% depletion of AGT levels in 5 of 6 patients. The MTD of the combination was established at TMZ 1500 mg and laromustine 300 mg/m2. Three of the 7 patients assayed from cohort 1 achieved > 90% depletion of AGT activity (range, 77%-100% depletion; median, 88%). Five of 6 patients enrolled in cohort 2 achieved > 90% depletion of AGT activity (range, 92%-100% depletion; median, 93.5%). This established that the 300-mg dose of TMZ (1500 mg total) would be maintained in subsequent cohorts. The majority of adverse events were primarily hematologic, with infectious and pulmonary complications also noted. Three (9%) of the patients with previous refractory disease achieved a complete remission, and 5 (14%) of the patients achieved a morphologic, leukemia-free, but persistent hypocellular bone marrow status. CONCLUSION: Laromustine in combination with TMZ is tolerable and manageable at doses that predictably suppress AGT. Reliable TMZ-induced inhibition of AGT was observed in doses that are clinically tolerable. Evidence of antitumor effect was observed with this combination, suggesting that further efficacy studies should be performed.",,"['Rizzieri, David', 'LoRusso, Samantha', 'Tse, William', 'Khan, Khuda', 'Advani, Anjali', 'Moore, Joseph', 'Karsten, Verena', 'Cahill, Ann', 'Gerson, Stanton L']","['Rizzieri D', 'LoRusso S', 'Tse W', 'Khan K', 'Advani A', 'Moore J', 'Karsten V', 'Cahill A', 'Gerson SL']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. rizzi003@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '14J2G0U3NQ (laromustine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'History, 16th Century', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Temozolomide', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/01 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/06/01 06:00'],"['2010/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)70008-8 [pii]', '10.3816/CLML.2010.n.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2010 Jun;10(3):211-6. doi: 10.3816/CLML.2010.n.033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 41 patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (n = 17), myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 15), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 9) who had RI and were receiving therapy with azacitidine or decitabine. The median number of administered cycles was 3. Most patients (39; 95%) received a standard dose of the drugs at the initiation of therapy. Nine patients (22%) required treatment interruptions or discontinuation, and 10 patients (24%) required dose reductions. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 63%, and 4 patients (10%) achieved a complete response. Twenty patients (51%) experienced grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression-related toxicities. Hospitalization was required in 68% of the patients. Among 12 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 29 mL per minute or less, 6 required dose reductions attributable to myelosuppression (n = 3) or to worsening renal function (n = 3). The overall survival (OS) at 18 months was 12%, and the median OS was 8.6 months. CONCLUSION: The use of HA in patients with RI is feasible, but is associated with a higher incidence of toxicity.

Several trials of next-generation agents and modified imatinib-based treatments are in progress, with the aim of improving on standard imatinib 400 mg per day therapy. In the post-imatinib era, a range of assessments are available for evaluating novel strategies. Based on existing evidence, achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) within 12 months provides the best prediction of longer-term benefit, although durable response and freedom from disease progression are the main treatment goals. In phase II studies, first-line treatment with dasatinib 100 mg once daily or nilotinib 400 mg twice daily resulted in high rates of CCyR and major molecular response (MMR) compared with historical data, and separate phase III trials are ongoing to compare each of these agents with imatinib for the treatment of newly diagnosed CP-CML. Preliminary results indicated higher 12-month CCyR and MMR and lower progression rates for nilotinib compared with standard-dose imatinib. Conflicting findings were reported regarding the ability of high-dose imatinib (800 mg per day) or imatinib plus interferon to induce higher response rates compared with standard-dose imatinib, although no improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival was reported.

After an initial correlation with rabies and feline leukaemia virus vaccination, subsequent studies have demonstrated that an abnormal reaction of feline tissues to chronic inflammation was mainly responsible for the disease. The low incidence of FISS in the population is explained by its multifactorial aetiology, since individual genetic characteristics are also implicated. FISS is an infiltrative tumour with low metastatic potential but local recurrence is common. Multimodal treatment (extensive surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) is recommended. The use of sophisticated imaging techniques can improve diagnosis and help in surgical planning.

Since aberrant DNA methylation plays an important role in leukemogenesis of ALL, it can be targeted by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR), a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation. 5-AZA-CdR is a prodrug that is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK). Leukemic cells lacking DCK are drug-resistant. In a previous phase I study, we reported that 5-AZA-CdR could induce remissions in ALL. However, some patients developed drug-resistance due to deficiency in DCK. These observations aroused our interest in 3-deazauridine (3-DU), a CTP synthetase inhibitor that is effective against leukemic cells deficient in DCK. In this report, we observed that 3-DU enhanced the in vitro antineoplastic action of 5-AZA-CdR on human leukemic cells by increasing its incorporation into DNA. Using an optimized dose-schedule we showed that this combination could cure some mice bearing L1210 leukemia, even in the presence of a subpopulation of drug-resistant (L1210/ARA-C) leukemic cells lacking DCK. 3-DU alone also cured some mice with L1210/ARA-C leukemia. In a pilot study on 3 relapsed patients with advanced ALL, the combination of 5-AZA-CdR and 3-DU produced a marked reduction in leukemic blasts, confirming our preclinical observations. Furthermore, after several treatments with these agents all three patients developed drug-resistance to 5-AZA-CdR as determined by an in vitro drug sensitivity test. In two patients we showed by enzymatic analysis that the drug-resistance was due to deficiency in DCK. Our preclinical and clinical results provide a strong rationale to further investigate the combination of 5-AZA-CdR and 3-DU for the treatment of advanced ALL.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2010.

However, we recently isolated two cytotoxic products, trimer and tetramer of sesamol, from oxidation of sesamol by an assay-guided purification. In this study, we have revealed some cytotoxic characteristics of these products in rat thymocytes and human leukemia K562 cells. Incubation of cells with trimer or tetramer at 10-30 microM for 24h significantly increased cell lethality and population of rat thymocytes containing hypodiploid DNA, suggesting cell death with DNA fragmentation, while it was not the case for 30 microM sesamol. The cytotoxic action of tetramer was more potent than that of trimer in rat thymocytes when their concentrations were 10-30 microM. The incubation of cells with 10 microM tetramer for 24h increased the population of cells with exposed phosphatidylserine, the activity of caspases, and the nick of DNA. These results indicate tetramer-induced apoptosis. In K562 cells, the incubation with tetramer at 10 microM for 72 h significantly inhibited the growth without affecting the lethality. However, tetramer at 30 microM significantly increased cell lethality. It is likely that tetramer exerts more cytotoxic action on normal non-proliferative cells (rat thymocytes) rather than proliferative cancer cells (human leukemia K562 cells).

Currently no validated non-animal test methods exist for skin sensitization. Evaluation of changes in cell surface marker expression in dendritic cell (DC)-surrogate cell lines represents one non-animal approach. The human Cell Line Activation Test (h-CLAT) examines the level of CD86 and CD54 expression on the surface of THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, following 24h of chemical exposure. To examine protocol transferability, between-lab reproducibility, and predictive capacity, the h-CLAT has been evaluated by five independent laboratories in several ring trials (RTs) coordinated by the European Cosmetics Association (COLIPA). The results of the first and second RTs demonstrated that the protocol was transferable and basically had good between-lab reproducibility and predictivity, but there were some false negative data. To improve performance, protocol and prediction model were modified. Using the modified prediction model in the first and second RT, accuracy was improved. However, about 15% of the outcomes were not correctly identified, which exposes some of the limitations of the assay. For the chemicals evaluated, the limitation may due to chemical being a weak allergen or having low solubility (ex. alpha-hexylcinnamaldehyde). The third RT evaluated the modified prediction model and satisfactory results were obtained. From the RT data, the feasibility of utilizing cell lines as surrogate DC in development of in vitro skin sensitization methods shows promise. The data also support initiating formal pre-validation of the h-CLAT in order to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of the assay.",['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We determined the population frequencies of HA-1 and HA-2 alleles in Taiwan and exploited their potential applications in allogeneic HSCT. METHODS: HA-1 and HA-2 were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism in healthy controls (221 for HA-1 and 306 for HA-2) and HLA-matched donor-recipient sibling pairs with HSCT (92 for HA-1 and 38 for HA-2). The association of genetic polymorphisms with HSCT outcome was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The allele frequencies in controls were 35.3% and 64.7% for HA-1(H) and HA-1(R), and 89.0% and 11.0% for HA-2(V) and HA-2(M), respectively. HA-1 disparity was denoted in 16.3% of HLA-matched donor-recipient sibling pairs, while it was not associated with HSCT outcome. HA-2 disparity was not observed in the donor-recipient pairs studied. The possibilities of using HA-1 and HA-2 variabilities as molecular markers for hematopoietic chimerism after HSCT were 39.2% and 18.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the information on allele and genotype frequencies of HA-1 and HA-2 in a Taiwanese population, and suggest that prospective genomic typing for HA-1 and HA-2 alleles of the donor and recipient could be a useful approach for molecular identification of hematopoietic chimerism after HSCT, rather than prognosis of clinical outcome.",,"['Lio, Hoi-Yan', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Wu, Jui', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Lin, Chun-Ying', 'Yang, Ya-Chien']","['Lio HY', 'Tang JL', 'Wu J', 'Wu SJ', 'Lin CY', 'Yang YC']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Graft Rejection/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Recurrence', 'Siblings', 'Taiwan', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/01 06:00,2011/01/06 06:00,['2010/06/01 06:00'],"['2010/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1515/CCLM.2010.246 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2010 Sep;48(9):1287-93. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.2010.246.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been documented for solid tumors, and there is an emerging evidence suggesting that tumor progression of hematolymphoid malignancies also depends on the induction of new blood vessel formation. The most important proangiogenic agent is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), activating VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The available data on angiogenesis in hemato-lymphoid malignancies, such as acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms, multiple myeloma, and lymphomas, point towards the significance of autocrine and paracrine VEGF-mediated effects for proliferation and survival of leukemia/lymphoma cells in addition to tumor vascularization. Antiangiogenic strategies have become an important therapeutic modality for solid tumors. Several antiangiogenic agents targeting VEGF-related pathways are also being utilized in clinical trials for the treatment of hemato-lymphoid malignancies, and in some instances these pathways have emerged as promising therapeutic targets.

To further our understanding of As(2)O(3)-induced death, we analyzed its effects on transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signaling mediators in ovarian cells. Dysregulated TGFbeta signaling is a characteristic of ovarian cancers. As(2)O(3) reduced the protein expression of EVI1, TAK1, SMAD2/3, and TGFbetaRII while increasing SnoN/SkiL. EVI1 protein was modulated by treatment with the proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and PS-341/Velcade, suggesting that degradation occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The sensitivity of ovarian cells to As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis correlated with expression of multidrug resistance protein 1. Interestingly, expression of SnoN was similar to LC3-II (autophagy marker), which increased with induction of cytoplasmic vacuolation preceding apoptosis. These vesicles were identified as autophagosomes based on transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining with EGFP-LC3. The addition of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (ROS scavenger) to As(2)O(3)-treated cells reversed changes in SnoN protein and the autophagic/apoptotic response. In contrast to beclin-1 knockdown, siRNA targeting ATG5, ATG7, and hVps34 markedly reduced autophagy in As(2)O(3)-treated ovarian carcinoma cells. Further, treatment with SnoN siRNA markedly decreased LC3-II levels and increased PARP degradation (an apoptosis marker). Collectively, these findings suggest that As(2)O(3) induces a beclin-1-independent autophagic pathway in ovarian carcinoma cells and implicates SnoN in promoting As(2)O(3)-mediated autophagic cell survival.",,"['Smith, D M', 'Patel, S', 'Raffoul, F', 'Haller, E', 'Mills, G B', 'Nanjundan, M']","['Smith DM', 'Patel S', 'Raffoul F', 'Haller E', 'Mills GB', 'Nanjundan M']","['Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, BSF218, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100528,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (ATG5 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SKIL protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', '*Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Beclin-1', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/genetics/metabolism']",2010/05/29 06:00,2011/03/11 06:00,['2010/05/29 06:00'],"['2010/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201053 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2010.53 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2010 Dec;17(12):1867-81. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2010.53.

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic-acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA) fusion protein, which emerges as a consequence of the t(15;17) translocation, acts as a transcriptional repressor that blocks neutrophil differentiation at the promyelocyte (PM) stage. In this study, we used publicly available microarray data sets and identified signatures of genes dysregulated in APL by comparison of gene expression profiles of APL cells and normal PMs representing the same stage of differentiation. We next subjected our identified APL signatures of dysregulated genes to a series of computational analyses leading to (i) the finding that APL cells show stem cell properties with respect to gene expression and transcriptional regulation, and (ii) the identification of candidate drugs and drug targets for therapeutic interventions. Significantly, our study provides a conceptual framework that can be applied to any subtype of AML and cancer in general to uncover novel information from published microarray data sets at low cost.

Two DLTs were seen, of grade 4 febrile neutropenia (cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m(2)) and grade 4 herpes zoster despite anti-viral prophylaxis (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)). No cumulative hematological toxicity or thromboembolic episodes were reported. The overall response rate was 96%, including 20% stringent complete response (CR), 40% CR/near-complete response and 68% >or=very good partial response.

Nonetheless, constitutively active mutant FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) causally contributes to transformation and is associated with poor prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can counteract deregulated gene expression profiles and decrease oncoprotein stability, which renders them candidate drugs for AML treatment. However, these drugs have pleiotropic effects and it is often unclear how they correct oncogenic transcriptomes and proteomes. We report here that treatment of AML cells with the HDACi LBH589 induces the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH8 and degradation of FLT3-ITD. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches show that UBCH8 and the ubiquitin-ligase SIAH1 physically interact with and target FLT3-ITD for proteasomal degradation. These ubiquitinylating enzymes though have a significantly lesser effect on wild-type FLT3. Furthermore, physiological and pharmacological stimulation of FLT3 phosphorylation, inhibition of FLT3-ITD autophosphorylation and analysis of kinase-inactive FLT3-ITD revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation determines degradation of FLT3 and FLT3-ITD by the proteasome. These results provide novel insights into antileukemic activities of HDACi and position UBCH8, which have been implicated primarily in processes in the nucleus, as a previously unrecognized important modulator of FLT3-ITD stability and leukemic cell survival.",,"['Buchwald, M', 'Pietschmann, K', 'Muller, J P', 'Bohmer, F D', 'Heinzel, T', 'Kramer, O H']","['Buchwald M', 'Pietschmann K', 'Muller JP', 'Bohmer FD', 'Heinzel T', 'Kramer OH']","['Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Friedrich-Schiller University, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100527,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2L6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/05/29 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/05/29 06:00'],"['2010/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010114 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Aug;24(8):1412-21. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.114.

A total of 38 IDH mutations (18 IDH1-R132, 19 IDH2-R140 and 1 IDH2-R172) were detected: 5 (0.8%) ET, 8 (1.9%) PV, 13 (4.2%) PMF, 1 (1%) post-PV/ET MF and 11 (21.6%) blast-phase MPN (P<0.01). Mutant IDH was documented in the presence or absence of JAK2, MPL and TET2 mutations, with similar mutational frequencies. However, IDH-mutated patients were more likely to be nullizygous for JAK2 46/1 haplotype, especially in PMF (P=0.04), and less likely to display complex karyotype, in blast-phase disease (P<0.01). In chronic-phase PMF, JAK2 46/1 haplotype nullizygosity (P<0.01; hazard ratio (HR) 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-5.2), but not IDH mutational status (P=0.55; HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5-3.4), had an adverse effect on survival. This was confirmed by multivariable analysis. In contrast, in both blast-phase PMF (P=0.04) and blast-phase MPN (P=0.01), the presence of an IDH mutation predicted worse survival.

Thus, these data suggest that VSELs may originate from epiblast/migrating PGC-like cells and, in spite of the expression of pluripotent stem cell markers, changes in the epigenetic signature of imprinted genes keep these cells quiescent in adult tissues and prevent them from teratoma formation.",,"['Shin, D-M', 'Liu, R', 'Klich, I', 'Wu, W', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Kucia, M', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Shin DM', 'Liu R', 'Klich I', 'Wu W', 'Ratajczak J', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Institute at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100527,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Methylation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Germ Cells', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2010/05/29 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/05/29 06:00'],"['2010/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010121 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.121 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Aug;24(8):1450-61. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.121.

We screened nine patients with post-MPN leukemia for chromosomal aberrations using microarray karyotyping. Deletions on the short arm of chromosome 7 (del7p) emerged as a recurrent defect. We mapped the common deleted region to the IKZF1 gene, which encodes the transcription factor Ikaros. We further examined the frequency of IKZF1 deletions in a total of 29 post-MPN leukemia and 526 MPN patients without transformation and observed a strong association of IKZF1 deletions with post-MPN leukemia in two independent cohorts. Patients with IKZF1 loss showed complex karyotypes, and del7p was a late event in the genetic evolution of the MPN clone. IKZF1 deletions were observed in both undifferentiated and differentiated myeloid cell types, indicating that IKZF1 loss does not cause differentiation arrest but rather renders progenitors susceptible to transformation, most likely through chromosomal instability. Induced Ikzf1 haploinsufficiency in primary murine progenitors resulted in elevated Stat5 phosphorylation and increased cytokine-dependent growth, suggesting that reduced expression of IKZF1 is sufficient to perturb growth regulation.

To analyze the hitherto unrecognized role of Stat5 serine phosphorylation in this context, we have generated cS5 constructs with mutated C-terminal serines 725 and 779, either alone or in combination. Genetic complementation assays in primary Stat5(null/null) mast cells and Stat5(DeltaN) T cells demonstrated reconstitution of proliferation with these mutants. Similarly, an in vivo reconstitution experiment of transduced Stat5(null/null) fetal liver cells transplanted into irradiated wild-type recipients revealed that these mutants exhibit biologic activity in lineage differentiation. By contrast, the leukemogenic potential of cS5 in bone marrow transplants decreased dramatically in cS5 single-serine mutants or was completely absent upon loss of both serine phosphorylation sites.

As we hypothesized that the rearrangement between BCR and ABL genes occurred near the inserted sequence and because of the relative small size of BCR intron 14, we determined the BCR-ABL breakpoint at the genomic DNA level. Using a PCR-based method, this analysis revealed that i) BCR intron 14 brought a potential lariat branch point and the polypyrimidine tract, ii) the BCR-ABL breakpoint created a chimeric acceptor site, and iii) the inserted sequence of ABL intron Ib carried at its 3' end a well-conserved donor splice site. Therefore, the inserted sequence was flanked by canonical consensus splice sites and recognized as a pseudo-exon (as shown by splice site prediction and exon finder software). Moreover, the insertion did not disrupt the reading frame between BCR and ABL and did not produce a premature stop codon.

High-resolution microscopy and surface rendering revealed serine 536 phosphorylated p65 predominantly in the cytosol, while serine 468 phosphorylated p65 mainly localized in nuclear speckles. TNF stimulation resulted in the translocation of the cytosolic p65 kinase IKKepsilon to the nucleus and also to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed the inducible association of IKKepsilon to the control regions of several NF-kappaB target genes.

The authors examined the association of parents' ages at women's births with risk of hematologic malignancies among 110,999 eligible women aged 22-84 years recruited into the prospective California Teachers Study. Between 1995 and 2007, 819 women without a family history of hematologic malignancies were diagnosed with incident lymphoma, leukemia (primarily acute myeloid leukemia), or multiple myeloma. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models provided estimates of relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Paternal age was positively associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma after adjustment for race and birth order (relative risk for age > or =40 vs. <25 years = 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 2.13; P-trend = 0.01). Further adjustment for maternal age did not materially alter the association.

Evidence on the relation of each to cancer is summarized, including esophageal, thyroid, colon, renal, liver, melanoma, multiple myeloma, rectum, gallbladder, leukemia, lymphoma, and prostate in men; and postmenopausal breast and endometrium in women. Different mechanisms drive etiologic pathways for these cancers. Weight loss, particularly among postmenopausal women, reduces risk for breast cancer. Among cancer patients, data are less robust, but we note a long history of poor outcomes after breast cancer among obese women. While evidence on obesity and outcomes for other cancers is mixed, growing evidence points to benefits of physical activity for breast and colon cancers. Dosing of chemotherapy and radiation therapy among obese patients is discussed and the impact on therapy-related toxicity is noted. Guidelines for counseling patients for weight loss and increased physical activity are presented and supported by strong evidence that increased physical activity leads to improved quality of life among cancer survivors.

The patient outcomes governing relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were defined as overall survival, time to progression (TTP) to AML, adverse events and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The clinical evidence was derived from an open-label randomised controlled trial referred to as study AZA-001. It compared aza with CCR in 358 patients with higher risk MDS, CMML and AML 20-30% blasts. The outcomes reported in AZA-001 included overall survival, TTP to AML and adverse events. No HRQoL results were reported; however, outcomes likely to impact on HRQoL were provided. The results showed that: the median overall survival was 24.5 months on aza, compared with 15.0 months in the CCR group (p = 0.0001); the response rates were low (complete remission 17% aza versus 8% CCR); the median time to transformation to AML was greater in the aza group (17.8 versus 11.5 months; p < 0.0001); and of patients who were red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent at baseline, 45% of those on aza became RBC transfusion-independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.8% in the CCR group (p < 0.0001). The ERG reran the submission's search strategies after some modifications incorporating minor improvements. The ERG analysed the submitted economic model (model 1) and identified a number of inconsistencies and errors within the model. The manufacturer submitted a revised model for analysis by the ERG. Using the issues identified in the earlier analysis, the ERG conducted those repairs to the revised model that were feasible within time constraints. The ERG ran this version in probabilistic sensitivity analyses to generate cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers. The results of these exploratory analyses indicated that: for standard-dose chemotherapy (SDC)-treated patients, of six treatment options available, best supportive care (BSC) was likely the most cost-effective option up to a threshold of 51,000 pounds/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) [beyond 51,000 pounds/QALY, aza + low-dose chemotherapy (LDC) became cost-effective]; for LDC-treated patients, of four options available, BSC was again the most cost-effective option up to a willingness-to-pay threshold of 51,000 pounds/QALY (aza + LDC became cost-effective after 51,000 pounds/QALY); for BSC-treated patients, aza + BSC became cost-effective relative to BSC at a threshold of about 52,000 pounds/QALY. The ERG considers these results exploratory and considers that they should be viewed with caution. The AZA-001 study showed that, compared with CCR, those MDS patients receiving aza had prolonged median survival, had delayed progression to AML, had reduced dependence on transfusions and had a small improvement in response rate. Given the general paucity of economic modelling work in MDS and the limitations of the submitted industry model there is an evident need for an independent cost-effectiveness analysis of aza in MDS. At the time of writing, the guidance appraisal consultation document issued by NICE on 4 March 2010 states that azacitidine is not recommended as a treatment option for people not eligible for haemopoietic stem cell transplantation with the the following conditions: intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, CMML with 10-29% marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, or with AML with 20-30% blasts and multilineage dysplasia, according to World Health Organization classification.",,"['Edlin, R', 'Connock, M', 'Tubeuf, S', 'Round, J', 'Fry-Smith, A', 'Hyde, C', 'Greenheld, W']","['Edlin R', 'Connock M', 'Tubeuf S', 'Round J', 'Fry-Smith A', 'Hyde C', 'Greenheld W']","['Unit of Public Health Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Birmingham Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Health Technol Assess,"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",9706284,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/economics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/economics/mortality', 'Models, Economic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/economics/mortality', 'Quality of Life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Survival', 'United Kingdom']",2010/06/12 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/05/29 06:00'],"['2010/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3310/hta14Suppl1/10 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Technol Assess. 2010 May;14 Suppl 1:69-74. doi: 10.3310/hta14Suppl1/10.,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of the Aurora kinases has also proven to be an effective therapeutic strategy in a number of haematological malignancies. AT9283 is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with potent activity against Jak2 and Aurora kinases A and B, and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. To investigate the therapeutic potential of AT9283 in the MPD we studied its activity in a number of Jak2-dependent systems. AT9283 potently inhibited proliferation and Jak2-related signalling in Jak2-dependent cell lines as well as inhibiting the formation of erythroid colonies from haematopoietic progenitors isolated from MPD patients with Jak2 mutations.

Variations in the viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins, which are used to pseudotype retroviral or lentiviral vectors, can alter vector performance, including stability, titers, host range, and tissue tropism. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus (XMRV) is a novel human retrovirus identified in patients with prostate cancer. XMRV targets XPR1 cell surface receptor, which is expressed in a broad range of human tissues including hematopoietic stem cells. Pseudotyping with XMRV Env would allow targeting of XPR1-expressing tissues. Here, we characterized XMRV Env-pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors. Although HIV and MLV vectors were poorly pseudotyped with wild-type XMRV Env, replacement of the C-terminal 11 amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain of XMRV Env with the corresponding 6 amino acid residues of amphotropic MLV Env (XMRV/R(ampho)) significantly increased XMRV Env-pseudotyped HIV and MLV vector titers. The transduction efficiency in human CD34(+) cells when using the XMRV/R(ampho)-pseudotyped HIV vector (10-20%) was comparable to that achieved when using the same infectious units of vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein-pseudotyped vector (25%); thus the modified XMRV Env offers an alternative pseudotyping strategy for XPR1-mediated gene delivery.",,"['Sakuma, Toshie', 'De Ravin, Suk See', 'Tonne, Jason M', 'Thatava, Tayaramma', 'Ohmine, Seiga', 'Takeuchi, Yasuhiro', 'Malech, Harry L', 'Ikeda, Yasuhiro']","['Sakuma T', 'De Ravin SS', 'Tonne JM', 'Thatava T', 'Ohmine S', 'Takeuchi Y', 'Malech HL', 'Ikeda Y']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100917,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cryopreservation', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Viral Load', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*metabolism']",2010/05/29 06:00,2011/06/30 06:00,['2010/05/29 06:00'],"['2010/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2010.063 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2010 Dec;21(12):1665-73. doi: 10.1089/hum.2010.063.

Many nonvolatile substances (whisky congeners, WC) seep from the oak cask during the maturing process. In this study, three antiallergic agents (syringaldehyde, SA; lyoniresinol, Lyo; and ellagic acid, EA) were isolated from WC. Treatment with SA, Lyo, and EA reduced the elevation of intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and intracellular ROS production caused by FcepsilonRI activation. The inhibitions of the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i and intracellular ROS production by SA and Lyo were mainly due to the suppression of the NADPH oxidase activity and scavenging of the produced radical, respectively. On the other hand, EA inactivated spleen tyrosine kinase and led to the inhibition of the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i and intracellular ROS production. Furthermore, it was found that WC strongly inhibited IgE binding to the FcepsilonRIalpha chain, whereas SA, Lyo, and EA did not indicate this inhibitory effect. These results suggest that WC inhibits allergic reactions through multiple mechanisms. To disclose the in vivo effects of WC, SA, Lyo, and EA, these compounds were administered to type I allergic model mice, and the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction was measured.

The development of ATL is thought to be associated with disruption of transcriptional control of cellular genes. HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) factor, HBZ, is encoded by the complementary strand of the provirus. We previously reported that HBZ interacts with c-Jun and suppresses its transcriptional activity. To identify the cellular factor(s) that interact with HBZ, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length HBZ as bait and identified MafB. HBZ heterodimerizes with MafB via each bZIP domain. Luciferase analysis revealed a significant decrease in transcription through Maf recognition element (MARE) in a manner dependent on the bZIP domain of HBZ. Indeed, production of full-length HBZ in cells decreased the MARE-bound MafB protein, indicating that HBZ abrogates the DNA-binding activity of MafB. In addition, HBZ reduced the steady-state levels of MafB, and the levels were restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. These results suggest a suppressive effect of HBZ on Maf function, which may have a significant role in HTLV-1 related pathogenesis.","['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Ohshima, Takayuki', 'Mukai, Risa', 'Nakahara, Norie', 'Matsumoto, Jun', 'Isono, Osamu', 'Kobayashi, Yusuke', 'Takahashi, Satoru', 'Shimotohno, Kunitada']","['Ohshima T', 'Mukai R', 'Nakahara N', 'Matsumoto J', 'Isono O', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Takahashi S', 'Shimotohno K']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science at Kagawa Campus, Tokushima Bunri University, Kagawa, Japan. ohshimat@kph.bunri-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (MafB Transcription Factor)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers', 'MafB Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Retroviridae Proteins', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/05/28 06:00,2011/02/15 06:00,['2010/05/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22687 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2010 Sep 1;111(1):187-94. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22687.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to investigate postmarketing reports of malignancy in children treated with TNF blockers. METHODS: The FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System was searched to identify malignancies associated with the use of infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in children in whom therapy was initiated between the ages of 0 and 18 years. The reporting rates for infliximab and etanercept were compared with the background rate of malignancy in the general pediatric population. RESULTS: Forty-eight reports of malignancy in children were identified: 31 following infliximab use, 15 following etanercept use, and 2 following adalimumab use. Half of the malignancies reported were lymphomas and included both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The remaining reported cases involved a variety of different malignancies including leukemia, melanoma, and solid organ cancers. The majority of the reported cases (88%) involved the concomitant use of other immunosuppressants. Reporting rates for malignancy showed that infliximab had a consistently higher reporting rate when compared with background rates in the general pediatric population for lymphomas and all malignancies. The reporting rates for etanercept were elevated above background for lymphomas and were on par with background for all malignancies. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that treatment with TNF blockers in children may increase the risk of malignancy.

Taken together, our findings indicate that RUNX1 interacts with the human SWI/SNF complex to control hematopoietic-specific gene expression.","['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Bakshi, Rachit', 'Hassan, Mohammad Q', 'Pratap, Jitesh', 'Lian, Jane B', 'Montecino, Martin A', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Janet L', 'Imbalzano, Anthony N', 'Stein, Gary S']","['Bakshi R', 'Hassan MQ', 'Pratap J', 'Lian JB', 'Montecino MA', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein JL', 'Imbalzano AN', 'Stein GS']","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (SMARCB1 Protein)', '0 (SMARCB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'SMARCB1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/05/28 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/05/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22240 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2010 Nov;225(2):569-76. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22240.,"['P01 AR048818/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK32520/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA082834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01AR048818/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA082834-S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA082834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3045090,['NIHMS271379'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monoclonal rheumatoid factors (mRF) that bear the WA cross-idiotype (Xid) are responsible for most cases of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis in patients with HCV infection. The purpose of this study was to determine whether WA B cells can be detected in asymptomatic patients with HCV infection, using sequence analysis of B cell clonal expansions (BCEs) to identify the WA Xid. METHODS: Asymptomatic patients with HCV infection and those without HCV infection as well as respective control patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, whose serum was either negative or positive for WA mRF, were studied. BCEs were isolated in the patients' blood, and WA BCEs were identified by sequencing analysis. RESULTS: BCEs were detected in all control patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, but only control patients with HCV infection had WA BCEs. None of the 33 asymptomatic patients without HCV infection had a BCE. WA BCEs were detected in 4 (7.4%) of 55 asymptomatic patients with HCV infection, in none of 14 patients with HCV infection and type III cryoglobulinemia, and in 5 (13.5%) of 37 patients with HCV infection and serum RF positivity. One patient with a WA BCE had splenic lymphoma markers and villous lymphocytes, and the villous lymphocytes were found to be WA B cells. CONCLUSION: By identification of the WA Xid, WA B cells can be detected in asymptomatic HCV-infected patients. WA B cells in asymptomatic patients with HCV infection may be a marker for the development of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and associated B cell malignancies. The results of this study provide a basis for the development of the first practical clinical application of cross-idiotype analysis.",,"['Knight, Glenn B', 'Gao, Lei', 'Gragnani, Laura', 'Elfahal, Mutasim M', 'De Rosa, Francesco G', 'Gordon, Fredric D', 'Agnello, Vincent']","['Knight GB', 'Gao L', 'Gragnani L', 'Elfahal MM', 'De Rosa FG', 'Gordon FD', 'Agnello V']","['Lahey Clinic, Burlington, Massachusetts 01805, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology', 'Cryoglobulinemia/complications/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/complications/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Vasculitis/complications/*immunology/pathology']",2010/05/28 06:00,2010/07/30 06:00,['2010/05/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/art.27490 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2010 Jul;62(7):2152-9. doi: 10.1002/art.27490.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, agents that can topically induce PGD(2) for itch relief are not well established. The antimycotic sertaconazole nitrate (STZ) has been shown to exhibit anti-itch properties; however, the mechanism for this activity has not been elucidated. STZ mitigated degranulation of RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia) mast cells induced by compound 48/80, a pruritogenic agent known to promote the release of histamine, and augmented PGD(2) production in mast cells and macrophages. Addition of exogenous PGD(2) abrogated compound 48/80-induced degranulation by acting through the prostanoid D receptor 1 (DP1). STZ induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in mast cells and a pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, resulted in the attenuation of PGD(2) levels. Finally, in a murine model of pruritus, the scratching behavior induced by compound 48/80 was mitigated by topical application of STZ. This effect was reversed by the addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, or a DP1 receptor antagonist (MK0524). Collectively, these results suggest that STZ mediates its anti-itch effects by boosting the antipruritic agent, PGD(2), by the activation of the p38-MAPK pathway. This is the first report to demonstrate a promising approach to topically induce PGD(2) for improving pruritus.",,"['Kaur, Simarna', 'Sur, Runa', 'Liebel, Frank T', 'Southall, Michael D']","['Kaur S', 'Sur R', 'Liebel FT', 'Southall MD']","['Preclinical Pharmacology, Johnson and Johnson Skin Research Center, CPPW, Johnson and Johnson Consumer Companies Inc., Skillman, New Jersey 08558, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100527,United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MK-0524)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (prostanoid D receptor 1, mouse)', '4091-50-3 (p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine)', '72W71I16EG (sertaconazole)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Interactions', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Prostaglandin D2/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Pruritus/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/metabolism', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology', 'p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2010/05/28 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/05/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-202X(15)34568-1 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2010.152 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2010 Oct;130(10):2448-56. doi: 10.1038/jid.2010.152.

Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations in lung cancers, they have primarily focused on a limited set of genes and have thus provided a constrained view of the mutational spectrum. Recent cancer sequencing efforts have used next-generation sequencing technologies to provide a genome-wide view of mutations in leukaemia, breast cancer and cancer cell lines. Here we present the complete sequences of a primary lung tumour (60x coverage) and adjacent normal tissue (46x). Comparing the two genomes, we identify a wide variety of somatic variations, including >50,000 high-confidence single nucleotide variants. We validated 530 somatic single nucleotide variants in this tumour, including one in the KRAS proto-oncogene and 391 others in coding regions, as well as 43 large-scale structural variations. These constitute a large set of new somatic mutations and yield an estimated 17.7 per megabase genome-wide somatic mutation rate. Notably, we observe a distinct pattern of selection against mutations within expressed genes compared to non-expressed genes and in promoter regions up to 5 kilobases upstream of all protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we observe a higher rate of amino acid-changing mutations in kinase genes. We present a comprehensive view of somatic alterations in a single lung tumour, and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of distinct selective pressures present within the tumour environment.",,"['Lee, William', 'Jiang, Zhaoshi', 'Liu, Jinfeng', 'Haverty, Peter M', 'Guan, Yinghui', 'Stinson, Jeremy', 'Yue, Peng', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Pant, Krishna P', 'Bhatt, Deepali', 'Ha, Connie', 'Johnson, Stephanie', 'Kennemer, Michael I', 'Mohan, Sankar', 'Nazarenko, Igor', 'Watanabe, Colin', 'Sparks, Andrew B', 'Shames, David S', 'Gentleman, Robert', 'de Sauvage, Frederic J', 'Stern, Howard', 'Pandita, Ajay', 'Ballinger, Dennis G', 'Drmanac, Radoje', 'Modrusan, Zora', 'Seshagiri, Somasekar', 'Zhang, Zemin']","['Lee W', 'Jiang Z', 'Liu J', 'Haverty PM', 'Guan Y', 'Stinson J', 'Yue P', 'Zhang Y', 'Pant KP', 'Bhatt D', 'Ha C', 'Johnson S', 'Kennemer MI', 'Mohan S', 'Nazarenko I', 'Watanabe C', 'Sparks AB', 'Shames DS', 'Gentleman R', 'de Sauvage FJ', 'Stern H', 'Pandita A', 'Ballinger DG', 'Drmanac R', 'Modrusan Z', 'Seshagiri S', 'Zhang Z']","['Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California 94080, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Selection, Genetic/genetics']",2010/05/28 06:00,2010/07/03 06:00,['2010/05/28 06:00'],"['2009/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['nature09004 [pii]', '10.1038/nature09004 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2010 May 27;465(7297):473-7. doi: 10.1038/nature09004.,,,,['GEO/GSE20585'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and following nucleotide sequencing showed that the p53 gene was mutated at codon 215, leading to an amino acid substitution from Ser to Arg. For the MLL gene, southern blot analysis showed that the MLL gene locus was amplified but not rearranged at its breakpoint cluster region, which is usually rearranged in balanced translocations with many partner genes.

Prognosis of ATL patients is directly correlated to the subtype of ATL. Treatment of the aggressive forms (acute and lymphoma types) of ATL remains inadequate, as most ATL patients receive conventional chemotherapy without stem cell rescue. At present, LSG15 is the standard chemotherapy for the treatment of aggressive ATL, but the efficacy of LSG15 in most patients is transient. To prolong median survival time, additional therapies for maintenance of complete response (CR) are needed after achieving CR by induction chemotherapy. Improved outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), despite a high incidence of graft-versus-host disease, has been reported. Thus, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and allogeneic peripheral blood SCT may have great potential for eradication of HTLV-1 and cure of ATL. Recently, reduced-intensity conditioning stem cell transplantation was also reported to be effective for ATL. Although several issues, including selection criteria for patients and sources of stem cells remain to be resolved, allo-SCT may be considered as a treatment option for patients with aggressive ATL. To evaluate whether allo-SCT is more effective than the standard chemotherapy (LSG15) for aggressive ATL, an up front phase II clinical trial of JCOG-LSG is now being planned.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed DNA from highly purified AML blasts and paired buccal cells from 95 patients for recurrent genomic microdeletions using ultra-high density Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism 6.0 array-based genomic profiling. RESULTS: Through fine mapping of microdeletions on 17q, we derived a minimal deleted region of approximately 0.9-Mb length that harbors 11 known genes; this region includes Neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Sequence analysis of all NF1 coding exons in the 11 AML cases with NF1 copy number changes identified acquired truncating frameshift mutations in two patients. These NF1 mutations were already present in the hematopoetic stem cell compartment. Subsequent expression analysis of NF1 mRNA in the entire AML cohort using fluorescence-activated cell sorting sorted blasts as a source of RNA identified six patients (one with a NF1 mutation) with absent NF1 expression. The NF1 null states were associated with increased Ras-bound GTP, and short hairpin RNA-mediated NF1 suppression in primary AML blasts with wild-type NF1 facilitated colony formation in methylcellulose. Primary AML blasts without functional NF1, unlike blasts with functional NF1, displayed sensitivity to rapamycin-induced apoptosis, thus identifying a dependence on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling for survival. Finally, colony formation in methylcellulose ex vivo of NF1 null CD34+/CD38- cells sorted from AML bone marrow samples was inhibited by low-dose rapamycin.

We hypothesized that proteasome inhibitors that act through a noncompetitive mechanism might overcome some forms of bortezomib resistance. METHODS: 5-amino-8-hydroxyquinoline (5AHQ) was identified through a screen of a 27-compound chemical library based on the quinoline pharmacophore to identify proteasome inhibitors. Inhibition of proteasome activity by 5AHQ was tested by measuring 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) release from the proteasome substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC in intact human and mouse leukemia and myeloma cells and in tumor cell protein extracts. Cytotoxicity was assessed in 5AHQ-treated cell lines and primary cells from myeloma and leukemia patients using AlamarBlue fluorescence and MTS assays, trypan blue staining, and annexin V staining. 5AHQ-proteasome interaction was assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance. 5AHQ efficacy was evaluated in three leukemia xenograft mouse models (9-10 mice per group per model). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: 5AHQ inhibited the proteasome when added to cell extracts and intact cells (the mean concentration inhibiting 50% [IC(50)] of AMC release in intact cells ranged from 0.57 to 5.03 microM), induced cell death in intact cells from leukemia and myeloma cell lines (mean IC(50) values for cell growth ranged from 0.94 to 3.85 microM), and preferentially induced cell death in primary myeloma and leukemia cells compared with normal hematopoietic cells. 5AHQ was equally cytotoxic to human myelomonocytic THP1 cells and to THP1/BTZ500 cells, which are 237-fold more resistant to bortezomib than wild-type THP1 cells because of their overexpression and mutation of the bortezomib-binding beta5 proteasome subunit (mean IC(50) for cell death in the absence of bortezomib, wild-type THP1: 3.7 microM, 95% confidence interval = 3.4 to 4.0 microM; THP1/BTZ500: 6.6 microM, 95% confidence interval = 5.9 to 7.5 microM). 5AHQ interacted with the alpha subunits of the 20S proteasome at noncatalytic sites. Orally administered 5AHQ inhibited tumor growth in all three mouse models of leukemia without overt toxicity (eg, OCI-AML2 model, median tumor weight [interquartile range], 5AHQ vs control: 95.7 mg [61.4-163.5 mg] vs 247.2 mg [189.4-296.2 mg], P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: 5AHQ is a noncompetitive proteasome inhibitor that is cytotoxic to myeloma and leukemia cells in vitro and inhibits xenograft tumor growth in vivo. 5AHQ can overcome some forms of bortezomib resistance in vitro.",,"['Li, Xiaoming', 'Wood, Tabitha E', 'Sprangers, Remco', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Franke, Niels E', 'Mao, Xinliang', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Verbrugge, Sue Ellen', 'Adomat, Hans', 'Li, Zhi Hua', 'Trudel, Suzanne', 'Chen, Christine', 'Religa, Tomasz L', 'Jamal, Nazir', 'Messner, Hans', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Rose, David R', 'Navon, Ami', 'Guns, Emma', 'Batey, Robert A', 'Kay, Lewis E', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Li X', 'Wood TE', 'Sprangers R', 'Jansen G', 'Franke NE', 'Mao X', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Verbrugge SE', 'Adomat H', 'Li ZH', 'Trudel S', 'Chen C', 'Religa TL', 'Jamal N', 'Messner H', 'Cloos J', 'Rose DR', 'Navon A', 'Guns E', 'Batey RA', 'Kay LE', 'Schimmer AD']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100526,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (5-amino-8-hydroxyquinoline)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyquinolines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2010/05/28 06:00,2010/08/06 06:00,['2010/05/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['djq198 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djq198 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010 Jul 21;102(14):1069-82. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djq198.

Strikingly, the strain showed a remarkable degree of variability, with evidence of selection and increasing predominance of biofilm-producing and oxacillin-resistant variants over time. Thus, in the early stages of the infection, the strain was found to generate subpopulations which had spontaneously lost the biofilm-mediating ica locus along with the oxacillin resistance-conferring mecA gene. These deletion mutants were obviously outcompeted by the ica- and mecA-positive wild-type genotype, with the selection and predominance of strongly biofilm-forming and oxacillin-resistant variants in the later stages of the infection.

Erythroid cells expressing SFFV gp55 proliferate in the absence of their normal regulator, erythropoietin (Epo), because of interaction of the viral envelope protein with the erythropoietin receptor and a short form of the receptor tyrosine kinase Stk (sf-Stk), leading to constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways. Our previous in vitro studies showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) is activated in SFFV-infected cells and is important in mediating the biological effects of the virus. To determine the role of PI3-kinase in SFFV-induced disease, mice deficient in the p85alpha regulatory subunit of class IA PI3-kinase were inoculated with different strains of SFFV. We observed that p85alpha status determined the extent of erythroid hyperplasia induced by the sf-Stk-dependent viruses SFFV-P (polycythemia-inducing strain of SFFV) and SFFV-A (anemia-inducing strain of SFFV) but not by the sf-Stk-independent SFFV variant BB6. Our data also indicate that p85alpha status determines the response of mice to stress erythropoiesis, consistent with a previous report showing that SFFV uses a stress erythropoiesis pathway to induce erythroleukemia. We further showed that sf-Stk interacts with p85alpha and that this interaction depends upon sf-Stk kinase activity and tyrosine 436 in the multifunctional docking site. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3-kinase blocked proliferation of primary erythroleukemia cells from SFFV-infected mice and the erythroleukemia cell lines derived from them. These results indicate that p85alpha may regulate sf-Stk-dependent erythroid proliferation induced by SFFV as well as stress-induced erythroid hyperplasia.",,"['Umehara, Daigo', 'Watanabe, Shinya', 'Ochi, Haruyo', 'Anai, Yukari', 'Ahmed, Nursarat', 'Kannagi, Mari', 'Hanson, Charlotte', 'Ruscetti, Sandra', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Umehara D', 'Watanabe S', 'Ochi H', 'Anai Y', 'Ahmed N', 'Kannagi M', 'Hanson C', 'Ruscetti S', 'Nishigaki K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100526,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RON protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*pathogenicity']",2010/05/28 06:00,2010/07/21 06:00,['2010/05/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00488-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00488-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Aug;84(15):7675-82. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00488-10.

In this study, we investigate the detailed mechanism of H3.3 replication-independent deposition. We found that the death domain-associated protein DAXX and the chromatin remodeling factor ATRX (alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome protein) are specifically associated with the H3.3 deposition machinery. Bacterially expressed DAXX has a marked binding preference for H3.3 and assists the deposition of (H3.3-H4)(2) tetramers on naked DNA, thus showing that DAXX is a H3.3 histone chaperone. In DAXX-depleted cells, a fraction of H3.3 was found associated with the replication-dependent machinery of deposition, suggesting that cells adapt to the depletion. The reintroduced DAXX in these cells colocalizes with H3.3 into the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) bodies. Moreover, DAXX associates with pericentric DNA repeats, and modulates the transcription from these repeats through assembly of H3.3 nucleosomes. These findings establish a new link between the PML bodies and the regulation of pericentric DNA repeat chromatin structure.

Over time, however, virtually all CLL patients become fludarabine-refractory. To elucidate whether microRNAs are involved in the development of fludarabine resistance, we analyzed the expression of 723 human miRNAs before and 5-days after fludarabine mono-therapy in 17 CLL patients which were classified as responder or refractory to fludarabine treatment based on NCI criteria. RESULTS: By comparing the expression profiles of these two groups of patients, we identified a microRNA signature able to distinguish refractory from sensitive CLLs. The expression of some microRNAs was also able to predict fludarabine resistance of 12 independent CLL patients. Among the identified microRNAs, miR-148a, miR-222 and miR-21 exhibited a significantly higher expression in non-responder patients either before and after fludarabine treatment. After performing messenger RNA expression profile of the same patients, the activation of p53-responsive genes was detected in fludarabine responsive cases only, therefore suggesting a possible mechanism linked to microRNA deregulation in non-responder patients. Importantly, inhibition of miR-21 and miR-222 by anti-miRNA oligonucleotides induced a significant increase in caspase activity in fludarabine-treated p53-mutant MEG-01 cells, suggesting that miR-21 and miR-222 up-regulation may be involved in the establishment of fludarabine resistance. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that reveals the existence of a microRNA profile that differentiate refractory and sensitive CLLs, either before and after fludarabine mono-therapy.

Therefore, the surveillance and early identification of patients at high risk for developing BSIs might be useful for the development of preventive measures. The aim of the current study was to assess the predictive power of three scoring systems: Infection Probability Score (IPS), APACHE II and KARNOFSKY score for the onset of Bloodstream Infections in hematology-oncology patients. METHODS: A total of 102 patients who were hospitalized for more than 48 hours in a hematology-oncology department in Athens, Greece between April 1st and October 31st 2007 were included in the study. Data were collected by using an anonymous standardized recording form. Source materials included medical records, temperature charts, information from nursing and medical staff, and results on microbiological testing. Patients were followed daily until hospital discharge or death. RESULTS: Among the 102 patients, Bloodstream Infections occurred in 17 (16.6%) patients. The incidence density of Bloodstream Infections was 7.74 per 1,000 patient-days or 21.99 per 1,000 patient-days at risk. The patients who developed a Bloodstream Infection were mainly females (p = 0.004), with twofold time mean length of hospital stay (p < 0.001), with fourfold time mean length of neutropenia (p < 0.001), with neutropenia < 500 (p < 0.001), suffered mainly from acute myeloid leukemia (p < 0.001), had been exposed to antibiotics (p = 0.045) and chemotherapy (p = 0.023), had a surgery (p = 0.048) and a Hickman catheter (p = 0.025) as compared to the patients without Bloodstream Infection. The best cut-off value of IPS for the prediction of a Bloodstream Infection was 10 with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 70.9% CONCLUSION: Between the three different prognostic scoring systems, Infection Probability Score had the best sensitivity in predicting Bloodstream Infections.",,"['Apostolopoulou, Eleni', 'Raftopoulos, Vasilios', 'Terzis, Konstantinos', 'Elefsiniotis, Ioannis']","['Apostolopoulou E', 'Raftopoulos V', 'Terzis K', 'Elefsiniotis I']","['University of Athens, Nursing Department, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20100526,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['APACHE', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacteremia/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Fungemia/*diagnosis', 'Greece', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Young Adult']",2010/05/28 06:00,2010/07/16 06:00,['2010/05/28 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-10-135 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-10-135 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2010 May 26;10:135. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-10-135.,,PMC2890000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reason for targeting receptor TF for the development of tPDT is that TF is a common but specific target on angiogenic tumour vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and many types of tumour cells, including solid tumours and leukaemia. METHODS: Murine factor VII protein (mfVII) containing a mutation (Lys341Ala) was covalently conjugated via a cross linker EDC with Veterporfin (VP) that was extracted from liposomal Visudyne, and then free VP was separated by Sephadex G50 spin columns. fVII-tPDT using mfVII-VP conjugate, compared to ntPDT, was tested in vitro for the killing of breast cancer cells and VEGF-stimulated VEC and in vivo for inhibiting the tumour growth of breast tumours in a mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: We showed that: (i) fVII protein could be conjugated with VP without affecting its binding activity; (ii) fVII-tPDT could selectively kill TF-expressing breast cancer cells and VEGF-stimulated angiogenic HUVECs but had no side effects on non-TF expressing unstimulated HUVEC, CHO-K1 and 293 cells; (iii) fVII targeting enhanced the effect of VP PDT by three to four fold; (iii) fVII-tPDT induced significantly stronger levels of apoptosis and necrosis than ntPDT; and (iv) fVII-tPDT had a significantly stronger effect on inhibiting breast tumour growth in mice than ntPDT. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the fVII-targeted VP PDT that we report here is a novel and effective therapeutic with improved selectivity for the treatment of breast cancer. Since TF is expressed on many types of cancer cells including leukaemic cells and selectively on angiogenic tumour VECs, fVII-tPDT could have broad therapeutic applications for other solid cancers and leukaemia.",,"['Hu, Zhiwei', 'Rao, Benqiang', 'Chen, Shimin', 'Duanmu, Jinzhong']","['Hu Z', 'Rao B', 'Chen S', 'Duanmu J']","['Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA. zhiwei.hu@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100526,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0X9PA28K43 (Verteporfin)', '9001-25-6 (Factor VII)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Carriers', 'Endothelial Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Factor VII/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'Necrosis', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Porphyrins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden', 'Verteporfin', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/05/28 06:00,2010/08/17 06:00,['2010/05/28 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-235 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-235 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 May 26;10:235. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-235.,['CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2882923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that forced expression of a new combination of transcription factors (T-cell leukemia/lymphoma protein 1A [TCL-1A], C-MYC, and SOX2) is sufficient to promote the reprogramming of human fibroblasts into pluripotent cells. These 3-factor pluripotent cells are similar to human embryonic stem cells in morphology, in the ability to differentiate into cells of the 3 embryonic layers, and at the level of global gene expression.

We found beta-catenin abnormally accumulated in both human acute T cell leukemia Jurkat cells and human erythroleukemia HEL cells. beta-Catenin can be significantly down-regulated by the Janus kinase 2 specific inhibitor AG490 in these two cells. AG490 also reduces the luciferase activity of a reporter plasmid driven by LEF/beta-catenin promoter. Similar results were observed in HEL cells infected with lentivirus containing shRNA against JAK2 gene. After treatment with 50 microM AG490 or shRNA, the mRNA expression levels of beta-catenin, APC, Axin, beta-Trcp, GSK3alpha, and GSK3beta were up-regulated within 12-16 h. However, only the protein levels of GSK3beta and beta-Trcp were found to have increased relative to untreated cells.

This descriptive study was designed to determine the pattern of deaths in children with ALL treated at a single center and identify the problem areas in management. Case records of 532 patients with ALL were analyzed. Information regarding the clinical-demographic profile, therapy, and course of illness were recorded. One hundred twenty-eight (24.0%) deaths were recorded. Sepsis (53.3%) and bleeding (15.7%) were the most common causes of mortality. The mortality rate fell significantly during the induction and remission phases of the therapy in 2 consecutive time periods between 1990 to 1997 and 1998 to 2006. The factors associated with an increased risk of death were longer symptom diagnosis interval (P=0.049), bulk disease (P=0.008), mediastinal adenopathy (P=0.001), higher total leukocyte count (P=0.001), and lower platelet count (P=0.007) at presentation as compared with the survivors. Multivariate analysis showed that longer symptom diagnosis interval (P=0.001), mediastinal adenopathy (P=0.006), lower platelet count (P=0.001), and higher total leukocyte count significantly influenced death. The estimated median time to death for the induction and remission deaths were 0.5 and 17 months, respectively. A high mortality rate necessitates the reappraisal of our treatment protocols.

Using proteomic analysis, we showed expression of PPARgamma protein in a series of 260 newly diagnosed primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) samples. Forced expression of PPARgamma enhanced the sensitivity of myeloid leukemic cells to apoptosis induced by PPARgamma agonists 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and 15-deoxy-(12,14)-15DPGJ(2), through preferential cleavage of caspase-8. No effects on cell cycle distribution or differentiation were noted, despite prominent induction of p21 in PPARgamma-transfected cells. In turn, antagonizing PPARgamma function by small interfering RNA or pharmacologic PPARgamma inhibitor significantly diminished apoptosis induction by CDDO. Overexpression of coactivator protein DRIP205 resulted in enhanced differentiation induction by CDDO in AML cells through PPARgamma activation. Studies with DRIP205 deletion constructs showed that the NR boxes of DRIP205 are not required for this coactivation. In a phase I clinical trial of CDDO (RTA-401) in leukemia, CDDO induced an increase in PPARgamma mRNA expression in six of nine patient samples; of those, induction of differentiation was documented in four patients and that of p21 in three patients, all expressing DRIP205 protein. In summary, these findings suggest that cellular levels of PPARgamma regulate induction of apoptosis via caspase-8 activation, whereas the coactivator DRIP205 is a determinant of induction of differentiation, in response to PPARgamma agonists in leukemic cells.",,"['Tsao, Twee', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Safe, Stephen', 'Watt, Julie C', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Chen, Wenjing', 'Qiu, Yihua', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Ju, Zhenlin', 'Abdelrahim, Maen', 'Schober, Wendy', 'Ling, Xiaoyang', 'Kardassis, Dimitris', 'Meyer, Colin', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Tsao T', 'Kornblau S', 'Safe S', 'Watt JC', 'Ruvolo V', 'Chen W', 'Qiu Y', 'Coombes KR', 'Ju Z', 'Abdelrahim M', 'Schober W', 'Ling X', 'Kardassis D', 'Meyer C', 'Schimmer A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100525,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (Mediator Complex Subunit 1)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mediator Complex Subunit 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitric Oxide/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'PPAR gamma/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/05/27 06:00,2010/07/23 06:00,['2010/05/27 06:00'],"['2010/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-1962 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1962 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Jun 15;70(12):4949-60. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1962.

Cbl is a member of a family of RING finger ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate signaling by tyrosine kinases and that function as adaptor proteins to regulate signaling positively. Until the past 2 years, there was little evidence that Cbl proteins were involved in human malignancies. Recent publications have shown homozygous mutations in Cbl in human myeloid neoplasms. Although in vitro and animal transformation models suggested that mutant forms of Cbl acted as an oncogene, the cellular role suggested that the protein could serve as a tumor suppressor gene. The recent data begin to reconcile this paradox as the loss of ubiquitin ligase function (the tumor suppressor function) is coupled to the maintenance of the positive signaling function (the oncogene function).

The precise molecular mechanism by which the ER stress response culminates in cell death requires further clarification. The present study shows that in prostate carcinoma cells, the mda-7/IL-24-induced ER stress response causes apoptosis by translational inhibition of the antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Forced expression of Mcl-1 blocked mda-7/IL-24 lethality, whereas RNA interference or gene knockout of Mcl-1 markedly sensitized transformed cells to mda-7/IL-24. Mcl-1 downregulation by mda-7/IL-24 relieved its association with the proapoptotic protein Bak, causing oligomerization of Bak and leading to cell death. These observations show the profound role of the Bcl-2 protein family member Mcl-1 in regulating cancer-specific apoptosis induced by this cytokine. Thus, our studies provide further insights into the molecular mechanism of ER stress-induced cancer-selective apoptosis by mda-7/IL-24.

Various proteins are constitutively or transiently accumulated in PML NBs in a PML-dependent manner. MORC3 (microrchidia family CW-type zinc-finger 3), also known as NXP2, which consists of GHL-ATPase, a CW-type zinc-finger and coiled-coil domains, is localized in PML NBs, where it recruits and activates p53 to induce cellular senescence. Interestingly, we found that MORC3 can form PML-independent nuclear domains (NDs) in mouse hematopoietic cells and even in Pml-deficient cells. Here, we show that MORC3 colocalizes with PML by a two-step molecular mechanism: the PML-independent formation of MORC3 NDs by the ATPase cycle, and the association of MORC3 with PML via the SUMO1-SUMO-interacting motif (SIM). Similarly to other members of the GHL-ATPase family, MORC3 functions as a 'molecular clamp'.

It is known that some proteins with peroxidase activity (horseradish peroxidase and prostaglandin hydroperoxidase) can catalyze oxidation of bisulfite (hydrated sulfur dioxide), leading to the formation of sulfur trioxide anion radical ((.)SO(3)(-)). This free radical further reacts with oxygen to form peroxymonosulfate anion radical ((-)O(3)SOO(.)) and the very reactive sulfate anion radical (SO(4)()), which is nearly as strong an oxidant as the hydroxyl radical. However, the ability of EPO to generate reactive sulfur radicals has not yet been reported. Here we demonstrate that eosinophil peroxidase/H(2)O(2) is able to oxidize bisulfite, ultimately forming the sulfate anion radical (SO(4)()), and that these reactive intermediates can oxidize target proteins to protein radicals, thereby initiating protein oxidation. We used immuno-spin trapping and confocal microscopy to study protein oxidation by EPO/H(2)O(2) in the presence of bisulfite in a pure enzymatic system and in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 clone 15 cells, maturated to eosinophils. Polyclonal antiserum raised against the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) detected the presence of DMPO covalently attached to the proteins resulting from the DMPO trapping of protein free radicals. We found that sulfite oxidation mediated by EPO/H(2)O(2) induced the formation of radical-derived DMPO spin-trapped human serum albumin and, to a lesser extent, of DMPO-EPO. These studies suggest that EPO-dependent oxidative damage may play a role in tissue injury in bisulfite-exacerbated eosinophilic inflammatory disorders.",,"['Ranguelova, Kalina', 'Chatterjee, Saurabh', 'Ehrenshaft, Marilyn', 'Ramirez, Dario C', 'Summers, Fiona A', 'Kadiiska, Maria B', 'Mason, Ronald P']","['Ranguelova K', 'Chatterjee S', 'Ehrenshaft M', 'Ramirez DC', 'Summers FA', 'Kadiiska MB', 'Mason RP']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.

As a result of the translocation, the 3' portion of the ABL1 oncogene is transposed from 9q34 to the 5' portion of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to form the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene. At diagnosis, in 5-10% of CML patients the Ph chromosome is derived from variant translocations other than the standard t(9;22). RESULTS: We report a molecular cytogenetic study of 452 consecutive CML patients at diagnosis, that revealed 50 cases identifying three main subgroups: i) cases with variant chromosomal rearrangements other than the classic t(9;22)(q34;q11) (9.5%); ii) cases with cryptic insertions of ABL1 into BCR, or vice versa (1.3%); iii) cases bearing additional chromosomal rearrangements concomitant to the t(9;22) (1.1%). For each cytogenetic group, the mechanism at the basis of the rearrangement is discussed.All breakpoints on other chromosomes involved in variant t(9;22) and in additional rearrangements have been characterized for the first time by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) experiments and bioinformatic analyses. This study revealed a high content of Alu repeats, genes density, GC frequency, and miRNAs in the great majority of the analyzed breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together with literature data about CML with variant t(9;22), our findings identified several new cytogenetic breakpoints as hotspots for recombination, demonstrating that the involvement of chromosomes other than 9 and 22 is not a random event but could depend on specific genomic features. The presence of several genes and/or miRNAs at the identified breakpoints suggests their potential involvement in the CML pathogenesis.",,"['Albano, Francesco', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Coccaro, Nicoletta', 'Casieri, Paola', 'Rossi, Antonella Russo', 'Vicari, Laura', 'Liso, Vincenzo', 'Rocchi, Mariano', 'Specchia, Giorgina']","['Albano F', 'Anelli L', 'Zagaria A', 'Coccaro N', 'Casieri P', 'Rossi AR', 'Vicari L', 'Liso V', 'Rocchi M', 'Specchia G']","['Hematology, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy. f.albano@ematba.uniba.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100525,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Dasatinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2010/05/27 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/05/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-120 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-120 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 May 25;9:120. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-120.,,PMC2887383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of patients with clonal evolution treated with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors is not known. METHODS: The authors analyzed the outcome of 177 CML patients after second tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were in chronic phase, 30 had clonal evolution, 28 were in accelerated phase (AP), and 24 were in AP plus clonal evolution. Major cytogenetic response rates were 58%, 54%, 28%, and 13%; 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 73%, 68%, and 33%; and 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 69%, 67%, 31%, and 8%, respectively. The hematologic and cytogenetic response rates, OS, and EFS were no different between patients in chronic phase with clonal evolution and patients with chronic phase and no clonal evolution. However, clonal evolution had a significant adverse impact when associated with other features of AP. On multivariate analysis, clonal evolution had no independently significant effect on achieving major cytogenetic response on the second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The factors predicting increasing major cytogenetic response to second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors were prior achievement of major cytogenetic response with imatinib, higher hemoglobin levels, no splenomegaly, lower percentage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases, and no prior chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal evolution constitutes a heterogeneous entity with variable outcome with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, with trisomy 8, chromosome 17, and complex abnormalities having the worst outcome, regardless of the number of metaphases involved.

Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel, less toxic and more effective drugs for CLL patients. In this study, we attempted to assess simvastatin, widely used as a cholesterol-lowering drug, both as a single agent and in combination with purine analogs-fludarabine and cladribine-in terms of its effect on apoptosis and DNA damage of CLL cells. The experiments were done in ex vivo short-term cell cultures of blood and bone marrow cells from newly diagnosed untreated patients. We analyzed expression of active caspase-3 and the BCL-2/BAX ratio as markers of apoptosis and the expression of phosphorylated histone H2AX (named gammaH2AX) and activated ATM kinase (ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase), reporters of DNA damage. Results of our study revealed that simvastatin induced apoptosis of CLL cells concurrently with lowering of BCL-2/BAX ratio, and its pro-apoptotic effect is tumor-specific, not affecting normal lymphocytes. We observed that combinations of simvastatin+fludarabine and simvastatin+cladribine had a synergic effect in inducing apoptosis. Interestingly, the rate of apoptosis caused by simvastatin alone and in combination was independent of markers of disease progression like ZAP-70 and CD38 expression or clinical stage according to Rai classification. We have also seen an increase in gammaH2AX expression in parallel with activation of ATM in most of the analyzed samples. The results suggest that simvastatin can be used in the treatment of CLL patients as a single agent as well as in combination with purine analogs, being equally effective both in high-risk and good-prognosis patients. One of the mechanisms of simvastatin action is inducing DNA damage that ultimately leads to apoptosis.",,"['Podhorecka, Monika', 'Halicka, Dorota', 'Klimek, Piotr', 'Kowal, Malgorzata', 'Chocholska, Sylwia', 'Dmoszynska, Anna']","['Podhorecka M', 'Halicka D', 'Klimek P', 'Kowal M', 'Chocholska S', 'Dmoszynska A']","['Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Staszica 11, Lublin, Poland. monika.podhorecka@am.lublin.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100525,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Anticholesteremic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Anticholesteremic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Purines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Simvastatin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2010/05/26 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/05/26 06:00'],"['2010/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-0988-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Nov;89(11):1115-24. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-0988-z.

LQB-118 treatment resulted in an important reduction of cell viability in cell lines derived from CML, both the vincristine-sensitive K562 cell line, and the resistant K562-Lucena (a cell line overexpressing P-glycoprotein). In agreement with these results, the induction of caspase-3 activation by this compound indicated that a significant rate of apoptosis was taking place. In these cell lines, apoptosis induced by LQB-118 was accompanied by a reduction of P-glycoprotein, survivin, and XIAP expression. Moreover, this effect was not restricted to cell lines as LQB-118 produced significant apoptosis rate in cells from CML patients exhibiting multifactorial drug resistance phenotype such as P-glycoprotein, MRP1 and p53 overexpression.

In the adult, hemopoiesis is restricted to bone marrow (BM) which contains HSCs residing within the so-called 'niches'. These are microenvironments consisting of extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules (mainly glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, fibronectin and collagens) and stromal cells that act in concert to keep HSCs in quiescence or to promote their growth and differentiation, since BM stromal cells secrete specific growth factors acting on responsive stem cells. Haematopoietic precursors also secrete numerous regulatory molecules as fibroblast growth factors (FGF), interleukin 1 (IL1), and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1), regulating in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner the various stages of normal hematopoiesis. Although the majority of stem cells are quiescent and do nor respond to external signals, a few active stem cells responde to paracrine produced growth factors and differentiate into the more committed CD34+ haematopoietic stem cell or into a mesenchymal stem cell, which generate even more specified tissue. This review focuses on the role of both ECM molecules and growth factors that form a dynamic, interactive system crucial for lineage commitment and amplification. In this perspective, we recently described the pivotal role of ECM, FGF and TGFbeta on the GM-490 phenotype, which is a cell line established from the bone marrow of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Hundreds of promoter regions in AML showed significant alterations in H3K9me3 levels. H3K9me3 deregulation in AML occurred preferentially as a decrease in H3K9me3 levels at core promoter regions. The altered genomic regions showed an overrepresentation of cis-binding sites for ETS and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response elements (CREs) for transcription factors of the CREB/CREM/ATF1 family. The decrease in H3K9me3 levels at CREs was associated with increased CRE-driven promoter activity in AML blasts in vivo. AML-specific H3K9me3 patterns were not associated with known cytogenetic abnormalities. But a signature derived from H3K9me3 patterns predicted event-free survival in AML patients. When the H3K9me3 signature was combined with established clinical prognostic markers, it outperformed prognosis prediction based on clinical parameters alone.

Although expression of BCL6 was not found in early IL-7-dependent B cell precursors, we report that IL-7Ralpha-Stat5 signaling negatively regulates BCL6. Upon productive VH-DJH gene rearrangement and expression of a mu heavy chain, however, activation of pre-B cell receptor signaling strongly induces BCL6 expression, whereas IL-7Ralpha-Stat5 signaling is attenuated. At the transition from IL-7-dependent to -independent stages of B cell development, BCL6 is activated, reaches expression levels resembling those in GC B cells, and protects pre-B cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis during immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain gene recombination. In the absence of BCL6, DNA breaks during Ig light chain gene rearrangement lead to excessive up-regulation of Arf and p53. As a consequence, the pool of new bone marrow immature B cells is markedly reduced in size and clonal diversity.

The aim of this study was to determine whether WT1 contributed to the graft-versus-leukemia effects (GVLE) for CML following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: High-resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genotyping was performed by sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fifteen HLA-A*2402 patients with CML who underwent allogeneic HSCT were enrolled in this study. We monitored the frequency of WT1-specific CTL by pentamer assay and the molecular minimal residual disease by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: A CD8(+) T-cell response to WT1 was observed in 14 of 15 patients after HSCT. The median frequencies of WT1-CTL were 0.54%, 0.62%, 0.81% and 1.28% (%CD8) on days 30, 60, 90 and 180, respectively. The median frequency of WT1-CTL (1.38%) in patients with molecular remission (MoR) was significantly higher than that in those without MoR (0.38%) on day 30, while no significant differences between them were detected on days 60, 90 and 180. The increase of WT1-CTL was associated with a decrease in bcr-abl expression and MoR; and the decrease of WT1-CTL was associated with an increase in bcr-abl expression, suggesting a WT1-driven GVL effect. WT1-CTL had a predominant effector-memory phenotype (CD45RO(+)CD27(-)CD57(+)). CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of WT1-CTL with an effector-memory phenotype is associated with GVLE in CML patients after HSCT. This will pave the way for the WT1 vaccines to enhance GVLE after HSCT in CML.",,"['Wang, Zhi-Dong', 'Li, Dan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Wang ZD', 'Li D', 'Huang XJ']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2010/05/26 06:00,2010/09/15 06:00,['2010/05/26 06:00'],"['2010/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2010 Apr 5;123(7):912-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aberrant markers are non-cancer-type-specific and are accompanied by increased levels of sporadic aneuploidy. The study aimed at following the epigenetic markers and aneuploidy levels in cells of patients with haematological malignancies from diagnosis to full remission, as achieved by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). METHODS: TP53 (a tumor suppressor gene assigned to chromosome 17), AML1 (a gene assigned to chromosome 21 and involved in the leukaemia-abundant 8;21 translocation) and the pericentomeric satellite sequence of chromosome 17 (CEN17) were used for replication timing assessments. Aneuploidy was monitored by enumerating the copy numbers of chromosomes 17 and 21. Replication timing and aneuploidy were detected cytogenetically using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technology applied to phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes. RESULTS: We show that aberrant epigenetic markers are detected in patients with hematological malignancies from the time of diagnosis through to when they are scheduled to undergo alloSCT. These aberrations are unaffected by the clinical status of the disease and are displayed both during accelerated stages as well as in remission. Yet, these markers are eradicated completely following stem cell transplantation. In contrast, the increased levels of aneuploidy (irreversible genetic alterations) displayed in blood lymphocytes at various stages of disease are not eliminated following transplantation. However, they do not elevate and remain unchanged (stable state). A demethylating anti-cancer drug, 5-azacytidine, applied in vitro to lymphocytes of patients prior to transplantation mimics the effect of transplantation: the epigenetic aberrations disappear while aneuploidy stays unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The reversible nature of the replication aberrations may serve as potential epigenetic blood markers for evaluating the success of transplant or other treatments and for long-term follow up of the patients who have overcome a hematological malignancy.",,"['Nagler, Arnon', 'Cytron, Samuel', 'Mashevich, Maya', 'Korenstein-Ilan, Avital', 'Avivi, Lydia']","['Nagler A', 'Cytron S', 'Mashevich M', 'Korenstein-Ilan A', 'Avivi L']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Institute of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer 52621, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100524,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aneuploidy', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*DNA Replication Timing/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2010/05/26 06:00,2010/08/17 06:00,['2010/05/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-230 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-230 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 May 24;10:230. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-230.,,PMC2887401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this method has some limitations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, the epitope-based matching (EBM) method was evaluated for selecting proper HLA-typed PLTs for patients with PLT transfusion refractoriness. Bead-based single-antigen HLA antibody detection method and HLAMatchmaker software were used to define the epitopes recognized by HLA-specific antibodies and to select compatible PLTs for nine patients with alloimmunized refractoriness. Corrected count increments (CCIs) were prospectively determined to compare successful transfusion rates among different matching methods in 142 PLT transfusions. In addition, HLA antibodies were serially detected to see whether any emerging antibodies appeared after receiving the EBM-matched PLTs. RESULTS: The transfusion success rates evaluated with 1-hour CCIs for perfect matching or lacking any mismatching at HLA-A and -B locus (A/BU)-matched, CREG-matched, and EBM-matched PLTs were 85.2, 63.2, and 83.7%, respectively. Compared to CREG-matched PLTs, EBM-matched PLTs showed better transfusion results (p = 0.035). In the follow-up study (7 months; range, 3-13 months), no emerging HLA-specific antibodies were detected after receiving EBM-matched PLTs. CONCLUSIONS: EBM performed on the basis of bead-based single-antigen HLA antibody detection coupled with the HLAMatchmaker program is recommended in choosing proper PLTs for refractory patients when A/BU-matched PLTs were not available.",['(c) 2010 American Association of Blood Banks.'],"['Pai, Shun-Chung', 'Lo, Shyh-Chyi', 'Lin Tsai, Su-Jen', 'Chang, Ji-Sheng', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Lin, Kuo-Sin', 'Lin, Liang-In']","['Pai SC', 'Lo SC', 'Lin Tsai SJ', 'Chang JS', 'Lin DT', 'Lin KS', 'Lin LI']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, Human Platelet)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/therapy', 'Antigens, Human Platelet/*immunology', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*immunology/*therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/therapy', 'Platelet Transfusion/*methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Software']",2010/05/26 06:00,2011/01/25 06:00,['2010/05/26 06:00'],"['2010/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['TRF2703 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02703.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2010 Nov;50(11):2318-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02703.x.,,,,,['Transfusion. 2010 Nov;50(11):2292-4.

Gene delivery has shown promise in short-term experiments; however, its long-term sustainability through multiple turnover cycles in human tissue has awaited confirmation. To characterize approaches for long-term genetic correction, retroviral vectors were constructed containing long terminal repeat-driven full-length and epitope-tagged COL7A1 cDNA and evaluated for durability of type VII collagen expression and function in RDEB skin tissue regenerated on immune-deficient mice. Type VII collagen expression was maintained for 1 year in vivo, or over 12 epidermal turnover cycles, with no abnormalities in skin morphology or self-renewal. Type VII collagen restoration led to correction of RDEB disease features, including reestablishment of anchoring fibrils at the BMZ.

Previous investigations have demonstrated that this overexpression of STAT3 in human malignancies plays important roles in maintaining the characteristics of malignant tumors by having an effect on proliferation, differentiation, and/or immortalization. Thus, inhibition of STAT3 expression could be a potent therapeutic approach in cancer treatment. In this study, we introduced STAT3 siRNA into the human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cell line, which has constitutive activation of STAT3, to elucidate the role of STAT3 in CML. The cells were transducted with STAT3 siRNA using lentivirus. FACS, real-time PCR, and Western blot were used to study changes in STAT3 expression levels in transducted cells by comparing with negative control siRNA lentivirus transduction. Knockdown of STAT3 by STAT3 siRNA caused a decrease in STAT3 protein level, inhibition of growth and proliferation, cell cycle blockade, visible morphologic changes, and induction of apoptosis in K562 cells.

In vitro studies suggest that statins and NSAIDs may have potential as anticancer therapies in low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a recent observational study found statin use was associated with improved event free survival in patients with follicular lymphoma. Other studies have suggested that statins reduce the efficacy of rituximab by inhibiting binding to CD20. We therefore conducted an observational cohort study of 686 patients with newly diagnosed Rai stage 0 CLL to evaluate whether statin or NSAID use was related to their clinical outcome or influenced the efficacy of rituximab therapy. At diagnosis, 136 (20%) patients took statins and 230 (34%) scheduled daily aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. No difference in time to treatment was observed based on statin or NSAID use. Among patients receiving a rituximab-containing first-line therapy, no difference in time to salvage treatment was observed based on statin use. Although previous studies suggested statins may improve event free survival among patients with follicular lymphoma, we find no impact of statins on time to initial therapy in this large study of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL.

Immune system is a typical system that fulfills this characteristic, and the immunoglobulins play important roles in it.

The immunoglobulin has two kinds of domains. One is the variable domain that binds the antigen and the other is the constant domain that has the effecter functions. The immunoglobulin molecule can be obviously identified in vertebrates. In mammals, five immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE are classified. It is important to recognize that our immune system assign immunological roles among classes especially between IgG and IgA after class switch from IgM. IgG, the major immunoglobulin in plasma or extra vascular spaces, has the most versatile function of immunoglobulin molecules; such as placenta transfer, complement fixation and cell binding. On the other hand, IgA, the major immunoglobulin in secretions, does not show any complement fixation unless denatured. These facts implicate an aggressive characteristic of IgG in systemic immune response inside of the body, and a defensive characteristic of IgA in mucosal immune response on the surface of the body.

Novel biological markers such as IgVH mutation, CD38, and ZAP-70 expression have shown to offer important prognostic information. An altered expression of the multidrug resistance 1 may represent an additional prognostic marker. Aim of our study was to evaluate two MDR-1 gene polymorphisms: G2677T polymorphism in exon 21 and C3435T polymorphism in exon 26, to evidence if polymorphisms influence the risk of development of B-CLL and whether genomic polymorphisms provide prognostic information on the clinical progression of the disease. A total of 125 patients with B-CLL and 125 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. The mutant homozygous 2677 TT genotype was found to be associated with the occurrence of B-CLL and higher T allele frequency in patients with B-CLL when compared with controls was observed (P=0.009). When comparing the prognostic patients' characteristics, patients with 2677 GT genotype were statistically linked to the unmutated IgVH genes (r=0.209, P=0.01). Moreover, the same genotype was correlated with lymphocyte number (r=0.269, P=0.02). Finally for the 2677GT polymorphism, the heterozygous status was associated with higher hemoglobin levels (r=0.247, P=0.005). As far the C3435T MDR1 polymorphism, we were not able to identify any significant correlation with IgVH gene status or other variables. In conclusion, MDR1 gene polymorphism could be a factor predisposing to LLC. Moreover, our findings support the possibility of considering these genomic polymorphisms as prognostic markers in patients with B-CLL.",,"['Penna, G', 'Allegra, A', 'Alonci, A', 'Aguennouz, M', 'Garufi, A', 'Cannavo, A', 'Gerace, D', 'Alibrandi, A', 'Musolino, C']","['Penna G', 'Allegra A', 'Alonci A', 'Aguennouz M', 'Garufi A', 'Cannavo A', 'Gerace D', 'Alibrandi A', 'Musolino C']","['Division of Hematology, Policlinico G.

We present a case of a 73-year-old farmer who presented with B-symptoms and multiple adenomegaly. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node reveal a CL: a histological and immunophenotypic aspect of HL-mixed cellularity (CD15+, CD30+, CD20-) and a diffuse small cell infiltrate which meet the criteria for B-CLL (CD20+, CD23+, and CD5+). The lymphocytes in peripheral blood over 15 000/mm(3) and marrow infiltrate with small lymphocytes also sustain the B-CLL diagnosis. The relationship between the two lymphoproliferations is discussed reported to the case above, but also considering the literature data. In most of the cases the two proliferative processes are clonal related which means they have a commune lymphoid progenitor, pre-GC or early-GC with individual detachment and transit through GC (also, the afferent related processes). It is also possible that the two proliferations, which form the composite lesion to have different cellular origins, possibility sustained by the analysis of the IgH rearrangements and of the somatic mutations identified in the two clones.

To identify small molecules for probing Nrg1-ErbB4 signaling, a PC12-cell model was developed and used to perform a live-cell, image-based screen of the effects of small molecules on Nrg1-induced neuritogenesis. By comparing the resulting phenotypic data to that of a similar screening performed with nerve growth factor (NGF), this multidimensional screen identified compounds that directly inhibit Nrg1-ErbB4 signaling, such as the 4-anilino-quinazoline Iressa (gefitinib), as well as compounds that potentiate Nrg1-ErbB4 signaling, such as the indolocarbazole K-252a.

CLL, like other cancers, can be affected by epigenetic alterations. MATERIALS & METHODS: A microarray discovery-based study was initiated to determine DNA methylation in CLL cases with a range of CD38 expression (1-92%). RESULTS: Many loci were either methylated or unmethylated across all CD38 levels, but differential methylation was also observed for some genes. Genomic sequencing of DLEU7 confirmed extensive cytosine methylation preferentially in patient samples with low CD38 expression, whereas NRP2, SFRP2 and ADAM12 were more commonly methylated in those with high CD38 expression. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that CLL is affected by CpG island methylation in some genes that segregate with CD38 expression levels, while most others show similar methylation patterns across all levels. The CpG island methylation in certain functional gene groups and pathway-associated genes that are known to be deregulated in CLL provides additional insights into the CLL methylome and epigenetic contribution to cellular dysfunction.

The clinical hallmarks of asthma include elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), eosinophilic inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is considered a carcinogen; however, it has also been used to treat diseases, such as syphilis, in traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Today, As2O3 is used as one of the standard therapies for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Previous studies have indicated that As2O3 can induce apoptosis in eosinophils. However, the effect of As2O3 on asthma has not been investigated. We used ovalbumin (OVA)-immunized mice as a model for asthma and treated mice with As2O3 at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg. The mice were then monitored for OVA-specific IgE production, airway inflammatory cell infiltration and AHR. We found that administration of As2O3 in OVA-immunized mice abrogated airway eosinophil recruitment by downregulating eotaxin expression but did not alter serum IgE or IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Furthermore, the development of AHR and cellular infiltration into the airway were reduced by treating mice with As2O3. In vitro data suggested that low concentrations of As2O3 could induce only a small degree of apoptosis in primary pulmonary cells but could significantly inhibit the secretion of eotaxin by these cells. These results indicate that the administration of As2O3 to OVA-immunized mice can suppress lung allergic inflammatory responses.

Here we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify transcriptional regulators of ATF5. Our results reveal an essential survival pathway in malignant glioma, whereby activation of a RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling cascade leads to induction of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein-3-like-2 (CREB3L2), which directly activates ATF5 expression. ATF5, in turn, promotes survival by stimulating transcription of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1), an antiapoptotic B cell leukemia-2 family member. Analysis of human malignant glioma samples indicates that ATF5 expression inversely correlates with disease prognosis. The RAF kinase inhibitor sorafenib suppresses ATF5 expression in glioma stem cells and inhibits malignant glioma growth in cell culture and mouse models.

GATA-1 is a master regulator of erythropoiesis. Its role in regulating erythroid-specific genes has been extensively studied, whereas its role in controlling genes that regulate cell proliferation is less understood. Ectopic expression of GATA-1 in erythroleukemia cells releases the block to their differentiation and leads to terminal cell division. An early event in reprogramming the erythroleukemia cells is induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Remarkably, ectopic expression of p21 also induces the erythroleukemia cells to differentiate. We now report that GATA-1 directly regulates transcription of the p21 gene in both erythroleukemia cells and normal erythroid progenitors. Using reporter, electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that GATA-1 stimulates p21 gene transcription by binding to consensus binding sites in the upstream region of the p21 gene promoter. This activity is also dependent on a binding site for Sp1/KLF-like factors near the transcription start site.

AML and MDS cells express the myeloid marker CD33, making it amenable to CD33-targeted therapy. Lintuzumab (SGN-33), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD33 antibody undergoing clinical evaluation, induced meaningful responses in a Phase 1 clinical trial and demonstrated anti-leukemic activity in preclinical models. Recently, it was reported that 5-azacytidine (Vidaza) prolonged the overall survival of a group of high risk MDS and AML patients. To determine whether the combination of lintuzumab and 5-azacytidine would be beneficial, a mouse xenograft model of disseminated AML was used to evaluate the combination. There was a significant reduction in tumor burden and an increase in overall survival in mice treated with lintuzumab and 5-azacytidine. The effects were greater than that obtained with either agent alone. As the in vivo anti-leukemic activity of lintuzumab was dependent upon the presence of mouse effector cells including macrophages and neutrophils, in vitro effector function assays were used to assess the impact of 5-azacytidine on lintuzumab activity. The results show that 5-azacytidine significantly enhanced the ability of lintuzumab to promote tumor cell killing through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytic (ADCP) activities. These results suggest that lintuzumab and 5-azacytidine act in concert to promote tumor cell killing.

PLZF expression was sufficient to provide some memory/effector functions to T cells without the need for Ag stimulation or proliferation. The acquisition of this phenotype did not require the proliferation typically associated with T cell activation. Furthermore, PLZF transgenic cells maintained a diverse TCR repertoire, indicating that there was no preferential expansion of specific clones. Functionally, PLZF transgenic CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes were similar to wild type memory cells, in that they had similar requirements for costimulation and exhibited a similar pattern of cytokine secretion, with the notable exception that transgenic T cells produced significantly increased levels of IL-17. Whereas transgene-mediated PLZF expression was not sufficient to rescue NKT cell development in Fyn- or signaling lymphocytic activation-associated protein (SAP)-deficient mice, the acquisition of memory/effector functions induced by PLZF in conventional T cells was independent of Fyn and SAP.

MicroRNA-196b (miR-196b) is highly expressed in MLL-rearranged leukemia and has been shown to be activated by MLL and MLL-fusion genes. DESIGN AND METHODS: In order to determine whether high expression of miR-196b is restricted to MLL-rearranged leukemia, we used quantitative stem-loop reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression of this microRNA in 72 selected cases of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia i.e. MLL-rearranged and non-MLL-rearranged precursor B-cell and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. We also determined the expression of HOXA-genes flanking miR-196 by microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, we used CpG island-arrays to explore the DNA methylation status of miR-196b and HOXA. RESULTS: We demonstrated that high expression of miR-196b is not unique to MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia but also occurs in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients carrying CALM-AF10, SET-NUP214 and inversion of chromosome 7. Like MLL-rearrangements, these abnormalities have been functionally linked with up-regulation of HOXA. In correspondence, miR-196b expression in these patients correlated strongly with the levels of HOXA family genes (Spearman's correlation coefficient >/= 0.7; P</=0.005). Since miR-196b is encoded on the HOXA cluster, these data suggest co-activation of miR-196b and HOXA genes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Up-regulation of miR-196b coincides with reduced DNA methylation at CpG islands in the promoter regions of miR-196b and the entire HOXA cluster in MLL-rearranged cases compared to in cases of non-MLL precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and normal bone marrow (P<0.05), suggesting an epigenetic origin for miR-196b over-expression. Although patients with MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia are highly resistant to prednisolone and L-asparaginase, this resistance was not attributed to miR-196b expression. CONCLUSIONS: High expression of miR-196b is not exclusively MLL-driven but can also be found in other types of leukemia with aberrant activation of HOXA genes.

Final results of a prospective randomized European Intergroup Trial.,1754-61,10.3324/haematol.2009.019182 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually considered the only curative treatment option for patients with advanced or transformed myelodysplastic syndromes in complete remission, but post-remission chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation are potential alternatives, especially in patients over 45 years old. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated, after intensive anti-leukemic remission-induction chemotherapy, the impact of the availability of an HLA-identical sibling donor on an intention-to treat basis. Additionally, all patients without a sibling donor in complete remission after the first consolidation course were randomized to either autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation or a second consolidation course consisting of high-dose cytarabine. RESULTS: The 4-year survival of the 341 evaluable patients was 28%. After achieving complete remission, the 4-year survival rates of patients under 55 years old with or without a donor were 54% and 41%, respectively, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.49-1.35) for survival and of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42-1.06) for disease-free survival. In patients with intermediate/high risk cytogenetic abnormalities the hazard ratio in multivariate analysis was 0.58 (99% CI, 0.22-1.50) (P=0.14) for survival and 0.46 (99% CI, 0.22-1.50) for disease-free survival (P=0.03). In contrast, in patients with low risk cytogenetic characteristics the hazard ratio for survival was 1.17 (99% CI, 0.40-3.42) and that for disease-free survival was 1.02 (99% CI, 0.40-2.56). The 4-year survival of the 65 patients randomized to autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation or a second consolidation course of high-dose cytarabine was 37% and 27%, respectively. The hazard ratio in multivariate analysis was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.65-2.27) for survival and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.56-1.85) for disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a donor and candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission may have a better disease-free survival than those without a donor in case of myelodysplastic syndromes with intermediate/high-risk cytogenetics.

Heterozygous missense mutations in IDH1 at position R132 and in IDH2 at positions R140 and R172 have recently been reported in acute myeloid leukemia. However, little is known about the incidence and prognostic impact of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 193 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and 53 patients with acute myeloid leukemia arising from myelodysplastic syndromes for mutations in IDH1 (R132), IDH2 (R172 and R140), and NPM1 by direct sequencing. RESULTS: We found that mutations in IDH1 occurred with a frequency of 3.6% in myelodysplastic syndromes (7 mutations in 193 patients) and 7.5% in acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes (4 mutations in 53 patients). Three mutations in codon R140 of IDH2 and one mutation in codon R172 were found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes (7.5%). No IDH2 R140 or R172 mutations were identified in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. The presence of IDH1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival (HR 3.20; 95% CI 1.47-6.99) and a higher rate of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (67% versus 28%, P=0.04). In multivariate analysis when considering karyotype, transfusion dependence and International Prognostic Scoring System score, IDH1 mutations remained an independent prognostic marker in myelodysplastic syndromes (HR 3.57; 95% CI 1.59-8.02; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IDH1 mutations are recurrent molecular aberrations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, and may become useful as a poor risk marker in these patients.

However, its role in adult mammalian hematopoiesis has not been extensively studied and its requirement in leukemia associated with Hox gene expression alteration is unclear. DESIGN AND METHODS: We inactivated Cdx4 in mice through either a germline or conditional knockout approach and analyzed requirement for Cdx4 in both normal adult hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis initiated by the MLL-AF9 fusion oncogene. RESULTS: Here, we report that loss of Cdx4 had a minimal effect on adult hematopoiesis. Indeed, although an increase in white blood cell counts was observed, no significant differences in the distribution of mature blood cells, progenitors or stem cells were observed in Cdx4-deficient animals. In addition, long-term repopulating activity in competitive transplantation assays was not significantly altered. In vitro, B-cell progenitor clonogenic potential was reduced in Cdx4-deficient animals but no significant alteration of mature B cells was detected in vivo. Finally, induction of acute myeloid leukemia in mice by MLL-AF9 was significantly delayed in the absence of Cdx4 in a retroviral transduction/bone marrow transplant model. CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate that Cdx4 is dispensable for the establishment and maintenance of normal hematopoiesis in adult mammals. These results, therefore, outline substantial differences in the Cdx-Hox axis between mammals and zebrafish and support the hypothesis that Cdx factors are functionally redundant during mammalian hematopoietic development under homeostatic conditions.

The assessment of prognostic factors, which relate baseline clinical and experimental covariables to outcomes, is one of the major objectives in clinical research. Historically, the impetus for the identification of prognostic factors has been the need to accurately estimate the effect of treatment adjusting for these variables. In oncology, the variability in outcome may be related to prognostic factors rather than to differences in treatments. In this article, we begin with a brief review of prognostic factors, and then subsequently offer a general discussion of their importance.

These treatments were applied to human leukemic K-562 cells and human lymphoma U-937 cells, yielding apoptotic and necrotic effects, determined by flow cytometry. Additional cell death occurs after exposure to light irradiation at wavelengths lambda > 600 nm, of cells which were electroporated and had incorporated actinomycin-C or daunomycin (daunorubicin). It is observed that drug uptake after an exponentially decaying electroporation pulse of the initial field strength Eo=1.4 kV/cm and pulse time constants in the time range 0.5-3 ms is faster than during PEMF-treatment, i.e., application of an alternating current of 16 kHz, voltage U<100 V, I=55 mA, and exposure time 20 min. However, at the low a.c. voltage of this treatment, more apoptotic and necrotic cells are produced as compared to the electroporation treatment with one exponentially decaying voltage pulse. Thus, additional photodynamic action appears to be more effective than solely drugs and electroporation as applied in clinical electrochemotherapy, and more effective than the noninvasive pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs), for cancer cells in general and animals bearing tumors in particular.",['2010.

A recent report by Sakuma et al. describes a second antiretroviral activity of rhesus macaque TRIM5alpha, which blocks HIV-1 production through rapid degradation of HIV-1 Gag polyproteins. Here, we find that human TRIM5alpha limits HIV-1 production. Transient expression of TRIM5alpha decreased HIV-1 production, whereas knockdown of TRIM5alpha in human cells increased virion release. A single amino acid substitution (R437C) in the SPRY domain diminished the restriction effect. Moderate levels of human wild-type TRIM5alpha and a little amount of R437C mutant were incorporated into HIV-1 virions. The R437C mutant also lost restriction activity against N-tropic murine leukemia virus infection. However, the corresponding R to C mutation in rhesus macaque TRIM5alpha had no effect on the restriction ability.

In the present study, the anticancer activity of ABP-CM4, an antibacterial peptide from Bombyx mori, against leukemic cell lines THP-1, K562 and U937 was evaluated, and the cytotoxicity compared with the effects on non-cancerous mammalian cells, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), HEK-293 and erythrocytes. ABP-CM4 reduced the number of viable cells of the leukemic cell lines after exposure for 24h. The reduction was concentration dependent, and the IC50 values ranged from 14 to 18 microM. Conversely, ABP-CM4, even at 120 microM, exhibited no cytotoxicity toward HEK-293 or PBMCs, indicating that there was no significant effect on these two types of non-cancer cells. ABP-CM4 at a concentration of 200 microM had no hemolytic activity on mammalian erythrocytes. Together, these results suggested a selective cytotoxicity in leukemia cells. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the binding activity of ABP-CM4 to leukemia cells was much higher than that to HEK-293 or PBMCs, and there was almost no binding to erythrocytes. FITC-labeled ABP-CM4 molecules were examined under a confocal microscope and found to be concentrated at the surface of leukemia cells and changes of the cell membrane were determined by a cell permeability assay, which led us to the conclusion that ABP-CM4 could act at the cell membrane for its anticancer activity on leukemia cells.

Previous crystal structures of BTB domains have revealed tightly interwound homodimers, with the N-terminus from one chain forming a two-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet with a strand from the other chain. We have solved the crystal structures of the BTB domains from Fanconi anemia zinc finger (FAZF) and Miz1 (Myc-interacting zinc finger 1) to resolutions of 2.0 A and 2.6 A, respectively. Unlike previous examples of BTB domain structures, the FAZF BTB domain is a nonswapped dimer, with each N-terminal beta-strand associated with its own chain. As a result, the dimerization interface in the FAZF BTB domain is about half as large as in the domain-swapped dimers. The Miz1 BTB domain resembles a typical swapped BTB dimer, although it has a shorter N-terminus that is not able to form the interchain sheet. Using cysteine cross-linking, we confirmed that the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) BTB dimer is strand exchanged in solution, while the FAZF BTB dimer is not. A phylogenic tree of the BTB fold based on both sequence and structural features shows that the common ancestor of the BTB domain in BTB-ZF (bric a brac, tramtrack, broad-complex zinc finger) proteins was a domain-swapped dimer. The differences in the N-termini seen in the FAZF and Miz1 BTB domains appear to be more recent developments in the structural evolution of the domain.",['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The diagnosis of ALL was initially suspected, because of the hyperleukocytosis observed on presentation, then confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry study of the peripheral blood. Furthermore, detection of the BCR/ABL Philadelphia translocation t(9:22)(q34:q11) in this leukemic patient by fluorescent in situ hybridization permitted targeted therapy of the blast crisis with imatinib (Gleevec).

Cecropin A, a linear 37-residue antimicrobial polypeptide produced by the cecropia moth, has exhibited cytotoxicity in various human cancer cell lines and inhibitory effects on tumor growth. In this study, we investigated the apoptosis induced by cecropin A in the promyelocytic cell line HL-60. Treatment of cells with cecropin A was characterized by loss of viability in a dose-dependent manner, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and modest attenuation of lysosomal integrity measured by neutral red assay. An increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization were quantified following cecropin A exposure at a concentration of 30 microM, whereas cecropin A-induced apoptosis was independent of caspase family members, because the activity of caspase-8 and -9 were irrelevant. Nevertheless, caspase-3 activity showed a significant increase at concentrations of 20-40 microM, but a considerable reduction at 50 microM. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), and the accumulation of cells at sub-G1 phase measured by FACS analysis of propidium iodide (PI) stained nuclei suggested induction of apoptosis. Morphological changes measured by Hoechst 33342 or acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining showed nuclear condensation, corroborating the apoptotic action of cecropin A.

Three most frequent repeats included in these deletions in CEBPA gene are CGCGAG (493- 498_865-870), GG (486-487_885-886), and GCCAAGCAGC (508-517_907-916), all according to GenBank Accession No. NM_004364.2.

The epigenetic changes of TSGs are recently recognized as an abnormal mechanism contributing to the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation status of DDIT3 gene in CML patients. METHODS: The methylation status of DDIT3 promoter was detected in the bone marrow mononuclear cells from 53 patients with CML using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The expression levels of DDIT3 and bcr/abl transcript were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). Clinical data of these patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The aberrant methylation of DDIT3 gene promoter was found in 35 of 53 (66%) CML cases. Correlation was not found between DDIT3 promoter hypermethylation and the age, sex, hemoglobin concentration, platelet counts, chromosomal abnormalities, bcr/abl transcript, and staging of CML patients (P > 0.05), but found between DDIT3 promoter hypermethylation and WBC counts of CML cases (R = 0.781, P < 0.001). The level of DDIT3 transcript in CML patients was significantly lower than that in controls (median 3.28 vs 19.69, P < 0.001), however, there was no difference in the level of DDIT3 transcript between methylation-positive CML cases (0.05-65.32, median 2.13) and methylation- negative CML cases (0.12-126.04, median 3.92) (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that aberrant methylation of DDIT3 occurs in CML frequently.",,"['Wang, Ya-li', 'Qian, Jun', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Yao, Dong-ming', 'Qian, Zhen', 'Zhu, Zhao-hui', 'Li, Jian-yong']","['Wang YL', 'Qian J', 'Lin J', 'Yao DM', 'Qian Z', 'Zhu ZH', 'Li JY']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100523,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2010/05/25 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/05/25 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-29-54 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-29-54 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2010 May 23;29:54. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-29-54.,,PMC2890546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total annual incidence of symptomatic individuals is estimated at 1 in 100,000 throughout the world and 1 in 10,000 people in the European Union. Three main forms have been described: thalassemia major, thalassemia intermedia and thalassemia minor. Individuals with thalassemia major usually present within the first two years of life with severe anemia, requiring regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Findings in untreated or poorly transfused individuals with thalassemia major, as seen in some developing countries, are growth retardation, pallor, jaundice, poor musculature, hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, development of masses from extramedullary hematopoiesis, and skeletal changes that result from expansion of the bone marrow. Regular transfusion therapy leads to iron overload-related complications including endocrine complication (growth retardation, failure of sexual maturation, diabetes mellitus, and insufficiency of the parathyroid, thyroid, pituitary, and less commonly, adrenal glands), dilated myocardiopathy, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis). Patients with thalassemia intermedia present later in life with moderate anemia and do not require regular transfusions. Main clinical features in these patients are hypertrophy of erythroid marrow with medullary and extramedullary hematopoiesis and its complications (osteoporosis, masses of erythropoietic tissue that primarily affect the spleen, liver, lymph nodes, chest and spine, and bone deformities and typical facial changes), gallstones, painful leg ulcers and increased predisposition to thrombosis. Thalassemia minor is clinically asymptomatic but some subjects may have moderate anemia. Beta-thalassemias are caused by point mutations or, more rarely, deletions in the beta globin gene on chromosome 11, leading to reduced (beta+) or absent (beta0) synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin (Hb). Transmission is autosomal recessive; however, dominant mutations have also been reported. Diagnosis of thalassemia is based on hematologic and molecular genetic testing. Differential diagnosis is usually straightforward but may include genetic sideroblastic anemias, congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, and other conditions with high levels of HbF (such as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and aplastic anemia). Genetic counseling is recommended and prenatal diagnosis may be offered. Treatment of thalassemia major includes regular RBC transfusions, iron chelation and management of secondary complications of iron overload. In some circumstances, spleen removal may be required. Bone marrow transplantation remains the only definitive cure currently available. Individuals with thalassemia intermedia may require splenectomy, folic acid supplementation, treatment of extramedullary erythropoietic masses and leg ulcers, prevention and therapy of thromboembolic events. Prognosis for individuals with beta-thalassemia has improved substantially in the last 20 years following recent medical advances in transfusion, iron chelation and bone marrow transplantation therapy. However, cardiac disease remains the main cause of death in patients with iron overload.",,"['Galanello, Renzo', 'Origa, Raffaella']","['Galanello R', 'Origa R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Biotecnologie- Universita di Cagliari, Ospedale Regionale, Microcitemie ASL Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy. renzo.galanello@mcweb.unica.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100521,England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,,IM,"['Genetic Counseling', 'Humans', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'beta-Thalassemia/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/genetics/therapy']",2010/05/25 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/05/25 06:00'],"['2009/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1750-1172-5-11 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-1172-5-11 [doi]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2010 May 21;5:11. doi: 10.1186/1750-1172-5-11.,,PMC2893117,,,,,,94,,,,,,,,,

When human leucocyte antigens (HLA)-sensitized patients fail to respond to HLA-matched (HLA-m) platelets, non-immune destruction may be assumed, and collections of HLA-m platelets abandoned. We report cases of highly HLA-sensitized patients whose only satisfactory platelet transfusion responses were consistently associated with products compatible for both HLA- and ABO-matched (HLA-m/ABO-m) platelets, and in whom unsatisfactory increments occurred if either form of major incompatibility was permitted (HLA-u or ABO-u). Absolute platelet increments (APIs) were measured and classified as satisfactory if >/=10 and unsatisfactory if <10. Patient 1, age 59 years, group O, with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia (MDS/AML), was unresponsive to either fresh ABO-m or HLA-m platelets. Of 17 HLA-m platelets, satisfactory responses occurred for 75% of HLA-m/ABO-m units, and failures for 100% of HLA-m/ABO-u, with mean API differing significantly (14.1 vs 1.1, P = 0.0059). Of 36 HLA-m platelets given to patient 2, age 49 years, group O, Gravida 2 Para 2, with severe aplastic anaemia, a satisfactory response occurred with 75% of HLA-m/ABO-m units, and failures for 63% of the HLA-m/ABO-u (mean API 26.7 vs 7.6, P = 0.008). Increment failures from HLA-m platelets need not imply intractable refractoriness.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the signalment, clinical complaints, and tumor location, and to evaluate utility of diagnostic tests in cattle with lymphosarcoma. ANIMALS: Adult cattle admitted to Cornell University between January 1980 and December 2008 with a definitive diagnosis of lymphosarcoma. METHODS: Retrospective case study was conducted with a search of all medical records at Cornell University for cattle diagnosed with lymphosarcoma. Categorical data were analyzed with a Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Sensitivities of diagnostic tests were calculated. RESULTS: There were 106 cows and 6 bulls (median age 5 years) examined for anorexia (34%), weight loss (16%), and fever (14%). The sensitivities of antemortem diagnostic tests performed were peripheral lymph node (PLN) wedge biopsy, 100%; surgical exploration and biopsy, 100%; pleurocentesis, 80%; pericardiocentesis, 67%; PLN fine-needle aspirate, 41%; abdominocentesis, 33%; and cerebral spinal fluid tap, 19%.

We found that low concentration of limonene (7.34 mmol/L) inhibited the production of ROS for eotaxin-stimulated HL-60 clone 15 cells. 14.68 mmol/L concentration of limonene diminished MCP-1 production via NF-kappa B activation comparable to the addition of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132.

The aims of this study were to investigate the components of this change and find contributing factors to changes in outcome. METHODS: The study method was a retrospective analysis of 213 consecutive first unrelated donor HCT for acute myeloid leukaemia performed within Australia for adult patients during the years of 1992-1997 (n= 43) and 1998-2005 (n= 170). RESULTS: The proportion of patients transplanted in first or second complete remission (CR) increased markedly from 21% in 1992-1997 to 52% in 1998-2005. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 year post HCT was significantly lower for the later cohort (22% vs 30%, P= 0.04) and for patients transplanted in CR compared with those not in CR (16% vs 31%, P= 0.01). The overall survival probability was significantly better at 5 years post HCT for patients transplanted in 1998-2005 compared with 1992-1997 (40% vs 21%, P= 0.04). Multivariate analysis identified five independent significant favourable factors for survival among the whole patient group: age under 40 years, transplant in CR1, CR2 or first relapse, patient CMV seronegativity, good performance status and year of transplant within 1998-2005. CONCLUSION: The later cohort of patients had improved survival even after allowing for the effects of age, remission status and other factors, which suggests a general improvement in the safety of the procedure over time, particularly for patients in early disease stages at transplant.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Comprehensive approaches including mouse genetics, prospective identification of CML stem cells, and syngenic transplantation techniques have identified several key molecules or signaling pathways, including hedgehog (Hh)/Smo, promyelocytic leukemia (PML), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), and forkhead box class O (FOXO), that function in CML stem cell maintenance. Inhibiting some of these factors in combination with TKI administration successfully antagonized resistance of CML stem cells to TKI therapy, resulting in efficient eradication of leukemia cells in vivo. Thus, development of methods that sensitize CML stem cells to TKI therapy may lead to novel therapies to treat CML patients.",,"['Naka, Kazuhito', 'Hoshii, Takayuki', 'Hirao, Atsushi']","['Naka K', 'Hoshii T', 'Hirao A']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Center for Cancer and Stem Cell Research, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100405,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'beta Catenin/drug effects/physiology']",2010/05/25 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/05/25 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1584 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01584.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Jul;101(7):1577-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01584.x.

Recent studies supposed that osteogenic differentiation of DFCs is controlled by growth factors such as BMP2 and IGF2, but their influence on the differentiation of DFCs has not been investigated in detail. We examined DFCs after the induction of osteogenic differentiation with BMP2, IGF2 and a standard osteogenic differentiation medium (ODM) with dexamethasone. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the calcium accumulation demonstrated osteogenic differentiation after all treatments, but with the most effective differentiation by ODM. Interestingly, markers of the process of osteoblast differentiation were much higher up-regulated in BMP2- or IGF2-treated cells than in ODM-treated cells. To evaluate the reason of these differences, we compared genome-wide expression profiles at an early stage of differentiation. Chondroblast markers in BMP2-differentiated cells and general markers for cell differentiation/proliferation in IGF2-treated cells were significantly regulated. However, ODM-treated DFCs expressed late markers of osteogenic-differentiated DFCs such as the transcription factor ZBTB16 that is not expressed in BMP2- or IGF2-differentiated cells. Importantly, although the BMP-antagonist noggin (NOG) diminishes the phosphorylation of SMAD1 in DFCs, it did not inhibit osteogenic differentiation by ODM and the expression of ZBTB16. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that osteogenic differentiation of DFCs can be stimulated with all tested inducers but also independently of BMP signaling. To evaluate this mechanism, the transcription factor ZBTB16 is a target for further investigations.",,"['Saugspier, Michael', 'Felthaus, Oliver', 'Viale-Bouroncle, Sandra', 'Driemel, Oliver', 'Reichert, Torsten E', 'Schmalz, Gottfried', 'Morsczeck, Christian']","['Saugspier M', 'Felthaus O', 'Viale-Bouroncle S', 'Driemel O', 'Reichert TE', 'Schmalz G', 'Morsczeck C']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (IGF2 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dental Sac/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/pharmacology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/05/25 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2010/05/25 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2010.0027 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2010 May;19(5):707-17. doi: 10.1089/scd.2010.0027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of NK cell-based immunotherapy to current treatment options in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) requires NK cell products with high anti-leukemic efficacy optimized for clinical use. METHODS: We describe a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant protocol of large-scale ex vivo expansion of alloreactive NK cells suitable for multiple donor lymphocyte infusions (NK-DLI) in AML. CliniMACS-purified NK cells were cultured in closed air-permeable culture bags with certified culture medium and components approved for human use [human serum, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-15 and anti-CD3 antibody] and with autologous irradiated feeder cells. RESULTS: NK cells (6.0 +/- 1.2 x 10(8)) were purified from leukaphereses (8.1 +/- 0.8 L) of six healthy donors and cultured under GMP conditions. NK cell numbers increased 117.0 +/- 20.0-fold in 19 days. To reduce the culture volume associated with expansion of bulk NK cells and to expand selectively the alloreactive NK cell subsets, GMP-certified cell sorting was introduced to obtain cells with single killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) specificities.

The aim of this study is to describe and interpret the trends in relative survival and excess mortality in the five Nordic populations among these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the NORDCAN database 1964-2003, we estimated age-standardised incidence and mortality rates, 5-year relative survival, and excess mortality rates for varying follow-up periods, and age-specific 5-year relative survival by country, sex, and 5-year diagnostic period. RESULTS: Taking into account classification and registration problems in the earlier periods, the patterns of incidence, mortality, and survival are fairly similar between the countries within each cancer form studied. High 5-year relative survival ratios of over 80% were seen in the most recent period 1999-2003 for Hodgkin lymphoma, between 50 and 60% for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 38-49% for acute leukaemia and 60-73% for other leukaemia. The variations were between 28 and 41% for multiple myeloma. Danish patients diagnosed with these malignancies tend to fare slightly worse than their Nordic neighbours, with excess mortality rates marginally higher one to three months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although the recent trends and absolute levels of incidence, mortality and survival for the lympho-haematopoietic malignancies are similar, the consistently lower survival of Danish patients--irrespective of type of malignancy--points to an impact of co-morbidity related lifestyle factors, which may negatively affect the chemotherapy and radiation offered as standard treatments for these diseases.",,"['Storm, Hans H', 'Klint, Asa', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Gislum, Mette', 'Engholm, Gerda', 'Bray, Freddie', 'Hakulinen, Timo']","['Storm HH', 'Klint A', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Gislum M', 'Engholm G', 'Bray F', 'Hakulinen T']","['Department of Cancer Prevention and Documentation, Danish Cancer Society, Strandboulevarden 49, Copenhagen, Denmark. hans@cancer.dk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/virology', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2010/05/25 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2010/05/25 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/02841861003631495 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2010 Jun;49(5):694-712. doi: 10.3109/02841861003631495.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These anti-leukemic and anti-inflammatory activities may be mediated by anti-angiogenic action. To investigate the anti-angiogenic activity of indirubin, we tested its inhibitory effect on blood vessel formation in zebrafish embryos and on endothelial cell proliferation in culture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-angiogenic activity of indirubin was tested using transgenic zebrafish embryos with fluorescent vasculature and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Apoptosis was analyzed with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. RESULTS: Indirubin dose-dependently inhibited intersegmental vessel formation in zebrafish embryos. It also inhibited HUVEC proliferation by the induction of cellular apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-angiogenic activity of indirubin may partly contribute to its anti-leukemic and anti-psoriatic properties and may be valuable for the treatment of diseases with excessive angiogenesis.

We investigated the role of different signaling pathways triggered by CCR7 engagement by its ligands, the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, in the control of CLL migration and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemotaxis and apoptosis assays were performed in the presence of pharmacologic inhibitors and genetic mutants of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), Rho guanosine triphosphatase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades to assess the role of these pathways on primary CLL migration and survival in response to CCR7 activation. Kinase activation was determined by immunoblotting and pull-down experiments. RESULTS: CLL chemotactic activity induced by CCL19 or CCL21 was markedly reduced by inhibitors of PI3K and the Rho effector molecule Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinases (ROCK), and also by the expression of dominant negative forms of PI3K and RhoA, whereas constitutively activated PI3K and RhoA mutants strongly promoted CLL migration. In contrast, MAPKs were not significantly involved in CLL migration to CCL19/CCL21. Conversely, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, along with PI3K, had a role in CCR7-mediated CLL cell survival. Biochemical experiments confirmed that CCL19/21 induced PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B, activation of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinases/myosin light chain pathway and MAPKs phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: The role of PI3K, Rho guanosine triphosphatases, and MAPKs in CCR7-mediated CLL cells migration and survival suggests that these signal transduction pathways could represent promising targets for CLL therapy.",,"['Cuesta-Mateos, Carlos', 'Lopez-Giral, Sonia', 'Alfonso-Perez, Manuel', 'de Soria, Valle Gomez Garcia', 'Loscertales, Javier', 'Guasch-Vidal, Sara', 'Beltran, Amada Elia', 'Zapata, Juan M', 'Munoz-Calleja, Cecilia']","['Cuesta-Mateos C', 'Lopez-Giral S', 'Alfonso-Perez M', 'de Soria VG', 'Loscertales J', 'Guasch-Vidal S', 'Beltran AE', 'Zapata JM', 'Munoz-Calleja C']","['Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100519,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CCL19 protein, human)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '124671-05-2 (RHOA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL19/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemokine CCL21/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Chemotaxis', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR7/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein']",2010/05/22 06:00,2010/09/11 06:00,['2010/05/22 06:00'],"['2009/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00191-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,"Exp Hematol. 2010 Sep;38(9):756-64, 764.e1-4. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.05.003.

The ED-50 for the non-malignant HEK-293 and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was 63.4 and 60.7 microM, respectively. The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of ODPC was 200 microM. Dynamic light scattering indicated that dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposome size was affected only above the CMC of ODPC. Differential calorimetric scanning (DCS) of liposomes indicated a critical transition temperature (T(c)) of 41.5 degrees C and an enthalpy (H) variation of 7.3 kcal mol(-1). The presence of 25 microM ODPC decreased T(c) and H to 39.3 degrees C and 4.7 kcal mol(-1), respectively. ODPC at 250 microM destabilized the liposomes (36.3 degrees C, 0.46 kcal mol(-1)). Kinetics of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) leakage from different liposome systems indicated that the rate and extent of CF release depended on liposome composition and ODPC concentration and that above the CMC it was instantaneous.

Although fludarabine is the standard first line therapy to treat CLL, only few data are available about the resistance of B cells to this purine nucleoside analog in vivo. Here we sought to increase our understanding of fludarabine action and describe the mechanisms leading to resistance in vivo. We performed an analysis of genomic aberrations, gene expression profiles, and microRNAs expression in CLL blood B lymphocytes isolated during the course of patients' treatment with fludarabine. RESULTS: In sensitive patients, the differentially expressed genes we identified were mainly involved in p53 signaling, DNA damage response, cell cycle and cell death. In resistant patients, uncommon genomic abnormalities were observed and the resistance toward fludarabine could be characterized based on the expression profiles of genes implicated in lymphocyte proliferation, DNA repair, and cell growth and survival. Of particular interest in some patients was the amplification of MYC (8q) observed both at the gene and transcript levels, together with alterations of myc-transcriptional targets, including genes and miRNAs involved in the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation. Differential expression of the sulfatase SULF2 and of miR-29a, -181a, and -221 was also observed between resistant and sensitive patients before treatment. These observations were further confirmed on a validation cohort of CLL patients treated with fludarabine in vitro. CONCLUSION: In the present study we identified genes and miRNAs that may predict clinical resistance of CLL to fludarabine, and describe an interesting oncogenic mechanism in CLL patients resistant to fludarabine by which the complete MYC-specific regulatory network was altered (DNA and RNA levels, and transcriptional targets). These results should prove useful for understanding and overcoming refractoriness to fludarabine and also for predicting the clinical outcome of CLL patients before or early during their treatment.",,"['Moussay, Etienne', 'Palissot, Valerie', 'Vallar, Laurent', 'Poirel, Helene A', 'Wenner, Thomas', 'El Khoury, Victoria', 'Aouali, Nassera', 'Van Moer, Kris', 'Leners, Bernadette', 'Bernardin, Francois', 'Muller, Arnaud', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Delmer, Alain', 'Duhem, Caroline', 'Ries, Fernand', 'van Dyck, Eric', 'Berchem, Guy']","['Moussay E', 'Palissot V', 'Vallar L', 'Poirel HA', 'Wenner T', 'El Khoury V', 'Aouali N', 'Van Moer K', 'Leners B', 'Bernardin F', 'Muller A', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Delmer A', 'Duhem C', 'Ries F', 'van Dyck E', 'Berchem G']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, CRP-Sante, Luxembourg, Luxembourg. etienne.moussay@crp-sante.lu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100520,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2010/05/22 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/05/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-115 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-115 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 May 20;9:115. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-115.,,PMC2881880,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By chromosomal translocations ETO and MTG16 become parts of fusion proteins characteristic of morphological variants of acute myeloid leukemia. Normal functions of ETO homologues have as yet not been examined. The goal of this work was to identify structural and functional promoter elements upstream of the coding sequence of the ETO gene in order to explore lineage-specific hematopoietic expression and get hints to function. RESULTS: A putative proximal ETO promoter was identified within 411 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Strong ETO promoter activity was specifically observed upon transfection of a promoter reporter construct into erythroid/megakaryocytic cells, which have endogeneous ETO gene activity. An evolutionary conserved region of 228 bp revealed potential cis-elements involved in transcription of ETO. Disruption of the evolutionary conserved GATA -636 consensus binding site repressed transactivation and disruption of the ETS1 -705 consensus binding site enhanced activity of the ETO promoter. The promoter was stimulated by overexpression of GATA-1 into erythroid/megakaryocytic cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with erythroid/megakaryocytic cells showed specific binding of GATA-1 to the GATA -636 site. Furthermore, results from chromatin immunoprecipitation showed GATA-1 binding in vivo to the conserved region of the ETO promoter containing the -636 site. The results suggest that the GATA -636 site may have a role in activation of the ETO gene activity in cells with erythroid/megakaryocytic potential. Leukemia associated AML1-ETO strongly suppressed an ETO promoter reporter in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells.

METHODS: A murine leukaemia cell line (L1210) was grown in vitro and supplemented with MTBITC (2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 microm) for 48 h. Cell growth was evaluated by the MTT assay. The chemopreventive role of MTBITC on the cytotoxic effect of zearalenone in a Balb/c mice keratinocyte cell line (C5-O) was also evaluated. Apoptosis and lipid peroxidation were assessed, as well as the expression of genes involved following zearalenone treatment alone or in combination with MTBITC. KEY FINDINGS: MTBITC showed a significant ability to inhibit nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by superoxide radicals in a non-enzymatic superoxide generating system, to scavenge free radicals and to cause a decrease in L1210 cell growth. The C5-O cells treated with zearalenone alone showed a high frequency of apoptotic cells and lipid peroxidation, typical of oxidative stress generated by zearalenone. The cotreatment with MTBITC reduced the cytotoxicity of zearalenone and the subsequent gene expression analysis demonstrated that MTBITC decreased the expression of caspase 8, implicated in the physiological mechanism to eliminate injured or abnormal cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MTBITC was able to inhibit L1210 cell growth and counteract the zearalenone oxidative stress to C5-O cells through caspase 8 inhibition of apoptosis.",,"['Salah-Abbes, Jalila Ben', 'Abbes, Samir', 'Abdel-Wahhab, Mosaad A', 'Oueslati, Ridha']","['Salah-Abbes JB', 'Abbes S', 'Abdel-Wahhab MA', 'Oueslati R']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Environmental Microbiology and Cancerology, Faculty of Sciences Bizerte, Zarzouna, Tunisia. jalila.bensalah@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate)', '0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Picrates)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5W827M159J (Zearalenone)', 'DFD3H4VGDH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimutagenic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Free Radical Scavengers/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Free Radicals/chemistry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Isothiocyanates/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Keratinocytes/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Picrates/chemistry', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Raphanus/*chemistry', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Superoxides/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tunisia', 'Xanthine Oxidase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Zearalenone/*toxicity']",2010/05/22 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/05/22 06:00'],"['2010/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['JPHP231 [pii]', '10.1211/jpp.62.02.0011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2010 Feb;62(2):231-9. doi: 10.1211/jpp.62.02.0011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The appropriate QSAR models for the toxicity data were obtained separately employing partial least squares (PLS) regression combined with genetic algorithms (GA), as a variable selection method. The resulting QSAR models were used to identify molecular fragments of phenol derivatives whose electronic properties contribute significantly to the observed toxicities. Using this information, it was feasible to discriminate between the mechanisms of action of phenol toxicity to the studied strains. It was found that toxicities of phenols to all strains, except with L1210 Leukemia, are significantly affected by electronic features of the phenolic hydroxyl group (C-O-H).

We investigated the effect of a mistletoe extract on PBMC with and without concomitant treatment with cyclophosphamide and compared mitochondrial activity and replication of normal PBMC with that of a T-cell leukemia cell line. DESIGN: The experiments were performed with PBMC of healthy blood donors and the T-cell leukemia Jurkat cell line. Cells were pre-incubated with mistletoe extract for 60 to 65 hours. 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-hpc, precursor of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide) was added for 2 hours, after which mitochondrial activity and replication were measured. All experiments were randomized and blinded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cell mitochondrial activity and replication were assessed with spectrophotometric analysis of WST-1 reduction and BrdU incorporation. RESULTS: The application of 4-hpc consistently reduced mitochondrial activity and replication of PBMC and Jurkat cells. Mistletoe extract strongly enhanced PBMC mitochondrial activity and replication (with or without 4-hpc) and partially inhibited Jurkat cell replication (with 4-hpc only). Compared to mistletoe untreated cells, enhancement ofPBMC mitochondrial activity by mistletoe extract was independent of treatment with 4-hpc, but enhancement of PBMC replication by mistletoe extract was stronger when treated with 4-hpc. CONCLUSIONS: Mistletoe extract strongly stimulated healthy PBMC but not malignant Jurkat cells. In addition, mistletoe extract seemed to partially protect healthy PBMC-but not malignant Jurkat cells-from the cytostatic effect of 4-hpc.

Although no major dog allergens were identified in MDCK 33016-PF cells, minor dog allergens might be present and cause reactions in dog-allergic individuals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the allergenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine produced in cell culture in a mediator release assay. METHODS: Rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells transfected with human IgE receptor-1 were sensitized with sera from dog-allergic adults with positive skin prick test reactions to dog extract and detectable dog dander IgE and were stimulated with serial dilutions of vaccine and dog dander extract. N-hexosaminidase release (NHR) was used as a marker of RBL cell degranulation. Western blots were performed, and UniCAP was used to measure dog-specific IgE antibody levels. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) level of dog dander IgE was 8.31 kU(A)/L (1.895-14.5 kU(A)/L) and of dog epithelium IgE was 3.19 kU(A)/L (0.835-6.27 kU(A)L). Median (range) maximum NHR (at the first 10-fold dilution) was 0% (0%-1.4%) to vaccine and 10.2% (0%-35.9%) to dog dander (P < .001). In an egg-allergic control subject, the maximum NHR to a vaccine cultured in chick embryo and containing egg protein was 10.2%. IgE antibodies in pooled sera did not bind to vaccine on immunoblots but produced strong binding to dog dander and epithelium extracts.

Differences in survival and the molecular characteristics of leukemia in infants versus older children suggest a distinct etiology, likely involving prenatal factors. PROCEDURE: We examined the association between eight categories of maternally reported congenital abnormalities (CAs) (cleft lip or palate, spina bifida or other spinal defect, large or multiple birthmarks, other chromosomal abnormalities, small head or microcephaly, rib abnormalities, urogenital abnormalities, and other) and infant leukemia in a case-control study. The study included 443 cases diagnosed at <1 year of age at a Children's Oncology Group Institution in the United States or Canada from 1996 to 2006 and 324 controls. Controls were recruited from the cases' geographic area either by random digit dialing (1999-2002) or through birth certificates (2003-2008) and were frequency-matched to cases on birth year. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression after adjustment for birth year and a measure of follow-up time to account for differences in the CA observation period. RESULTS: No statistically significant associations were observed between infant leukemia and any CA (OR = 1.2; 95% CI: 0.8-1.9), birthmarks (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.7-2.5), urogenital abnormalities (OR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.2-2.0), or other CA (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.7-2.8). Results were similar for acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia cases. Fewer than five subjects were in the remaining CA categories precluding analysis.

We prepared recombinant c-Myc and Max proteins encompassing the human-origin DNA binding and dimerization domains, and tested a chemical library of 6480 small molecules for their inhibitory effect on the in vitro formation of the c-Myc/Max/DNA complex as well as their influence on DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells. We found several hit compounds through in vitro and cell-based screening tests, and also confirmed these compounds significantly inhibited the formation of the recombinant c-Myc/Max/DNA complex in the low micromolar range. Indeed, these inhibitors effectively blocked c-Myc-associated gene expression in cancer cell line, suppressed the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells via cell cycle arrest without altering the expression level of c-Myc in the DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells. These successive results suggest that our c-Myc/Max/DNA complex inhibitors potently contribute to the suppression of the Myc-dependent proliferation of leukemia cells and to the induction of apoptosis.

In most settings, the extent of the multiplicity problem varies across the study region. For example, urban areas typically have many overlapping clusters, while rural areas have few. The spatial scan statistic does not account for these local variations in the multiplicity problem. We propose two new spatially-varying multiplicity adjustments for spatial cluster detection, one based on a nested Bonferroni adjustment and one based on local averaging.

The TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 are expressed at low levels in human umbilical cord blood cells (3-15%) and are upregulated by incubation with the cognate ligand, triggering apoptosis in 70-80% of receptor-positive cells (P<0.001). Apoptosis is not induced in hematopoietic progenitors, as determined from sustained severe combined immunodeficiency reconstituting potential and clonogenic activity. Furthermore, elimination of dead cells after incubation with TRAIL for 72 h results in a threefold enrichment in myeloid progenitors. Exposure to TRAIL in semisolid cultures showed synergistic activity of DR4 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor in recruiting lineage-negative (lin(-)) and CD34(+) progenitors and in promoting the formation of large colonies. In murine bone marrow, approximately 30% of lin(-) cells express TRAIL-R2 (the only murine receptor), and the receptor is upregulated after transplantation in cycling and differentiating donor cells that home to the host marrow. However, this receptor is almost ubiquitously expressed in the most primitive (lin(-)SCA-1(+)c-kit(+)) progenitors, and stimulates the clonogenic activity of lin(-) cells (P<0.001), suggesting a tropic function after transplantation. It is concluded that TRAIL does not trigger apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitors, and upregulation of its cognate receptors under stress conditions mediates tropic signaling that supports recovery from hypoplasia.",,"['Mizrahi, K', 'Stein, J', 'Pearl-Yafe, M', 'Kaplan, O', 'Yaniv, I', 'Askenasy, N']","['Mizrahi K', 'Stein J', 'Pearl-Yafe M', 'Kaplan O', 'Yaniv I', 'Askenasy N']","[""Center for Stem Cell Research, Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100520,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fetal Blood/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism']",2010/05/21 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/05/21 06:00'],"['2010/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201097 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.97 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jul;24(7):1325-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.97.

Twenty-three MCL samples, eight cell lines and appropriate controls were screened for their miRNAs and gene expression profiles and DNA copy-number changes. MCL patients exhibit a characteristic signature that includes 117 miRNA (false discovery rate <0.05). Combined analysis of miRNAs and the gene expression profile, paired with bioinformatics target prediction (miRBase and TargetScan), revealed a series of genes and pathways potentially targeted by a small number of miRNAs, including essential pathways for lymphoma survival such as CD40, mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB. Functional validation in MCL cell lines demonstrated NF-kappaB subunit nuclear translocation to be regulated by the expression of miR-26a. The expression of 12 selected miRNAs was studied by quantitative PCR in an additional series of 54 MCL cases. Univariate analysis identified a single miRNA, miR-20b, whose lack of expression distinguished cases with a survival probability of 56% at 60 months.

Estimates for patients in the United States in earlier time periods were compared with that of Philippine residents to estimate delay in achievements of comparable levels of survival. RESULTS: Childhood leukaemia and lymphoma relative survival was much lower in Filipinos living in the Philippines (32.9 and 47.7%) than in Asian Americans (80.1 and 90.5%) and Caucasians (81.9 and 87%). Achievement of comparable survival rates of Philippine residents lagged behind by 20 to >30 years compared with patients in the United States.

Recommendations for other vaccines state that the vaccines should be readministered several months after the completion of chemotherapy outside of the stem cell transplant setting. This is not often possible with the influenza vaccine because of its seasonal nature. To examine whether certain times during chemotherapy are more favorable for seroconversion, we examined vaccine responses in a cohort of children on chemotherapy. Pediatric patients on chemotherapy were recruited over the 2006 to 2008 influenza vaccine seasons. Sixty-eight acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 3 acute myeloid leukemia, and 18 sarcoma patients were evaluated. Clinical and laboratory features were recorded. The hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay was used to define serotype-specific responses. Seroconversion rates varied according to the type of chemotherapy during the vaccination period. In some cases, there was a late rise in titer, suggesting that a wild-type infection had occurred, leading to an estimate of vulnerability of this population. In patients with ALL, responses to the vaccine were greater when it was given early in the course of treatment. We conclude that seroconversion rates are well below the rates cited for the general population. The 3 acute myeloid leukemia patients had a particularly poor response to the vaccine.

The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of alterations in glucose metabolism and the predisposing factors of these disturbances in survivors of childhood ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 131 ALL survivors, an oral glucose tolerance test was conducted to determine beta-cell function/insulin sensitivity. The particular risk factors were analyzed and 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms of diabetic predisposing genes: PAX4 and TCF7L2 were genotyped to evaluate the association between these factors and beta-cell function/insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Ten out of 131 survivors (7.6%) had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) whereas 40 out of 131 (30.5%) had insulin resistance (IR) and showed characteristics of the metabolic syndrome (hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-C). In the logistic regression analysis, the most important factor predicting IGT and IR was older age of survivors (P=0.014 and P<0.001, respectively) whereas the PAX4 R192H mutation (rs2233580) was significantly associated with IGT after adjustment for age (P=0.043) (adjusted OR 5.28, 95% CI 1.06-26.40). CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence suggests that older age is an independent risk factor for developing IGT and IR in childhood ALL survivors, emphasizing the need for life-long metabolic screening. The PAX4 variant might impact individual susceptibility against IGT and diabetes.

We identified 280 potential targets of aberrant DNA methylation in CLL. These genes were located more frequently in chromosomes 19 (16%, p=0.001), 16 (11%, p=0.001), 17 (10%, p=0.02) and 11 (9%, p=0.02) and could be grouped in several functional networks. Methylation status was confirmed for 22 of these genes (SOX11, DLX1, FAM62C, SOX14, RSPO1, ADCY5, HAND2,SPOCK, MLL, ING1, PRIMA1, BCL11B, LTBP2, BNC1, NR2F2, SALL1, GALGT2, LHX1, DLX4, KLK10, TFAP2 and APP) in 78 CLL patients by pyrosequencing. As a proof of principle, we analyzed the expression of 2 genes, PRIMA1 and APP, in primary cells and of GALGT2, TFAP2C and PRIMA1 in leukemia cells. There was an inverse association between methylation and gene expression. This could be reversed by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in cell lines. Treatment in a clinical trial with 5-azacitidine resulted in decreased methylation of LINE, DLX4 and SALL1 in the peripheral blood B-cells of patients with CLL. IgVH mutational status or ZAP-70 expression were not associated with specific methylation profiles. By multivariate analysis, methylation of LINE and APP was associated with shorter overall survival (p = 0.045 and 0.0035, respectively).

Here, we examined the expression of BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL1 in primary human hematopoietic subsets and leukemic blasts from AML patients and found that MCL1 transcripts were consistently expressed at high levels in all samples tested. Consistent with this, Mcl1 protein was also highly expressed in myeloid leukemic blasts in a mouse Myc-induced model of AML. We used this model to test the hypothesis that Mcl1 facilitates AML development by allowing myeloid progenitor cells to evade Myc-induced cell death. Indeed, activation of Myc for 7 days in vivo substantially increased myeloid lineage cell numbers, whereas hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and B-lineage cells were depleted. Furthermore, Mcl1 haploinsufficiency abrogated AML development. In addition, deletion of a single allele of Mcl1 from fully transformed AML cells substantially prolonged the survival of transplanted mice. Conversely, the rapid lethality of disease was restored by coexpression of Bcl2 and Myc in Mcl1-haploinsufficient cells. Together, these data demonstrate a critical and dose-dependent role for Mcl1 in AML pathogenesis in mice and suggest that MCL1 may be a promising therapeutic target in patients with de novo AML.",,"['Xiang, Zhifu', 'Luo, Hui', 'Payton, Jacqueline E', 'Cain, Jennifer', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Tomasson, Michael H']","['Xiang Z', 'Luo H', 'Payton JE', 'Cain J', 'Ley TJ', 'Opferman JT', 'Tomasson MH']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100517,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism']",2010/05/21 06:00,2010/06/22 06:00,['2010/05/21 06:00'],"['2009/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['39964 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI39964 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2010 Jun;120(6):2109-18. doi: 10.1172/JCI39964.

Foxa2 has been shown to be expressed specifically in the glandular epithelium of the murine uterus. To study the uterine function of Foxa2, this gene was conditionally ablated in the mouse uterus by crossing mice with floxed Foxa2 alleles, Foxa2(loxP/loxP), with the Pgr(cre) mouse model. Pgr(cre/+) Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice showed significantly reduced fertility. Analysis of the uterus on Day 5.5 of pregnancy showed disrupted blastocyst implantation. Pgr(cre/+) Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice also showed a severe impairment of the uterus to respond to the artificial induction of the decidual response. Morphological examination of the uteri of these mice showed a severe reduction in the number of endometrial glands. The loss of endometrial glands resulted in the reduction of leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) expression. The lack of a decidual response could be partially rescued by an intrauterine injection of LIF before the initiation of the decidual response.

We found that knockdown of Daxx in a nontransformed human hepatocyte cell line using RNA interference (RNAi) techniques results in significantly increased adenoviral (Ad) replication, including enhanced viral mRNA synthesis and viral protein expression. This Daxx restriction imposed upon adenovirus growth is counteracted by early protein E1B-55K (early region 1B 55-kDa protein), a multifunctional regulator of cell-cycle-independent Ad5 replication. The viral protein binds to Daxx and induces its degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway. We show that this process is independent of Ad E4orf6 (early region 4 open reading frame 6), known to promote the proteasomal degradation of cellular p53, Mre11, DNA ligase IV, and integrin alpha3 in combination with E1B-55K.

This approach identified a clonal cell line that exhibited approximately 10-fold reduced gene expression from MLV vectors following infection despite supporting normal levels of MLV reverse transcription and integration. The defect in this cell line was specific for the MLV long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, as normal levels of reporter gene expression were obtained from both an internal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter contained within an LTR-defective MLV vector and LTR expression from an avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) vector. Complementation and shRNA knockdown experiments demonstrated that the defective gene in these cells is ZASC1 (ZNF639), a transcription factor with strong links to cancer and inherited ataxias. We demonstrated that ZASC1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein with three closely related binding sites located within the MLV LTR promoter, but it does not bind to the ASLV promoter. Mutating these putative ZASC1 binding sites significantly reduced levels of MLV gene expression. While wild-type ZASC1 activated expression from the MLV promoter, a green fluorescent protein-ZASC1 fusion protein showed dominant-negative inhibition of MLV gene expression.

GH therapy may result in poorer outcome regarding cardiovascular (CV) and particularly cardiac effects than in patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disease. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate GH therapy on CV risk, cardiac function, physical activity, and quality of life in ALL patients treated with cranial radiotherapy (18-24 Gy) and chemotherapy (anthracycline dose 120 mg/m2). DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a 5- and 8-yr open nonrandomized prospective study in a university hospital clinic. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of GH-deficient ALL patients (aged 25 yr; range 19-32 yr) and matched population controls participated. INTERVENTIONS: One ALL group (n=16) received GH for 5 yr, and the other ALL group (n=13) did not receive GH therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated the prevalence of CV risk factors and metabolic syndrome (International Diabetes Federation consensus), cardiac function (echocardiography), and quality of life and physical activity questionnaires. RESULTS: In comparison with 8 yr without, 5 yr with GH therapy resulted in significant positive changes in plasma glucose (-0.5 vs. 0.6 mmol/liter, P=0.002), apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio (-0.1 vs. 0.0, P=0.03), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (0.20 vs.-0.01 mmol/liter, P=0.008) and a significant reduction in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (P=0.008). No significant difference in the left-ventricular systolic function or in physical activity and quality of life was recorded before and after 5 or 8 yr, respectively (all P>0.3).

A fusion between the nuclear pore protein NUP98 and LEDGF/p75 has been found in human acute and chronic myeloid leukemia and association of LEDGF/p75 with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)/menin is critical for leukemic transformation. During lentiviral replication, LEDGF/p75 tethers the pre-integration complex to the host chromatin resulting in a bias of integration into active transcription units (TUs). The consensus function of LEDGF/p75 is tethering of cargos to chromatin. In this regard, we determined the LEDGF/p75 chromatin binding profile. To this purpose, we used DamID technology and focused on the highly annotated ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) regions. LEDGF/p75 primarily binds downstream of the transcription start site of active TUs in agreement with the enrichment of HIV-1 integration sites at these locations. We show that LEDGF/p75 binding is not restricted to stress response elements in the genome, and correlation analysis with more than 200 genomic features revealed an association with active chromatin markers, such as H3 and H4 acetylation, H3K4 monomethylation and RNA polymerase II binding.

Interestingly, a difference was also observed in the status of c-kit mutations according to the age of onset.

KIT-ECD versus KIT-PTD mutants were introduced into rodent Ba/F3, EML, Rat2, and human TF1 cells to investigate their biologic effect. Both ECD and PTD mutations induced constitutive receptor autophosphorylation and ligand-independent proliferation of the 3 hematopoietic cells. Unlike ECD mutants, PTD mutants enhanced cluster formation and up-regulated several mast cell-related antigens in Ba/F3 cells. PTD mutants failed to support colony formation and erythropoietin-mediated erythroid differentiation. ECD and PTD mutants also displayed distinct whole-genome transcriptional profiles in EML cells. We observed differences in their signaling properties: they both activated STAT, whereas AKT was only activated by ECD mutants. Consistently, AKT inhibitor suppressed ECD mutant-dependent proliferation, clonogenicity, and erythroid differentiation. Expression of myristoylated AKT restored erythroid differentiation in EML-PTD cells, suggesting the differential role of AKT in those mutants.

We report herein mechanistic details concerning the role of these transcription factors in human peripheral blood Th2 cell development. Silencing c-Myb in normal human naive CD4(+) cells under Th2 cell-promoting conditions blocked up-regulation of GATA-3 and interleukin-4, and in effector/memory CD4(+) T cells, decreased expression of GATA-3 and Th2 cytokines. In primary T cells, c-Myb allows GATA-3 to autoactivate its own expression, an event that requires the direct interaction of c-Myb and GATA-3 on their respective binding sites in promoter of GATA-3. Immunoprecipitation revealed that the c-Myb/GATA-3 complex contained Menin and mixed lineage leukemia (MLL). MLL recruitment into the c-Myb-GATA-3-Menin complex was associated with the formation Th2 memory cells. That MLL-driven epigenetic changes were mechanistically important for this transition was suggested by the fact that silencing c-Myb significantly decreased the methylation of histone H3K4 and the acetylation of histone H3K9 at the GATA-3 locus in developing Th2 and CD4(+) effector/memory cells.

Furthermore, these cells are positively selected following TCR interactions with glycolipid/CD1d complexes expressed on CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Whereas conventional T cell development can proceed with as few as 4/10 CD3 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), little is known about the ITAM requirements for iNKT cell selection and expansion. We analyzed iNKT cell development in CD3 zeta transgenic lines with various tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions (YF) that eliminated the functions of the first (YF1,2), third (YF5,6), or all three (YF1-6) CD3 zeta ITAMs. iNKT cell numbers were significantly reduced in the thymus, spleen, and liver of all YF mice compared with wild type mice. The reduced numbers of iNKT cells resulted from significant reductions in the expression of the early growth response 2 and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger transcription factors. In the mice with few to no iNKT cells, there was no difference in the severity of Lyme arthritis compared with wild type controls, following infections with the spirochete B. burgdorferi.

Bcr-Abl-T315I is the notorious point mutation that causes resistance to imatinib and the second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, leading to poor prognosis. CML blasts have constitutive p65 (RelA NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity, and NF-kappaB may be a potential target for molecular therapies in CML that may also be effective against CML cells with Bcr-Abl-T315I. RESULTS: In this report, we discovered that pristimerin, a quinonemethide triterpenoid isolated from Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae, inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in CML cells, including the cells harboring Bcr-Abl-T315I mutation. Additionally, pristimerin inhibited the growth of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl-T315I xenografts in nude mice. Pristimerin blocked the TNFalpha-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, translocation of p65, and expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes. Pristimerin inhibited two steps in NF-kappaB signaling: TAK1TauIKK and IKKTauIkappaBalpha. Pristimerin potently inhibited two pairs of CML cell lines (KBM5 versus KBM5-T315I, 32D-Bcr-Abl versus 32D-Bcr-Abl-T315I) and primary cells from a CML patient with acquired resistance to imatinib. The mRNA and protein levels of Bcr-Abl in imatinib-sensitive (KBM5) or imatinib-resistant (KBM5-T315I) CML cells were reduced after pristimerin treatment. Further, inactivation of Bcr-Abl by imatinib pretreatment did not abrogate the TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation while silencing p65 by siRNA did not affect the levels of Bcr-Abl, both results together indicating that NF-kappaB inactivation and Bcr-Abl inhibition may be parallel independent pathways. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that pristimerin is effective in vitro and in vivo against CML cells, including those with the T315I mutation. The mechanisms may involve inhibition of NF-kappaB and Bcr-Abl. We concluded that pristimerin could be a lead compound for further drug development to overcome imatinib resistance in CML patients.",,"['Lu, Zhongzheng', 'Jin, Yanli', 'Chen, Chun', 'Li, Juan', 'Cao, Qi', 'Pan, Jingxuan']","['Lu Z', 'Jin Y', 'Chen C', 'Li J', 'Cao Q', 'Pan J']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100519,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'L8GG98663L (celastrol)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",2010/05/21 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/05/21 06:00'],"['2010/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-112 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-112 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 May 19;9:112. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-112.,,PMC2893099,,,,,['Mol Cancer. 2021 Dec 31;20(1):172.

To date, no utility (preference) studies from the general public or patient perspective have been conducted in CLL. The objective of this study was to measure preferences for health states associated with CLL treatment. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 89 members of the general population in the UK (England and Scotland). Using standard gamble, each participant valued four health states describing response status, six describing treatment-related toxicities based on Common Toxicity Criteria, and two describing line of treatment. The health states incorporated standardized descriptions of treatment response (symptoms have ""improved,"" ""stabilized,"" or ""gotten worse""), swollen glands, impact on daily activities, fatigue, appetite, and night sweats. Utility estimates ranged from 0.0, reflecting dead, to 1.0, reflecting full health. RESULTS: Complete response (CR) was the most preferred health state (mean utility, 0.91), followed by partial response (PR), 0.84; no change (NC), 0.78; and progressive disease (PD), 0.68. Among the toxicity states, grade I/II nausea and nausea/vomiting had the smallest utility decrements (both were -0.05), and grade III/IV pneumonia had the greatest decrement (-0.20). The utility decrements obtained for toxicity states can be subtracted from utilities for CR, PR, NC, and PD, as appropriate. The utilities for second- and third-line treatments, which are attempted when symptoms worsen, were 0.71 and 0.65, respectively. No significant differences in utilities were observed by age, sex, or knowledge/experience with leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports UK population utilities for a universal set of CLL health states that incorporate intended treatment response and unintended toxicities. These utilities can be applied in future cost-effectiveness analyses of CLL treatment.",,"['Beusterien, Kathleen M', 'Davies, John', 'Leach, Michael', 'Meiklejohn, David', 'Grinspan, Jessica L', ""O'Toole, Alison"", 'Bramham-Jones, Steve']","['Beusterien KM', 'Davies J', 'Leach M', 'Meiklejohn D', 'Grinspan JL', ""O'Toole A"", 'Bramham-Jones S']","['Oxford Outcomes, Bethesda, MD, USA. kathy.beusterien@oxfordoutcomes.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100518,England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Quality of Life', 'Sickness Impact Profile', '*Treatment Outcome']",2010/05/21 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/05/21 06:00'],"['2009/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7525-8-50 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7525-8-50 [doi]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2010 May 18;8:50. doi: 10.1186/1477-7525-8-50.,,PMC2890699,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The case histories of 63 hemoblastosis patients with ARF who received PCT were examined. The patients were divided into 3 groups: 1) 40 patients with acute leukemia (AL); 2) 15 patients with lymphomas; 3) 8 with multiple myeloma (MM). RESULTS: The duration of lung lesion in leukemia was less than that in myeloma and lymphomas (2.5 +/- 5.3 versus 12.8 +/- 30.6 and 21 +/- 10.2 days, respectively). In the patients with leukemia and lymphomas, PCT was initiated earlier than in those with myeloma (1.5 +/- 0.5 versus 1.75 +/- 3.1 and 8.3 +/- 10.9 days, respectively). In 65.1% of the patients, PCT resulted in agranulocytosis, the rate and duration of which did not differ in the groups. APACHE II scores were 23.5 +/- 4.2; PaO2/FiO2 was 182.1 +/- 60.5. The groups did not differ in disease severity. Noninvasive ventilation was made in 22 patients. Artificial ventilation (AV) was used in 39 patients; it was successfully completed in 13 (33.3%) patients. The most common infectious complications were sepsis (60%), septic shock (27%), and bacteremia (16%). Sepsis was encountered twice more frequently in lymphomas and myeloma, and septic shock was 4 times more commonly in leukemias. In myeloma, bacteremia was seen more frequently than in leukemia (50 and 10%; p = 0.024); serum procalcitonin was > 10 ng/ml (100 and 35%); p = 0.028). In leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloma, 28-day survival was 60, 60, and 75%, respectively.

At present, the studies in celastrol's effects on HSP90's clients have focused on the kinase sub-population, while another key sub-population, nuclear transcription factors (TFs), is not being well-explored. In this study, we observe the effects of celastrol on 18 TFs (belonging to HSP90 clients) in three human cell lines: MCF-7 (breast cancer), HepG2 (hepatoma), and THP-1 (monocytic leukemia). The results show that at least half of the detectable TFs were affected by celastrol, though the effect patterns varied with cell type and dosage. Bi-directional regulations of some TFs were identified, a phenomenon not yet seen with other HSP90 inhibitors. Celastrol's capability to affect multiple TFs was consistent with its altering HSP90/TFs interactions and disrupting HSP90/Hop interaction, in addition to the reported damaging HSP90/Cdc37 interaction. This work confirms, for the first time, that celastrol has broad effects on TFs belonging to HSP90's clients, casts new light on understanding these reported actions, and suggests new possible applications for celastrol, such as diabetes management.",,"['Zhang, Denghai', 'Xu, Limin', 'Cao, Fanfan', 'Wei, Tingxuan', 'Yang, Chunxin', 'Uzan, Georges', 'Peng, Bin']","['Zhang D', 'Xu L', 'Cao F', 'Wei T', 'Yang C', 'Uzan G', 'Peng B']","['Sino-French Cooperative Central Lab, Shanghai Gongli Hospital, 207 Ju Ye Road, Pudong New District, Shanghai, 200135, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100518,Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'L8GG98663L (celastrol)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",2010/05/19 06:00,2011/02/05 06:00,['2010/05/19 06:00'],"['2010/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12192-010-0202-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010 Nov;15(6):939-46. doi: 10.1007/s12192-010-0202-1.

This retrospective analysis investigated the prognostic factors for complete remission (CR) and survival in older patients with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 847 patients older than 60 years enrolled onto three trials carried out in France between 1995 and 2005. Induction therapy consisted of idarubicin (8 mg/m(2), days 1 through 5) and cytarabine (100 mg/m(2), days 1 through 7; group I, 339 patients) or the same drugs plus lomustine (200 mg/m(2) orally on day 1; group II, 508 patients). Consolidation therapy consisted of anthracycline and cytarabine courses at lower doses, preceded or not by a first course of intermediate-dose cytarabine. RESULTS: The rate of CR was significantly higher in patients in group II compared with group I (68% v 58%; P = .002). The rate of toxic death was similar in the two groups. In multivariate analysis, two prognostic factors were linked to CR: nonadverse cytogenetic (P < .003) and addition of lomustine to induction chemotherapy (P = .002). Median overall survival was significantly improved in patients treated with lomustine (median and SE, 12.7 +/- 2.2 months v 8.7 +/- 2.7 months; P = .004). In multivariate analysis, five prognostic factors positively affected overall survival: addition of lomustine (P = .002), age < or = 69 years (P < .001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status lower than 2 (P = .002), French-American-British subgroup 1/2 (P = .02), and nonadverse cytogenetic (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Lomustine improves the rate of CR and survival in elderly patients with de novo AML when added to standard induction therapy.",,"['Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Harousseau, Jean-Luc', 'Witz, Francis', 'Sauvezie, Mathieu', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'Luquet, Isabelle', 'Hunault-Berger, Mathilde', 'Recher, Christian', 'Lioure, Bruno', 'Himberlin, Chantal', 'Escoffre-Barbe, Martine', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Lissandre, Severine', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Jourdan, Eric', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Ifrah, Norbert']","['Pigneux A', 'Harousseau JL', 'Witz F', 'Sauvezie M', 'Bene MC', 'Luquet I', 'Hunault-Berger M', 'Recher C', 'Lioure B', 'Himberlin C', 'Escoffre-Barbe M', 'Berthou C', 'Lissandre S', 'Fegueux N', 'Cahn JY', 'Jourdan E', 'Dreyfus F', 'Reiffers J', 'Milpied N', 'Ifrah N']","['Hopital du Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100517,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/05/19 06:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2010/05/19 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.26.4648 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.26.4648 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jun 20;28(18):3028-34. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.26.4648.

A phase I dose-escalation study of SNS-032 was conducted to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers of mechanism-based pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, and clinical efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Parallel cohorts of previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM) received SNS-032 as a loading dose followed by 6-hour infusion weekly for 3 weeks of each 4-week course. RESULTS: There were 19 patients with CLL and 18 with MM treated. Tumor lysis syndrome was the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for CLL, the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 75 mg/m(2), and the most frequent grade 3 to 4 toxicity was myelosuppression. One patient with CLL had more than 50% reduction in measurable disease without improvement in hematologic parameters. Another patient with low tumor burden had stable disease for four courses. For patients with MM, no DLT was observed and MTD was not identified at up to 75 mg/m(2), owing to early study closure. Two patients with MM had stable disease and one had normalization of spleen size with treatment. Biomarker analyses demonstrated mechanism-based PD activity with inhibition of Cdk7 and Cdk9, decreases in Mcl-1 and XIAP expression level, and associated CLL cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: SNS-032 demonstrated mechanism-based target modulation and limited clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with CLL and MM.

We compared outcomes of 386 patients with ATL who underwent allogeneic HSCT using different graft sources: 154 received human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related marrow or peripheral blood; 43 received HLA-mismatched related marrow or peripheral blood; 99 received unrelated marrow; 90 received single unit unrelated cord blood. After a median follow-up of 41 months (range, 1.5-102), 3-year overall survival for entire cohort was 33% (95% confidence interval, 28%-38%). Multivariable analysis revealed 4 recipient factors significantly associated with lower survival rates: older age (> 50 years), male sex, status other than complete remission, and use of unrelated cord blood compared with use of HLA-matched related grafts. Treatment-related mortality rate was higher among patients given cord blood transplants; disease-associated mortality was higher among male recipients or those given transplants not in remission. Among patients who received related transplants, donor HTLV-I seropositivity adversely affected disease-associated mortality.

Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated thereafter in vivo and, if not repaired, pose lethal impact on cell survival. This study sought to define the mechanisms by which CNDAC-induced DSBs are formed and repaired. We demonstrated that single-strand breaks induced by CNDAC incorporation into DNA were converted to DSBs when cells progressed into the subsequent S-phase. CNDAC-induced DSBs were products of replication, rather than a consequence of apoptosis. ATM, the activator of homologous recombination (HR), was essential for cell survival after CNDAC treatment in cell lines and in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples, as were the HR components, Rad51, Xrcc3, and Brca2. Furthermore, formation of sister chromatid exchanges, a hallmark of HR, increased significantly after CNDAC-treated cells had progressed into a second replication cycle. In contrast, neither the replication stress sensor ATR nor DNA-PK, the initiator of nonhomologous end-joining of DSB, was involved in repair of CNDAC-induced damage.

The purpose of this study was to identify the metabolites of flumatinib in CML patients, with the aim of determining the main metabolic pathways of flumatinib in humans after oral administration. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed 34 metabolites; 7 primary metabolites were confirmed by comparison with synthetic reference standards. The results show that the parent drug flumatinib was the main form recovered in human plasma, urine, and feces. The main metabolites of flumatinib in humans were the products of N-demethylation, N-oxidation, hydroxylation, and amide hydrolysis. In addition to these phase I metabolites, several phase II glucuronidation and acetylation products were detected in plasma, urine, and feces. The observed circulating metabolites included an N-demethylated metabolite (M1), two hydrolytic metabolites (M3, M4), oxidation metabolites (M2-1, M2-4, M2-7, M2-9, and M14), a glucuronide conjugate (M16-2), and several multiple metabolic products. Flumatinib was predominantly metabolized by amide bond cleavage to yield two corresponding hydrolytic products. By comparison with the related drug 4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl-pyrimidin-2-ylami no)-phenyl]-benzamide (imatinib), we concluded that the electron-withdrawing groups of trifluoromethyl and pyridine facilitated the amide bond cleavage and led to the in vivo formation of a carboxylic acid and an amine.",,"['Gong, Aishen', 'Chen, Xiaoyan', 'Deng, Pan', 'Zhong, Dafang']","['Gong A', 'Chen X', 'Deng P', 'Zhong D']","['Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100517,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'R4009Y24AI (HH-GV-678)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminopyridines/blood/chemistry/*metabolism/urine', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/chemistry/metabolism/urine', 'Benzamides/blood/chemistry/*metabolism/urine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/blood/chemistry/*metabolism/urine', 'Young Adult']",2010/05/19 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/05/19 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['dmd.110.032326 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.110.032326 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2010 Aug;38(8):1328-40. doi: 10.1124/dmd.110.032326.

We review the structure, nomenclature, mechanism of action, technologies used for miRNA detection, and associations of miRNAs with human cancer. miRNAs are produced in a tissue-specific manner, and changes in miRNA within a tissue type can be correlated with disease status. miRNAs appear to regulate mRNA translation and degradation via mechanisms that are dependent on the degree of complementarity between the miRNA and bead-based arrays, and quantitative real-time PCR. The tissue concentrations of specific miRNAs have been associated with tumor invasiveness, metastatic potential, and other clinical characteristics for several types of cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and breast, colorectal, hepatic, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. By targeting and controlling the expression of mRNA, miRNAs can control highly complex signal-transduction pathways and other biological pathways.

Knockin mice expressing CBF beta-SMMHC with a HABD deletion developed leukemia quickly, even though hematopoietic defects associated with Runx1-inhibition were partially rescued. A larger pool of leukemia-initiating cells, increased MN1 expression, and retention of RUNX1 phosphorylation are potential mechanisms for accelerated leukemia development in these mice.

Efforts to induce the regrowth of the peripheral neurites have had to rely on limited knowledge of the mechanisms underlying spiral ganglion neurite regeneration and have been restricted by the impracticality of undertaking large numbers of manual analyses of neurite growth responses. Here we have used dissociated cultures of postnatal mouse spiral ganglia to assess the effects of the Rho kinase inhibitor H-1152 on neurite growth and to determine the utility of automated high content analysis for evaluating neurite length from spiral ganglion neurons in vitro. In cultures of postnatal mouse spiral ganglion, greater than 95% of the neurons develop bipolar, monopolar or neurite-free morphologies in ratios dependent on whether the initial medium composition contains leukemia inhibitory factor or bone morphogenetic protein 4. Cultures under both conditions were maintained for 24 h, then exposed for 18 h to H-1152. None of the cultures exposed to H-1152 showed decreased neuronal survival or alterations in the ratios of different neuronal morphologies. However, as measured manually, the population of neurite lengths was increased in the presence of H-1152 in both types of cultures. High content analysis using the Arrayscan VTi imager and Cellomics software confirmed the rank order differences in neurite lengths among culture conditions. These data suggest the presence of an inhibitory regulatory mechanism(s) in the signaling pathway of Rho kinase that slows the growth of spiral ganglion neurites.

Here I review the evidence that variation at the 5p15.33 locus, which contains the TERT gene (encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase), might play a role in the determination of cancer risk. Mutations in the coding regions of TERT can affect telomerase activity and telomere length, and create severe clinical phenotypes, including bone marrow failure syndromes and a substantive increase in cancer frequency. Variants within the TERT gene have been associated with increased risk of haematological malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia as well as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Furthermore, there is good evidence from a number of independent genome-wide association studies to implicate variants at the 5p15.33 locus in cancer risk at several different sites: lung cancer, basal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer show strong associations, while bladder, prostate and cervical cancer and glioma also show risk alleles in this region. Thus, multiple independent lines of evidence have implicated variation in the TERT gene as a risk factor for cancer. The mechanistic basis of these risk variants is yet to be established; however, the basic biology suggests that telomere length control is a tantalising candidate mechanism underlying cancer risk.",,"['Baird, Duncan M']",['Baird DM'],"['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, CF14 4XN, UK. bairddm@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100518,England,Expert Rev Mol Med,Expert reviews in molecular medicine,100939725,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/classification/enzymology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/metabolism']",2010/05/19 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/05/19 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S146239941000147X [pii]', '10.1017/S146239941000147X [doi]']",epublish,Expert Rev Mol Med. 2010 May 18;12:e16. doi: 10.1017/S146239941000147X.,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,174,,,,,,,,,

Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) include hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura and immune neutropenia. In turn, CLL and B-cell lymphoma develop in the frame of an AID. Such reciprocal interactions suggest that similar B cells are involved in both disorders. Phenotypic features (i.e., several membrane markers) and functional characteristics of CD5(+) B cells (i.e., Epstein-Barr virus transformation and expression of apoptotic proteins) distinguish CLL and AID CD5(+) B cells from their normal counterparts. These cells produce often nonpathogenic polyspecific low-affinity autoantibodies, whereas they present the antigen to antiself B or T cells to feature pathogenic monospecific high-affinity autoantibody. The CD5 molecule itself plays a part by translocating phosphatases to the vicinity of the B-cell antigen receptor, thereby precluding transduction from the B-cell receptor.

The actual treatment of CML patients in chronic phase is the specific abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate that induces 90% of cytogenetic responses in early-phase patients. However, resistance in long-term treated patients occurs and the allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment in resistant patients. Despite recent reports outlining the role of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells as potent antileukemic effectors, the mechanisms controlling the leukemic target recognition and lysis by activated NK cells have not been well identified. The authors' experimental data obtained on appropriate cellular models identify diverse mechanisms that could explain the increased NK-cell susceptibility of Bcr/Abl targets to NK-mediated lysis. They further delineate unexpected effects of the inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity on the cross-talk between NK and CML leukemic cells.

Therefore, we examined these associations among 411,097 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. During a median follow-up of 8.5 years, 1,334 lymphomas (1,267 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 67 Hodgkin lymphomas) were identified. Consumption of red and processed meat, poultry, milk and dairy products was assessed by dietary questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate the association of the consumption of these food groups with lymphoma risk. Overall, the consumption of foods of animal origin was not associated with an increased risk of NHLS or HL, but the associations with specific subgroups of NHL entities were noted. A high intake of processed meat was associated with an increased risk of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL) [relative risk (RR) per 50 g intake = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.63], but a decreased risk of follicular lymphomas (FL) (RR = 0.58; CI 0.38-0.89).

The aim of this study was to assess the risk of cancer among a large cohort (n = 4,501,578) of black and white U.S. veterans admitted to Veterans Affairs hospitals. The cancer risk among men with diabetes (n = 594,815) was compared to the risk among men without diabetes (n = 3,906,763). Poisson regression was used to estimate adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Overall, men with diabetes had a significantly lower risk of cancer (RR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.93-0.94). Men with diabetes, however, had increased risks of cancers of the liver (RR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.82-2.09), pancreas (RR = 1.50, 95%CI = 1.42-1.59), biliary tract (RR = 1.41, 95%CI = 1.22-1.62), colon (RR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.16-1.25), rectum (RR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.07-1.18), and kidney (RR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.03-1.16), as well as leukemia (RR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.08-1.21) and melanoma (RR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.03-1.24). In contrast, men with diabetes had decreased risks of cancers of the prostate (RR = 0.89, 95%CI = 0.87-0.91), brain (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.82-0.99), buccal cavity (RR = 0.85, 95%CI = 0.82-0.89), lung (RR = 0.79, 95%CI = 0.77-0.80), esophagus (RR = 0.77, 95%CI = 0.72-0.82), and larynx (RR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.71-0.80). These findings indicate that black and white men with diabetes are at significantly lower risk of total cancer and of two of the most common cancers among U.S. males; lung and prostate cancers. These decreased risks were offset, however, by increased risks of cancer at several sites. Hyperinsulinemia may explain the increased risks of the digestive cancers, while lower testosterone levels, in the case of prostate cancer, and higher BMI, in the case of lung cancer, may explain the decreased risks of those tumors.",,"['Atchison, Elizabeth A', 'Gridley, Gloria', 'Carreon, J Daniel', 'Leitzmann, Michael F', 'McGlynn, Katherine A']","['Atchison EA', 'Gridley G', 'Carreon JD', 'Leitzmann MF', 'McGlynn KA']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blacks/statistics & numerical data', 'Body Mass Index', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Diabetes Complications/*epidemiology', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Testosterone/blood', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",2010/05/18 06:00,2011/01/15 06:00,['2010/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25362 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Feb 1;128(3):635-43. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25362.,['ZIA CP010158-09/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2962873,['NIHMS216526'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We enrolled 1583 healthy children and 1335 pediatric patients (aged from 5 to 18 years) and 325 proxies. The psychometric properties of the measure were evaluated. RESULTS: The subscales of physical functioning, social functioning and psychosocial showed alpha coefficients above 0.7 for self-report in healthy children and the total pediatric patients, and all coefficients were higher than 0.7 for proxy report for all subscales. There were higher correlations between items and hypothesized subscales than with other subscales. Healthy children reported higher scores than pediatric patients in all subscales. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that some of the indices of goodness of fit did not reach the standard of acceptable construct validity. Moderate to high correlations were found between self-reported and proxy-reported scores.

This study investigated above-mentioned issues using TRAP staining, immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting, ELISA, and Laser Confocal Scanning Microscopy techniques. We found that CaSR protein was expressed, and mainly located in the membrane and cytoplasm in differentiated THP-1 cells. Elevated extracellular calcium or GdCl(3) (an agonist of CaSR) raised intracellular calcium concentration. And this increase was inhibited or abolished by NPS2390 (an inhibitor of CaSR), U73122 (a specific inhibitor of phospholipase C, PLC) or thapsigargin (a Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor). The extracellular GdCl(3) elevation stimulated both of IL-1beta and TNFalpha release, and this effect of GdCl(3) was inhibited by NPS2390. In conclusion, CaSR is functionally expressed in differentiated THP-1 cells, and the activated CaSR contributes to intracellular calcium increment through Gq-PLC- inositol triphosphate (IP3) pathway and commits to cytokine secretion.

The caspase cascade includes a series of events leading to the activation of initiator and downstream caspases in a cell. Analysis of the caspase cascade in intact cells, however, has generally been limited as the simultaneous monitoring of upstream and downstream caspases is not well executed. In an effort to monitor the activation of caspase cascades in an intact cell, high-content cellular imaging that allows simultaneous quantitative monitoring of caspase activation has been developed. This has great significance for the exploration of various cellular caspases involved in apoptotic pathways as possible therapeutic targets in the process of drug discovery. To explore the potential of simultaneous monitoring of caspase-mediated apoptotic pathways, human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells were treated with SH-03 {(7S,7aR,13aS)-9,10-dimethoxy-3,3-dimethyl-7,7a,13,13a-tetrahydro-3H-chromeno [3,4-b]pyrano[2,3-h]chromen-7-ol} (a newly synthesized candidate), camptothecin or naringenin (agents known to induce apoptosis) with or without caspase inhibitors.

This includes upregulation of nuclear complex genes, as well as genes for cytoplasmic proteins and WNT ligands and their cognate receptors. In addition, epigenetic silencing of several negative regulators of the WNT pathway have been identified. The balance between epigenetic downregulation of negative effector genes and increased expression of positive effector genes demonstrate that the epigenetic downregulation of WNT antagonists is one mechanism, perhaps the main mechanism, that is permissive to active WNT signaling in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, constitutive activation of the WNT network and target genes is likely to impact on additional interacting signaling pathways. Based on published studies, we propose a model of WNT signaling that involves mainly permissive expression, and sometimes overexpression, of positive effectors and downregulation of negative regulators in the network.

In contrast, histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) marks developmental regulators in sperm, as in somatic cells.

Nonetheless, genes with extensive H3K27me3 coverage around transcriptional start sites in particular tend not to be expressed during male and female gametogenesis or in preimplantation embryos.

Using the current World Health Organization classification criteria, we retrospectively reviewed cases of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in which erythroid precursors were >or=50% of the bone marrow nucleated cell population and the diagnosis of erythroleukemia was considered using older classification schemes. We collected 90 cases and separated them into four diagnostic groups: acute erythroid leukemia, erythroleukemia or erythroid/myeloid type (n=20); acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (n=22); therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (n=32); and refractory anemia with excess blasts and preceding or concurrent history of erythropoietin therapy for anemia (n=16). Patients with acute erythroid leukemia were the youngest patient group and had the best overall survival. There was a statistically significant difference in overall survival between patients with acute erythroid leukemia versus acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (P=0.003) and between patients with acute erythroid leukemia versus therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (P<0.0001). The presence of complex cytogenetic abnormalities (>3) was the only statistically significant independent variable that adversely affected survival in the acute erythroid leukemia group. Monosomy 5/del(5q) and monosomy 7/del(7q) were overrepresented in the context of complex chromosomal abnormalities. Our data suggest that acute erythroid leukemia, as currently defined in the World Health Organization classification, has become a rare disease. A majority of the cases reported previously as erythroleukemia are now classified as other entities. In addition, our data suggest that the current definition of acute erythroid leukemia, erythroleukemia type remains heterogeneous.

New agents and approaches are emerging to improve mobilization efficacy while reducing duration and toxicity of mobilization. The purpose of this review is to overview clinical experience with AMD3100 (plerixafor) and its role in stem cell mobilization. RECENT FINDINGS: AMD3100 is a bicyclam molecule that selectively and reversibly antagonizes the binding of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) to its receptor CXC motif receptor-4 (CXCR4) with subsequent egress of hematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood. AMD3100 safely and rapidly mobilizes stem cells in patients with lymphoma, myeloma and healthy donors, and is synergistic in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. In addition, AMD3100 disrupts the interaction between mouse and human leukemic blasts and the bone marrow stroma, mobilizing blasts to the peripheral blood and sensitizing them to chemotherapy. SUMMARY: AMD3100 was recently FDA-approved for stem cell mobilization in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma.

Also, we will discuss recent studies addressing the impact of leukemia development on HSC regulation and normal hematopoiesis, while discussing the potential regulation of leukemia-initiating cells by bone marrow niches. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have identified new cellular and molecular components of the HSC niche and highlighted reciprocal interactions between the hematopoietic cells and their niches. These studies indicate that the HSC niche is not constituted by a single cell type but rather should be considered as a multicellular functional unit. Finally, advances have been made that provide promising insights into the the instructive role of the bone marrow microenvironment in hematological malignancies.

Successful transplantation is dependent upon efficient homing and engraftment of HSCs. Recently, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exposure, either in vivo or ex vivo, has been shown to increase engraftment. These results establish PGE2 as a regulator of hematopoietic development. RECENT FINDINGS: The underlying mechanisms of PGE2 regulation of HSC development were poorly understood until recently. Ex-vivo exposure of LSK cells to PGE2 results in increased homing efficiency of HSCs to the murine bone marrow compartment. In addition, in-vivo treatment with PGE2 preferentially expands short-term HSCs without affecting long-term HSC number and engraftment in murine bone marrow. PGE2 acts through EP4 receptors to mediate lymphoid precursor development in the zebrafish. An in-vivo interaction between PGE2 and the Wnt signaling pathways controls HSC engraftment. SUMMARY: PGE2 has a new role in HSC homing and survival, as well as short-term-HSC engraftment.

Ovarian cryopreservation is often an option for fertility preservation in cancer patients of reproductive age, specifically in minors.

Ovarian samples were fixed and prepared for light microscopy, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR. Histological studies, including immunostaining for the adhesion receptor CD99, were used to detect histopathological features. Sensitive molecular methods were used to detect translocations causing the formation of tumor-specific EWS-Friend leukemia virus integration site 1 fusion gene (EWS-FLI1). RESULTS: In seven patients, there was no evidence of EWS in the ovaries from pathological/molecular studies. However, in one patient, the RT-PCR showed the EWS translocation, although there was no pathological evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian involvement is possible in EWS.

We characterized these abnormal B-cell populations as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and report a high frequency of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in T/NK LGLL. Our findings suggest that certain pathologic factors may operate in patients with T/NK LGLL to drive low-level clonal B-cell proliferations.",,"['Howard, Matthew T', 'Bejanyan, Nelli', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Hsi, Eric D']","['Howard MT', 'Bejanyan N', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Hsi ED']","['Department of Clinical Pathology and Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/complications/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology']",2010/05/18 06:00,2010/06/02 06:00,['2010/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['133/6/936 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPIIL1Y5QXTIBP [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2010 Jun;133(6):936-41. doi: 10.1309/AJCPIIL1Y5QXTIBP.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using MDS cell lines and patient samples, we showed that the expression of an immunoinhibitory molecule, B7-H1 (CD274), was induced by interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) on MDS blasts. This induction was associated with the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and nearly completely blocked by an NF-kappaB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). B7-H1(+) MDS blasts had greater intrinsic proliferative capacity than B7-H1(-) MDS blasts when examined in various assays. Furthermore, B7-H1(+) blasts suppressed T-cell proliferation and induced T-cell apoptosis in allogeneic cocultures. When fresh bone marrow samples from patients were examined, blasts from high-risk MDS patients expressed B7-H1 molecules more often compared with those from low-risk MDS patients. Moreover, MDS T cells often overexpressed programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) molecules that transmit an inhibitory signal from B7-H1 molecules. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into MDS pathophysiology. IFNgamma and TNFalpha activate NF-kappaB that in turn induces B7-H1 expression on MDS blasts. B7-H1(+) MDS blasts have an intrinsic proliferative advantage and induce T-cell suppression, which may be associated with disease progression in MDS.",,"['Kondo, Asaka', 'Yamashita, Taishi', 'Tamura, Hideto', 'Zhao, Wanhong', 'Tsuji, Takashi', 'Shimizu, Masumi', 'Shinya, Eiji', 'Takahashi, Hidemi', 'Tamada, Koji', 'Chen, Lieping', 'Dan, Kazuo', 'Ogata, Kiyoyuki']","['Kondo A', 'Yamashita T', 'Tamura H', 'Zhao W', 'Tsuji T', 'Shimizu M', 'Shinya E', 'Takahashi H', 'Tamada K', 'Chen L', 'Dan K', 'Ogata K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100514,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'B7-H1 Antigen', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2010/05/18 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34616-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-12-255125 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Aug 19;116(7):1124-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-12-255125.

Monotherapy antivascular strategies such as targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has limited efficacy in treating AML. Thus, in search of a multitarget antivascular treatment strategy for AML, we tested a novel vascular disrupting agent, OXi4503, alone and in combination with the anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab. Using xenotransplant animal models, OXi4503 treatment of human AML chloromas led to vascular disruption in leukemia cores that displayed increased leukemia cell apoptosis. However, viable rims of leukemia cells remained and were richly vascular with increased VEGF-A expression. To target this peripheral reactive angiogenesis, bevacizumab was combined with OXi4503 and abrogated viable vascular rims, thereby leading to enhanced leukemia regression. In a systemic model of primary human AML, OXi4503 regressed leukemia engraftment alone and in combination with bevacizumab. Differences in blood vessel density alone could not account for the observed regression, suggesting that OXi4503 also exhibited direct cytotoxic effects on leukemia cells. In vitro analyses confirmed this targeted effect, which was mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species and resulted in apoptosis. Together, these data show that OXi4503 alone is capable of regressing AML by a multitargeted mechanism and that the addition of bevacizumab mitigates reactive angiogenesis.",,"['Madlambayan, Gerard J', 'Meacham, Amy M', 'Hosaka, Koji', 'Mir, Saad', 'Jorgensen, Marda', 'Scott, Edward W', 'Siemann, Dietmar W', 'Cogle, Christopher R']","['Madlambayan GJ', 'Meacham AM', 'Hosaka K', 'Mir S', 'Jorgensen M', 'Scott EW', 'Siemann DW', 'Cogle CR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100514,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Diphosphates)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Oxi 4503)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis', 'Bevacizumab', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Diphosphates/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*prevention & control', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Stilbenes/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/05/18 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)33066-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-230474 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 2;116(9):1539-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-230474.

Ingenol 3-angelate (PEP005) activates a broad range of PKC isoforms and induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells by activating the PKC isoform PKCdelta. We show here that, in contrast to its effect on leukemic cells, PEP005 provides a strong survival signal to resting and activated human T cells. The antiapoptotic effect depends upon the activation of PKC. This PKC isoform is expressed in T cells but is absent in myeloid cells. Further studies of the mechanism involved in this process showed that PEP005 inhibited activated CD8(+) T cell apoptosis through the activation of NFkappaB downstream of PKC, leading to increased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L). Transfection of CD8(+) T cells with dominant-negative PKC diminished the prosurvival effect of PEP005 significantly. Ectopic expression of PKC in the acute myeloid leukemia cell line NB4 turned their response to PEP005 from an increased to decreased rate of apoptosis. Therefore, in contrast to myeloid leukemia cells, PEP005 provides a strong survival signal to T cells, and the expression of functional PKC influences whether PKC activation leads to an anti- or proapoptotic outcome in the cell types tested.",,"['Lee, Wing-Yiu', 'Hampson, Peter', 'Coulthard, Lydia', 'Ali, Farrah', 'Salmon, Mike', 'Lord, Janet M', 'Scheel-Toellner, Dagmar']","['Lee WY', 'Hampson P', 'Coulthard L', 'Ali F', 'Salmon M', 'Lord JM', 'Scheel-Toellner D']","['Medical Research Council, Centre for Immune Regulation, Institute for Biomedical Research, School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100514,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (3-ingenyl angelate)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/chemistry']",2010/05/18 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)61855-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.041962 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jul 30;285(31):23889-98. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.041962.

Its oncogenic role is known only in lymphoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and malignant gliomas. The functional expression of LRF in human breast carcinoma has not yet been confirmed. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the expression of LRF in human breast cancer tissues and other human tumors. The expression of LRF mRNA transcripts and protein was observed in twenty human benign and malignant breast biopsy tissues. Expression of LRF was observed in several formalin-fixed tissues by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. All malignant breast tissues expressed mRNA transcripts and protein for LRF. However, 40% and 15% benign breast biopsy tissues expressed LRF mRNA transcripts and protein, respectively. The overall expression of LRF mRNA transcripts and total protein was significantly more in malignant breast tissues than the benign breast tissues. LRF expression was also observed in the nuclei of human colon, renal, lung, hepatocellular carcinomas and thymoma tumor cells. In general, a significantly higher expression of LRF was seen in malignant tissues than in the corresponding benign or normal tissue.

Treatment of THP1 cells (CD33+ AML cell line) with GO alone, or in combination with unconjugated CD33 antibody (hP67.6), resulted in a statistically significant (P<0.01) increase in tissue factor (TF) expression, but HepG2 cells (CD33 hepatocyte cell line) were unaffected. Cytokine secretion was not affected by GO treatment in either cell line. These results indicate that GO exerts a pro-coagulant response in certain cell types, which may predispose individuals to developing SOS.",['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

SFRP1 has been observed to be transcriptionally down-regulated due to hypermethylation in acute and chronic leukaemia, but so far not in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Moreover, it has been shown that the epigenetic inactivation of SFRP1 correlates with an overexpression of the Wnt receptor Frizzled 3 (Fzd3) in acute leukaemia. Using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we examined mRNA expression of SFRP1 and Fzd3 in bone marrow cells derived from 121 patients with different risk types of MDS, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We employed pyrosequencing to quantify promoter DNA methylation in MDS and acute leukaemia. We detected significant lower mRNA transcription of SFRP1 in MDS compared to healthy individuals. However, DNA sequence mutations or frequent elevated DNA methylation levels of the SFRP1 promoter could not be observed in MDS but in AML and ALL as previously reported. The expression levels of Fzd3 were up-regulated in both acute leukaemia and MDS. Our data show a significant transcriptional down-regulation of SFRP1 as a common event in AML, ALL and - as demonstrated for the first time - in MDS. An inactivation of SFRP1 and the transcriptional up-regulation of Fzd3 seem to be associated with an activation of the Wnt signalling pathway in these haematopoietic diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

With the purpose of evaluating whether the combination of ATO and bortezomib would be an option for patients with acute leukemia, we incubated HL60 leukemic cells with ATO alone and in combination with bortezomib. ATO and bortezomib cooperated to induce cell death and to inhibit proliferation and apoptosis in a synergistic way. The combined treatment resulted in a stronger activation of caspase 8 and 9, moderate activation of caspase 3, and increased expression of Fas and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-DR5 receptors. When bortezomib was added, some proapoptotic genes (CARD9, TRAIL) were upregulated, and some antiapoptotic genes (BCL2, BCL3, FLICE) were downregulated. When coincubated, approximately 80% of cells showed altered mitochondrial membrane permeability. Moreover, ATO alone and in combination with bortezomib abrogated DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappaB). Gene expression assays showed that more deregulated genes were related to proliferation of leukocytes, tumorigenesis, control of cell cycle, hypoxia and oxidative stress, cytokines, PI3K-AKT, ERK-MAPK, EGF pathways, and ubiquitination.

A fraction of these patients, in particular those displaying trisomy 8 or monosomy 7, are at risk of developing a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consequently, there is a need to characterize the clinical features of such cases and to increase our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the emergence of clonal cytogenetic changes in Ph(-) cells. To date, most cases reported have received treatment with imatinib. Here we describe the case of a patient with CML who developed monosomy 7 in Ph(-) cells during dasatinib therapy. At 20 months after dasatinib initiation, the patient developed MDS, which rapidly progressed into AML. Genome-wide 500K SNP array analysis of the monosomy 7 clone revealed no acquired submicroscopic copy number changes.

In six patients, ACAs persisted after the disappearance of the Ph. A complete cytogenetic response (CCR) was obtained in five of these six patients, and five of six also had a high Sokal score.

Although strategies to overcome resistance-mediated T315I mutation may improve the survival of BCR-ABL-positive leukemia patients, there is little information on cell-based studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a new human BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, SK-9 with the T315I mutation, from the peripheral blood of a 36-year-old female patient. RESULTS: Growth kinetic studies revealed an approximate population doubling time of 48 hours. The common B-cell phenotype is a feature of the SK-9 cell line. Cells have the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) with many structural abnormalities, as well as the T315I mutation in the BCR-ABL gene. Insertion of SK-9 cells into athymic nude mice induced the formation of tumors in the lymph node that infiltrated into the spleen and bone marrow. We examined the drug sensitivity of imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib using a cell proliferation assay and an immunoblot assay. Cell proliferation did not decrease after imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib treatment as compared to the BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562. Because phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and Crk-L did not decrease after imatinib and dasatinib treatment, it is suggested that SK-9 is resistant to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. CONCLUSION: This cell line may provide a useful model for in vitro and in vivo cellular and molecular studies of BCR-ABL-positive ALL with T315I mutation.",,"['Okabe, Seiichi', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Okabe S', 'Tauchi T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. okabe@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100513,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2010/05/18 06:00,2010/09/11 06:00,['2010/05/18 06:00'],"['2009/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00190-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Sep;38(9):765-72. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.04.017.

Recently, KIT D816V was reported to be expressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, it was not clarified whether these patients have co-existing occult SM. We investigated neoplastic cells in 101 patients with AML for expression of KIT D816V. In 7/101 patients (6.9%), KIT D816V was detectable. After a thorough histologic, molecular, and biochemical analysis, all 7 cases were found to have an associated SM, leading to the final diagnosis SM-AML. Microdissected tryptase+ MC displayed KIT D816V in all patients tested, whereas CD34+ blasts exhibited KIT D816V in only 2/4 patients. In one AML patient, SM without KIT D816V was detected. In all other patients, no associated SM was found, and leukemic blasts were negative for KIT D816V. In summary, our data show that KIT D816V in AML is highly associated with co-existing SM (SM-AML). Moreover, our data show that AML blasts may lack this transforming target-mutant, which may be important when considering the use of KIT D816V-targeting drugs for treatment of patients with KIT D816V-positive AML.","['(c) 2010 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Those hybrid molecules which had both two N-methylpyrrole groups and terminal (dimethylamino)alkyl side chains displayed submicromolar cytotoxicity towards K562 human leukemia cells. The combilexins were also evaluated for DNA binding by measuring the increase in DNA melting temperature, for DNA topoisomerase IIalpha-mediated double strand cleavage of DNA, for inhibition of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha decatenation activity, and for inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I relaxation of DNA. Several of the compounds stabilized the DNA-topoisomerase IIalpha covalent complex indicating that they acted as topoisomerase IIalpha poisons.

In a sub-sample: serum interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-1 (Levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist activity IL-1RA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Of 164 participants, mean age 84.6 +/- 6.57 years (+/- S.D.), 67.1% were women. On first assessment, mean BI was 14.13 +/- 4.46 and delirium prevalence was 25.6%. At discharge, the mean BI of survivors (n=150) was 15.61 +/- 4.22. By discharge, survivors who had recovered from prevalent delirium had significant improvement in BI (n=38, p=0.005), but non-recovers did not (n=14, p=0.512). On, multivariate analysis, BI was significantly affected by MMSE, APOE, IL-1alpha, IL-6, LIF and TNF-alpha levels (p<0.05) but not by delirium.

Our data showed that expression of ZNF300 changed significantly in various leukemia blasts in the bone marrow aspirates of newly diagnosed leukemia patients. To investigate the potential relationship between expression of ZNF300 and the progression of leukemia development and hematopoietic differentiation, we cloned and characterized the putative human ZNF300 gene promoter and identified its transcription start sites (TSSs). Deletion and mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that a myeloid-specific transcription factor PU.1 binding site was responsible for myeloid-specific regulation of ZNF300 promoter activity. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PU.1 bound to the PU.1 binding site within ZNF300 promoter region in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of PU.1 elevated ZNF300 promoter activity, whereas silencing of PU.1 expression significantly reduced the activity in myeloid-derived HL-60 cell but not in T-cell Jurkat. In vitro induced HL-60 cells into CD11b expressing cells by DMSO demonstrated that ZNF300 was upregulated along with upregulation of PU.1 expression.

We conducted a three-year controlled prospective study of the usual risk factors [venous insufficiency (VI), obesity, phlebitis] and of other factors suggested by our experience, such as heart failure (HF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Both in-patients and out-patients referred for stasis ulcers were included. The diagnosis of stasis ulcer was based on clinical criteria: venous insufficiency, cutaneous signs and/or severe leg oedema. Doppler ultrasound was performed systematically if the lesions showed no dramatic improvement within two months of treatment to eliminate arterial ulcers. VI, liver cirrhosis, heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, obesity, after-effects of leg injury, homolateral artificial hip and knee joints, and consumption of anti-leukaemia or leg-oedema-eliciting drugs were the criteria analysed by clinical examination or by consulting the information in the hospital records. Data were analyzed using SPSS/PCv12 software. Chi(2) and Fischer's exact tests were to compare cases and controls, who were identical in age, gender, and department of initial contact for reasons other than leg ulcers, stasis eczema or lipodermatosclerosis. RESULTS: We included 100 cases and 200 control subjects. Most were out-patients and only 4% were hospitalized in cardiology. Univariate analysis showed that stasis ulcer was significantly associated (p < 10(-4)) with VI (71% of cases versus 32.5% of control subjects), HF (44% versus 11%), obesity (44% versus 21.5%), after-effects of injury (17% versus 0%), and to a lesser extent, with artificial knee joints (7% versus 2.5%; p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis showed that stasis ulcer was strongly associated with VI (OR=5.5; 3-9.9) and HF (OR=4.7; 2.1-10.4). HF (right 16%, left 11%, global 57%, unspecified 16%) was also significantly associated with bilateral localization of leg ulcers (p = 10(-4)) but not with delayed healing (> 6 months). DISCUSSION: This study highlights two risk factors for stasis ulcer: artificial knee joints (in the univariate analysis only) and HF. An increase in leg oedemas is probably an important mechanism but we suggest the role of hypoxaemia in patients with isolated left HF. We advise an internist approach in the management of venous leg ulcers, which we prefer to name stasis ulcers, before having ruled out a general disease. In particular, we recommend a consultation with a cardiologist in the event of doubt.",['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The mechanisms by which leukocytes interact with human brain-derived microvasculature endothelial cells (HBMEC) and enter the CNS are largely derived from models of inflammation. However, our data indicate that ALL cells do not elicit an inflammatory phenotype by HBMEC. Our current investigation focuses on the contribution of the unique coexpression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) by ALL in mediating leukemic cell interactions with HBMEC as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary ALL and ALL cell lines were evaluated for VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 expression. Lentiviral-mediated transduction of VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 into REH cells and antibody neutralization of VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 in SUP-B15 cells was used to delineate the role of these two proteins in mediating ALL adhesion to, and migration through, HBMEC monolayers. RESULTS: Although cell line models indicate that VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 expression is found on the surface Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, evaluation of primary ALL demonstrates that VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 are expressed independent of Philadelphia status. Expression of VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 by ALL enhanced the adhesion of ALL to HBMEC, while expression of PECAM-1 enhanced ALL adhesion to, and migration through, HBMEC. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 by ALL cells positions them to interact with HBMEC. By increasing our understanding of molecular mechanisms through which ALL cells gain entry into the CNS, new strategies may be designed to prevent leukemia cell entry into the CNS.",,"['Akers, Stephen M', ""O'Leary, Heather A"", 'Minnear, Fred L', 'Craig, Michael D', 'Vos, Jeffrey A', 'Coad, James E', 'Gibson, Laura F']","['Akers SM', ""O'Leary HA"", 'Minnear FL', 'Craig MD', 'Vos JA', 'Coad JE', 'Gibson LF']","['Cancer Cell Biology Program, Robert C.

Development of curative therapies of CML require the identification of genes/pathways that play critical roles in survival and self-renewal of LSCs. Targeting of these key BCR-ABL downstream genes provides an opportunity to eradicate LSCs, as shown in our work that identifies the Alox5 gene as a key regulator of the function of CML LSCs. Immediate clinical trials are necessary to test the effectiveness of targeting a key BCR-ABL downstream gene in eradicating LSCs in CML patients.

Based on our previous finding, to further characterize the immune status, T cell proliferative history was analyzed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. METHODS: Quantitative analysis of deltaRec-psiJalpha signal joint T cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECs) was performed in PBMCs, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+T cells by real-time PCR, and the analysis of 23 TRBV-D1 sjTRECs was performed by semi-nested PCR. Forty eight CML cases in chronic phase (CML-CP) were selected for this study and 17 healthy individuals served as controls. RESULTS: The levels of deltaRec-psiJalpha sjTRECs in PBMCs, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells were significantly decreased in CML patients, compared with control groups. Moreover, the numbers of detectable TRBV subfamily sjTRECs, as well as the frequency of particular TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with CML were significantly lower than those from healthy individuals.

Usually the conventional imaging modalities, such as x-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and MRI, are being routinely used for the management of these pediatric malignancies. However, most of these modalities provide structural information and are lacking in functional/metabolic status of these malignancies. Recently, PET and PET/CT have emerged as a functional diagnostic imaging modality for the management of various cancers in adult population. Up to now most of the data published in the literature are on PET alone. PET used in conjunction with CT is useful as it provides an enhanced view of the anatomical details and the malignant focus then can be located with highest accuracy. PET and PET/CT has been found to be useful in, for example, CNS tumors, lymphomas, soft-tissue tumors, neuroblastoma, malignant bone tumors and germ cell tumors. PET/CT has a limited role in early diagnosis, however, it plays an important role in initial staging, treatment response evaluation and detection of metastatic disease in these cancers. Despite the fact that PET/CT has better diagnostic value when compared with conventional imaging, such as CT and MRI, in the management of many pediatric cancers, there are certain limitations. PET/CT has a limited role in detection of lesions smaller than 5 mm, well-differentiated tumors and tumors with low metabolic rate.

Topics that will be addressed include (1) CNS 2 status at diagnosis-definition and treatment; (2) CNS leukemia at diagnosis--treatment with radiation therapy; (3) isolated relapse of leukemia in the CNS--treatment of early and late relapse; and (4) opportunities for future research in CNS relapse of ALL.",,"['Barredo, Julio', 'Ritchey, A Kim']","['Barredo J', 'Ritchey AK']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis/etiology/*prevention & control/radiotherapy', 'Chemoprevention/methods', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",2010/05/18 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880011003758422 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Aug;27(5):329-32. doi: 10.3109/08880011003758422.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Studies were identified from a MEDLINE search through 31 July 2009 and from the reference lists of identified publications. Relative risk (RR) estimates were extracted from 25 studies published between 1985 and 2008. Meta-rate ratio estimates (mRR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study design, definition of exposure (employment in a farm/agriculture assuming exposure to pesticides versus exposure to pesticides stipulated), exposed parent, window of exposure, type of leukaemia and biocide category. RESULTS: No statistically significant association between childhood leukaemia and parental occupation as farmers/agricultural workers was observed. When exposure to pesticides was stipulated, positive associations were reported for maternal exposure for all studies combined (mRR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.22-2.16), in all exposure windows considered and for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). There was no association with paternal exposure when combining all studies (mRR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.76-1.69). However, significant increased risks were seen for paternal exposure, in some exposure windows as well as for the biocide category. CONCLUSIONS: The strongest evidence of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia comes from studies with maternal occupational exposure to pesticides. The associations with paternal exposure were weaker and less consistent. These results add to the evidence leading to recommend minimizing parental occupational exposure to pesticides. Our findings also support the need to rely more on studies that clearly stipulate exposure to pesticides rather than those that assume pesticide exposure because of farm/agriculture employment.",,"['Van Maele-Fabry, Genevieve', 'Lantin, Anne-Catherine', 'Hoet, Perrine', 'Lison, Dominique']","['Van Maele-Fabry G', 'Lantin AC', 'Hoet P', 'Lison D']","['Louvain Center for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (LTAP), Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue E.

In this study we show that this interaction specifically and timely controls the accumulation of Mcl-1 in the nucleus in response to DNA damage. The IEX-1 protein is rapidly induced by gamma-irradiation, genotoxic agents or replication inhibitors, in a way dependent on ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activity and is necessary for Mcl-1 nuclear translocation. Conversely, IEX-1 protein proteasomal degradation triggers the return of Mcl-1 to the cytosol. IEX-1 and Mcl-1 are integral components of the DNA damage response. Loss of IEX-1 or Mcl-1 leads to genomic instability and increased sensitivity to genotoxic and replicative stresses. The two proteins cooperate to maintain Chk1 activation and G2 checkpoint arrest. Mcl-1 nuclear translocation may foster checkpoint and improve the tumor resistance to DNA damage-based cancer therapies. Deciphering the pathways involved in IEX-1 degradation should lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets to increase sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy.",,"['Pawlikowska, P', 'Leray, I', 'de Laval, B', 'Guihard, S', 'Kumar, R', 'Rosselli, F', 'Porteu, F']","['Pawlikowska P', 'Leray I', 'de Laval B', 'Guihard S', 'Kumar R', 'Rosselli F', 'Porteu F']","['INSERM U, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100514,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IER3 protein, human)', '0 (IEX-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2010/05/15 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2010/05/15 06:00'],"['2010/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201056 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2010.56 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2010 Nov;17(11):1739-50. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2010.56.

OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin is an important regulator of insulin sensitivity that is secreted exclusively by adipocytes. We previously reported that imatinib promotes adipocytic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells. We therefore hypothesized that imatinib therapy would be associated with an increase in peripheral and intramedullary adiposity and elevated plasma adiponectin levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adiponectin levels in CML patient plasma, at diagnosis and then during imatinib mesylate therapy, was measured using an ELISA. Adiponectin multimers in plasma were analyzed using nondenaturing PAGE and immunoblotting. Intramedullary adiposity and adipose tissue mass was determined using histomorphometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. RESULTS: In CML patients, an increase in intramedullary and peripheral adiposity was observed after 6 months of imatinib therapy and plasma adiponectin levels, in the form of high- and low-molecular-weight complexes, were elevated 3-fold, compared with pretreatment levels, after 3, 6, and 12 months of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated adiponectin levels in imatinib-treated CML patients provide a possible mechanism for improved glucose and lipid metabolism reported for some imatinib-treated patients.",,"['Fitter, Stephen', 'Vandyke, Kate', 'Schultz, Christopher G', 'White, Deborah', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Zannettino, Andrew C W']","['Fitter S', 'Vandyke K', 'Schultz CG', 'White D', 'Hughes TP', 'Zannettino AC']","['Myeloma Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Centre for Cancer Biology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, G.P.O.

This retrospective study evaluated the benefit of alemtuzumab monotherapy in unselected patients with advanced CLL in the various cytogenetic subgroups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected from 105 consecutive, pretreated, cytogenetically defined patients who had received alemtuzumab. Response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. RESULTS: The hierarchic incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities was: 13q deletion (as sole abnormality), 18%; trisomy 12, 13%; 11q deletion, 19%; 17p deletion, 33%; and none of these, 16%. Overall response rate (ORR) was 43% in the total cohort and 49% in the subgroup of 17p-deleted patients (n = 35).

Improvement in cancer survival is considered a valid indicator of the quality of care introduced to the patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in the survival profile over age for patients with the most incident cancers. METHODS: Survival data of 3.94 million patients diagnosed with 23 primary-site cancers within the periods of 1979-1983, 1989-1993, and 1999-2003 were adopted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Gender and cause-specific survival probabilities were estimated at one, three, and five years after diagnosis using the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate. Survival was presented for each of the studied cancers, cohorts, and sexes in the form of line graphs as a function of age at diagnosis. Error bars demonstrated the probability of error at 95% confidence level. RESULTS: The graphs demonstrated that cancer survival was improved over the successive cohorts for most cancers, with several exceptions such as brain and lung cancers. The relation between survival and the age at diagnosis was generally described in the form of a gradual decline phase and a rapid fall-off phase at 70-80 years of age, with few exceptions as in leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma.

The pathway for LPS activation of RelB by the non-canonical pathway (RelB) in non-myeloid cells was not yet reported, but important for understanding the range of potential microbial LPS-induced effects in inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Experiments were performed in human colonic epithelial cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in components of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalosome, in order to detect mediators of the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappaB activation, including nuclear RelB and p52 and phospho- and total NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK). BCL10 was silenced by siRNA and effects of mutations of specific phosphorylation sites of BCL10 (Ser138Gly and Ser218Gly) were determined. RESULTS: By the non-canonical pathway, LPS exposure increased nuclear RelB and p52, and phospho-NIK, with no change in total NIK. Phosphorylation of BCL10 serine 138 was required for NIK phosphorylation, since mutation of this residue eliminated the increases in phospho-NIK and nuclear RelB and p52. Mutations of either serine 138 or serine 218 reduced RelA, p50, and phospho-IkappaBalpha of the canonical pathway. Effects of LPS stimulation and BCL10 silencing on NIK phosphorylation were demonstrated in confocal images. CONCLUSIONS: LPS induces activation of both canonical and non-canonical pathways of NF-kappaB in human colonic epithelial cells, and the non-canonical pathway requires phosphorylations of BCL10 (serine 138) and NIK. These findings demonstrate the important role of BCL10 in mediating LPS-induced inflammation in human colonic epithelial cells and may open new avenues for therapeutic interventions.",['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],"['Bhattacharyya, Sumit', 'Borthakur, Alip', 'Dudeja, Pradeep K', 'Tobacman, Joanne K']","['Bhattacharyya S', 'Borthakur A', 'Dudeja PK', 'Tobacman JK']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago and Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612-7227, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100511,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (BCL10 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl10 protein, mouse)', '0 (I kappa B beta protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'Colon/cytology', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/deficiency/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphoserine/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2010/05/15 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/05/15 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00209-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Nov 15;316(19):3317-27. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.05.004.

In this study, we found that IL-7 protects human CD4(+) effector/memory T cells from apoptosis induced upon the absence of stimulation and cytokines. We show that IL-7 up-regulates not only Bcl-2 but also Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 as well. Interleukin-7-induced activation of the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway is sufficient for cell survival and up-regulation of Bcl-2 proteins. In contrast to previous studies with naive T cells, we found that IL-7 is a weak activator of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT (also referred as protein kinase B) pathway and IL-7-mediated cell survival occurs independently from the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as from activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Considering the contribution of both IL-7 and CD4(+) effector/memory T cells to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and colitis, our study suggests that IL-7 can contribute to these diseases by promoting cell survival. A further understanding of the mechanisms of IL-7 signalling in effector/memory T cells associated with autoimmune inflammatory diseases may lead to potential new therapeutic avenues.",,"['Chetoui, Nizar', 'Boisvert, Marc', 'Gendron, Steve', 'Aoudjit, Fawzi']","['Chetoui N', 'Boisvert M', 'Gendron S', 'Aoudjit F']","['Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie/Immunologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Pavillon CHUL, and Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, PQ, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100504,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/deficiency', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/*drug effects', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/immunology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2010/05/15 06:00,2010/08/27 06:00,['2010/05/15 06:00'],"['2010/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['IMM3244 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03244.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2010 Jul;130(3):418-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03244.x.

SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 29 May 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to 2 June 2009). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing-trials-databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which different anthracycline derivates were compared in cancer patients (children and adults). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently performed study selection, assessment of risk of bias and data-extraction including adverse effects. MAIN RESULTS: We identified five RCTs of varying quality addressing epirubicin versus doxorubicin (1036 patients) with the same dose. The meta-analysis showed no evidence for a significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure between the treatment groups (RR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.11). However, there is some suggestion of a lower rate of clinical heart failure in patients treated with epirubicin.We identified two RCTs with varying quality addressing liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin (521 patients). The meta-analysis showed a significantly lower rate of both clinical heart failure and clinical and subclinical heart failure combined in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin (RR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75 and RR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59 respectively). It should be noted that in one of the studies patients in the liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin group received a higher cumulative anthracycline dose than patients in the doxorubicin group.For the other possible combinations of different anthracycline derivates only one RCT (epirubicin versus liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin) or no RCT was identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are not able to favour either epirubicin or doxorubicin when given with the same dose. Based on the currently available evidence on heart failure, we conclude that in adults with a solid tumour liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin should be favoured over doxorubicin. For both epirubicin versus doxorubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin no conclusions can be made about the effects of treatment in children treated with anthracyclines and also not in patients diagnosed with leukaemia. More research is needed. For other combinations of anthracycline derivates not enough evidence was available to make definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with anthracyclines.",,"['van Dalen, Elvira C', 'Michiels, Erna Mc', 'Caron, Huib N', 'Kremer, Leontien Cm']","['van Dalen EC', 'Michiels EM', 'Caron HN', 'Kremer LC']","[""Paediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital / Academic Medical Center, PO Box 22660 (room F8-257), Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1100 DD.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20100512,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cardiac Output, Low/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2010/05/14 06:00,2010/06/17 06:00,['2010/05/14 06:00'],"['2010/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD005006.pub4 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2010 May 12;(5):CD005006. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD005006.pub4.,,PMC6457588,,,,,,103,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2010;(3):CD005006.

Over the past decades, much has been learned about the disease from molecular study of the etiological agent of the disease, JC virus. Recently, promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), punctuate structures for important nuclear functions in eukaryotic cells, were identified as an intranuclear target of JC virus infection. Neuropathologically, JC virus-infected glial cells display diffuse amphophilic viral inclusions by hematoxylin-eosin staining (full inclusions), a diagnostic hallmark of this disease. Recent results using immunohistochemistry, however, revealed the presence of punctate viral inclusions preferentially located along the inner nuclear periphery (dot-shaped inclusions). Dot-shaped inclusions reflect the accumulation of viral progeny at PML-NBs, which may be disrupted after viral replication. Structural changes to PML-NBs have been reported for a variety of human diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, PML-NBs may provide clues to the further pathogenesis of JC virus-induced demyelinating disease.

METHODS: A cost of treatment analysis was conducted from the US payer perspective, based on resource utilization data for 48 patients with dasatinib-related pleural effusions at a large US cancer center. Probabilities of various procedures and treatment events were derived from published resource use data, supplemented with expert opinion. Cost data was derived from median reimbursements for relevant CPT codes for outpatient services and medical literature for inpatient services. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for types of procedures used. All costs were adjusted to US dollars (2007 rates). RESULTS: Sixty percent of pleural effusions were managed medically costing $750 per episode. Forty percent of pleural effusions were more significant (>25% of one lung volume), with half of those requiring invasive procedures. Cost of inpatient procedures was $10,616 for chest tube and $15,170 with pleural catheter. Cost of outpatient procedures was $713 for ultrasound thoracentesis and $4,598 for pleural catheter. The average cost of treating a pleural effusion was $2,062 to >$2,700 for all severity levels and approximately $6,400 to >$9,000 for invasive procedures. Key cost drivers were invasive procedures and recurrence. CONCLUSION: This economic analysis using actually observed treatment patterns suggests that the management of pleural effusion adverse events in CML patients is costly, requires intensive resource utilization, and may be an important factor in treatment selection.",,"['Stephens, Jennifer', 'Carpiuc, Kimbach Tran', 'Botteman, Marc']","['Stephens J', 'Carpiuc KT', 'Botteman M']","['Pharmerit North America LLC, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100408,New Zealand,Int J Gen Med,International journal of general medicine,101515487,,,,2010/05/14 06:00,2010/05/14 06:01,['2010/05/14 06:00'],"['2009/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/14 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Gen Med. 2010 Apr 8;3:31-6.,,PMC2866554,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['adverse events', 'cost, and cost analysis', 'dasatinib', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'safety']",,,,,,,

Moreover, nonleukemic peripheral blood lymphocyte cytotoxicity (PBL/CTC) as well as rituximab (RTX)-dependent PBL/CTC was also measured at the initiation of therapy, EOT and M12. These parameters were correlated with post-FCR monitoring of the minimal residual disease (MRD) level in blood using a four-color flow cytometry technique. FCR induced a profound and sustained depletion of all T-cell populations, Tgammadelta being the most affected, whereas NK cells were relatively preserved. Both basal and interleukin-2-stimulated nonleukemic PBL/CTC against MEC-2, a CLL cell line, increased during the post-FCR period. There was no correlation between immune recovery parameters and MRD progression profile, except that patients with high post-FCR CD4(+) counts experienced rapid MRD progression. MRD at M12 predicts clinical relapse. The limited data show RTX-mediated LBL/CTC activity against autologous B-cell cells in individuals with <1% residual disease at M12, opening avenues for immunomodulation post-FCR with anti-CD20 antibodies. To conclude, our study suggests that MRD increase at M12 precedes disease evolution post-FCR, and should be assessed as a surrogate marker for proactive management of CLL relapse.",,"['Ysebaert, L', 'Gross, E', 'Kuhlein, E', 'Blanc, A', 'Corre, J', 'Fournie, J J', 'Laurent, G', 'Quillet-Mary, A']","['Ysebaert L', 'Gross E', 'Kuhlein E', 'Blanc A', 'Corre J', 'Fournie JJ', 'Laurent G', 'Quillet-Mary A']","['Inserm U563, Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France. ysebaert.l@chu-toulouse.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100513,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', '*Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2010/05/14 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/05/14 06:00'],"['2010/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201089 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.89 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jul;24(7):1310-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.89.

We recently showed that ID in the IG heavy chain genes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was generally limited; however, intense ID was evident in selected cases, especially those expressing stereotyped IGHV4-34 rearrangements and assigned to subset 4. Here, we report results from a large-scale subcloning study of IG light variable genes, in a total of 1008 subcloned sequences from 56 CLL cases. Multiple analogies were noted between heavy and light chains regarding the occurrence and molecular features of ID. More specifically, the impact of ID on the clonotypic light chains was generally low, with the significant exception of subset 4.

Flavonoids may have a conspicuous role in cancer prevention because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and growth-inhibitory effects. Therefore, we tested the effects of the flavone luteolin (LUT) on selected parameters of the sunburn response in normal human keratinocytes, exposed to physiological doses of UVB. LUT attenuated UVB-induced cell death through delay and inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic signaling. Moreover, LUT not only predominantly affected the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through its antioxidant capacity, but also changed the balance of Bcl2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2)-family members. Furthermore, LUT had inhibitory effects on the UVB-induced release of the inflammatory mediators, IL-1alpha and prostaglandin-E(2). Using different cell lines derived from squamous cell carcinomas, we showed that LUT did not increase the resistance of malignant keratinocytes to UVB. Our data suggest that LUT inhibits different aspects of the sunburn response, which results ultimately in an increased survival of normal keratinocytes, whereas the sensitivity of malignant cells to UVB remain unchanged.

Myeloid leukemic cells can regularly be induced to differentiate into leukemia-derived dendritic cells (DC(leu)), regaining the stimulatory capacity of professional dendritic cells (DCs) while presenting the known/unknown leukemic antigen repertoire. So far, induced antileukemic T-cell responses are variable or even mediate opposite effects. To further elicit DC/DC(leu)-induced T-cell-response patterns, we generated DC from 17 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 2 myelodysplastic syndrome cases and carried out flowcytometry and (functional) nonradioactive fluorolysis assays before/after mixed lymphocyte cultures of matched (allogeneic) donor T cells (n=6), T cells prepared at relapse after stem-cell transplantation (n=4) or (autologous) patients' T cells (n=7) with blast containing mononuclear cells (""MNC"") or DC(leu) (""DC""). Compared with ""MNC"", ""DC"" were better mediators of antileukemic-activity, although not in every case effective. We could define DC subtypes and cut-off proportions of DC subtypes/qualities (mature DC/DC(leu)) after ""DC"" priming, which were predictive for an antileukemic activity of primed T cells and the clinical course of the disease after immunotherapy (allogeneic stem-cell transplantation/donor lymphocytes infusion/therapy). In summary, our data show that the composition and quality of DC after a mixed lymphocyte culture-priming phase is predictive for a successful ex vivo antileukemic response, especially with respect to proportions of mature and leukemia-derived DC. These data contribute not only to predict DC-mediated functions or the clinical course of the diseases but also to develop and refine DC-vaccination strategies that may pave the way to develop and modify adoptive immunotherapy, especially for patients at relapse after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.",,"['Grabrucker, Christine', 'Liepert, Anja', 'Dreyig, Julia', 'Kremser, Andreas', 'Kroell, Tanja', 'Freudenreich, Markus', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Schweiger, Cornelia', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochen', 'Schmetzer, Helga']","['Grabrucker C', 'Liepert A', 'Dreyig J', 'Kremser A', 'Kroell T', 'Freudenreich M', 'Schmid C', 'Schweiger C', 'Tischer J', 'Kolb HJ', 'Schmetzer H']","['*Department for Hematopoetic Transplantations, University of Munich, Munich daggerDepartment for Hematology, Municipal Hospital Augsburg, Augsburg section signHelmholtz Center, Munich double daggerMunicipal Hospital Oldenburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology']",2010/05/14 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2010/05/14 06:00'],"['2010/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181d87ffd [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2010 Jun;33(5):523-37. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181d87ffd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a long latent period, a fraction of carriers develop adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Genetic changes in the tax gene in ATL cells were reported in about 10% of ATL cases. To determine genetic changes that may occur throughout the provirus, we determined the entire sequence of the HTLV-1 provirus in 60 ATL cases. Abortive genetic changes, including deletions, insertions, and nonsense mutations, were frequent in all viral genes except the HBZ gene, which is transcribed from the minus strand of the virus. G-to-A base substitutions were the most frequent mutations in ATL cells. The sequence context of G-to-A mutations was in accordance with the preferred target sequence of human APOBEC3G (hA3G). The target sequences of hA3G were less frequent in the plus strand of the HBZ coding region than in other coding regions of the HTLV-1 provirus.

MJ-29 induced growth inhibition and cell death of leukemia cell lines (U937, HL-60, K562, and KG-1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner but did not obviously impair the viability of normal cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells). MJ-29 interacted with alpha- and beta-tubulin, inhibited tubulin polymerization both in vitro and in vivo, and disrupted microtubule organization. MJ-29 caused mitotic arrest by activating cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B complex activity. MJ-29-induced growth inhibition and activation of CDK1 activity were significantly attenuated by roscovitine (CDK inhibitor) and CDK1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Furthermore, MJ-29-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation was also significantly attenuated by CDK1 siRNA. MJ-29 caused an increase in the protein levels of cytosolic cytochrome c, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1, procaspase-9, and apoptosis-inducing factor. MJ-29-promoted activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 during apoptosis was significantly attenuated by caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibitors. It is noteworthy that in BALB/c(nu/nu) mice bearing U937 xenograft tumors MJ-29 inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated d-UTP nick end-labeling-positive apoptotic cells of tumor sections significantly increased in MJ-29-treated mice compared with the control group.

We designed a patient-specific, highly sensitive, DNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction to test follow-up samples for the original leukemic clone, identified by its unique genomic BCR-ABL fusion (gBCR-ABL). In 5 IM-treated patients in CMR, gBCR-ABL was detected in transcript-negative samples; 4 patients became gBCR-ABL-negative with continuing IM therapy. In contrast, of 9 patients in LTR (13-27 years) post-SCT, gBCR-ABL was detected in only 1, despite occasional transcript-positive samples in 8 of them.

Traditional methods for mapping LOH regions require the comparison of both tumor and patient-matched normal DNA samples. However, for many archival samples, patient-matched normal DNA is not available leading to the under-utilization of this important resource in LOH studies. Here we describe a new method for LOH analysis that relies on the genome-wide comparison of heterozygosity of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between cohorts of cases and un-matched healthy control samples. Regions of LOH are defined by consistent decreases in heterozygosity across a genetic region in the case cohort compared to the control cohort. METHODS: DNA was collected from 20 Follicular Lymphoma (FL) tumor samples, 20 Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) tumor samples, neoplastic B-cells of 10 B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) patients and Buccal cell samples matched to 4 of these B-CLL patients. The cohort heterozygosity comparison method was developed and validated using LOH derived in a small cohort of B-CLL by traditional comparisons of tumor and normal DNA samples, and compared to the only alternative method for LOH analysis without patient matched controls. LOH candidate regions were then generated for enlarged cohorts of B-CLL, FL and DLBCL samples using our cohort heterozygosity comparison method in order to evaluate potential LOH candidate regions in these non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tumor subtypes. RESULTS: Using a small cohort of B-CLL samples with patient-matched normal DNA we have validated the utility of this method and shown that it displays more accuracy and sensitivity in detecting LOH candidate regions compared to the only alternative method, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method. Subsequently, using B-CLL, FL and DLBCL tumor samples we have utilised cohort heterozygosity comparisons to localise LOH candidate regions in these subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Detected LOH regions included both previously described regions of LOH as well as novel genomic candidate regions. CONCLUSIONS: We have proven the efficacy of the use of cohort heterozygosity comparisons for genome-wide mapping of LOH and shown it to be in many ways superior to the HMM method. Additionally, the use of this method to analyse SNP microarray data from 3 common forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma yielded interesting tumor suppressor gene candidates, including the ETV3 gene that was highlighted in both B-CLL and FL.",,"['Green, Michael R', 'Jardine, Paul', 'Wood, Peter', 'Wellwood, Jeremy', 'Lea, Rod A', 'Marlton, Paula', 'Griffiths, Lyn R']","['Green MR', 'Jardine P', 'Wood P', 'Wellwood J', 'Lea RA', 'Marlton P', 'Griffiths LR']","['Genomics Research Centre, Griffith Institute for Health & Medical Research, Griffith University, Parklands Drive, Southport, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20100512,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics', 'Markov Chains', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2010/05/14 06:00,2010/08/17 06:00,['2010/05/14 06:00'],"['2009/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-195 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-195 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 May 12;10:195. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-195.,,PMC2885361,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory effects of As2O3 and AMO-miR-21, used singly or in combining, on cell proliferation were detected by MTT, their inhibition rate and IC50 were calculated. Cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed with PI stain; expression of miRNA-21 in cells was detected quantitatively by real-time PCR, and the potential target gene PDCD, protein expression was detected by immuno-fluorimetry. RESULTS: Used in combining with AMO-miR-21, the IC50 of As2O3, could be lowered from 2.1 micromol/L to 1.23 micromol/L, and the sensitivity of cells to As2O3 increased to 1.78-fold; with the amount of apoptotic cells increased significantly.

The dose of intravenous ATO was 0.15-0.17 mg/kg per day, only one patient got 0.33 mg/kg per day, maximum dose was 10 mg per day in induction therapy with minimal chemotherapy treatment (CT) for hyperleukocytosis. Anthracycline or anthracycline-based CT was used for consolidation therapy and followed by 0.10-0.15 mg/kg per day ATO treatment in maintenance therapy. The continuous detection for morphology of bone marrow and PML-RARa were necessary for administrating CT or not. 3 patients died during induction therapy for intracranial hemorrhage, leukocytosis and septic shock. Total of 30 patients achieved complete remission (CR) and were followed-up for 10-108 months. The overall survival (OS) for all patients was 82.7%, whereas the OS for patients obtained CR was 95.8%.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I dose escalation trial of single-agent flavopiridol in adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias, utilizing a modification of the intravenous bolus/continuous intravenous infusion approach, intensifying treatment for administration on days 1, 2, and 3 of 21-day cycles. RESULTS: Twenty-four adults with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (n=19) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=5) were enrolled. The median age was 62 years (range, 23-78). The maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol was 40 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus plus 60 mg/m(2) continuous intravenous infusion (40/60). The dose limiting toxicity was secretory diarrhea. Life-threatening hyperacute tumor lysis syndrome requiring hemodialysis on day 1 was observed in one patient. Pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent with increased clearance observed at the two highest dose levels. Diarrhea occurrence and severity significantly correlated with flavopiridol concentrations at the end of the 4-hour infusion, volume of distribution, and elimination half-life. Modest anti-leukemic activity was observed, with most patients experiencing dramatic but transient reduction/clearance of circulating blasts lasting for 10-14 days. One refractory acute myeloid leukemia patient had short-lived complete remission with incomplete count recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Flavopiridol as a single agent given by intravenous bolus/continuous intravenous infusion causes marked, immediate cytoreduction in relapsed/refractory acute leukemias, but objective clinical responses were uncommon.

Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been described in many human cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia. Current first-line therapy for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia is imatinib mesylate, which typically produces a rapid hematologic response. However the effect of imatinib on miRNA expression in vivo has not been thoroughly examined. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a TaqMan Low-Density Array system, we analyzed miRNA expression in blood samples from newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia patients before and within the first two weeks of imatinib therapy. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate imatinib-modulated miRNAs in sequential primary chronic myeloid leukemia samples (n=11, plus 12 additional validation patients). Bioinformatic target gene prediction analysis was performed based on changes in miRNA expression. RESULTS: We observed increased expression of miR-150 and miR-146a, and reduced expression of miR-142-3p and miR-199b-5p (3-fold median change) after two weeks of imatinib therapy. A significant correlation (P<0.05) between the Sokal score and pre-treatment miR-142-3p levels was noted. Expression changes in the same miRNAs were consistently found in an additional cohort of chronic myeloid leukemia patients, as compared to healthy subjects. Peripheral blood cells from chronic phase and blast crisis patients displayed a 30-fold lower expression of miR-150 compared to normal samples, which is of particular interest since c-Myb, a known target of miR-150, was recently shown to be necessary for Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation. CONCLUSIONS: We found that imatinib treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia patients rapidly normalizes the characteristic miRNA expression profile, suggesting that miRNAs may serve as a novel clinically useful biomarker in this disease.",,"['Flamant, Stephane', 'Ritchie, William', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Holst, Jeff', 'Bonnet, Marie-Laure', 'Chomel, Jean-Claude', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Turhan, Ali G', 'Rasko, John E J']","['Flamant S', 'Ritchie W', 'Guilhot J', 'Holst J', 'Bonnet ML', 'Chomel JC', 'Guilhot F', 'Turhan AG', 'Rasko JE']","['Gene and Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, Locked Bag No 6, Newtown, NSW 2042, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100511,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MIRN150 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",2010/05/13 06:00,2011/03/09 06:00,['2010/05/13 06:00'],"['2010/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.020636 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.020636 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Aug;95(8):1325-33. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.020636.

However, disease remission can also be observed after syngeneic transplantation and we investigated whether a T-cell immune response to cancer-testis antigens can be detected in patients in the post-transplant period. DESIGN AND METHODS: The T-cell immune response against cancer-testis antigens was studied in a cohort of 41 patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation for the management of acute myeloid leukemia or multiple myeloma. The cytokine secretion assay was combined with magnetic selection to allow detection of an interferon-gamma-secreting T-cell response to a panel of cancer-testis antigen peptides. RESULTS: A cancer-testis antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell immune response was observed in the peripheral blood of five patients with an average magnitude of 0.045% of the CD8(+) T-cell repertoire. Four of these patients had undergone reduced intensity conditioning transplantation with alemtuzumab for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and three remain in long-term remission.

Due to the rarity of this disease and its association with autoimmune diseases, a theoretical germline or somatic mutation might have significant penetrance, thus enabling detection, even from samples of suboptimal size, through genome-wide association studies. DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate a non-mendelian genetic predisposition to large granular lymphocyte leukemia, we used a step-wise method for gene discovery. First, a modified 'random forests' technique was used for candidate gene identification: this was followed by traditional allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, sequencing modalities, and mechanistic assays. RESULTS: Our analysis found an association with MICA, a non-peptide-presenting, tightly regulated, stress-induced MHC-like molecule and cognate receptor for NKG2D, found abundantly on large granular lymphocyte leukemia cells. Sequencing of germline DNA revealed a higher frequency of MICA*00801/A5.1 in patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia than in matched controls (64% versus 41%, P<0.001, homozygous 40% versus 15%, P<0.001). Flow cytometry was employed to determine the expression of MICA within hematologic compartments, showing that the signal intensity of MICA was increased in granulocytes from neutropenic patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia in comparison with that in controls (P=0.033). Furthermore, neutrophil counts were inversely correlated with MICA expression (R(2)=0.50, P=0.035). Finally, large granular lymphocyte leukemia cells were able to selectively kill MICA(+) Ba/F3 lymphocytes transfected with human MICA*019 in a dose-dependent manner compared to naive cells (P<0.001), an effect mitigated by administration of an anti-NKG2D antibody (P=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate that MICA-NKG2D played a role in disease pathogenesis in the majority of patients in our cohort of cases of large granular lymphocyte leukemia and further investigation into this signaling axis may provide potent therapeutic targets.",,"['Viny, Aaron D', 'Clemente, Michael J', 'Jasek, Monika', 'Askar, Medhat', 'Ishwaran, Hemant', 'Nowacki, Amy', 'Zhang, Aiwen', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Viny AD', 'Clemente MJ', 'Jasek M', 'Askar M', 'Ishwaran H', 'Nowacki A', 'Zhang A', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematologic and Oncologic Research, Taussig Cancer Center R/40, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100511,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",2010/05/13 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/05/13 06:00'],"['2010/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.021865 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.021865 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Oct;95(10):1713-21. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.021865.

BAFF-R was fully competent to bind BAFF, and stimulation of the receptor activated both the classic and the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways. Recombinant BAFF supported survival of the ALL cells in the absence of stroma, and it significantly attenuated the rate of apoptosis caused by exposure to nilotinib, a drug used therapeutically to treat Ph-positive ALLs.

Expression profiling has shown that chromosomal translocations, in particular, are associated with distinctive patterns of gene expression. AML exhibiting the translocation t(8;21), which fuses the AML1 and ETO genes, has such a characteristic expression profile. One gene whose expression is highly correlated with the presence of the AML1/ETO fusion is POU4F1, which encodes the POU homeodomain transcription factor BRN3A. Here we show using specific siRNA in t(8;21) cells and overexpression studies in progenitor cells that AML1/ETO promotes expression of POU4F1/BRN3A. This effect requires DNA-binding function of AML1/ETO, and accordingly, AML1/ETO is bound to the POU4F1 locus in t(8;21) cells. Functionally, whereas overexpression of Brn3a in murine hematopoietic progenitor cells induces terminal myeloid differentiation, coexpression of AML1/ETO or AML1/ETO9a blocks this effect. Furthermore, Brn3a reduction by shRNA impairs AML1/ETO-induced immortalization of murine progenitors. In summary, we identify POU4F1/BRN3A as a novel potential upregulated AML1/ETO target gene whose dramatically high expression may cooperate with AML1/ETO in t(8;21) cells.",['(c)2010 AACR.'],"['Dunne, Jenny', 'Gascoyne, Duncan M', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Brady, Hugh J M', 'Heidenreich, Olaf', 'Young, Bryan D']","['Dunne J', 'Gascoyne DM', 'Lister TA', 'Brady HJ', 'Heidenreich O', 'Young BD']","['Cancer Research UK Medical Oncology Unit, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100511,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (POU4F1 protein, human)', '0 (Pou4f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factor Brn-3A)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Fetus', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/cytology/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor Brn-3A/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2010/05/13 06:00,2010/06/22 06:00,['2010/05/13 06:00'],"['2010/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-3604 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3604 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 May 15;70(10):3985-95. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3604.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined responses developing against CML66, an immunogenic antigen preferentially expressed in myeloid progenitor cells identified from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia who attained long-lived remission following CD4+ donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). RESULTS: From this patient, CML66-reactive CD8+ T-cell clones were detected against an endogenously presented HLA-B*4403-restricted epitope (HDVDALLW). Neither CML66-specific antibody nor T-cell responses were detectable in peripheral blood before DLI. However, by 1 month after DLI, CD8+ T cells were present in peripheral blood and at 10-fold higher frequency in marrow. Subsequently, plasma antibody to CML66 developed in association with disease remission. Donor-derived CML66-reactive T cells were detected at low levels in vivo in marrow before DLI by ELISpot and by a nested PCR-based assay to detect clonotypic T-cell receptor sequences but not in blood of the patient pre-DLI nor of the graft donor. CONCLUSIONS: CD4+ DLI results in rapid expansion of preexisting marrow-resident leukemia-specific donor CD8+ T cells, followed by a cascade of antigen-specific immune responses detectable in blood. Our single-antigen analysis thus shows that durable posttransplant tumor immunity is directed in part against nonpolymorphic overexpressed leukemia antigens that elicit coordinated cellular and humoral immunity.",['Copyright (c) 2010 AACR.'],"['Zhang, Wandi', 'Choi, Jaewon', 'Zeng, Wanyong', 'Rogers, Shelby A', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Rheinwald, James G', 'Canning, Christine M', 'Brusic, Vladimir', 'Sasada, Tetsuro', 'Reinherz, Ellis L', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Zhang W', 'Choi J', 'Zeng W', 'Rogers SA', 'Alyea EP', 'Rheinwald JG', 'Canning CM', 'Brusic V', 'Sasada T', 'Reinherz EL', 'Ritz J', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Wu CJ']","[""Cancer Vaccine Center and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Skin Disease Research Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100511,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (NUDCD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2010/05/13 06:00,2010/08/17 06:00,['2010/05/13 06:00'],"['2010/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0415 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0415 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 May 15;16(10):2729-39. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0415.

Sesamin, a lipid-soluble lignan, is one such agent that belongs to a class of phytoestrogens, isolated from sesame (Sesamum indicum), and has been linked with prevention of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and carcinogenesis through an unknown mechanism. Because the transcription factor NF-kappaB has been associated with inflammation, carcinogenesis, tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis of cancer, we postulated that sesamin might mediate its effect through the modulation of the NF-kappaB pathway. We found that sesamin inhibited the proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, pancreas, and lung. Sesamin also potentiated tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis and this correlated with the suppression of gene products linked to cell survival (e.g., Bcl-2 and survivin), proliferation (e.g., cyclin D1), inflammation (e.g., cyclooxygenase-2), invasion (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-9, intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor). Sesamin downregulated constitutive and inducible NF-kappaB activation induced by various inflammatory stimuli and carcinogens, and inhibited the degradation of IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, through the suppression of phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and inhibition of activation of IkappaBalpha protein kinase, thus resulting in the suppression of p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and NF-kappaB-mediated reporter gene transcription. The inhibition of IkappaBalpha protein kinase activation was found to be mediated through the inhibition of TAK1 kinase.

Rapid post-weaning mammary growth and mammary tissue overexpression of insulin receptor, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), estrogen receptor isoform alpha and v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2), correlated with this risk. The objectives of this study were therefore (i) to identify underlying mechanisms of increased risk through candidate and global approaches; (ii) to determine if excessive calorie intake further increased risk and if so, (iii) to identify the molecular mechanisms mediating this. We provide evidence for transcriptional upregulation of IGF-1R by Sp1 in LP mammary tissue (P < 0.01). Cell cycle control and DNA damage repair gene cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) (p21waf1) was also upregulated (P < 0.05) as was transcription factor nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell (P < 0.05) and adhesion gene CDH1 (P < 0.05). Invasion and metastasis markers matrix metalloproteinase 9 and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade E, member 1 (SERPIN1) were upregulated (both P < 0.05), whereas metastasis suppressor gene NME1 was downregulated (P < 0.01). Feeding a highly palatable diet (HPD) to increase calorie intake from puberty, additively and independently increased early mammary tumor risk, which correlated with increased serum insulin and triglyceride concentrations (P < 0.05). PTEN gene expression was reduced both by early protein restriction (P < 0.05) and HPD (P < 0.01), which may induce Akt in cell survival pathways. Progesterone receptor and ERBB2 (both P < 0.05) expression increased as an effect of an interaction between maternal diet and adult nutrition, with subsequent downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. We conclude that poor early growth and excessive calorie intake exert independent and additive effects on mitogenic growth factor signaling to influence mammary tumor susceptibility.",,"['Fernandez-Twinn, D S', 'Ekizoglou, S', 'Martin-Gronert, M S', 'Tarry-Adkins, J', 'Wayman, A P', 'Warner, M J', 'Luan, J-A', 'Gusterson, B A', 'Ozanne, S E']","['Fernandez-Twinn DS', 'Ekizoglou S', 'Martin-Gronert MS', 'Tarry-Adkins J', 'Wayman AP', 'Warner MJ', 'Luan JA', 'Gusterson BA', 'Ozanne SE']","[""Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Metabolic Research Laboratories, Institute of Metabolic Science, Level 4, Box 289, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, UK. df220@cam.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100511,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Erbb2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Disease Susceptibility', '*Energy Intake', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Growth Disorders/*complications', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/*etiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics/physiology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/analysis/genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/analysis/genetics']",2010/05/13 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/05/13 06:00'],"['2010/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['bgq095 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgq095 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Oct;31(10):1873-81. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgq095.

The N-terminal RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain of Cyp33 has been found to associate with the third plant homeodomain (PHD3) finger of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) proto-oncoprotein and a poly(A) RNA sequence. Here, we report a 1.9 A resolution crystal structure of the RRM domain of Cyp33 and describe the molecular mechanism of PHD3 and RNA recognition. The Cyp33 RRM domain folds into a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and two alpha-helices. The RRM domain, but not the catalytic module of Cyp33, binds strongly to PHD3, exhibiting a 2 muM affinity as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) analysis and dynamics data reveal that the beta strands and the beta2-beta3 loop of the RRM domain are involved in the interaction with PHD3. Mutations in the PHD3-binding site or deletions in the beta2-beta3 loop lead to a significantly reduced affinity or abrogation of the interaction. The RNA-binding pocket of the Cyp33 RRM domain, mapped on the basis of NMR CSP and mutagenesis, partially overlaps with the PHD3-binding site, and RNA association is abolished in the presence of MLL PHD3. Full-length Cyp33 acts as a negative regulator of MLL-induced transcription and reduces the expression levels of MLL target genes MEIS1 and HOXA9. Together, these in vitro and in vivo data provide insight into the multiple functions of Cyp33 RRM and suggest a Cyp33-dependent mechanism for regulating the transcriptional activity of MLL.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Such patients could benefit from augmented therapy if their clinical outcome could be more accurately predicted at the time of diagnosis. Gene expression profiling offers the potential to identify additional prognostic markers but has had limited success in generating robust signatures that predict outcome across multiple patient cohorts. This study aimed to identify robust gene classifiers that could be used for the accurate prediction of relapse in independent cohorts and across different experimental platforms. RESULTS: Using HG-U133Plus2 microarrays we modeled a five-gene classifier (5-GC) that accurately predicted clinical outcome in a cohort of 50 T-ALL patients. The 5-GC was further tested against three independent cohorts of T-ALL patients, using either qRT-PCR or microarray gene expression, and could predict patients with significantly adverse clinical outcome in each. The 5-GC featured the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R), low-expression of which was independently predictive of relapse in T-ALL patients. In T-ALL cell lines, low IL-7R expression was correlated with diminished growth response to IL-7 and enhanced glucocorticoid resistance. Analysis of biological pathways identified the NF-kappaB and Wnt pathways, and the cell adhesion receptor family (particularly integrins) as being predictive of relapse. Outcome modeling using genes from these pathways identified patients with significantly worse relapse-free survival in each T-ALL cohort. CONCLUSIONS: We have used two different approaches to identify, for the first time, robust gene signatures that can successfully discriminate relapse and CCR patients at the time of diagnosis across multiple patient cohorts and platforms. Such genes and pathways represent markers for improved patient risk stratification and potential targets for novel T-ALL therapies.",,"['Cleaver, Amanda L', 'Beesley, Alex H', 'Firth, Martin J', 'Sturges, Nina C', ""O'Leary, Rebecca A"", 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Baker, David L', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Cleaver AL', 'Beesley AH', 'Firth MJ', 'Sturges NC', ""O'Leary RA"", 'Hunger SP', 'Baker DL', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Perth, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100512,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Decision Trees', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics']",2010/05/13 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/05/13 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-105 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-105 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 May 12;9:105. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-105.,"['CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2879253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the potential therapeutic values of this pathway, we assessed both the expression and the activation of Stat3 pathway in several pairs of multidrug resistant (MDR) osteosarcoma cell lines, and tissues. To explore the potential therapeutic values of this pathway, we analyzed the ability of the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid, C-28 methyl ester of 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolen-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me), to inhibit Stat3 expression and activation as well as its effects on doxorubicin sensitivity in osteosarcoma cells. METHODS: Expression of Stat3, phosphorylated Stat3 (pStat3) and Stat3 targeted proteins, including Bcl-XL, Survivin and MCL-1 were determined in drug sensitive and MDR osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues by Western blot analysis. The effect of CDDO-Me on osteosarcoma cell growth was evaluated by MTT and apoptosis by PARP cleavage assay and caspase-3/7 activity. RESULTS: Stat3 pathway was activated in osteosarcoma tissues and in MDR cell lines. CDDO-Me inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cell lines. Treatment with CDDO-Me significantly decreased the level of nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of Stat3. The inhibition of Stat3 pathway correlated with the suppression of the anti-apoptotic Stat3 targeted genes Bcl-XL, survivin, and MCL-1. Furthermore, CDDO-Me increased the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in the MDR osteosarcoma cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Stat3 pathway is overexpressed in MDR osteosarcoma cells. CDDO-Me significantly inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation, Stat3 nuclear translocation and induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The relationship between Bcl-2 protein expression and cell proliferation was explored in 124 cases of B-cell lymphoma using double immunofluorescence labelling for Bcl-2 and Ki67. In follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), neoplastic cells tended to lose Bcl-2 when they are in cell cycle. This pattern is usually maintained in both follicular lymphoma and CLL/SLL when they undergo high-grade transformation. In mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and a subset of CLL/SLL, the inverse relationship (between Bcl-2 and Ki67) was not observed, i.e. the proliferating cells tended to show co-expression of Bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS: In low-grade lymphomas, including those that are transformed, Bcl-2 expression is lost when cell proliferate. However, in more aggressive tumours (i.e. mantle cell and de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphomas) the inverse Bcl-2/Ki67 relationship was not observed. It would be of interest to explore the clinical implications in lymphoma of the presence and absence of the inverse Bcl-2/Ki67 pattern.",,"['Masir, Noraidah', 'Jones, Margaret', 'Lee, Abigail M', 'Goff, Lindsey K', 'Clear, Andrew J', 'Lister, Andrew', 'Marafioti, Teresa', 'Mason, David Y']","['Masir N', 'Jones M', 'Lee AM', 'Goff LK', 'Clear AJ', 'Lister A', 'Marafioti T', 'Mason DY']","['Pathology Department, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",2010/05/13 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2010/05/13 06:00'],"['2010/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['HIS3524 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2559.2010.03524.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2010 Apr;56(5):617-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2010.03524.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypes include cognitive impairment, congenital defects, and increased risk for several diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and leukemia. Current DS-screening tests subject many women to invasive procedures for accurate diagnosis due to insufficient specificity. Since amniotic fluid (AF) surrounds the developing fetus, understanding the changes in AF composition in the presence of DS may provide insights into genotype-phenotype associations, and aid in discovery of novel biomarkers for better screening. On the basis of our previous study, in which we reported an extensive proteome of AF, we performed two-dimensional liquid chromatography followed by MS/MS to analyze triplicates of pooled AF of chromosomally normal and DS-affected pregnancies (10 samples per pool). A total of 542 proteins were identified from the two sets of triplicate analyses by the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer and data were compared semiquantitatively by spectral counting. Candidate biomarkers were selected based on the spectral count differences between the two conditions after normalization. Comparison between the two groups revealed 60 candidates that showed greater than 2-fold increase or decrease in concentration in the presence of DS. Among these candidates, amyloid precursor protein and tenascin-C were verified by ELISA, and both showed a 2-fold increase, on average, in DS-AF samples compared to controls.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which As2O3 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in solid tumors have not been clearly understood. The goal of our study is to gain insight into the general biological processes and molecular functions that are altered by As2O3 treatment in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and to identify the key signaling processes that are involved in the regulation of these physiological effects. In the present study, MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 muM As2O3, and the differential gene expression was then analyzed by DNA microarray. The results showed that As2O3 treatment changed the expression level of several genes that involved in cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Notably, As2O3 treatment increased the mRNA and protein levels of the cell cycle inhibitory proteins, p21 and p27. Interestingly, knocking down p21 or p27 individually did not alter As2O3-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest; however, the simultaneous down-regulation of both p21 and p27 resulted in attenuating of G1, G2/M arrest and reduction in apoptosis, thus indicating that p21 and p27 as the primary molecular targets of As2O3 against breast cancer.

The intracellular kinase JAK2 plays an essential role in cytokine signaling, and activating mutations in JAK2 are found in a number of hematologic malignancies. We previously demonstrated that lymphocyte adaptor protein (Lnk, also known as Sh2b3) binds JAK2 and attenuates its activity, thereby limiting HSPC expansion. Here we show that loss of Lnk accelerates and exacerbates oncogenic JAK2-induced myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs) in mice. Specifically, Lnk deficiency enhanced cytokine-independent JAK/STAT signaling and augmented the ability of oncogenic JAK2 to expand myeloid progenitors in vitro and in vivo. An activated form of JAK2, unable to bind Lnk, caused greater myeloid expansion than activated JAK2 alone and accelerated myelofibrosis, indicating that Lnk directly inhibits oncogenic JAK2 in constraining MPD development. In addition, Lnk deficiency cooperated with the BCR/ABL oncogene, the product of which does not directly interact with or depend on JAK2 or Lnk, in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) development, suggesting that Lnk also acts through endogenous pathways to constrain HSPCs. Consistent with this idea, aged Lnk-/- mice spontaneously developed a CML-like MPD. Taken together, our data establish Lnk as a bona fide suppressor of MPD in mice and raise the possibility that Lnk dysfunction contributes to the development of hematologic malignancies in humans.",,"['Bersenev, Alexey', 'Wu, Chao', 'Balcerek, Joanna', 'Jing, Jiang', 'Kundu, Mondira', 'Blobel, Gerd A', 'Chikwava, Kudakwashe R', 'Tong, Wei']","['Bersenev A', 'Wu C', 'Balcerek J', 'Jing J', 'Kundu M', 'Blobel GA', 'Chikwava KR', 'Tong W']","[""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100510,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",2010/05/12 06:00,2010/06/22 06:00,['2010/05/12 06:00'],"['2009/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['42032 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI42032 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2010 Jun;120(6):2058-69. doi: 10.1172/JCI42032.

METHODS In a retrospective cohort study, 5937 adult survivors of non-CNS cancers and 382 siblings completed a validated neuropsychological instrument with subscales in task efficiency, emotional regulation, organization, and memory. Scores were converted to T scores; scores in the worst 10% of siblings' scores (ie, T score > or =63) were defined as impaired. Non-CNS cancer survivors and siblings were compared with multivariable linear regression and log-binomial regression. Among survivors, log-binomial models assessed the association of patient and treatment factors with neurocognitive dysfunction. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS Non-CNS cancer survivors had similar or slightly worse (<0.5 standard deviation) mean test scores for all four subscales than siblings. However, frequencies of impaired survivors were approximately 50% higher than siblings in task efficiency (13.0% of survivors vs 7.3% of siblings), memory (12.5% vs 7.6%), and emotional regulation (21.2% vs 14.4%). Impaired task efficiency was most often identified in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received cranial radiation therapy (18.1% with impairment), myeloid leukemia who received cranial radiation therapy (21.2%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (13.9%). In adjusted analysis, diagnosis age of younger than 6 years, female sex, cranial radiation therapy, and hearing impairment were associated with impairment.

We compared intense dose-dense (IDD) adjuvant chemotherapy with conventionally scheduled adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, phase III trial, a total of 1,284 eligible patients with four or more involved axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive IDD sequential epirubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide (IDD-ETC) every 2 weeks or conventionally scheduled epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel every three weeks. The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 62 months, 5-year event-free survival rates were 62% in the conventional arm and 70% in the IDD-ETC arm, representing a 28% reduction of the relative risk of relapse (P < .001). This benefit was independent of menopausal, hormone receptor, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. The 5-year overall survival rates were 77% versus 82%, representing a 24% reduction of the relative risk of death (P = .0285). IDD therapy was associated with significantly more nonhematologic and hematologic toxicities, but no treatment-related death occurred. Four occurrences of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were observed in the IDD-ETC arm. No severe congestive heart failure was reported. CONCLUSION: IDD-ETC was less well tolerated compared with conventional chemotherapy but significantly improved event-free and overall survivals in patients with high-risk primary breast cancer who had four or more positive axillary lymph nodes.",,"['Moebus, Volker', 'Jackisch, Christian', 'Lueck, Hans-Joachim', 'du Bois, Andreas', 'Thomssen, Christoph', 'Kurbacher, Christian', 'Kuhn, Walther', 'Nitz, Ulrike', 'Schneeweiss, Andreas', 'Huober, Jens', 'Harbeck, Nadia', 'von Minckwitz, Gunter', 'Runnebaum, Ingo B', 'Hinke, Axel', 'Kreienberg, Rolf', 'Konecny, Gottfried E', 'Untch, Michael']","['Moebus V', 'Jackisch C', 'Lueck HJ', 'du Bois A', 'Thomssen C', 'Kurbacher C', 'Kuhn W', 'Nitz U', 'Schneeweiss A', 'Huober J', 'Harbeck N', 'von Minckwitz G', 'Runnebaum IB', 'Hinke A', 'Kreienberg R', 'Konecny GE', 'Untch M']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Klinikum Frankfurt Hoechst, Academic Hospital of Goethe University Frankfurt, Gotenstrasse 6-8, D-65929, Frankfurt, Germany. studien-frauenklinik@KlinikumFrankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100510,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/05/12 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/05/12 06:00'],"['2010/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.24.7643 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.24.7643 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jun 10;28(17):2874-80. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.24.7643.

Recently, other anti-CD20 mAbs have been developed to improve on the activity achieved with rituximab or to demonstrate efficacy in patients whose diseases are resistant to rituximab. The most extensively studied of these is ofatumumab, a type I human antibody that binds to a different epitope of CD20 than rituximab. Preclinical data suggest improved complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity compared with rituximab. In early clinical trials, ofatumumab demonstrated single-agent activity against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a number of histologies of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This antibody was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CLL that is resistant to both fludarabine and alemtuzumab.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received six cycles of CVP followed by one cycle of tositumomab and (131)I-tositumomab (one dosimetric dose and one therapeutic dose). The treatment was evaluated for efficacy and safety. RESULTS: All 30 patients enrolled completed CVP as well as tositumomab and (131)I-tositumomab therapy. The overall response rate after completion of therapy was 100%, with 28 patients (93%) achieving a complete response (CR) and two patients achieving a partial response. Of the 17 patients with bone marrow involvement at enrollment, 15 achieved a confirmed CR. Fourteen of 15 patients with bulky disease (> or = 5 cm) had a CR after treatment completion. After a median follow-up of 8.4 years, the median response duration had not been reached (range, 3 to 111+ months). Five-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 56% and 83%, respectively. The most common grade > or = 3 hematologic adverse events were neutropenia (87%) and thrombocytopenia (37%). Nineteen patients received growth factor support, and three required blood product transfusions. No patients developed human antimurine antibodies. Two patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: These mature data demonstrate that sequential therapy with a non-anthracycline-containing regimen comprising CVP followed by one cycle of tositumomab and (131)I-tositumomab produced high response rates with adequate safety and durable remissions and that this regimen represents a highly active treatment for first-line therapy of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",,"['Link, Brian K', 'Martin, Peter', 'Kaminski, Mark S', 'Goldsmith, Stanley J', 'Coleman, Morton', 'Leonard, John P']","['Link BK', 'Martin P', 'Kaminski MS', 'Goldsmith SJ', 'Coleman M', 'Leonard JP']","['University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100510,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'K1KT5M40JC (tositumomab I-131)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2010/05/12 06:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2010/05/12 06:00'],"['2010/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.27.8325 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.27.8325 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jun 20;28(18):3035-41. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.27.8325.

Although this suggests a key role for this protein in myeloid disease suppression, experimental evidence to support this has not been reported. To address whether this event is critical for premalignant myeloid disorders and leukemia development, mice were generated that have loss of p15Ink4b specifically in myeloid cells. The p15Ink4b(fl/fl)-LysMcre mice develop nonreactive monocytosis in the peripheral blood accompanied by increased numbers of myeloid and monocytic cells in the bone marrow resembling the myeloproliferative form of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Spontaneous progression from chronic disease to acute leukemia was not observed. Nevertheless, MOL4070LTR retrovirus integrations provided cooperative genetic mutations resulting in a high frequency of myeloid leukemia in knockout mice. Two common retrovirus insertion sites near c-myb and Sox4 genes were identified, and their transcript up-regulated in leukemia, suggesting a collaborative role of their protein products with p15Ink4b-deficiency in promoting malignant disease. This new animal model demonstrates experimentally that p15Ink4b is a tumor suppressor for myeloid leukemia, and its loss may play an active role in the establishment of preleukemic conditions.",,"['Bies, Juraj', 'Sramko, Marek', 'Fares, Joanna', 'Rosu-Myles, Michael', 'Zhang, Steven', 'Koller, Richard', 'Wolff, Linda']","['Bies J', 'Sramko M', 'Fares J', 'Rosu-Myles M', 'Zhang S', 'Koller R', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. biesj@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100510,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cdkn2b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox4 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Genes, myb/physiology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocyte-Macrophage Precursor Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Monocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Precancerous Conditions/*genetics/*pathology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'SOXC Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Spleen/pathology']",2010/05/12 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/05/12 06:00'],"['2010/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34645-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-238360 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Aug 12;116(6):979-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-238360.

PE induced a rapid and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in wild-type (WT) and Bax knockout (Bax(-/-)) MEFs but failed in Bak knockout (Bak(-/-)) and Bax/Bak double-knockout (DKO) MEFs. Also a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed in WT and Bax(-/-) MEFs, but not in Bak(-/-) or in DKO MEFs, indicating an effect of PE on mitochondrial permeability. PE-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis was identical in all 4 cell lines, indicating that differences in killing were due to steps after the ADP-ribosylation of EF2. Mcl-1, but not Bcl-x(L), was rapidly degraded after PE treatment, consistent with a role for Mcl-1 in the PE death pathway. Bak was associated with Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) in MEFs and uncoupled from suppressed complexes after PE treatment. Overexpression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) inhibited PE-induced MEF death.

OBJECTIVE: The Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) allows users to calculate adjusted and unadjusted standardized rates and risks. The RIF is embedded in ArcGIS so that further geographical information system (GIS) spatial functionality can be exploited or results can be exported to statistical packages for further tailored analyses where required. The RIF also links directly to several statistical packages and displays the results in the GIS. METHODS: The value of the RIF is illustrated here with two case studies: risk of leukemia in areas surrounding oil refineries in the State of Utah (USA) and an analysis of the geographical variation of risk of esophageal cancer in relation to zinc cadmium sulfide exposure in Norwich (United Kingdom). RESULTS: The risk analysis study in Utah did not suggest any evidence of increased relative risk of leukemia, multiple myeloma, or Hodgkin's lymphoma in the populations around the five oil-refining facilities but did reveal an excess risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that might warrant further investigation.

Use of hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen carriers as ""bridging treatment"" can be an option. CASE REPORT: This is a report of a 36-year-old Jehovah's Witness diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed severe symptomatic anemia (Hb as low as 3.1 g/dL) during induction chemotherapy and refused allogeneic blood transfusions. Fifteen units of Hemopure (Biopure Corp.), an investigational polymerized bovine Hb-derived artificial oxygen carrier, were administered over a 12-day period after informed consent was obtained. The patient's condition improved. RESULTS: Chart review was performed to identify relevant information about the patient's clinical status during Hemopure treatment. With the use of Hemopure the patient's total Hb level was maintained between 3.6 and 5.3 g/dL, over a 12-day period, without any evidence of ischemia or organ dysfunction indicating that Hemopure was providing adequate tissue oxygen supply until marrow red blood cell recovery. The patient completed the chemotherapy regimen and was discharged in stable condition and has been in remission for 28 months. CONCLUSION: This report documents the successful management of profound anemia in an acute leukemia patient who refused blood transfusion, with the use of Hemopure, to save the patient from the devastating effects of ischemia associated with severe anemia.

Median age at diagnosis of AML was 69 yr in secondary cases when compared to 66 yr in de novo cases (P = 0.006). In univariate analyses, secondary AML was associated with an inferior complete remission (CR) rate (P = 0.008) and poorer overall survival (OS, P = 0.003) whereas in complete remitters, disease-free survival (DFS) of secondary cases was equal to that of de novo cases. Interestingly, in all further analyses of CR-rates, OS and DFS, when correcting for the influence of age, cytogenetic abnormalities, performance status and leucocyte count (WBC), presence of secondary AML completely lost prognostic significance.

Recently we showed in a clinical pilot study in Friedreich's ataxia patients that recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuEPO) significantly increases frataxin-expression. In this in vitro study, we investigated the role of the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) in the frataxin increasing effect of rhuEPO and if nonerythropoietic carbamylated erythropoietin (CEPO), which cannot bind to the classical EPO-R increases frataxin expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our experiments human erythroleukaemic K562 cells (+ EPO-R), human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells (- EPO-R) and isolated primary lymphocytes from healthy control and FRDA patients were incubated with different concentrations of rhuEPO or CEPO. Frataxin-expression was detected by an electrochemical luminescence immunoassay (based on the principle of an ELISA). RESULTS: We show that rhuEPO increases frataxin-expression in K562 cells (expressing EPO-R) as well as in THP-1 cells (without EPO-R expression). These results were confirmed by the finding that CEPO, which cannot bind to the classical EPO-R increased frataxin expression in the same concentration range as rhuEPO. In addition, we show that both EPO derivatives significantly increase frataxin-expression in vitro in control and Friedreich's ataxia patients primary lymphocytes.

Expression of PML/RARA, a potent transcriptional repressor, induces APL in mice. Both retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic trioxide directly target PML/RARA-mediated transcriptional repression and protein stability, inducing rapid differentiation of the promyelocytes and clinical remission in most APL patients. RA also triggers growth arrest and progressive clearance of leukemia initiating cells (LIC), both ex vivo and in vivo. Suboptimal RA concentrations or expression of the PLZF/RARA variant allows complete RA-induced differentiation, but neither LIC clearance nor disease remission. Thus, RA-induced differentiation and LIC clearance may be uncoupled. The RA/arsenic trioxide association, which dramatically synergizes for PML/RARA degradation but not for differentiation, rapidly clears LIC in a proteasome-dependent manner, resulting in APL eradication in murine models and patients. Collectively, these results demonstrate that LIC clearance, which mirrors PML/RARA degradation, is the primary basis for APL cure by the RA/arsenic trioxide association, rather than differentiation.

Such factors include soil and water pollution and the presence of metals and toxic compounds in the air. Measuring the content of metallic elements in rainwater has become an accepted procedure for environmental pollution monitoring. In accordance with the above, it was decided to study relations between the content of selected elements in rainwater and hospitalization frequency due to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, C91 on ICD-10) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, C92 on ICD-10). It can be assumed that hospitalization frequency is a reliable indicator of exacerbations of these diseases. The annual average of hospitalizations due to a given disease during the years 2000-2002 was correlated with the annual average content of a given element in rainwater using the Spearman's correlation indicator to describe the relationship between the element content and the disease that is possibly a consequence of the element's presence in rainwater. In cases of CLL for all the subjected population and for men, no statistically significant correlations were found. For women, statistically significant correlations were found for chromium (r = 0.66), lead (r = 0.58), copper (r = 0.58), and cadmium (r = 0.51). For CML in all the studied population significant, negative correlations were found for magnesium (r = -0.6) and zinc (r = -0.52). In men, significant negative correlations were seen for magnesium (r = -0.69 and zinc (r = -0.55). No significant correlations were found in women.

Through multiple interactions with chromatin regulatory factors, they convert a normal hematopoietic hierarchy into a leukemia cell hierarchy sustained at its apex by a population of inappropriately self-renewing myeloid cells termed leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Initiation of the aberrant leukemia cell hierarchy is associated with an abnormal epigenetic state at Hoxa and Meis1 loci, with concomitant high level Hoxa and Meis1 expression. This introduces at the level of the myeloblast, or thereabouts, a finite probability of self-renewal division where none previously existed. In contrast, differentiation-mediated exit of LSCs from the self-renewing compartment of the leukemia clone depends on the prevailing levels of the transcription factor Myb, which functions as part of an LSC maintenance program influenced, but not directly controlled, by Hoxa and Meis1.

METHODS: Ninety-five patients with incident B-CLL and 95 hospital controls matched on age and gender were studied between 2001 and 2007, and blood samples were collected. Leptin, total and high molecular weight adiponectin, and prognostic markers of B-CLL were determined. RESULTS: Cases had a higher body mass index (BMI) than controls (p = 0.01) and lower levels of leptin (p < 0.01). Significantly more cases than controls presented a family history of lymphohematopoietic cancer (LHC) (p = 0.01). Higher serum leptin levels were associated with lower risk of B-CLL adjusting for age, gender, family history of LHC, BMI and serum adiponectin; the multivariate odds ratio comparing highest to lowest tertile was 0.05 (95% CI 0.01-0.29, p trend < 0.001); Adiponectin was not significantly different between cases and controls.

An in vitro and in vivo mechanistic study.,891-900,10.1007/s10637-010-9441-3 [doi],"Numerous studies suggest that generation of oxidative stress could be useful in cancer treatment. In this study, we evaluated, in vitro and in vivo, the antitumor potential of oxidative stress induced by ascorbate/menadione (asc/men). This combination of a reducing agent (ascorbate) and a redox active quinone (menadione) generates redox cycling leading to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Asc/men was tested in several cell types including K562 cells (a stable human-derived leukemia cell line), freshly isolated leukocytes from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, BaF3 cells (a murine pro-B cell line) transfected with Bcr-Abl and peripheral blood leukocytes derived from healthy donors. Although these latter cells were resistant to asc/men, survival of all the other cell lines was markedly reduced, including the BaF3 cells expressing either wild-type or mutated Bcr-Abl. In a standard in vivo model of subcutaneous tumor transplantation, asc/men provoked a significant delay in the proliferation of K562 and BaF3 cells expressing the T315I mutated form of Bcr-Abl. No effect of asc/men was observed when these latter cells were injected into blood of mice most probably because of the high antioxidant potential of red blood cells, as shown by in vitro experiments. We postulate that cancer cells are more sensitive to asc/men than healthy cells because of their lack of antioxidant enzymes, mainly catalase.

This study aimed at expanding the knowledge on the bioactivities of antioxidatively active G. macrorrhizum butanol fraction, which was isolated from ethanolic extract (EB), and water fraction, which was isolated from water extract (WW) by measuring their singlet oxygen scavenging properties, as well as preliminary assessment of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity toward mammalian cells. The cytotoxicity (necrosis induction) of the extracts in bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) was partly prevented by antioxidants and stimulated by the prooxidant BCNU (N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea). This indicates that the cytotoxicity of G. macrorrhizum extracts is at least partly attributed to their prooxidant action, presumably due to the formation of quinoidal products of their (auto)oxidation. The latter was evidenced by the nature of the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation products, which supported DT-diaphorase-catalyzed oxidation of NADPH and participated in conjugation reactions with reduced glutathione. The genotoxic properties were studied using chromosome aberration (CA) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) tests in human lymphocytes in vitro and Drosophila melanogaster somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in vivo. In the CA test, only the highest doses of both fractions significantly increased chromosome aberration frequency. In the SCE test, both fractions induced SCEs in a clear dose-dependent manner. G. macrorrhizum extracts were not genotoxic in the SMART test in vivo. Our data indicate that in spite of the possible beneficial (antioxidant) effects of Geranium extracts, the possibilities of their use as ingredients of functional foods and/or food supplements should be further examined due to their cyto- and genotoxic effects resulting mainly from the action of quercetin-derived components abundant in the extracts.",,"['Venskutonis, Petras Rimantas', 'Dedonyte, Veronika', 'Lazutka, Juozas', 'Slapsyte, Grazina', 'Maroziene, Audrone', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene, Ausra', 'Cenas, Narimantas', 'Miliauskas, Giedrius']","['Venskutonis PR', 'Dedonyte V', 'Lazutka J', 'Slapsyte G', 'Maroziene A', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene A', 'Cenas N', 'Miliauskas G']","['Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology, Lithuania. rimas.venskutonis@ktu.lt <rimas.venskutonis@ktu.lt>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100506,Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations/drug effects', 'Drosophila/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/*drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Geranium/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Singlet Oxygen/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2010/05/11 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/05/11 06:00'],"['2009/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['20101902 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2010;57(2):157-63.

Despite the apparent clinical efficacy of ACT, the timely preparation of a sufficient number of cancer antigen-specific T cells for each patient has been recognized as its biggest limitation. Currently, therefore, attention is being focused on ACT with engineered T cells produced using cancer antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer. With regard to human leukemia, ACT using engineered T cells bearing the leukemia antigen-specific TCR gene still remains in its infancy. However, several reports have provided preclinical data on TCR gene transfer using Wilms' tumor gene product 1 (WT1), and also preclinical and clinical data on TCR gene transfer involving minor histocompatibility antigen, both of which have been suggested to provide additional clinical benefit.

Approximately 40% of cases are associated with other congenital defects, particularly malformations of the upper limb or craniofacial region. Mutations in the gene coding for the ribosomal protein RPS19 have been identified in 25% of patients with DBA, with resulting impairment of 18S rRNA processing and 40S ribosomal subunit formation. Moreover, mutations in other ribosomal protein coding genes account for about 25% of other DBA cases. Recently, the analysis of mice from which the gene coding for the heme exporter Feline Leukemia Virus subgroup C Receptor (FLVCR1) is deleted suggested that this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of DBA. FLVCR1-null mice show a phenotype resembling that of DBA patients, including erythroid failure and malformations. Interestingly, some DBA patients have disease linkage to chromosome 1q31, where FLVCR1 is mapped. Moreover, it has been reported that cells from DBA patients express alternatively spliced isoforms of FLVCR1 which encode non-functional proteins.

Therefore, it has been logically assumed that the enzyme responsible for viral RNA replication process, influenza virus type A RNA polymerase (IAV Pol), is a highly error-prone polymerase which provides the genomic mutations necessary for viral evolution and host adaptation. Importantly, however, the actual enzyme fidelity of IAV RNA polymerase has never been characterized. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we established new biochemical assay conditions that enabled us to assess both polymerase activity with physiological NTP pools and enzyme fidelity of IAV Pol. We report that IAV Pol displays highly active RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity at unbiased physiological NTP substrate concentrations. With this robust enzyme activity, for the first time, we were able to compare the enzyme fidelity of IAV Pol complex with that of bacterial phage T7 RNA polymerase and the reverse transcriptases (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and murine leukemia virus (MuLV), which are known to be low and high fidelity enzymes, respectively. We observed that IAV Pol displayed significantly higher fidelity than HIV-1 RT and T7 RNA polymerase and equivalent or higher fidelity than MuLV RT. In addition, the IAV Pol complex showed increased fidelity at lower temperatures. Moreover, upon replacement of Mg(++) with Mn(++), IAV Pol displayed increased polymerase activity, but with significantly reduced processivity, and misincorporation was slightly elevated in the presence of Mn(++). Finally, when the IAV nucleoprotein (NP) was included in the reactions, the IAV Pol complex exhibited enhanced polymerase activity with increased fidelity. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study indicates that IAV Pol is a high fidelity enzyme. We envision that the high fidelity nature of IAV Pol may be important to counter-balance the multiple rounds of IAV genome amplification per infection cycle, which provides IAV Pol with ample opportunities to generate and amplify genomic founder mutations, and thus achieve optimal viral mutagenesis for its evolution.",,"['Aggarwal, Shilpa', 'Bradel-Tretheway, Birgit', 'Takimoto, Toru', 'Dewhurst, Stephen', 'Kim, Baek']","['Aggarwal S', 'Bradel-Tretheway B', 'Takimoto T', 'Dewhurst S', 'Kim B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100429,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",IM,"['DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/*enzymology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']",2010/05/11 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2010/05/11 06:00'],"['2010/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0010372 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Apr 29;5(4):e10372. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0010372.,['HHSN266200700008C/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2861597,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the function of Abl has been extensively studied in leukemia, its role in epithelial cell invasion remains obscure.

Our in vivo data indicate that dAbl acts downstream of the Src kinases, which are known regulators of cell adhesion and invasion. Downstream of dAbl, Rac GTPases activate two distinct MAPK pathways: c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling (required for cell invasion and apoptosis) and ERK signaling (inducing cell proliferation). Activated Abl also increases the activity of Src members through a positive feedback loop leading to signal amplification.

We focused on the north-western part of the country to describe clinical phenotypes, especially severe forms of the disease, and AIRE gene mutations. METHODS: Clinical and immunological data were collected, and pathological mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were identified with APS1. Clinical manifestations varied greatly, showing 1-10 components. Mucocutaneous candidiasis, adrenal failure, hypoparathyroidism, alopecia and other severe infections were the most frequent components. Four patients had severe forms, needing immunosuppressive therapy: 2 for hepatitis; 1 for severe malabsorption, and 1 for a T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia. These therapies were very effective but caused general discomfort. One patient died of septicemia. Four different AIRE gene mutations were identified, and a 13-bp deletion in exon 8 (c.967-979del13) was the most prevalent. There was at least one allele correlating with this mutation and alopecia occurrence (p = 0.003). No novel mutation was detected. CONCLUSION: APS1 appears to be rare in north-western France. We identified 4 cases with a severe form needing immunosuppressive therapy. The AIRE gene mutations are more like those found in north-western Europe than those found in Finland.","['Copyright (c) 2010 S.

CD99 is strongly expressed by certain pediatric cancers including BCP-ALL. Modulation of the antigen in ETs and T cells induces apoptosis, hence implicating CD99 as a potential target for anti-cancer therapy. However, nothing is known about these aspects in BCPs. We investigated BCP-ALL cases and normal BCP cells from pediatric BM for CD99 protein and RNA expression as well as for effects of CD99 modulation by mAb. Immunophenotypes, recovery, apoptosis, and aggregation were assessed. Flow cytometry, light microscopy, and qRT-PCR were used in our experiments. An association of CD99 expression levels with the cytogenetic background of pediatric BCP-ALLs was found. Highest CD99 levels were observed in hyperdiploid, followed by TEL/AML1 and random karyotype leukemias. CD99 ligation moderately induced cell death only in TEL/AML1 cases. Stroma cell contact mitigated this effect. Very immature normal BCPs were the most sensitive to CD99-mediated death induction. Type I CD99 mRNA was the main isoform in ALLs and was expressed differentially during BCP maturation. Our data suggest that clinical targeting of CD99 may be effective in BCP-ALL-bearing TEL/AML1 but also may elicit negative effects on normal B-lymphopoiesis.

Myeloid Src family kinases such as Hck and Lyn are often overexpressed in imatinib-resistant CML cells that lack Bcr-Abl mutations. Here we tested whether Hck overexpression is sufficient to induce imatinib resistance using both wild-type Hck and a mutant (Hck-T338A) that is uniquely sensitive to the pyrazolo-pyrimidine inhibitor, NaPP1. Expression of either kinase in K562 CML cells caused resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis and inhibition of soft-agar colony formation. Treatment with NaPP1 restored sensitivity to imatinib in cells expressing T338A but not wild-type Hck, demonstrating that resistance requires Hck kinase activity. NaPP1 also reduced Hck-mediated phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl at sites that may affect imatinib sensitivity exclusively in cells expressing Hck-T338A.

Despite a positive initial response, however, most treated cancers eventually progress due to development of HU resistance. Although RNR properties influence HU resistance in cell lines, the mechanisms underlying cancer HU resistance in vivo remain unclear. To address this issue, we screened for HU resistance in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and identified seventeen unique catalase mutants, thereby establishing that HU toxicity depends on catalase in vivo. We further demonstrated that catalase is a direct HU target by showing that HU acts as a competitive inhibitor of catalase-mediated hydrogen peroxide decomposition. Considering also that catalase can accelerate HU decomposition in vitro and that co-treatment with another catalase inhibitor alleviates HU effects in vivo, our findings suggests that HU could act as a catalase-activated pro-drug.

In this regard, most studies have focused on the role of T- and NK-cells as the critical immune effector cells. However, macrophages play a major role in the recognition and clearance of foreign, aged, and damaged cells. Macrophage phagocytosis is negatively regulated via the receptor SIRPalpha upon binding to CD47, a ubiquitously expressed protein. We recently showed that CD47 is up-regulated in myeloid leukemia and migrating hematopoietic progenitors, and that the level of protein expression correlates with the ability to evade phagocytosis. These results implicate macrophages in the immunosurveillance of hematopoietic cells and leukemias. The ability of macrophages to phagocytose tumor cells might be exploited therapeutically by blocking the CD47-SIRPalpha interaction.",['2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Anthracyclines have been reported to contaminate chemotherapy workstation surfaces as well as other workplaces surfaces. The occupational exposure to these drugs could occur in hospitals, for nurses involved in anthracyclines preparation and administration, in chemical industries during the commercial formulate syntheses, and in analytical laboratories. Numerous studies investigated cutaneous effects related to DOXO administration, on the contrary few literature data are available about effects on the skin due to the direct contact with the drug. The present study investigated the DOXO permeability of three commercially available gloves' types used to protect skin in occupational contexts, as well as the effects of DOXO on human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). The results suggest that the DOXO permeability of gloves depends not only on glove material but also on DOXO solutions' pH, in fact nitrile gloves can be penetrated by acid solutions, while neither natural rubbers nor nitrile gloves are permeable to neutral solutions. Moreover, DOXO solutions, even at low concentration, cause apoptosis in epithelial cells, through activation of intrinsic pathway p53-independent.",['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the clinical use of DNR has been limited by its undesirable systemic toxicity, especially in the heart and kidney. This study was designed to test the effectiveness of carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker against DNR-induced cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Rats were treated with a cumulative dose of 9 mg/kg body weight DNR (i.v.). Carvedilol was administered orally every day for 6 weeks. DNR rats showed cardiac and nephrotoxicities as evidenced by worsening cardiac and kidney functions, which were evaluated by hemodynamic and echocardiographic studies, and by measuring protein in urine, levels of urea and creatinine in serum, lipid profiles, malondialdeyde level and the total level of glutathione peroxidase activity in both heart and kidney tissues. These changes were reversed by treatment with carvedilol, which resulted in significant improvement in the cardio-renal function. Furthermore, carvedilol down-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression in the heart, increased nephrin expression in the kidney, and attenuated the increased protein expression of NADPH oxidase subunits in heart and kidney. Moreover, carvedilol reduced myocardial and renal apoptosis and improved the histopathological changes in heart and kidney induced by DNR. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a beneficial effect of carvedilol treatment in the prevention of DNR-induced cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity by reversing the oxidative stress and apoptosis.",['2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In addition to its canonical histone methyltransferase SET domain, the MLL protein contains three plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers that are well conserved between species but whose potential roles and requirements for MLL function are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the third PHD domain of MLL (PHD3) binds histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) with high affinity and specificity and H3K4me2 with 8-fold lower affinity. Biochemical and structural analyses using NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy identified key amino acids essential for the interaction with H3K4me3. Site-directed mutations of the residues involved in recognition of H3K4me3 compromised in vitro H3K4me3 binding but not in vivo localization of full-length MLL to chromatin sites in target promoters of MEIS1 and HOXA genes. Whereas intact PHD3 finger was necessary for MLL occupancy at these promoters, H3K4me3 binding was critical for MLL transcriptional activity. These results demonstrate that MLL occupancy and target gene activation can be functionally separated. Furthermore, these findings reveal that MLL not only ""writes"" the H3K4me3 mark but also binds the mark, and this binding is required for the transcriptional maintenance functions of MLL.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the damage caused by MTX on liver mitochondria and its protection by using antioxidant properties of lipoic acid. MTX substantially affects mitochondrial function by reducing glutathione levels leading to disturbances in antioxidant enzyme defense system. Lipoic acid occurs naturally in mitochondria as a coenzyme. In various studies lipoic acid has been convincingly shown to exhibit an antioxidant role when supplemented exogenously. We studied the effect of lipoic acid pre-treatment on the toxicity of MTX in mouse liver mitochondria focusing specifically on the oxidative stress. MTX caused a significant rise in the mitochondrial lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl (PC) content and superoxide radical generation. It also affected the mitochondrial thiol profile. Pre-treatment of mice with lipoic acid (35 mg/kg) markedly lowered mitochondrial LPO, PC content and superoxide radical generation. It also restored decreased enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants of mitochondria. It is suggested that lipoic acid has a potential role in suppressing MTX-induced mitochondrial toxicity, and it affords protection either by reversing the decline of antioxidants or by the directly scavenging the free radicals.",['2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Cancer cells have shrunken signaling networks, and therefore tend to be dependent on fewer signaling modules than non-cancerous cells. Thus, targeted therapy holds the promise of efficacy with minimal toxicity. Yet, with the notable exception of Gleevec for the treatment of early chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), targeted therapies have so far had minimal success. Unlike early CML, which is dependent upon BCR-ABL, most cancers are not dependent on a single survival factor. Furthermore, tumors are constantly evolving entities, and are heterogeneous in their cellular makeup, compounding the challenge. ""Smart cocktails"", comprising rational combinations of therapies, need to be developed to meet this challenge. What are the best pathways to target, and why?

Compound C, a cell-permeable pyrrazolopyrimidine derivative, acts as a potent, selective, reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In this study, we show that compound C sensitizes Caki human renal cancer cells, but not normal human skin fibroblast cells (HSF) and human mesangial cells, to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. However, AMPK siRNA failed to affect TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in Caki cells and transduction of dominant negative AMPK rather attenuated TRAIL-induced apoptosis, indicating that the effect of compound C on sensitization of TRAIL-induced apoptosis is independent of AMPK activity. Interestingly, we found that down-regulation of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 contributes to compound C-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Reduced expression of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 were caused by the decreased protein stability of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1, but not by their transcriptional control, in compound C-treated cells. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly inhibited the cell death induced by the combined treatment with compound C and TRAIL as well as recovered the expression levels of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 down-regulated by the combinatory treatment with compound C plus TRAIL, suggesting that compound C-stimulated TRAIL-induced apoptosis appears to be dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species for down-regulation of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that compound C enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human renal cancer cells by ROS-mediated c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 down-regulation.",['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: From Oct 13, 2002, to June 19, 2008, 232 patients with de-novo AML (n=206), therapy-related or myelodysplasia-related AML (n=12), or mixed-lineage leukaemia (n=14) were enrolled at eight centres. 230 patients were assigned by block, non-blinded randomisation, stratified by cytogenetic or morphological subtype, to high-dose (18 g/m(2), n=113) or low-dose (2 g/m(2), n=117) cytarabine given with daunorubicin and etoposide (ADE; induction 1). The primary aim of the study was to compare the incidence of MRD positivity of the high-dose group and the low-dose group at day 22 of induction 1. Induction 2 consisted of ADE with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody); consolidation therapy included three additional courses of chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Levels of MRD were used to allocate GO and to determine the timing of induction 2. Both MRD and genetic abnormalities at diagnosis were used to determine the final risk classification. Low-risk patients (n=68) received five courses of chemotherapy, whereas high-risk patients (n=79), and standard-risk patients (n=69) with matched sibling donors, were eligible for HSCT (done for 48 high-risk and eight standard-risk patients). All 230 randomised patients were analysed for the primary endpoint. Other analyses were limited to the 216 patients with AML, excluding those with mixed-lineage leukaemia. This trial is closed to accrual and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00136084. FINDINGS: Complete remission was achieved in 80% (173 of 216 patients) after induction 1 and 94% (203 of 216) after induction 2. Induction failures included two deaths from toxic effects and ten cases of resistant leukaemia. The introduction of high-dose versus low-dose cytarabine did not significantly lower the rate of MRD-positivity after induction 1 (34%vs 42%, p=0.17). The 6-month cumulative incidence of grade 3 or higher infection was 79.3% (SE 4.0) for patients in the high-dose group and 75.5% (4.2) for the low-dose group. 3-year event-free survival and overall survival were 63.0% (SE 4.1) and 71.1% (3.8), respectively. 80% (155 of 193) of patients achieved MRD of less than 0.1% after induction 2, and the cumulative incidence of relapse for this group was 17% (SE 3). MRD of 1% or higher after induction 1 was the only significant independent adverse prognostic factor for both event-free (hazard ratio 2.41, 95% CI 1.36-4.26; p=0.003) and overall survival (2.11, 1.09-4.11; p=0.028). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the use of targeted chemotherapy and HSCT, in the context of a comprehensive risk-stratification strategy based on genetic features and MRD findings, can improve outcome in patients with childhood AML.

The primary objective of this review was to analyze the current state of knowledge on the association between environmental exposure to non-ionizing radiation and the risk of childhood leukemia. Scientific publications between 1979 and 2008 that include examination of this association have been reviewed using the MEDLINE/PubMed database. Studies to date have not convincingly confirmed or ruled out an association between non-ionizing radiation and the risk of childhood leukemia. Discrepancies among the conclusions of the studies may also be influenced by confounding factors, selection bias, and misclassification. Childhood defects can result from genetic or epigenetic damage and from effects on the embryo or fetus, which may both be related to environmental exposure of the parent before conception or during the pregnancy. It is therefore critical for researchers to define a priori the type and ""window"" of exposure to be assessed. Methodological problems to be solved include the proper diagnostic classification of individuals and the estimated exposure to non-ionizing radiation, which may act through various mechanisms of action. There appears to be an urgent need to reconsider exposure limits for low frequency and static magnetic fields, based on combined experimental and epidemiological research into the relationship between exposure to non-ionizing radiation and adverse human health effects.",,"['Calvente, I', 'Fernandez, M F', 'Villalba, J', 'Olea, N', 'Nunez, M I']","['Calvente I', 'Fernandez MF', 'Villalba J', 'Olea N', 'Nunez MI']","['Laboratory of Medical Investigations, San Cecilio University Hospital, CIBER de Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20100507,Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,,IM,"['Child', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology']",2010/05/11 06:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/05/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0048-9697(10)00310-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.03.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 2010 Jul 15;408(16):3062-9. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.03.039.

To assess the role of FeLV-B in the induction of multicentric lymphoma and other non-T-cell disease, the frequency of occurrence and nature of FeLV-B were examined in diseased tissues from a large collection of FeLV-infected animals.

The present study shows that expression of the protein promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-finger (PLZF) does not occur in all cells, only in gonocytes in neonatal testis (Stage 1) and a subpopulation of Type A spermatogonia in peripubertal (Stage 2), prepubertal (Stage 3) and post-pubertal (Stage 4) ovine testes. Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) lectin binding does not occur at any stage of testis development. The numbers of putative undifferentiated spermatogonia, germ cells and Sertoli cells were assessed by PLZF, VASA and vimentin staining, respectively. In paraffin sections, the percentage of PLZF-positive cells per tubule in samples derived from Stage 2 testis (12.2 + or - 2.8%) was twofold higher than that from Stage 1 testis (6.4 + or - 0.4%), but the percentages decreased in Stage 3 and Stage 4 testes (4.6 + or - 0.7% and 3.1 + or - 0.6%, respectively). Single cell suspensions from Stage 1 and Stage 2 testis were generated by two-step enzymatic digestion. The spermatogonia were enriched by 2 h and 2 + 16 h (overnight) differential plating on 0.2% gelatin-coated coated flasks. For Stage 1 testes, a sixfold increase in PLZF-positive cells was observed in 2 h differential plating and an almost 10-fold increase was produced following 2 + 16 h enrichment. There was less than a twofold increase in PLZF-positive cells between the 2 h and 2 + 16 h differential plating. A similar level of enrichment efficiency was also obtained for Stage 2 testis, but the percentage of PLZF-positive cells in the final enrichment was approximately one-third of that Stage 1. The efficiency of isolation and/or enrichment of PLZF-positive cells appears to depend on the maturity of the testis and the neonatal testis is better suited for isolation of gonocytes and/or putative SSCs.",,"['Borjigin, Uyunbilig', 'Davey, Rhonda', 'Hutton, Keryn', 'Herrid, Muren']","['Borjigin U', 'Davey R', 'Hutton K', 'Herrid M']","['CSIRO Livestock Industries, FD McMaster Laboratory, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Vimentin)', '0 (dolichos biflorus agglutinin)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Separation/methods/veterinary', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Male', 'Plant Lectins', 'Seminiferous Tubules/cytology', 'Sexual Maturation', 'Sheep/*metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/chemistry/*cytology', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/*cytology', 'Testis/*chemistry/*cytology/growth & development', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/analysis', 'Vimentin/analysis']",2010/05/11 06:00,2010/07/02 06:00,['2010/05/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['RD09237 [pii]', '10.1071/RD09237 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 2010;22(5):733-42. doi: 10.1071/RD09237.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The degree of cellular maturation was verified by NBT reduction test and immunophenotyping. Expression of unspliced WT1, WT1 (17AA+) and WT1 (KTS+) were determined by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR during the induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The relative ratio of four splicing variants WT1 (+/+), WT1 (+/-), WT1 (-/+), WT1 (-/-) were analyzed. RESULTS: During the induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, NBT reduction rate and CD11b positive rate increased significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). The expression of WT1 gene decreased from (4.17 +/- 2.21) x 10(-3) at 0 hour to (7.53 +/- 2.30) x 10(-4) at the 96th hour. The ratio of 17AA+decreased from 0.60 +/- 0.05 at 0 hour to 0.42 +/- 0.08 at the 96th hour. The ratio of KTS+ decreased from 0.53 +/- 0.08 at 0 hour to 0.41 +/- 0.04 at the 96th hour.

METHODS: From Oct. 2007 to Mar. 2009, 93 unexplained infertile women underwent hysteroscopy examination at 7 approximately 9 days after a spontaneous ovulation in Family Planning Research Institute of Guangdong Province. According to the endometrial glandular openings and vascular shape, 79 cases without pathological endometrial changes were divided into 60 cases in good endometrium group and 19 cases in poor endometrium group. The following clinical parameters were analyzed and compared between two groups, including endometrial configuration, thickness, secretion, the development and number of pinopodes, vascular distribution, and the level of sex hormone, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and glycodelin in the uterine flushing, and pregnancy outcome. RESULTS: (1) There was no statistical difference in the level of serum estrogen and progesterone at the phase of implantation window, which were (518 +/- 176) pmol/L, (40 +/- 20) nmol/L in good group and (513 +/- 244) pmol/L, (37 +/- 19) nmol/L in poor group (P < 0.05).

METHODS: From March 2001 to February 2009, 60 patients with MDS underwent allo-HSCT in our hospital were enrolled in this study. The conditioning regimens were Myleran (BU)/Cyclophosphamide (Cy) or Flu for identical sibling HSCT, and BU/Cy or Flu plus anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) for haploidentical and unrelated HSCT. Cyclosporine A and short-course MTX were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Diseased free survival (DFS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Total DFS rate was 75.3%. The relapse rate was 20%. DFS rates in RA/RAS/5q-, RCMD, RAEB-I/RAEB-II and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) subgroups were 84.6%, 80.0%, 81.0%, 56.2%, respectively (P > 0.05). DFS rates in IPSS low risk group, intermediate-I risk group, intermediate-I risk group and high risk group were 80.0%, 84.6%, 81.8% and 65.4%, respectively (P > 0.05). DFS rates for allo-HSCT from identical sibling, unrelated or haploidentical donors were 79.2%, 60.0%, 76.9%, respectively (P = 0.028). DFS rates for percentages of blasts in bone marrow pre-transplant were 87.0%, 65.5%, 75.0% in < 5% blasts, 5% - 20% blasts, > 20% blasts subgroups, respectively (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Since favorable clinical outcomes have been seen in all kinds of MDS by allo-HSCT, HSCT should be the first-line therapy for MDS. No significant differences are found based on different stem cell donors and the percentages of bone marrow blasts pre-HSCT, unrelated or haploidentical donors should be important alternatives if there is no identical sibling available. Chemotherapy before transplantation is not necessary except overt acute leukemia.

Both polymers were expected to anchor to the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane through hydrophobic interactions. We followed the kinetics of these fluorescently labeled amphiphilic polymers (fPEG-lipid, fPVA-alkyl) over time on living cells with confocal scanning laser microscopy and flow cytometry. We found that fPEG-lipids and fPVA-alkyl polymers were not cytotoxic, and they were released from the cell surface without triggering endocytosis. The gradual release from the cell surface was influenced by the hydrophobicity of the alkyl chains, which affected their stability. The amphiphilic polymers tended to aggregate on the cell surface; in particular, the aggregation of PVA-alkyl was clearly identified. Although most of PEG-lipids and PVA-alkyl polymers did not appear to in the cytoplasm, the cells were able to endocytose lipid molecules, as expected.

Leukocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood from healthy donors. Breast carcinoma derived tumor cells (MCF-7, BT-20) and myeloid leukaemia cells (OCI-AML3) were prepared from cell cultures. Raman images were collected from dried cells on calcium fluoride slides using 785 nm laser excitation. Unsupervised statistical methods (hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis) were used to visualize spectral differences and cluster formation according to the cell type. With the help of supervised statistical methods (support vector machines) a classification model with 99.7% accuracy rates for the differentiation of the cells was built. The model was successfully applied to identify single cells from an independent mixture of cells based on their vibrational spectra. The classification was confirmed by fluorescence staining of the cells after the Raman measurement.","['(c) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AIM: Critical analysis of the morphology and immunophenotypic profile of MTNKL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 380 consecutive cases of mature lymphoid neoplasm that presented as leukemia and were diagnosed on morphology and immunophenotyping of bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples. RESULTS: Peripheral blood and bone marrow involvement was seen in all cases. MTNKL constituted 4% (nine cases) of all mature lymphoid neoplasms presenting as leukemia. It included four cases of T-large granular leukemia (T-LGL), two of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia small cell variant (T-PLL), two of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and one of primary cutaneous gamma delta T-cell lymphoma (PCGDTCL). T-LGL revealed CD4-/CD8+ phenotype in three, and CD4+/CD8+ phenotype in one case. CD56 was absent in all the cases of T-LGL. One case of T- PLL small cell variant showed CD4+/CD8- phenotype, while the other revealed CD4-/CD8+ phenotype. Both cases of ATLL showed CD4+/CD8+/CD25+ phenotype. The single case of PCGDTCL showed CD4-/CD8- phenotype pattern. CD3 and CD5 were expressed in all MTNKL. CD7 was absent in three cases of T-LGL. TCRalpha/beta was performed in three cases of T-LGL and was positive in all. TCRalpha/beta was also seen in both the cases of T-PLL small variant. However, TCRalpha/beta was seen in the single case of PCGDTCL. CONCLUSION: Mature nodal T/NK cell neoplasms are rare and MTNKL presenting as leukemia are even rarer.

Although testicular relapse is rare with modern risk-adapted treatment protocols, earlier, the testes were a frequently encountered site of relapse and were designated as ""drug sanctuaries"". PURPOSE: This descriptive study was designed to assess the pattern of testicular relapse and to identify high-risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data obtained from case records of 407 boys with ALL were analyzed. Fine needle aspiration cytology was carried out in children presenting with painless enlargement of testi(e)s. Bone marrow aspiration and cerebrospinal fluid examination were performed concomitantly to confirm or exclude disease at these sites. RESULTS: Testicular relapse was documented in 30 boys. It was isolated in 17 patients and associated with bone marrow and/or central nervous system relapse in 13. At relapse, nine boys were over the age of 10 years. The majority were very early and early relapsers. Hyperleucocytosis was documented in five of 30 and seven of 137 relapsers and nonrelapsers, respectively (P = 0.04). Twelve of the 30 boys with testicular relapse were treated with testicular irradiation, reinduction and maintenance therapy. The estimated median overall survival was 33 months. CONCLUSION: Testicular relapse, which depends on the therapy administered, may manifest several months/years after completion of treatment.

Recently, HTLV-1 proviral loads have been evaluated as important predictors of ATL, but a few small prospective studies have been conducted. We prospectively evaluated 1218 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (426 males and 792 females) who were enrolled during 2002 to 2008. The proviral load at enrollment was significantly higher in males than females (median, 2.10 vs 1.39 copies/100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]; P < .001), in those 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years of age than that of those 40 years of age and younger (P = .02 and .007, respectively), and in those with a family history of ATL than those without the history (median, 2.32 vs 1.33 copies/100 PBMCs; P = .005).

Because the vermis is involved in motor and cognitive functioning, the goal of this prospective longitudinal study was to evaluate treatment-related changes in vermal volumes and neuropsychologic performance in children receiving brain radiation of the cerebellum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients (mean age, 11.6 years) and 10 healthy children (mean age, 12.1 years) were examined. Lobar vermal volumes and performance on neuropsychologic tests evaluating motor, visual, verbal, attention, memory, and executive functions were assessed at baseline and at 6-month follow-up visits. RESULTS: At baseline, lower mean vermal volumes and impaired performance on visual-spatial and fine-motor tasks were detected in patients. At 6-month follow-up, further decrease in vermal volumes was detected only in patients with medulloblastoma, who received the largest radiation doses to the entire vermis. The volume decrease was not associated with reduction in neuropsychologic performance compared with baseline. At 6-month follow-up, data from all subjects revealed an association between smaller vermal volumes and slower fine-motor speed and lower visual-spatial skills. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced brain-tissue volumes following radiation have been reported previously in pediatric patients. In this study, lower vermal volumes were detected even earlier, before radiation treatment was initiated or completed. Six months postradiation, vermal volume decreases detected in patients with medulloblastoma were not accompanied by declines in already poor neuropsychologic performance. In addition to radiation, the presence of brain malignancies and preradiation treatment may be important factors affecting cerebellar vermis tissue.",,"['Horska, A', 'Laclair, A', 'Mohamed, M', 'Wells, C T', 'McNutt, T', 'Cohen, K J', 'Wharam, M', 'Mahone, E M', 'Kates, W']","['Horska A', 'Laclair A', 'Mohamed M', 'Wells CT', 'McNutt T', 'Cohen KJ', 'Wharam M', 'Mahone EM', 'Kates W']","['Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore,MD, USA. ahorska@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100506,United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

However, findings are inconsistent and the role of specific chemicals is not known. Objective To investigate the role of occupational exposure to organic solvents in the aetiology of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) and its major subtypes, as well as Hodgkin's lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma. METHODS: 2348 lymphoma cases and 2462 controls participated in a case-control study in six European countries. A subset of cases were reviewed by a panel of pathologists to ensure diagnostic consistency. Exposure to solvents was assessed by industrial hygienists and occupational experts based on a detailed occupational questionnaire. RESULTS: Risk of follicular lymphoma significantly increased with three independent metrics of exposure to benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) (combined p=4 x 10(-7)) and to styrene (p=1 x 10(-5)), and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) risk increased with exposure to solvents overall (p=4 x 10(-6)), BTX (p=5 x 10(-5)), gasoline (p=8 x 10(-5)) and other solvents (p=2 x 10(-6)). Risk of B-NHL for ever exposure to solvents was not elevated (OR=1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3), and that for CLL and follicular lymphoma was 1.3 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.6) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.7), respectively. Exposure to benzene accounted, at least partially, for the association observed with CLL risk. Hodgkin's lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma did not show an association with solvent exposure. CONCLUSION: This analysis of a large European dataset confirms a role of occupational exposure to solvents in the aetiology of B-NHL, and particularly, CLL. It is suggested that benzene is most likely to be implicated, but we cannot exclude the possibility of a role for other solvents in relation to other lymphoma subtypes, such as follicular lymphoma.

Although its etiology is largely unknown, leukemia is believed to result from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Among different potential risk factors, the possible role of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been questioned. METHODS: To assess the association between maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and childhood leukemia, a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies was done. RESULTS: Twenty-one case-control studies were included in categorical and dose-response meta-analyses. No cohort study was identified. Analyses were conducted by type of leukemia, children's age at diagnosis, and type of alcoholic beverage and trimester of pregnancy at alcohol use. Alcohol intake during pregnancy (yes versus no) was statistically significantly associated with childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [odds ratio (OR), 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.15] but not with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.93-1.29). Heterogeneity between studies was observed. The OR of AML for an increase of a drink per week was 1.24 (95% CI, 0.94-1.64). The association of alcohol intake during pregnancy with AML was observed for cancers diagnosed at age 0 to 4 years (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.85-3.89) in five studies without heterogeneity (I2<or=0.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of case-control studies indicate that maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with a significantly increased risk of AML in young children.

METHODS: Using the British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a population-based cohort of 17,981 individuals diagnosed with childhood cancer (1940-1991) and surviving>or=5 years, 14,836 were eligible for a questionnaire that ascertained drinking behavior, as previously ascertained in the 2002 General Household Survey throughout Britain. RESULTS: Of 10,389 survivors who responded, 77.2% were alcohol drinkers, 23.8% consumed over weekly recommendations, and 3.9% consumed potentially harmful amounts. Survivors were less likely than the general population to be a current drinker {odds ratio [OR; 99% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.52 (0.46-0.60)}, consume over weekly recommended levels [OR (99% CI): 0.65 (0.58-0.73)], and consume harmful amounts [OR (99% CI): 0.40 (0.32-0.49)]. Survivors of a central nervous system neoplasm or leukemia, particularly those treated with brain irradiation, were the least likely to have adverse drinking behaviors when compared with the general population. However, survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, bone sarcoma, and soft tissue sarcoma had adverse drinking behaviors at levels expected from the general population. CONCLUSION: Overall adverse drinking behaviors were less frequent in survivors than expected from the general population, but subgroups with adverse drinking behaviors were identified, and it is these subgroups who are most in need of intervention.

The MIF -173C allele results in increased MIF promoter activity and is associated with a higher serum MIF level. We hypothesized that this polymorphism may contribute to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility. We genotyped the MIF -173G/C polymorphism (rs755622) in 346 ALL cases and 516 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population and found that the variant genotype GC and the combined genotypes GC/CC were associated with a significantly higher risk of childhood ALL [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.93 for GC and adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=1.01-1.89 for GC/CC]. In addition, we found that the increased risk was more pronounced among high-risk ALL and B-phenotype ALL patients. Our results suggest that the MIF -173G/C polymorphism is involved in the etiology of childhood ALL and is a potential candidate gene for determining cancer susceptibility.

We compared the analytical performance of the Siemens ADVIA 2120 to the Beckman-Coulter LH750 in the detection of blasts. In the study, 390 blood samples were analyzed from a general hospital population, which included oncology patients. The presence of blasts, as indicated by the analyzers' flags, was compared with the results of a manual differential (regarded as the reference method). The ADVIA 2120 demonstrated 100% sensitivity at detecting blasts compared with 62% using the LH750. This improved sensitivity came at the expense of a lower specificity (49% vs. 86%). The effect of the false-positive and false-negative samples on the laboratory's manual review was partially (false-positive) or completely (false-negative) mitigated by triggering of other criteria.

Testing molecules in cell systems on a large scale, however, is a rate-limiting step in drug discovery or in toxicity assessment. In this study, we developed a low-cost high-throughput method for first-level screening of cytotoxic molecules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used microplate spectrophotometry to measure growth kinetics of human tumour cells that grow in suspension (Molt3) or adherent to the plastic surface of culture wells (HeLa) in standard RPMI medium. Cells were treated with colchicin, idarubicin or paclitaxel under various treatment schedules. The effects were quantified and compared with those measured by optical microscopy using the trypan blue dye exclusion method to reveal dead cells. RESULTS: Proliferation kinetics of tumour cells can be quantified by measuring variations in optical densities of cell samples at 410 and 560 nm wavelengths. For cells that grow in suspension, one single reading at 730 nm may be sufficient to reconstruct growth curves that parallel those obtained by direct cell counting. Effects of the cytotoxic treatments could also be quantified and results compared very favourably with those obtained using standard techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Microplate spectrophotometry is a robust and sensitive method to monitor growth of animal cell populations both in the absence and in the presence of cytotoxic drugs. This method implements existing technologies and can be fully automated.",,"['Tomelleri, C', 'Dalla Pellegrina, C', 'Chignola, R']","['Tomelleri C', 'Dalla Pellegrina C', 'Chignola R']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colchicine/toxicity', 'Culture Media', 'Cytotoxins/*toxicity', 'Epithelial Cells/*drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/economics/instrumentation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/toxicity', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrophotometry/instrumentation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2010/05/08 06:00,2010/06/22 06:00,['2010/05/08 06:00'],"['2010/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['CPR665 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2009.00665.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2010 Apr;43(2):130-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2009.00665.x.,,PMC6496426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Records of 27 patients (aged 17-75) who received 69 (median 3 per patient) (177)Lu-octreotate administrations, including 29 in conjunction with radiosensitising infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (n = 27), or capecitabine (n = 2), between October 2005 and July 2007 subsequent to 1-8 prior cycles of (111)In-pentetreotide therapy were analysed. Toxicity was assessed during and at 8-12 weeks post-treatment, with further long-term assessments including survival status reviewed till death or study close-out date of 1 November 2009. RESULTS: Reduction in blood counts was most marked following the first dose of (177)Lu-octreotate but at early follow-up the only major haematological toxicity was a single case of grade 4 lymphopaenia. Both the presence of bone metastases and the administration of chemotherapy tended to result in greater reduction in blood counts, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. On long-term follow-up, 16 patients (59%) are alive with median overall survival of 36 months (32-44 months from first (177)Lu-octreotate therapy). None of the recorded deaths was directly related to treatment toxicity. One patient had late grade 4 anaemia and thrombocytopaenia secondary to bone marrow failure from progressive infiltration by tumour. No other significant long-term haematological toxicities were recorded and no leukaemia was observed. No renal toxicity was observed on serial serum creatinine or radionuclide glomerular filtration rate (GFR) determination on initial or long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: (177)Lu-octreotate is a safe and well-tolerated therapy for patients who have previously been treated with (111)In-pentetreotide and can be safely combined with radiosensitising chemotherapy. However, caution is recommended in patients with bone metastases. Significant late toxicities including bone marrow or renal failure, or leukaemia directly related to radionuclide therapy, did not occur in our series.",,"['Hubble, Daniel', 'Kong, Grace', 'Michael, Michael', 'Johnson, Val', 'Ramdave, Shakher', 'Hicks, Rodney John']","['Hubble D', 'Kong G', 'Michael M', 'Johnson V', 'Ramdave S', 'Hicks RJ']","[""Centre for Molecular Imaging, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 12 St Andrew's Place, East Melbourne, VIC 3002, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100506,Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (177Lu-octreotate)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (indium-111-octreotide)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '6804DJ8Z9U (Capecitabine)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Capecitabine', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/blood/metabolism/*therapy', 'Octreotide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Organometallic Compounds/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Peptide/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2010/05/07 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/05/07 06:00'],"['2010/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00259-010-1483-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2010 Oct;37(10):1869-75. doi: 10.1007/s00259-010-1483-4.

To explore the prognostic impact of recurrent DNA copy number abnormalities on relapse, we performed high-resolution genomic profiling of 34 paired diagnosis and relapse ALL samples. Recurrent lesions detected at diagnosis, including PAX5, CDKN2A and EBF1, were frequently absent at relapse, indicating that they represent secondary events that may be absent in the relapse-prone therapy-resistant progenitor cell. In contrast, deletions and nonsense mutations in IKZF1 (IKAROS) were highly enriched and consistently preserved at the time of relapse. A targeted copy number screen in an unselected cohort of 131 precursor B-ALL cases, enrolled in the dexamethasone-based Dutch Childhood Oncology Group treatment protocol ALL9, revealed that IKZF1 deletions are significantly associated with poor relapse-free and overall survival rates. Separate analysis of ALL9-treatment subgroups revealed that non-high-risk (NHR) patients with IKZF1 deletions exhibited a approximately 12-fold higher relative relapse rate than those without IKZF1 deletions. Consequently, IKZF1 deletion status allowed the prospective identification of 53% of the relapse-prone NHR-classified patients within this subgroup and, therefore, serves as one of the strongest predictors of relapse at the time of diagnosis with high potential for future risk stratification.",,"['Kuiper, R P', 'Waanders, E', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'van Reijmersdal, S V', 'Venkatachalam, R', 'Scheijen, B', 'Sonneveld, E', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Veerman, A J P', 'van Leeuwen, F N', 'van Kessel, A Geurts', 'Hoogerbrugge, P M']","['Kuiper RP', 'Waanders E', 'van der Velden VH', 'van Reijmersdal SV', 'Venkatachalam R', 'Scheijen B', 'Sonneveld E', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Veerman AJ', 'van Leeuwen FN', 'van Kessel AG', 'Hoogerbrugge PM']","['Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. r.kuiper@antrg.umcn.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100506,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Codon, Nonsense/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/05/07 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/05/07 06:00'],"['2010/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201087 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.87 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jul;24(7):1258-64. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.87.

We aimed to evaluate the immunophenotypic features of non-blastic granulocytes, monocytes, and blasts in patients with MDS and non-clonal disorders using routine flow cytometry (FCM). Moreover, we evaluated the phenotypic abnormalities of mature cells in leukemic patients. METHODS: Marrow aspirates from 60 patients, including 18 with MDS, 18 with leukemia, and 24 with non-clonal disorders (control group), were analyzed using FCM. Blasts, non-blast myeloid cells, and monocytes were gated based on CD45 expression and side scatter (SSC). The phenotypes were then compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: Compared to non-clonal disorders, the granulocytic lineages of MDS showed decreased SSC (P=0.005), increased CD45 intensity (P=0.020), decreased CD10-positive granulocytes (P= 0.030), and a higher CD56-positive rate (P=0.005). It is noteworthy that similar results were obtained in the leukemia group, and these findings were not related to the phenotypes of the leukemic cells. Using blast and monocytic gating, useful parameters for generating a differential diagnosis were not found. CONCLUSIONS: Gating the granulocytic region is a relatively easy method for MDS immunophenotyping. Among the parameters studied, SSC, CD10, and CD56 were the most useful for differentiating MDS from non-clonal disorders. While immunophenotypic changes in MDS appear to be useful for differentiating MDS from non-clonal disorders, these changes were also noted in the mature cells of leukemic patients.",,"['Moon, Hee Won', 'Huh, Jung Won', 'Lee, Miae', 'Hong, Ki Sook', 'Chung, Wha Soon']","['Moon HW', 'Huh JW', 'Lee M', 'Hong KS', 'Chung WS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Konkuk University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/*classification', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*classification', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis', 'Neprilysin/metabolism', 'Phenotype']",2010/05/07 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/05/07 06:00'],"['2010/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['201004097 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.2.97 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2010 Apr;30(2):97-104. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.2.97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fli-1 overexpression leads to erythropoietin-dependent erythroblast proliferation, enhanced survival, and inhibition of terminal differentiation, through activation of the Ras pathway. However, the mechanism by which Fli-1 activates this signal transduction pathway has yet to be identified. Down-regulation of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase-1 (SHIP-1) is associated with erythropoietin-stimulated erythroleukemic cells and correlates with increased proliferation of transformed cells. In this study, we have shown that F-MuLV-infected SHIP-1 knockout mice display accelerated erythroleukemia progression. In addition, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of SHIP-1 in erythroleukemia cells activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathways, blocks erythroid differentiation, accelerates erythropoietin-induced proliferation, and leads to PI 3-K-dependent Fli-1 up-regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays confirmed that Fli-1 binds directly to an Ets DNA binding site within the SHIP-1 promoter and suppresses SHIP-1 transcription. These data provide evidence to suggest that SHIP-1 is a direct Fli-1 target, SHIP-1 and Fli-1 regulate each other in a negative feedback loop, and the suppression of SHIP-1 by Fli-1 plays an important role in the transformation of erythroid progenitors by F-MuLV.",,"['Lakhanpal, Gurpreet K', 'Vecchiarelli-Federico, Laura M', 'Li, You-Jun', 'Cui, Jiu-Wei', 'Bailey, Monica L', 'Spaner, David E', 'Dumont, Daniel J', 'Barber, Dwayne L', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Lakhanpal GK', 'Vecchiarelli-Federico LM', 'Li YJ', 'Cui JW', 'Bailey ML', 'Spaner DE', 'Dumont DJ', 'Barber DL', 'Ben-David Y']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100505,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPP5D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Inpp5d protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*etiology/genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2010/05/07 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/05/07 06:00'],"['2010/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34734-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-250217 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 22;116(3):428-36. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-250217.

Its lifespan can be prolonged by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). However, the signal mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hCG in the maintenance of the viability of granulosa-lutein cells. DESIGN: Granulosa-lutein cells were obtained from women undergoing in vitro fertilization. We examined the effects of hCG on the survival of cultured granulosa-lutein cells. The signal pathway inducing antiapoptotic protein was investigated. RESULTS: hCG enhanced viability of granulosa-lutein cells through antiapoptosis but not proliferation, because the apoptotic marker of annexin V was decreased, but the proliferative markers of Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were not increased. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein, but not B-cell lymphoma protein-2 or B-cell lymphoma protein-xL, was significantly induced by hCG and LH. The granulosa-lutein cells secreted vascular endothelial growth factor that induced endothelial permeability. Mcl-1 small interfering RNA increased DNA fragmentation and diminished the antiapoptotic effect of hCG. hCG induced Mcl-1 expression through the LH/hCG receptor, adenylate cyclase, protein kinase A, and cAMP response element-binding protein signal pathway. Flavopiridol inhibited Mcl-1 production, released cytochrome c, and induced apoptosis of granulosa-lutein cells. CONCLUSIONS: We first demonstrate that hCG prevents apoptosis of granulosa-lutein cells through the induction of Mcl-1 protein via the LH/hCG receptor and a cAMP response element-binding protein-dependent pathway. We may have found the molecular mechanism for luteal rescue during early pregnancy. Mcl-1 prevents apoptosis and increases cell viability but not proliferation as mechanisms for luteal rescue.

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A/p21(waf1/Cip1)) is upregulated by Tax, without perturbation of cell cycle control. During an analysis of the gene expression profiles of ATLL cells, we found very low expression of CDKN1A in ATLL-derived cell lines and ATLL cells from patient samples, and epigenetic abnormalities including promoter methylation are one of the mechanisms for the low CDKN1A expression in ATLL cells. Three HTLV-1-infected cell lines showed high levels of expression of both CDKN1A and Tax, but expression of CDKN1A was detected in only two of six ATLL-derived cell lines. In both the HTLV-1-infected and ATLL cell lines, we found that activated Akt phosphorylates CDKN1A at threonine 145 (T145), leading to cytoplasmic localization of CDKNIA. In HTLV-1-infected cell lines, cytoplasmic CDKN1A did not inhibit the cell cycle after UV irradiation; however, following treatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, CDKN1A was dephosphorylated and relocalized to the nucleus, resulting in suppression of the cell cycle. In the ATLL cell lines, treatment with LY294002 did not inhibit the cell cycle but induced apoptosis with the cytoplasmic localization. Therefore, the low CDKN1A expression in ATLL cells may be a key player in ATLL leukemogenesis, and the abnormal genomic methylation may influence the expression of not only HTLV-1 Tax but also CDKN1A during long-term development of ATLL from the HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes.",,"['Watanabe, Masaaki', 'Nakahata, Shingo', 'Hamasaki, Makoto', 'Saito, Yusuke', 'Kawano, Yohei', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Umeki, Kazumi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Okayama, Akihiko', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Watanabe M', 'Nakahata S', 'Hamasaki M', 'Saito Y', 'Kawano Y', 'Hidaka T', 'Yamashita K', 'Umeki K', 'Taki T', 'Taniwaki M', 'Okayama A', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100505,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*virology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism']",2010/05/07 06:00,2010/08/12 06:00,['2010/05/07 06:00'],"['2010/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00073-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00073-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Jul;84(14):6966-77. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00073-10.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases was performed (1966-2008). Data was extracted and pooled as per the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: Of the 570 identified studies, 10 (3811 patients) met inclusion criteria: three each in prostate cancer and multiple myeloma (MM), two in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and one each in lung cancer, and follicular lymphoma. The analyses showed no survival benefit with early treatment except in prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR]=1.23, 95% CI 1.11-1.37 p<0.001). There was no survival difference in MM (HR=0.92, 95% CI 0.56-1.52 p=0.74), CLL (HR=0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.04 p=0.09), lung cancer (HR=0.95, 95% CI 0.72-1.24 p=0.71), or follicular lymphoma (HR=1, 95% CI 0.55-1.83 p=0.99). No statistically significant difference in response rate between early and late treatment was detected in any cancer type. CONCLUSIONS: Data shows that delaying cancer treatments does not necessarily compromise therapeutic outcomes except possibly in locally advanced prostate cancer.

LSCs resemble HSCs with respect to self-renewal capacity and chemotherapy-resistance. However, LSCs possess specific cell-surface markers, they are proposed to reside within the CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) compartment. And the interaction mediated by adhesion molecules between LSCs and niche played a role in chemoresistance of LSCs. Therefore, study on the LSCs surface makers related to niche is helpful for the potential target therapy in the future. In this study, the proportions of CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) LSCs compartment co-expressing the three adhesion molecules, N-Cadherin, Tie2 and CD44, respectively, from AML patients before and after chemotherapy were analyzed. We demonstrated N-Cadherin and Tie2 positive CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) LSCs populations could be enriched by chemotherapy. Furthermore, AML1/ETO fusion signals and MDR1 expression were detected on the CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) LSCs populations expressing N-Cadherin and Tie2.

SHALs were synthesized with a biotin or DOTA chelate (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid), using a solid-phase lysine-polyethyleneglycol backbone to link sets of ligands shown previously to bind to HLA-DR10. Using cell-binding and death assays and confocal microscopy, SHAL uptake, residualization, and cytocidal activity were evaluated in HLA-DR10 expressing and nonexpressing live, human lymphoma cell lines. All of the SHALs tested were selective for, and accumulated in, expressing cells. Reflecting binding to HLA-DR10 inside the cells, SHALs having the Ct ligand (3-(2-([3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy)-anilino)-3-oxopropanionic acid) residualized in expressing cells greater than 179 times more than accountable by cell-surface membrane HLA-DR10. Confocal microscopy confirmed the intracellular residualization of these SHALs. Importantly, SHALs with a Ct ligand had direct cytocidal activity, similar in potency to that of Lym-1 mAb and rituximab, selectively for HLA-DR10 expressing lymphoma cells and xenografts. The results show that SHALs containing the Ct ligand residualize intracellularly and have cytocidal effects mediated by HLA-DR10. These SHALs have extraordinary potential as novel molecules for the selective targeting of lymphoma and leukemia for molecular therapy and imaging. Further, these SHALs can be used to transport and residualize cytotoxic agents near critical sites inside these malignant cells.",,"['DeNardo, Gerald L', 'Natarajan, Arutselvan', 'Hok, Saphon', 'Mirick, Gary', 'DeNardo, Sally J', 'Corzett, Michele', 'Sysko, Vladimir', 'Lehmann, Joerg', 'Beckett, Laurel', 'Balhorn, Rod']","['DeNardo GL', 'Natarajan A', 'Hok S', 'Mirick G', 'DeNardo SJ', 'Corzett M', 'Sysko V', 'Lehmann J', 'Beckett L', 'Balhorn R']","['University of California, Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, USA. gldenardo@ucdavis.edu <gldenardo@ucdavis.edu>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Serological Subtypes)', '0 (HLA-DR10 antigen)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lym-1 monoclonal antibody)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Biomimetic Materials/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Serological Subtypes', 'Humans', 'Indium Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Molecular Mimicry/*immunology', 'Nanoparticles', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Rituximab', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tissue Distribution']",2008/12/01 00:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/05/07 06:00'],"['2010/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cbr.2008.0589 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2008 Dec;23(6):783-96. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2008.0589.,['P01-CA47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2936943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients are traditionally treated with ALL-type protocols, with no consensus on the role of maintenance therapy, or allogeneic or autologous transplant. Outcome results are thus difficult to interpret. The successful use of intensified ALL protocols in patients <25 years with lymphoblastic malignancies without transplant prompted the Haematology Unit at St James's Hospital (SJH) to change practice in 2005 from transplanting in first complete remission (CR1) to treating patients <25 years with chemotherapy alone. We reviewed the outcome of patients treated before 2005 in order to compare the pre- and post-2005 management approaches in the future. This retrospective study included 31 patients with T-LBL treated from 1980 to 2004. The patients were divided into group A (16-25 years) and group B (>25 years). Twenty-one patients had an allograft in CR1 (group A, n = 12 and group B, n = 9). For the allografted patients the 5-year EFS and OS was 57%, with a treatment related mortality of 10%.

The disease is genetically heterogeneous and maps to at least 4 loci including the gene encoding perforin, a protein critical for the cytotoxic and regulatory functions of T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Hepatic dysfunction often occurs early in the clinical course, but the pathology of the liver is not well characterized. The clinical history, laboratory data, and pathologic material (25 hepatic specimens) from 19 children (11 boys, 7 girls, 1 unknown, 12 d to 11 mo of age, median 3 mo) with FHL were reviewed. Routine and immunohistochemical stains were carried out in all cases, and perforin gene sequencing in a subset. Common to all specimens was a portal and sinusoidal infiltrate of CD3, CD8, granzyme B+ lymphocytes admixed with CD68, CD1a- histiocytes that exhibited hemophagocytosis. There was endothelialitis of portal and central veins and lymphocyte-mediated bile duct injury. The degree of portal and sinusoidal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and endothelialitis varied from mild to marked and correlated with clinical severity. In some specimens, histiocytic cells predominated and in others, there was extensive hepatocellular giant cell transformation. Accordingly, 4 histopathologic patterns were observed: (1) chronic hepatitis-like, (2) leukemia-like, (3) histiocytic storage disorder-like, and (4) neonatal giant cell hepatitis-like. Two siblings homozygous for a 50delT nucleotide deletion had no perforin immunoreactive cells, 1 compound heterozygote for a deletion and missense mutation had cells with markedly diminished perforin expression, and 1 infant hemizygous for a perforin missense mutation had intact expression.

It has a poor prognosis compared to multiple myeloma, with a median survival of 8-12 months. The results of conventional therapy are disappointing though autologous stem cell transplantation may improve survival. DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation experience of 272 patients with plasma cell leukemia and 20844 with multiple myeloma undergoing first autologous transplantation between 1980 and 2006. All patients were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry using MED-A (limited data) or MED-B (extensive data) forms. All patients were included regardless of availability of complete data. RESULTS: There was no difference in type of graft or use of total body irradiation between patients with plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma, but the group with plasma cell leukemia was transplanted earlier after diagnosis (6.0 versus 7.7 months, P=0.000). Patients with plasma cell leukemia were more likely to enter complete remission after transplantation but their overall survival (25.7 months, 95% confidence interval 19.5-31.9 months) was inferior to that of patients with multiple myeloma (62.3 months, 95% confidence interval 60.4-64.3 months) (P=0.000), due to the short duration of their post-transplant response and increased non-relapse-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This largest study ever reported on plasma cell leukemia suggests that autologous transplantation can improve outcome, although results are markedly inferior to those achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, highlighting the need for novel approaches to this aggressive disorder.",,"['Drake, Mary B', 'Iacobelli, Simona', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Morris, Curly', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Bjorkstrand, Bo', 'Gahrton, Gosta']","['Drake MB', 'Iacobelli S', 'van Biezen A', 'Morris C', 'Apperley JF', 'Niederwieser D', 'Bjorkstrand B', 'Gahrton G']","['Belfast City Hospital, Northern Ireland, UK. mary.drake@belfast-trust.hscni.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/05/06 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2010/05/06 06:00'],"['2010/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['95/5/804 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.013334 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 May;95(5):804-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.013334.,['MC_G0802523/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC2864387,,,['Haematologica. 2010 May;95(5):705-7.

The mouse provides a cost-effective, highly reproducible model in which to study factors related to lymphoma development and the preclinical efficacy of potential therapies against ATL. The ability to manipulate transgenic mice has provided important insight into viral genes responsible for lymphocyte transformation. Expansion of various strains of immunodeficient mice has accelerated the testing of drugs and targeted therapy against ATL.

However, its role in megakaryocytic differentiation has yet to be investigated. Human leukemia K562 cells have been used as a model to study hematopoietic differentiation. In this study, we report that ectopic expression of HA-PRMT1 in K562 cells suppressed phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation as demonstrated by changes in cytological characteristics, adhesive properties, and CD41 expression, whereas knockdown of PRMT1 by small interference RNA promoted differentiation. Impairment of the methyltransferase activity of PRMT1 diminished the suppressive effect. These results provide evidence for a novel role of PRMT1 in negative regulation of megakaryocytic differentiation. Activation of ERK MAPK has been shown to be essential for megakaryocytic differentiation, although the role of p38 MAPK is still poorly understood. We show that knockdown of p38alpha MAPK or treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 significantly enhanced PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. Further investigation revealed that PRMT1 promotes activation of p38 MAPK without inhibiting activation of ERK MAPK. In p38alpha knockdown cells, PRMT1 could no longer suppress differentiation. In contrast, enforced expression of p38alpha MAPK suppressed PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of parental K562 as well as PRMT1-knockdown cells. We propose modulation of the p38 MAPK pathway by PRMT1 as a novel mechanism regulating megakaryocytic differentiation.

Here, we investigated 243 older (> or = 60 years) primary CN-AML patients. WT1 mutated (WT1mut) patients (7%) had FLT3-ITD more frequently (P < .001), lower hemoglobin (P = .01), higher white blood cell count (P = .03) and percentage blood blasts (P = .03), and a shorter overall survival (P = .08) than WT1 wild-type (WT1wt) patients. Comparing older and younger WT1mut patients, they had similar pretreatment characteristics and outcome. By contrast, among WT1wt CN-AML, younger patients had a significantly better outcome.

Initial clinical data indicate forodesine has significant activity on circulating CLL cells, but less activity in clearing CLL cells from tissues such as marrow. In tissue microenvironments, lymphocytes interact with accessory stromal cells that provide survival and drug-resistance signals, which may account for residual disease. Therefore, we investigated the impact of marrow stromal cells (MSCs) on forodesine-induced response in CLL lymphocytes. We demonstrate that spontaneous and forodesine-induced apoptosis of CLL cells was significantly inhibited by human and murine MSCs. Forodesine-promoted dGuo triphosphate (dGTP) accumulation and GTP and ATP depletion in CLL cells was inhibited by MSCs, providing a mechanism for resistance. Also, MSCs rescued CLL cells from forodesine-induced RNA- and protein-synthesis inhibition and stabilized and increased Mcl-1 transcript and protein levels. Conversely, MSC viability was not affected by forodesine and dGuo. Collectively, MSC-induced biochemical changes antagonized forodesine-induced CLL cell apoptosis. This provides a biochemical mechanism for MSC-derived resistance to forodesine and emphasizes the need to move toward combinations with agents that interfere with the microenvironment's protective role for improving current therapeutic efforts.",,"['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Quiroga, Maite P', 'Henneberg, Marina', 'Ayres, Mary L', 'Wierda, William G', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Burger JA', 'Quiroga MP', 'Henneberg M', 'Ayres ML', 'Wierda WG', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

We show that Stat5b-CA transgenic (TG) CD4(+) T cells had a markedly reduced graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) capacity versus wild-type (WT) T cells. Stat5b-CA TG versus WT CD4(+) T cells had a higher proportion of Tregs, which were superior in suppressing alloresponses mediated by CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells (Teffs). By day 5 after transplantation, Stat5b-CA TG Tregs had expanded approximately 3-fold more than WT Tregs. Purified Stat5b-CA TG Tregs added to WT CD4(+)CD25(-) Teffs were superior on a per-cell basis for inhibiting GVHD versus WT Tregs. Surprisingly, rigorously Treg-depleted Stat5b-CA TG versus WT CD4(+)CD25(-) Teffs caused less GVHD lethality associated with diminished Teff proinflammatory and increased Th2 anti-inflammatory cytokine responses. Reduced GVHD by Stat5b-CA TG versus WT Teffs could not be explained by conversion into Tregs in day 10 posttransplantation spleen or small intestine. In addition, Stat5b-CA TG Teffs retained a graft-versus-leukemia response. These results indicate a major role for Stat5 in Treg expansion and potency along with a lesser but significant role in Teff activation and suggest a strategy of pharmacologic Stat5b up-regulation as a means of decreasing GVHD while retaining a graft-versus-leukemia effect.",,"['Vogtenhuber, Christine', 'Bucher, Christoph', 'Highfill, Steven L', 'Koch, Lisa K', 'Goren, Emily', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Taylor, Patricia A', 'Farrar, Michael A', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Vogtenhuber C', 'Bucher C', 'Highfill SL', 'Koch LK', 'Goren E', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Taylor PA', 'Farrar MA', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100504,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",2010/05/06 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/05/06 06:00'],"['2010/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34738-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-11-252825 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 22;116(3):466-74. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-11-252825.

Multivariate analyses revealed that karyotype, age, NPM1 mutation status, white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and CD34 expression were of independent prognostic significance for OS. On the basis of the multivariate Cox model, an additive risk score was developed that allowed the subdivision of the largest group of patients with an intermediate-risk karyotype into 2 groups. We are, therefore, able to distinguish 4 prognostic groups: favorable risk, good intermediate risk, adverse intermediate risk, and high risk.

Moreover, there is also an indication that the BRCA1 protein is downregulated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. We have investigated a possible functional relationship between BRCA1 and mitotic checkpoint competence in cells with the same genetic background expressing different levels of Bcr-Abl, an oncogene responsible for CML. Herein, we show that Bcr-Abl strongly downregulates the BRCA1 protein level, which is partially reversed on treatment with imatinib, an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. Bcr-Abl leads to decreased expression of genes involved in the mitotic checkpoint activation--Mad2, Bub1, Bub3, and BubR1, resulting in mitosis perturbances, weakened mitotic checkpoint function, and mitotic slippage after nocodazole treatment. Furthermore, high Bcr-Abl-expressing cells showed also postmitotic checkpoint dysfunctions and inability to effectively arrest in the 4NG1 phase of the cell cycle, which was associated with limited p21 induction. These observations had significant biological consequences, as we found a high level of improper divisions, chromosomal missegregation, and generation of polyploid cells on mitotic checkpoint prolonged activation.

Despite recent advances in the clinical development of azacytidine, the use of the drug is limited by its low bioavailability and dependency on variably expressed nucleoside transporters for cellular uptake. We show here that CP-4200, an elaidic acid derivative of azacytidine, has strong epigenetic modulatory potency in human cancer cell lines, as evidenced by efficient depletion of DNA methyltransferase protein, genome-wide DNA demethylation, and robust reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes. Importantly, however, the cellular uptake of CP-4200 was substantially less dependent on the nucleoside transporters that are known to be involved in azacytidine uptake. In agreement with this notion, CP-4200 showed a significantly higher antitumoral activity than azacytidine in an orthotopic mouse tumor model for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Together, these data represent a detailed characterization of the CP-4200 mode of action and suggest that elaidic acid modification improves the therapeutic efficacy of azacytidine.",,"['Brueckner, Bodo', 'Rius, Maria', 'Markelova, Maria Rivera', 'Fichtner, Iduna', 'Hals, Petter-Arnt', 'Sandvold, Marit Liland', 'Lyko, Frank']","['Brueckner B', 'Rius M', 'Markelova MR', 'Fichtner I', 'Hals PA', 'Sandvold ML', 'Lyko F']","['Division of Epigenetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100504,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CP 4200)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Oleic Acids)', '2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)', '4837010H8C (elaidic acid)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Esterification', 'Esters/administration & dosage/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oleic Acid/*administration & dosage/chemistry/metabolism', 'Oleic Acids', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/05/06 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/05/06 06:00'],"['2010/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-1202 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1202 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 May;9(5):1256-64. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1202.

While some of the miRNAs are oncogenic, miRNAs such as miR-26a are consistently downregulated in a number of cancers, demonstrating their potential tumor suppressor functions. Global miRNA expression profiles of a number of virus-transformed avian lymphoma cell lines have shown downregulation of gga-miR-26a expression, irrespective of molecular mechanisms of transformation or the viral aetiology. The neoplastic transformation of lymphocytes by many viruses accompanies high levels of proliferative responses, mostly mediated through cytokines such as IL-2. Chicken IL-2 can modulate T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo and dysregulation of IL-2 expression is observed in diseases such as leukaemia. RESULTS: The expression levels of gga-miR-26a in chicken lymphoma cells transformed by 3 distinct avian oncogenic viruses, viz Marek's disease virus (MDV), avian leukosis virus (ALV) and Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) were consistently downregulated compared to the levels in the normal lymphocytes. This downregulation of miR-26a regardless of the viral etiology and molecular mechanisms of transformation was consistent with the tumor suppressor role of this miRNA. Notwithstanding this well-established role in cancer, we demonstrate the additional role of this miRNA in directly targeting chicken IL-2 through reporter and biochemical assays. The downregulation of miR-26a can relieve the suppressive effect of this miRNA on IL-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We show that miR-26a is globally downregulated in a number of avian lymphoma cells irrespective of the mechanisms of transformation, reiterating the highly conserved tumor suppressor function of this miRNA. However, with the potential for directly targeting chicken IL-2, the downregulation of miR-26a in these tumor cells could relieve the inhibitory effect on IL-2 expression assisting in the proliferative features of the transformed lymphocyte lines.",,"['Xu, Hongtao', 'Yao, Yongxiu', 'Smith, Lorraine P', 'Nair, Venugopal']","['Xu H', 'Yao Y', 'Smith LP', 'Nair V']","['Avian Oncogenic Virus Group, Avian Infectious Diseases Programme, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Berkshire, UK RG20 7NN. venu.gopal@bbsrc.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100504,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2010/05/06 06:00,2010/05/06 06:01,['2010/05/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/06 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-10-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-10-15 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2010 May 4;10:15. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-10-15.,"['BB/G009163/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",PMC2873332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the presence of the AKT1(E17K) mutation in v-Abl-transformed cell clones. AKT1(E17K) was detected in 3 (2.6%) of 116 specimens examined. To show the involvement of AKT1(E17K) directly in v-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis, we infected bone marrow cells from mice with bicistronic retroviruses encoding v-Abl and either wild-type or the mutant AKT1. Interestingly, we found that E17K mutant greatly increased the v-Abl transformation efficiency as compared with wild-type AKT1. Ectopic expression of E17K mutant increased the expression levels of antiapoptotic protein BCL2 and phosphorylation levels of proapoptotic protein BAD. This correlated with an increased protection from imatinib-induced apoptosis in Abl transformants. Furthermore, AKT1(E17K) promotes survival of the Pim-deficient cells, indicating a functional link between AKT and Pim in v-Abl transformation. In addition, AKT1(E17K) delays loss of Pim-1 and Pim-2 protein levels on v-Abl inactivation, which suggests that there exists reciprocal signaling between AKT and Pim in v-Abl transformants.",,"['Guo, G', 'Qiu, X', 'Wang, S', 'Chen, Y', 'Rothman, P B', 'Wang, Z', 'Chen, Y', 'Wang, G', 'Chen, J-L']","['Guo G', 'Qiu X', 'Wang S', 'Chen Y', 'Rothman PB', 'Wang Z', 'Chen Y', 'Wang G', 'Chen JL']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100503,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (platelet protein P47)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Blood Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Mutation', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/genetics/*physiology']",2010/05/05 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/05/05 06:00'],"['2010/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010149 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.149 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Jul 1;29(26):3845-53. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.149.

Here, we show that MCM levels in primary human T cells are induced during the G(0)-->G(1) transition and are not in excess in proliferating cells. The level of induction is critical as we show that a 50% reduction leads to increased centromere separation, premature chromatid separation (PCS) and gross chromosomal abnormalities typical of genomic instability syndromes. We investigated the mechanisms involved and show that a reduction in MCM levels causes dose-dependent DNA damage involving activation of ATR & ATM and Chk1 & Chk2. There is increased DNA mis-repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and both NHEJ and homologous recombination are necessary for Mcm7-depleted cells to progress to metaphase. Therefore, a simple reduction in MCM loading onto DNA, which occurs in cancers as a result of aberrant cell cycle control, is sufficient to cause PCS and gross genomic instability within one cell cycle.",,"['Orr, S J', 'Gaymes, T', 'Ladon, D', 'Chronis, C', 'Czepulkowski, B', 'Wang, R', 'Mufti, G J', 'Marcotte, E M', 'Thomas, N S B']","['Orr SJ', 'Gaymes T', 'Ladon D', 'Chronis C', 'Czepulkowski B', 'Wang R', 'Mufti GJ', 'Marcotte EM', 'Thomas NS']","[""King's College London, Department of Haematological Medicine, Leukaemia Sciences Laboratories, Rayne Institute, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100503,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*blood', 'DNA Damage', '*G1 Phase', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', '*Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/05/05 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/05/05 06:00'],"['2010/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010138 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.138 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Jul 1;29(26):3803-14. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.138.

One mechanism suggested to underlie its development is chronic exposure of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) to potent antiapoptotic signals initiated by IL-15, a cytokine overexpressed in the enterocytes of individuals with CD. However, the signaling pathway by which IL-15 transmits these antiapoptotic signals has not been firmly established. Here we show that the survival signals delivered by IL-15 to freshly isolated human IELs and to human IEL cell lines derived from CD patients with type II refractory CD (RCDII) - a clinicopathological entity considered an intermediary step between CD and enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma - depend on the antiapoptotic factors Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL. The signals also required IL-15Rbeta, Jak3, and STAT5, but were independent of PI3K, ERK, and STAT3. Consistent with these data, IELs from patients with active CD and RCDII contained increased amounts of Bcl-xL, phospho-Jak3, and phospho-STAT5. Furthermore, incubation of patient duodenal biopsies with a fully humanized human IL-15-specific Ab effectively blocked Jak3 and STAT5 phosphorylation. In addition, treatment with this Ab induced IEL apoptosis and wiped out the massive IEL accumulation in mice overexpressing human IL-15 in their gut epithelium.

After a review of all the available evidence, the original report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee in 2003 concluded that mitoxantrone probably reduced clinical attack rates, MRI activity, and disease progression. Subsequent reports of decreased systolic function, heart failure, and leukemia prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to institute a ""black box"" warning in 2005. This review was undertaken to examine the available literature on the efficacy and safety of mitoxantrone use in patients with MS since the initial report. METHODS: Relevant articles were obtained through a review of the medical literature and the strength of the available evidence was graded according to the American Academy of Neurology evidence classification scheme. RESULTS: The accumulated Class III and IV evidence suggests an increased incidence of systolic dysfunction and therapy-related acute leukemia (TRAL) with mitoxantrone therapy. Systolic dysfunction occurs in approximately 12% of patients with MS treated with mitoxantrone, congestive heart failure occurs in approximately 0.4%, and leukemia occurs in approximately 0.8%. The number needed to harm is 8 for systolic dysfunction and 123 for TRAL. There is no new efficacy evidence that would change the recommendation from the previous report.

The diagnostic gold standard has been CSF cytology, but MRI is now used routinely for diagnosis. Diagnosis and prognosis of LM has not been studied in the MRI era. METHODS: Patients with LM from 2002 through 2004 were identified through a neurology database, as well as by reviewing all abnormal CSF cytologies from a pathology database. Diagnosis was made by malignant cytology or imaging; suspicious cases treated as LM were also included. RESULTS: A total of 187 patients with LM were analyzed in this retrospective review. Of these, 150 had solid and 37 had hematopoietic malignancies. Median age was 56.4 years, and median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 70. The most common types of solid tumor were breast (65 patients), lung (47), gastrointestinal (11), and melanoma (9). Of the hematopoietic tumors, 21 were lymphoma and 15 were leukemia. Fifty-three percent of patients were diagnosed by imaging, 23% by cytology, and 24% by both. Treatment included radiation therapy in 55%, intrathecal chemotherapy in 29%, and systemic chemotherapy in 18%; 21% received supportive care alone. Median overall survival was 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.9-3.1) months. Median survival for patients with hematopoietic tumors was 4.7 months and for solid tumors was 2.3 months (p = 0.0006). In multivariate analysis, initial KPS and tumor type (solid vs hematopoietic) were significant predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Despite enhanced diagnosis with MRI, prognosis remains poor in leptomeningeal metastasis.

A survey of 18 lymphoid cell lines found that Nef was dispensable in three, each of which harbored gammaretroviruses. Nef-dependent cell lines were rendered Nef-independent by a cell-free supernatant from the independent lines or by transfection of cloned murine leukemia virus (MLV). Analysis of MLV deletion mutations identified glycosylated gag (glycogag) as the factor that rescues Nef-defective HIV-1 virions. Glycogag was also demonstrated to be required for the infectivity of MLV virions produced in lymphoid cells. Direct comparison of Nef and glycogag revealed identical dependence for activity on Env-pseudotype and producer cell type. The two proteins colocalize within cells, and both increase the yield of viral cDNA in target cells. The functional similarity of Nef and glycogag is a compelling example of convergent evolution in which two structurally unrelated proteins provide a function necessary for virion infectivity in lymphoid cells.",,"['Pizzato, Massimo']",['Pizzato M'],"['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland. massimo.pizzato@unige.ch']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100503,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (nef protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'HIV-1/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*deficiency']",2010/05/05 06:00,2010/07/23 06:00,['2010/05/05 06:00'],"['2010/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1001554107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1001554107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 May 18;107(20):9364-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1001554107.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The entire CEBPA coding sequence was screened in 1,427 young adult patients with AML, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Of 107 patients (7%) with CEBPA mutations, 48 patients (45%) had one mutation (CEBPA-single), and 59 patients (55%) had two mutations (CEBPA-double). The incidence of CEBPA-double patients was similar in intermediate cytogenetic risk patients with and without a normal karyotype (6% and 5%, respectively). CEBPA-double patients had evidence of a lower coincidence with FLT3/ITDs (P = .04) and were highly unlikely to have an NPM1 mutation (P < .0001). CEBPA-double but not CEBPA-single patients had a significantly better overall survival (OS) at 8 years (34%, 31%, and 54% for CEBPA-wild-type [WT], CEBPA-single, and CEBPA-double, respectively, P = .004). This benefit was lost in the presence of a FLT3/ITD (OS for CEBPA-WT, CEBPA-single, and CEBPA-double FLT3/ITD-negative patients: 36%, 35%, 59%, respectively, P = .002; OS for CEBPA-WT, CEBPA-single, and CEBPA-double FLT3/ITD-positive patients: 26%, 21%, 14%, respectively, P = .05). There was no evidence of any additional favorable benefit for a CEBPA-single mutation in the presence of an NPM1 mutation (OS, 45%, 44%, and 56%, P = .2, for NPM1-positive/CEBPA-WT, NPM1-positive/CEBPA-single, and NPM1-negative/CEBPA-double patients, respectively).

Because AML is rare in children, the true prognostic significance of individual chromosomal abnormalities in this age group remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cytogenetic study of 729 childhood patients classified them into 22 subgroups and evaluated their incidence and risk. RESULTS: Rearrangements of 11q23 were the most frequent abnormality found in approximately 16% of patients, with 50% of these in infants. The outcome for all patients with 11q23 abnormalities was intermediate; no difference was observed for those with t(9;11)(p21-22;q23). The core binding factor leukemias with the translocations t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22) occurred at incidences of 14% and 7%, respectively, predominantly in older children, and their prognosis was favorable. An adverse outcome was observed in patients with monosomy 7, abnormalities of 5q, and t(6;9)(p23;q34). Abnormalities of 3q and complex karyotypes, in the absence of favorable-risk features, have been associated with an adverse outcome in adults, but the results were not significant in this childhood series. However, the presence of 12p abnormalities predicted a poor outcome.

In the imatinib era, the prognostic impact of der(9) deletions has been evaluated mainly in patients with late chronic-phase (CP) CML, giving partially conflicting results. Few data are available in the early CP setting. For this reason, in 2006, the European LeukemiaNet recommendations still considered der(9) deletions as a candidate adverse prognostic factor and required a careful monitoring of the patient. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate the prognostic value of der(9) deletions in early CP CML, we performed an analysis of three prospective imatinib trials of the Italian Group for Hematological Malignancies of the Adult (GIMEMA) CML Working Party. RESULTS: A fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of bone marrow cells was performed at diagnosis; der(9) deletions were detected in 60 (12%) of 521 evaluable patients. At 60 months, the cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response-and the probability of event-free survival, failure-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival-in patients with and without deletions were not statistically different.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of a large group of patients younger than 18 years treated according to study AML-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 98 (n = 454), including their cytogenetics, were analyzed. RESULTS: The favorable outcome in the subgroups of patients with t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17), with an overall survival of 91% (SE, 4%), 92% (SE, 6%), and 87% (SE, 5%), respectively, was confirmed. Within this group, the 5-year probability of event-free survival (pEFS) of all 17 children with t(8;21) and additional aberrations apart from del(9q) or -X/-Y was 100%. As expected, the cytogenetic finding of a complex karyotype (n = 35; pEFS, 33%; SE, 8%) or a monosomy 7 (n = 12; pEFS, 17%; SE, 11%) was associated with a poor outcome. Compared with remaining patients with cytogenetic data (pEFS, 48%; SE, 2%), prognosis in patients with an MLL rearrangement (n = 91) was inferior (pEFS, 34%; SE, 5%; P = .0005). Particularly, children with t(9;11) and additional aberrations (n = 13; pEFS, 31%; SE, 14%) and MLL rearrangements other than t(9;11) and t(11;19) (n = 41; pEFS, 24%; SE, 7%) had an unfavorable outcome. Nine patients with aberrations in 12p showed an adverse prognosis (pEFS, 11%; SE, 10%). The outcome of patients with aberrations of chromosome 5 (n = 13) was better than expected (pEFS, 50%; SE, 13%).

Here, we examined outcomes after nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT in such patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventy-four patients (median age, 60 years) with de novo or secondary AML underwent allogeneic HCT from related (n = 118) or unrelated donors (n = 156) after conditioning with 2 Gy of total-body irradiation (TBI) with or without fludarabine. A calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil were used for postgrafting immunosuppression. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 38 months in surviving patients, the estimated overall survival at 5 years was 33%. The estimated 5-year relapse/progression and nonrelapse mortality rates were 42% and 26%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of grades 2, 3, and 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 38%, 9%, and 5%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 5 years was 44%. Patients in first and second complete remission had better survival rates than patients with more advanced disease (37% and 34% v 18%, respectively). Patients with HLA-matched related or unrelated donors had similar survivals. Unfavorable cytogenetic risk status was associated with increased relapse and subsequent mortality.

Here we have established that Pbx1 negatively regulates Hoxa10-mediated gene transcription in mesenchymal cells and identified components of a Pbx1 complex associated with genes in osteoblasts. Expression of Pbx1 impaired osteogenic commitment of C3H10T1/2 multipotent cells and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts. Conversely, targeted depletion of Pbx1 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) increased expression of osteoblast-related genes. Studies using wild-type and mutated osteocalcin and Bsp promoters revealed that Pbx1 acts through a Pbx-binding site that is required to attenuate gene activation by Hoxa10. Chromatin-associated Pbx1 and Hoxa10 were present at osteoblast-related gene promoters preceding gene expression, but only Hoxa10 was associated with these promoters during transcription. Our results show that Pbx1 is associated with histone deacetylases normally linked with chromatin inactivation. Loss of Pbx1 from osteoblast promoters in differentiated osteoblasts was associated with increased histone acetylation and CBP/p300 recruitment, as well as decreased H3K9 methylation. We propose that Pbx1 plays a central role in attenuating the ability of Hoxa10 to activate osteoblast-related genes in order to establish temporal regulation of gene expression during osteogenesis.",,"['Gordon, Jonathan A R', 'Hassan, Mohammad Q', 'Saini, Sharanjot', 'Montecino, Martin', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Gary S', 'Stein, Janet L', 'Lian, Jane B']","['Gordon JA', 'Hassan MQ', 'Saini S', 'Montecino M', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein GS', 'Stein JL', 'Lian JB']","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 55 Lake Avenue North, Worcester, MA 01655-0106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100503,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (IBSP protein, human)', '0 (Ibsp protein, mouse)', '0 (Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Osteocalcin/genetics/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Rats', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2010/05/05 06:00,2010/07/16 06:00,['2010/05/05 06:00'],"['2010/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00889-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00889-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Jul;30(14):3531-41. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00889-09.

Emerging evidence suggests that MLL5 has important functions in adult hematopoiesis and the chromatin regulatory network, and it participates in regulating the cell cycle machinery. Here, we demonstrate that MLL5 is tightly regulated through phosphorylation on its central domain at the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. Upon entry into mitosis, the phosphorylated MLL5 delocalizes from condensed chromosomes, whereas after mitotic exit, MLL5 becomes dephosphorylated and re-associates with the relaxed chromatin. We further identify that the mitotic phosphorylation and subcellular localization of MLL5 are dependent on Cdc2 kinase activity, and Thr-912 is the Cdc2-targeting site. Overexpression of the Cdc2-targeting MLL5 fragment obstructs mitotic entry by competitive inhibition of the phosphorylation of endogenous MLL5. In addition, G(2) phase arrest caused by depletion of endogenous MLL5 can be compensated by exogenously overexpressed full-length MLL5 but not the phosphodomain deletion or MLL5-T912A mutant. Our data provide evidence that MLL5 is a novel cellular target of Cdc2, and the phosphorylation of MLL5 may have an indispensable role in the mitotic progression.",,"['Liu, Jie', 'Wang, Xiao Ning', 'Cheng, Fei', 'Liou, Yih-Cherng', 'Deng, Lih-Wen']","['Liu J', 'Wang XN', 'Cheng F', 'Liou YC', 'Deng LW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Health System, National University of Singapore, 8 Medical Drive, Singapore 117597.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100503,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2E protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin B/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'G2 Phase', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic Index', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transfection']",2010/05/05 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/05/05 06:00'],"['2010/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)57378-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.098558 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jul 2;285(27):20904-14. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.098558.

The complexity of our database enabled us to perform a detailed analysis of microRNA (miRNA) activities. We inferred genetic networks from miRNA expression in normal tissues and cancer. We also built, for the first time, specialized miRNA networks for solid tumors and leukemias. Nonmalignant tissues and cancer networks displayed a change in hubs, the most connected miRNAs. hsa-miR-103/106 were downgraded in cancer, whereas hsa-miR-30 became most prominent. Cancer networks appeared as built from disjointed subnetworks, as opposed to normal tissues. A comparison of these nets allowed us to identify key miRNA cliques in cancer. We also investigated miRNA copy number alterations in 744 cancer samples, at a resolution of 150 kb. Members of miRNA families should be similarly deleted or amplified, since they repress the same cellular targets and are thus expected to have similar impacts on oncogenesis. We correctly identified hsa-miR-17/92 family as amplified and the hsa-miR-143/145 cluster as deleted. Other miRNAs, such as hsa-miR-30 and hsa-miR-204, were found to be physically altered at the DNA copy number level as well. By combining differential expression, genetic networks, and DNA copy number alterations, we confirmed, or discovered, miRNAs with comprehensive roles in cancer.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 67 of 3504 patients from our MDS Registry fulfilling the criteria for ICUS. Furthermore, we used the human androgen receptor gene-based assay (HUMARA) to look for clonality. RESULTS: Of all 67 patients, 66% had unilineage, 18% bilineage and 12% trilineage cytopenias. The majority of patients (67%) presented with anaemia. Median overall survival was 44 months (range: 1-199 months). In the entire group, eight patients (12%) developed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Of the 23 patients eligible for HUMARA, 17 had non-clonal X-chromosome inactivation patterns, while 6 patients showed clonal patterns. Two of these six patients developed AML indicating that a clonal stem cell disorder was the reason for the anteceding cytopenia, while there was no AML observed among the 17 patients with non-clonal patterns (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Since some of the ICUS patients had a clonal bone marrow disease when presenting with cytopenia(s) and 8 of 67 patients with ICUS later developed AML, we recommend to follow these patients thoroughly. As demonstrated here, HUMARA can facilitate the discrimination between ICUS and a 'manifest' MDS.",,"['Schroeder, T', 'Ruf, L', 'Bernhardt, A', 'Hildebrandt, B', 'Aivado, M', 'Aul, C', 'Gattermann, N', 'Haas, R', 'Germing, U']","['Schroeder T', 'Ruf L', 'Bernhardt A', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Aivado M', 'Aul C', 'Gattermann N', 'Haas R', 'Germing U']","['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology.

DATA SOURCES: Clinical trial data, published guidelines, review articles, and conference proceedings. DATA SYNTHESIS: Therapies for older adult patients with AML include cytarabine-based intensive-induction chemotherapy, investigational therapy, and supportive care. Nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may provide the best opportunity for cure following remission if a human leukocyte antigen-matched hematopoietic stem cell donor is available. Careful assessment of patient- and disease-related factors is critical in determining the appropriate treatment modality for individuals. Assessment tools and algorithms may identify patients likely to be intolerant of intensive therapies. Supportive care may improve treatment tolerance and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Survival outcomes have not improved significantly for older adult patients with AML. Novel therapies, coupled with better understanding of prognostic factors, may allow more highly individualized care. Performance status or comorbidity score may provide insights regarding outcome, particularly when combined with age, cytogenetic risk, or molecular markers. Efforts to improve transplantation safety may increase use in the older adult patient population.

The resulting RUNX1-ETO fusion protein contributes to leukemic progression by directing aberrant association of transcriptional cofactors and epigenetic modifiers to RUNX1 target genes. For example, the GM-CSF gene is activated by RUNX1, but is repressed by RUNX1-ETO. Here we show that RUNX1 normally cooperates with the histone acetyltransferase, CBP, to regulate GM-CSF expression at two levels. Firstly, it directs the establishment of a competent chromatin environment at the GM-CSF promoter prior to gene activation. It then participates in the transcriptional activation of the promoter in response to immune stimuli. In contrast, RUNX1-ETO, which cannot associate with CBP, is unable to transactivate the GM-CSF promoter and is associated with the generation of a repressive chromatin environment at the promoter.",['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mononuclear cells were obtained from the bone marrow of a CML patient in blast crisis and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 containing 20% fetal bovine serum. After 2 months of primary culture, these cells were injected into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient mice via tail vein. Eight weeks after injection, mice were sacrificed and ex vivo culture was performed from the bone marrow cells isolated from the mice. The established cell line was named as SNUCML-02 and the biological features were characterized by cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, sequencing analysis, cell proliferation assay, and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Cytogenetic studies using conventional G-banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization of SNUCML-02 demonstrated classical Philadelphia chromosome, (9;22)(q34;q11.2), and other abnormalities, such as add(11)(q23), +19 and +der(9;22). SNUCML-02 has the same BCR-ABL fusion transcript as was seen in K562 cells, but has no mutations in the ABL kinase domain. SNUCML-02 was more resistant to imatinib (STI571, Gleevec, Glivec) than other CML cell lines (K562, Kcl22, and BV173). SNUCML-02 has constitutive activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. In addition, interleukin-3 induced c-ABL phosphorylation and constitutively enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation was not inhibited by imatinib in SNUCML-02. CONCLUSION: SNUCML-02 is a new established cell line with a relatively high level of resistance to imatinib, which is useful for investigating the pathogenesis of CML progression, and will be useful in developing optimal therapeutic strategies for this ailment.",,"['Park, Juwon', 'Kim, Kyung Im', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Won, Nam-Hee', 'Oh, Jung Mi', 'Lee, Dong Soon', 'Kim, Byoung Kook', 'Ahn, Kwang-Sung', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo']","['Park J', 'Kim KI', 'Koh Y', 'Won NH', 'Oh JM', 'Lee DS', 'Kim BK', 'Ahn KS', 'Yoon SS']","['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100521,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', '*Blast Crisis/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Cattle', '*Cell Line, Tumor/enzymology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2010/05/05 06:00,2010/09/11 06:00,['2010/05/05 06:00'],"['2009/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00155-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Sep;38(9):773-81. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.04.012.

To investigate possible genetic contribution to childhood leukemia risk in the innate immune system, we performed an association study for the 1214 SNPs in 146 gene regions related to innate immunity using GoldenGate (Illumina) oligonucleotide pool assay (OPA) in 106 case patients and 123 controls. Childhood leukemia risk was estimated as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for age, gender and birth weight. The minP test was used to identify statistically significant association at gene level. Three SNPs (STAT6 rs703817, C1qG rs17433222, and MBP rs3794845) were significantly associated with childhood leukemia risk (p(trend) < 0.001, minP < 0.01). The most significant association with childhood leukemia risk was for STAT6 rs703817 (GA vs GG: 0.48 (0.26-0.87), AA vs GG: 0.21 (0.07-0.61), p(trend) = 0.0003, minP = 0.002). Subgroup analysis showed that Ly96 rs78380171 and MBP rs3794845 were significantly associated with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (p(trend) < 0.001).

We observed upregulated FGL2 expression in alveolar macrophages from peripheral lungs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and found a correlation between FGL2 expression and increased macrophage activation markers (CD11b and CD14). The role of FGL2 in the activation of macrophages was confirmed by the detection of significantly decreased macrophage activation marker (CD11b, CD11c, and CD71) expression as well as the inhibition of cell migration and inflammatory cytokine (IL-8 and MMP-9) production in an LPS-induced FGL2 knockdown human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). Increased FGL2 expression co-localized with upregulated phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) in the lung tissues from COPD patients. Moreover, FGL2 knockdown in THP-1 cells significantly downregulated LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38-MAPK while upregulating phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).

In this study, we confirmed that LAPA treatment induces direct cytotoxicity in human leukemia cells (U937, K562, HL60, and THP-1) through activation of caspase-3 and subsequent cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The observed induction of cell death was associated with decreased telomerase activity, which was ascribed to down-regulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase.

The histomorphological diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma can be challenging to pathologists, especially in the absence of a known hematological disorder. In this case, differentiation of granulocytic sarcoma from malignant lymphomas and other small round cell tumors is very critical. Seven cases of granulocytic sarcoma are reported in this paper. One patient had granulocytic sarcomas at two different sites. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections were reexamined. Blastic, poorly differentiated, and well differentiated histopathological variants were found in two, five and one cases, respectively. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed tissue from all cases using a avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique. The panel included antibodies against LCA, CD43, CD34, c-kit, myeloperoxidase, CD68 KP1, CD15, and CD99. All cases stained positively with LCA, CD43, CD34, myeloperoxidase, and CD68. Five cases were positive for c-kit, three cases were positive for CD15, and two cases were positive for CD99.

A report of eight cases.,143-8,,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To further clarify the clinicopathological, molecular genetic and karyotypic findings of reactive lymph node hyperplasia with giant follicles (RLHGF) associated with a posttherapeutic state of hematological malignancies, we studied eight such cases. METHODS: Using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, histological, immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization (ISH), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed. RESULTS: Six patients had a history of malignant lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL] = 4, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma = 2), and two had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Six patients initially presented with lymphadenopathy of the head and neck area and the remaining one presented with swelling of the tonsil. All seven cases demonstrating analyzable metaphases showed a normal karyotype. Histologically, all eight lesions were characterized by numerous enlarged, bizarre-shaped coalescing lymphoid follicles with follicular lysis. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometry study demonstrated the reactive nature of the B cells in all eight lesions. However, three of our eight cases demonstrated immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene rearrangement on PCR study. Different clonal bands were detected in the initial lymphomatous tissue and RLHGF in one of the studied cases. There was no development of B-cell lymphoma or recurrence of B-cell lymphoma in any of the three lesions demonstrating IgH rearrangement. There were no human herpes virus type-8+ or human immunodeficiency virus type-1+ cells in any of the eight lesions. ISH demonstrated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA (EBER)+ cells in only two lesions. PCR analyses demonstrated that there was no Toxoplasma gondii DNA in any of the eight lesions. CONCLUSIONS: As suggested in RLHGF posttransplant, RLHGF arising after therapy for hematological malignancies is also a consequence of chronic stimulation in the setting of immune deregulation rather than various infectious agents. It is important for pathologists and clinicians to be aware of this type of lesion in diagnostic practice.",,"['Kojima, Masaru', 'Nakamura, Naoya', 'Murayama, Kayoko', 'Igarashi, Tadahiko', 'Matsumoto, Morio', 'Matsuda, Hazuki', 'Masawa, Nobuhide', 'Miura, Ikuo', 'Morita, Yukio']","['Kojima M', 'Nakamura N', 'Murayama K', 'Igarashi T', 'Matsumoto M', 'Matsuda H', 'Masawa N', 'Miura I', 'Morita Y']","['Department of Pathology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Mibu, Japan. mkojima@dokkyomed.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Castleman Disease/*etiology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/complications/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pseudolymphoma/*etiology/genetics/immunology/pathology']",2010/05/05 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2010/05/05 06:00'],"['2010/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2010 Jan-Feb;96(1):143-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: The late development of chemotherapy-induced myocardial complications becomes an issue as the number of childhood cancer survivors is increasing. Underlying cardiac impairment may progress to serious cardiac diseases. Therefore, an early identification of myocardial injury is essential. PATIENTS AMD METHODS: Study population was divided into two treatment groups: ANT group (31 patients previously treated with ANT), and non-ANT group (32 patients who underwent chemotherapy without ANT, both more than 5 years ago). SAECG was added to routine cardiology examination in the whole population study and 32 controls. Using the frequency-domain analysis within the QRS complex a ratio (AR) of 20-50 (Hz)/0-20 (Hz) was calculated. RESULTS: AR 20-50/0-20 in SAECG was significantly higher in ANT and non-ANT groups, relative to controls (262.5 p < 0.00001 vs. 135.9 p < 0.001 vs. 74.7). The difference between both patient groups was also evident p < 0.01.

For the last 15 years the main source of cells for transplantation have been peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). With the availability of hematopoietic growth factors and understanding the advantages of treatment with PBSC, the application of bone marrow (BM) was supplanted. The aim of this survey was to explore the success of PBSC collection, the factors which influence the success of PBSC collection, the composition and the quality of graft and their influence on hematopoietic recovery and outcome after transplantation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PBSC were collected by the method of leukapheresis after applying a combination of chemotherapy and growth factors or only growth factors. The quality of graft was determined with the clonogenic progenitor cell assay and with the flow cytometry analysis. Of the total 134 patients with AML, who were submitted to HSC mobilization, the collection was successful in 78 (58.2%) patients. The collection was more successful after the first than after the second attempt of HSC mobilization (49% vs. 11%). The criteria for effective mobilization were the number of leukocytes > 3 x 10(9)/L and the concentration of CD34+ cells > 20 x 10(3)/mL in the peripheral blood on the first day of leukapheresis. The number of CD34+ cells infused had the strongest impact on hematopoietic recovery. We noted significantly faster hematological recovery of neutrophils and platelets, fewer number of transfused units of red blood cells and platelets, shorter duration of the tranfusion support, shorter treatment with intravenous antibiotic therapy and shorter hospitalization after PBSC compared to BM transplantation.

The frequency of the five most common MEFV gene mutations (M694V, M680I, V726A, E148Q and M694I) was determined in 26 patients with myeloid neoplasm. We identified 1 homozygous (E148Q/E148Q), 1 compound heterozygous (M694V/E148Q) and 5 heterozygous MEFV gene mutations; none had their own and/or family history compatible with familial Mediterranean fever. The mean overall mutation rate was 0.269. We found a high frequency of carriers in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (66.6%), polycythemia vera (33.3%) and acute myeloid leukemia (28.6%). However, there was no MEFV gene mutation in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. In conclusion, this study reports for the first time a possibly high prevalence of MEFV gene mutations in patients with myeloid neoplasm, especially myelodysplastic syndrome, polycythemia vera and acute myeloid leukemia. Our findings could open new perspectives for MEFV gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms and its association with tumor promotion.

When cytokine-dependent FL5.12 cells were cultured in the presence of IL-3, which stimulated multiple proliferation and anti-apoptotic cascades, MEK, PI3K and mTOR inhibitors transiently suppressed but did not totally inhibit cell cycle progression or induce apoptosis while chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel were more effective in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Doxorubicin induced a G(1) block, while paclitaxel triggered a G(2)/M block. Doxorubicin was more effective in inducing cell death than paclitaxel. Furthermore the effects of doxorubicin could be enhanced by addition of MEK, PI3K or mTOR inhibitors. Cytokine-dependent cells which proliferate in vitro and are not ""oncogene-addicted"" may represent a pre-malignant stage, more refractory to treatment with targeted therapy. However, these cells are sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Exposition of Jurkat cells to ciprofloxacin inhibited cell proliferation,increased proportion of cells in the G2/M-phase of the cell cycle, compromised formation of the mitotic spindle and induced aneuploidy.

Herein, the authors describe the high incidence and characteristic histopathologic lesions of acute ATLS in p53-deficient mice used in 2 short-term carcinogenicity studies. ATLS was a frequent cause of early death in p53 (+/-) mice in these studies and was consistently associated with the presence of disseminated lymphoma and leukemia. Although a heavy tumor burden and leukemia were present in all affected mice, the absence of ATLS in other mice with equally severe lymphoma and leukemia indicates that these tumor burdens are necessary but insufficient to cause ATLS in mice. The hallmark histopathologic findings of ATLS in mice are the disseminated microemboli composed of nuclear and cytoplasmic debris derived from lysed tumor cells. The mechanical obstruction of capillary beds by these microemboli appeared to be the proximate cause of the early deaths of mice in these studies. Microemboli may contribute to the pathogenesis of acute renal failure and other clinical signs associated with ATLS in other species. Recognition of ATLS in laboratory animals is critical in studies intended to evaluate the efficacy and/or toxicity of anticancer treatments, where early deaths due to ATLS might otherwise be attributed to test article toxicity. Further studies on the role of microemboli in the pathogenesis of ATLS may elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms and lead to improved approaches to clinical management and treatment of this potentially lethal condition.",,"['Vogel, P', 'Pletcher, J M', 'Liang, Y']","['Vogel P', 'Pletcher JM', 'Liang Y']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105 Email: peter.vogel@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100430,United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Death, Sudden/*etiology', 'Embolism/*etiology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Random Allocation', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*etiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2010/05/04 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/05/04 06:00'],"['2010/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['0300985810363484 [pii]', '10.1177/0300985810363484 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2010 Jul;47(4):719-24. doi: 10.1177/0300985810363484.

Furthermore, aberrant expression of WT1 in acute myeloid leukemia was associated with an increased risk of relapse. No larger studies have performed a combined approach including WT1 mutation and expression analyses in acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the WT1 mutations and the expression status in a total of 252 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed T-lymphoblastic leukemia, who were registered on the GMALL 06/99 and 07/03 protocols and had sufficient material available. The GMALL protocols included intensive chemotherapy as well as stem cell transplantation according to a risk-based model with indication for stem cell transplantation in first complete remission for early and mature T-lymphoblastic leukemia patients; patients with thymic T-lymphoblastic leukemia were allocated to a standard risk group and treated with intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: Twenty of the 238 patients analyzed had WT1 mutations (WT1mut) in exon 7. WT1mut cases were characterized by immature features such as an early immunophenotype and higher WT1 expression. In thymic T-lymphoblastic leukemia, WT1mut patients had an inferior relapse-free survival compared to WT1 wild-type patients. T-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with aberrant WT1 expression (high or negative) showed a higher relapse rate and an inferior outcome compared to patients with intermediate WT1 expression. In the standard risk group of thymic T-lymphoblastic leukemia, aberrant WT1 expression was predictive for an inferior relapse-free survival as compared to patients with intermediate expression. In multivariate analysis, WT1 expression was of independent prognostic significance for relapse-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: WT1 mutations were associated with an inferior relapse-free survival in standard risk thymic T-lymphoblastic leukemia patients.

The inferior prognosis in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia is not fully understood but could be attributed, in part, to differences in genomic alterations found in adult as compared to in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared two different sets of high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array genotyping data from 75 new diagnostic adult and 399 previously published diagnostic pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. The patients' samples were randomly acquired from among Caucasian and Asian populations and hybridized to either Affymetrix 50K or 250K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. The array data were investigated with Copy Number Analysis for GeneChips (CNAG) software for allele-specific copy number analysis. RESULTS: The high density single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis of 75 samples of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia led to the identification of numerous cryptic and submicroscopic genomic lesions with a mean of 7.6 genomic alterations per sample. The patterns and frequencies of lesions detected in the adult samples largely reproduced known genomic hallmarks detected in previous single nucleotide polymorphism-array studies of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, such as common deletions of 3p14.2 (FHIT), 5q33.3 (EBF), 6q, 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/B), 9p13.2 (PAX5), 13q14.2 (RB1) and 17q11.2 (NF1). Some differences between adult and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia were identified when the pediatric data set was partitioned into hyperdiploid and non-hyperdiploid cases and then compared to the nearly exclusively non-hyperdiploid adult samples. In this analysis, adult samples had a higher rate of deletions of chromosome 17p (TP53) and duplication of 17q. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases led to the identification of new potential target lesions relevant for the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, no unequivocal pattern of submicroscopic genomic alterations was found to separate adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia from pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Therefore, apart from different therapy regimen, differences of prognosis between adult and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia are probably based on genetic subgroups according to cytogenetically detectable lesions but not focal genomic copy number microlesions.",,"['Okamoto, Ryoko', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Nowak, Daniel', 'Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Akagi, Tadayuki', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Weiss, Tamara', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Ruckert, Christian', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Okamoto R', 'Ogawa S', 'Nowak D', 'Kawamata N', 'Akagi T', 'Kato M', 'Sanada M', 'Weiss T', 'Haferlach C', 'Dugas M', 'Ruckert C', 'Haferlach T', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, 8700, Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, CA90048, USA.

The functions of Ets-1 are regulated by transcription factors as well as by phosphorylation events: phosphorylation of threonine 38 activates Ets-1, whereas phosphorylation of a cluster of serines within exon VII reduces DNA binding activity. This study focuses on the role of Ets-1 during granulocytic differentiation of NB4 promyelocytic and HL60 myeloblastic leukemia cell lines induced by all-trans retinoic acid. DESIGN AND METHODS: Ets-1 expression was measured by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The role of Ets-1 during all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation was analyzed by using a transdominant negative molecule or small interfering RNA. RESULTS: NB4 and HL60 cell lines expressed high levels of p51 Ets-1, while the splice variant isoform that lacks exon VII (p42) was almost undetectable. The addition of all-trans retinoic acid reduced p51 Ets-1 levels and induced inhibitory phosphorylation of the remaining protein. Expression of Ets-1 was also reduced during dimethylsulfoxide-induced differentiation and during granulocytic differentiation of human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells but not in NB4.R2 and HL60R cells resistant to all-trans retinoic acid. In line with these observations, transduction of a transdominant negative molecule of Ets-1, which inhibited DNA binding and transcriptional activity of the wild-type Ets-1, significantly increased chemical-induced differentiation. Consistently, Ets-1 knockdown by small interfering RNA increased the number of mature neutrophils upon addition of all-trans retinoic acid. Interestingly, p51 Ets-1 over-expression was frequently observed in CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, as compared to its expression in normal CD34(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that a decreased expression of Ets-1 protein generalizes to granulocytic differentiation and may represent a crucial event for granulocytic maturation.",,"['Lulli, Valentina', 'Romania, Paolo', 'Riccioni, Roberta', 'Boe, Alessandra', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Testa, Ugo', 'Marziali, Giovanna']","['Lulli V', 'Romania P', 'Riccioni R', 'Boe A', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Testa U', 'Marziali G']","['Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, viale Regina Elena 299, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100430,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology']",2010/05/04 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/05/04 06:00'],"['2010/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.023267 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.023267 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Oct;95(10):1633-41. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.023267.

Available single disease registries provide reliable information regarding natural history, efficacy and side effects of treatments, and contribute to the discovery of the causative genes. However, these registries could not shed light on the true incidence of the various syndromes. We, therefore, established an Israeli national registry in order to investigate the relative frequency of each of these syndromes and their complications. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were registered by their hematologists in all 16 medical centers in Israel. We included patients with Fanconi anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, dyskeratosis congenita, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and thrombocytopenia with absent radii. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients diagnosed between 1966 and 2007 were registered. Fifty-two percent were found to have Fanconi anemia, 17% severe congenital neutropenia, 14% Diamond-Blackfan anemia, 6% congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, 5% dyskeratosis congenita, 2% Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and 2% thrombocytopenia with absent radii. No specific diagnosis was made in only 2 patients. Of the thirty patients (24%) developing severe bone marrow failure, 80% had Fanconi anemia. Seven of 9 patients with leukemia had Fanconi anemia, as did all 6 with solid tumors. Thirty-four patients died from their disease; 25 (74%) had Fanconi anemia and 6 (17%) had severe congenital neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive population-based study evaluating the incidence and complications of the different inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. By far the most common disease was Fanconi anemia, followed by severe congenital neutropenia and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Fanconi anemia carried the worst prognosis, with severe bone marrow failure and cancer susceptibility. Diamond-Blackfan anemia had the best prognosis.

The mechanisms of these anti-leukemic GC effects are, however, poorly understood. We previously defined a list of GC-regulated genes by expression profiling in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during systemic GC monotherapy and in experimental systems of GC-induced apoptosis. PLZF/ZBTB16, a transcriptional repressor, was one of the most promising candidates derived from this screen. To investigate its role in the anti-leukemic GC effects, we performed overexpression and knock-down experiments in CCRF-CEM childhood ALL cells. Transgenic PLZF/ZBTB16 alone had no detectable effect on cell proliferation or survival, but reduced sensitivity to GC-induced apoptosis but not apoptosis induced by antibodies against Fas/CD95 or 3 different chemotherapeutics. Knock-down of ZBTB16 entailed a small, but significant, increase in cell death induction by GC. Affymetrix Exon array-based whole genome expression profiling revealed that PLZF/ZBTB16 induction did not significantly alter the expression profile, however, it interfered with the regulation of numerous GC response genes, including BCL2L11/Bim, which has previously been shown to be responsible for cell death induction in CCRF-CEM cells.

METHODS: Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitory effects in stably transfected HeLa cells were determined by luciferase assay, and effects on LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediators prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha in primary monocytes were assessed by ELISA. Cytotoxic activities were examined against HeLa cells, human leukaemia CCRF-CEM cells and the multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 subline using the MTT and XTT tests. However, a redox status has been linked with both inflammation and cancer, antioxidant effects were also assessed using the DPPH, lipid-peroxidation, and Folin-Ciocalteau methods. RESULTS: Among all the nine species, Gynura pseudochina var. hispida and Oroxylum indicum showed the most promising NF-kappaB inhibitory effects with the lowest IC(50) values (41.96 and 47.45 microg/ml, respectively). Muehlenbeckia platyclada did not inhibit the NF-kappaB activation but effectively inhibited the release of IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha with IC(50) values ranging between 0.28 and 8.67 microg/ml. Pouzolzia indica was the most cytotoxic against CCRF-CEM cells and the multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells (9.75% and 10.48% viability, at 10 microg/ml, respectively). Rhinacanthus nasutus was the most potent cytotoxicity against HeLa cells (IC(50) 3.63 microg/ml) and showed specific cytotoxicity against the multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells (18.72% viability at 10 microg/ml, p<0.0001 when compared to its cytotoxicity against CCRF-CEM cells). Moreover, Oroxylum indicum showed a high level of antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid-peroxidation (IC(50) 0.08 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides in vitro evidence for the use of the Thai plants, most importantly Gynura pseudochina var. hispida, Oroxylum indicum and Muehlenbeckia platyclada as Thai anti-inflammatory remedies and these plants are now a priority for further phytochemical research.",['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It has been previously shown that this prodrug displays significantly higher anticancer activity than gemcitabine against leukemia. In the present study the structural modifications of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) model membranes induced by increasing concentrations of GemSQ have been investigated using small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). At room temperature an unusual inverse bicontinuous cubic phase formed over a broad composition range. The basic bilayer structure displayed an intermediate order between those of the gel and fluid phases of DPPC. A reversible transition to a fluid lamellar phase occurred upon heating. The transitions between these two phases were governed by different mechanisms depending on the GemSq concentration in the membrane.

Unfortunately this assumption is far from true, and can be indicative of an underlying serious medical condition in most of the cases (i.e. cancer). However, the biological role of severe hypocholesterolaemia is poorly understood. Here, the possible biological process is being investigated. Cholesterol plays a key role in cell proliferation, hence it has been suggested that low cholesterol levels are probably linked to the high cellular cholesterol demands from neoplastic cells. SUMMARY OF THE METHODS: We used serum and isolated T-lymphocytes from patients with acute lymphoblast leukaemia and human lymphoblast cell line to test this hypothesis. RESULTS: We found that patients with low serum cholesterol levels have instead high levels of cholesterol in lymphocytes. These data were supported with in vitro studies. In fact we have demonstrated that low cholesterol level in the culture medium was related to the neoplastic cellular growth, suggesting a greater use by lymphoma cells for their proliferation. Therefore by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis by mevastatin, in vitro, we showed that cholesterol levels did not change significantly in culture medium and the cellular growth was inhibited.

Evidence was provided that heparanase over-expression in cancer cells results in a marked increase in tissue factor (TF) levels. Likewise, TF was induced by exogenous addition of recombinant heparanase to tumor cells and primary endothelial cells, induction that was mediated by p38 phosphorylation and correlated with enhanced procoagulant activity. TF induction was further confirmed in heparanase over-expressing transgenic mice and correlated with heparanase expression levels in leukemia patients. Heparanase was also found to be involved in the regulation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). A physical interaction between heparanase and TFPI was demonstrated, suggesting a mechanism by which secreted heparanase interacts with TFPI on the cell surface, leading to dissociation of TFPI from the cell membrane and increased coagulation activity, thus further supporting the local pro-thrombotic function of heparanase. Data indicate a possible involvement of heparanase in early miscarriages and point to a regulatory effect on TFPI and TFPI-2 in trophoblasts. As heparins are strong inhibitor of heparanase, in view of the effect of heparanase on TF, the role of heparins anticoagulant-activity may potentially be expanded. Taking into account the pro-metastatic and pro-angiogenic functions of heparanase, its over-expression in human malignancies and abundance in platelets, its involvement in the coagulation machinery is an intriguing novel arena for further research.",,"['Nadir, Yona', 'Brenner, Benjamin']","['Nadir Y', 'Brenner B']","['Thrombosis and Hemostasis Unit, Department of Hematology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel. ynadir@netvision.net.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticoagulants/*pharmacology', '*Blood Coagulation', 'Glucuronidase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Heparin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*blood/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/*metabolism']",2010/05/15 06:00,2010/08/12 06:00,['2010/05/04 06:00'],"['2010/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0049-3848(10)70018-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0049-3848(10)70018-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2010 Apr;125 Suppl 2:S72-6. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(10)70018-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The body of biological information on APL establishes this leukemia as a unique entity that has to be promptly recognized to counteract the coagulopathy, especially in light of its striking response to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid. In fact, the current standard for induction therapy results in extremely high antileukemic efficacy, achieving 90 to 95% complete remission rate. However, while primary leukemia resistance has virtually disappeared as a cause of remission induction failure, death due to hemorrhage remains the major problem during the early treatment phase. As a part of the clotting activation commonly present in APL, thrombosis is a less recognized and probably underestimated life-threatening manifestation in patients with this disease.

Haematopoietic progenitors are stimulated by growth factors and cytokines to proliferate and differentiate, and they die via apoptosis when these factors are depleted. An aberrant response to growth environment may lead to haematological disorders. Bomapin (serpinb10) is a hematopoietic- and myeloid leukaemia-specific protease inhibitor with unknown function. RESULTS: We found that the majority of naturally expressed bomapin was located in the nucleus. Both the natural and recombinant bomapin had a disulfide bond which linked the only two bomapin cysteines: one located in the CD-loop and the other near the C-terminus. Computer modelling showed that the cysteines are distant in the reduced bomapin, but can easily be disulfide-linked without distortion of the overall bomapin structure. Low-level ectopic expression of bomapin in bomapin-deficient K562 cells resulted in about 90% increased cell proliferation under normal growth conditions. On the other hand, antisense-downregulation of natural bomapin in U937 cells resulted in a decreased cell proliferation. Bomapin C395S mutant, representing the reduced form of the serpin, had no effect on cell proliferation, suggesting that the disulfide bond-linked conformation of bomapin is biologically important. The bomapin-dependent effect was specific for myeloid cells, since ectopic expression of the serpin in HT1080 cells did not change cell proliferation. In contrast to the survival-promoting activity of bomapin in cells cultured under optimal growth conditions, bomapin enhanced cell apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that bomapin is a redox-sensitive nuclear serpin that augments proliferation or apoptosis of leukaemia cells, depending on growth factors availability.",,"['Przygodzka, Patrycja', 'Ramstedt, Bjorn', 'Tengel, Tobias', 'Larsson, Goran', 'Wilczynska, Malgorzata']","['Przygodzka P', 'Ramstedt B', 'Tengel T', 'Larsson G', 'Wilczynska M']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100430,England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (SERPINB10 protein, human)', '0 (Serpins)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism', 'Serpins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2010/05/04 06:00,2010/07/06 06:00,['2010/05/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2121-11-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2121-11-30 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2010 Apr 30;11:30. doi: 10.1186/1471-2121-11-30.,,PMC2874763,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we address the challenge of selecting a relevant and manageable subset of genes from a large microarray dataset. Currently, most gene selection methods focus on identifying a set of genes that can further improve classification accuracy. Few or none of these small sets of genes, however, are biologically relevant (i.e. supported by medical evidence). To deal with this critical issue, we propose two novel methods that can identify biologically relevant genes concerning cancers. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose two novel techniques, entitled random forest gene selection (RFGS) and support vector sampling technique (SVST). Compared with results from six other methods developed in this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that RFGS and SVST can identify more biologically relevant genes in patients with leukemia or prostate cancer. Among the top 25 genes selected using SVST method, 15 genes were biologically relevant genes in patients with leukemia and 13 genes were biologically relevant genes in patients with prostate cancer. Meanwhile, the RFGS method, while less effective than SVST, still identified an average of 9 biologically relevant genes in both leukemia and prostate cancers. In contrast to traditional statistical methods, which only identify less than 8 genes in patients with leukemia and less than 8 genes in patients with prostate cancer, our methods yield significantly better results. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed SVST and RFGS methods are novel approaches that can identify a greater number of biologically relevant genes. These methods have been successfully applied to both leukemia and prostate cancers. Research in the fields of biology and medicine should benefit from the identification of biologically relevant genes by confirming recent discoveries in cancer research or suggesting new avenues for exploration.",,"['Chen, Austin H', 'Tsau, Yin-Wu', 'Lin, Ching-Heng']","['Chen AH', 'Tsau YW', 'Lin CH']","['Department of Medical Informatics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien City, Hualien County, Taiwan. achen@mail.tcu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100430,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics']",2010/05/04 06:00,2010/07/02 06:00,['2010/05/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-11-274 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-11-274 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2010 Apr 30;11:274. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-11-274.,,PMC2873479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors present an analysis of the prevalence of previously diagnosed extracranial malignancies at the time of meningioma diagnosis in 1228 patients evaluated at a single institution. METHODS: All patients who underwent evaluation and/or treatment for meningioma between 1991 and 2007 at the authors' institution were identified. The intake history and physical were assessed for any history of extracranial malignancy. Using the National Cancer Institute data, the authors calculated an expected cancer prevalence for their meningioma patient population, and compared this derived value to the observed rate of these cancers in this population. RESULTS: There were 1228 patients included in this study. A total of 50 patients (4.1%) with newly diagnosed meningioma had a history of an extracranial malignant tumor at the time of their initial meningioma diagnosis. In general, most malignancies did not differ in prevalence from their expected frequency in the population in the present study. Notable exceptions were acute leukemia (p < 0.0001), and papillary thyroid carcinoma, which had a prevalence 2.5 times that expected in this population (p < 0.05).

Cytological findings of the supraclavicular lymph node showed numerous CD3 positive (100%) and CD2 positive (88%) lymphoblasts, negative for CD34 and CD10. Flow cytometry of lymph node revealed T cell phenotype of immature cells: CD45+CD2+CD5+CD7+CD4+CD8+CD3cyt +CD3TdT+CD10-CD34-HLAD/DR-. Cytogenetic analysis of lymph node showed translocation t(1;4)(p32;p12), t(8;14)(q24;q11.2). Southern blot analysis of extracted DNA from the supraclavicular lymph node demonstrated clonal rearrangement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR/J) gene (region Vb+Jb2). Based on these findings, diagnosis of T lymphoblastic non Hodgkin lymphoma was established. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed CNS infiltration with 49% lymphoblasts positive for CD4 and CD8. The disease progressed rapidly with poor response to therapy. T-ALL/LBL with an unusual t(8;14)(q24;q11.2) is a very rare hematologic disorder with rapid disease progression and poor response to conventional therapy because of frequent central nervous system involvement and early relapses.",,"['Mandac, Inga', 'Kolonic, Slobodanka Ostojic', 'Vrhovac, Radovan', 'Lasan-Trcic, Ruzica', 'Jakelic-Pitesa, Jasminka', 'Kardum-Skelin, Ika']","['Mandac I', 'Kolonic SO', 'Vrhovac R', 'Lasan-Trcic R', 'Jakelic-Pitesa J', 'Kardum-Skelin I']","['University Hospital ""Merkur"", Zagreb, Croatia. imandac@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Coll Antropol,Collegium antropologicum,8003354,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2010/05/04 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/05/04 06:00'],"['2010/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Coll Antropol. 2010 Mar;34(1):265-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment with BAPTA-AM (Ca(2+) chelator) and N-acetylcysteine (ROS scavenger) abolished caffeine-induced ERK inactivation and p38 MPAK activation. Moreover, caffeine treatment led to MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) down-regulation and protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) up-regulation, which were involved in cross-talk between p38 MAPK and ERK. Transfection of constitutively active MEK1 or pretreatment with SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) restored MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expression in caffeine-treated cells. Caffeine treatment repressed ERK-mediated c-Fos phosphorylation but evoked p38 MAPK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation.

This study investigated whether variants in inflammatory genes act alone or interact with plasma antioxidants to influence prostate cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in Central Arkansas. METHODS: Cases (n = 193) were men, aged 40-80, diagnosed with prostate cancer in three major hospitals in 1998-2003, and controls (n = 197) were matched to cases by age, race, and county of residence. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, polymorphisms in COX-2 (rs689466) and IL-8 (rs4073) were not significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. However, apparent interactions were observed between these genetic variants and plasma antioxidants on the risk of this malignancy.

METHODS: Patients between the ages of 2 to 17 years with persistent fever and neutropenia were randomly assigned to receive caspofungin (70 mg/m loading dose on day 1, then 50 mg/m daily [maximum 70 mg/d]) or L-AmB (3 mg/kg daily) in a 2:1 ratio. Evaluation of safety was the primary objective of the study. Efficacy was also evaluated, with a successful outcome defined as fulfilling all components of a prespecified 5-part composite endpoint. Suspected invasive fungal infections were evaluated by an independent, treatment-blinded adjudication committee. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients received study therapy (caspofungin 56, L-AmB 26), and 81 were evaluated for efficacy (caspofungin 56; L-AmB 25). Outcomes for safety and efficacy endpoints were similar for both study arms. Adverse drug-related event rates [95% confidence interval] were similar between the caspofungin and L-AmB groups (clinical 48.2% [34.7-62.0] versus 46.2% [26.6-66.6]; laboratory 10.7% [4.0-21.9] versus 19.2% [6.6-39.4]). Serious drug-related adverse events occurred in 1 (1.8%) of caspofungin-treated patients and 3 (11.5%) of L-AmB-treated patients. Overall success rates [95% CI] were 46.4% [33.4-59.5] for caspofungin and 32.0% [13.7-50.3] for L-AmB. CONCLUSIONS: Caspofungin and L-AmB were comparable in tolerability, safety, and efficacy as empiric antifungal therapy for persistently febrile neutropenic pediatric patients.",,"['Maertens, Johan A', 'Madero, Luis', 'Reilly, Anne F', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Groll, Andreas H', 'Jafri, Hasan S', 'Green, Michael', 'Nania, Joseph J', 'Bourque, Michael R', 'Wise, Beth Ann', 'Strohmaier, Kim M', 'Taylor, Arlene F', 'Kartsonis, Nicholas A', 'Chow, Joseph W', 'Arndt, Carola A S', 'DePauw, Ben E', 'Walsh, Thomas J']","['Maertens JA', 'Madero L', 'Reilly AF', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Groll AH', 'Jafri HS', 'Green M', 'Nania JJ', 'Bourque MR', 'Wise BA', 'Strohmaier KM', 'Taylor AF', 'Kartsonis NA', 'Chow JW', 'Arndt CA', 'DePauw BE', 'Walsh TJ']","['Acute Leukemia and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology, University Hospitals Leuven, Campus Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Caspofungin', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Echinocandins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Lipopeptides', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/05/01 06:00,2010/08/10 06:00,['2010/05/01 06:00'],"['2010/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/INF.0b013e3181da2171 [doi]', '00006454-201005000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2010 May;29(5):415-20. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e3181da2171.,,,,,['Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2010 Oct;29(10):985-6; author reply 986-7.

Since the early 1960s, a peculiar neurological disease became prevalent throughout Japan. Through the chemical analysis of the green urine, characteristic of this disease, it was found that this disease was caused by intoxication of the administered clioquinol, an anti-diarrheal drug. This discovery is a big topic in the history of Japanese medicine. 2) In early 1970s, I experienced many young patients with oedema and polyneuropathy in Kagoshima. Finally it was found that the disease was the long-forgotten beriberi, which had disappeared several decades ago. We must always be aware of beriberi even now, as far as we eat well-polished rice. 3) In 1972, we noticed a group of sporadic paraparesis in Kagoshima, which was 20 years later confirmed to be induced by human T lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I). We named this disease as ""HTLV-I associated myelopathy"" (HAM). It gave a strong impact that the causative virus of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) can induce entirely different diseases, in terms of both the clinical course and the pathological features. It was also proven that HAM was identical with tropical spastic paraparesis, (TSP), which had been prevalent in many areas of tropical zones.

We report a case of donor cell leukemia in a pediatric patient with a history of acute myeloid leukemia that manifested as recurrent AML FAB type M5 fourteen months after umbilical cord blood transplantation. Although there was some immunophenotypic drift from the patient's original AML and their posttransplant presentation, the initial pathological impression was of recurrent disease. Bone marrow engraftment analysis by multiplex PCR of short tandem repeat markers performed on the patient's diagnostic specimen showed complete engraftment by donor cells, with a loss of heterozygosity in the donor alleles on chromosome 7. This led to the reinterpretation of this patient's disease as donor-derived leukemia. This interpretation was supported by a routine karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showing loss of chromosome 7 and a male (donor) chromosome complement in this female patient. Also noted was a loss of the patient's presenting chromosomal abnormality, t(11;19)(q23;p13).

Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the homo-tetramerization domain of ETO, the nervy homology region 2 (NHR2), is essential for RUNX1/ETO oncogenic activity. We analyzed the energetic contribution of individual amino acids within the NHR2 to RUNX1/ETO dimer-tetramer transition and found a clustered area of 5 distinct amino acids with strong contribution to the stability of tetramers. Substitution of these amino acids abolishes tetramer formation without affecting dimer formation. Similar to RUNX1/ETO monomers, dimers failed to bind efficiently to DNA and to alter expression of RUNX1-dependent genes. RUNX1/ETO dimers do not block myeloid differentiation, are unable to enhance the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic progenitors, and fail to induce leukemia in a murine transplantation model.

The expression of TLRs and Bcl-2 family is controlled by means of activating the transcriptional signaling pathways that involve the p38 MAP kinase. As previously described, PMNs from cancer patients exert accelerated apoptosis associated with decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. In the present study we have been interested in establishing the involvement of TLR2 and TLR6, and p38 MAP kinase in the Mcl-1-modulated apoptosis in PMNs of oral cavity cancer patients. The expression of these proteins in neutrophils and autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was analyzed by Western blot, the intensity of apoptosis was estimated by flow cytometry, caspase-9 activity by colorimetric assay, and the cytochrome c concentration by ELISA. The simultaneous decreased expression of examined TLRs receptors and Mcl-1 protein, associated with the acceleration of PMNs apoptosis, suggests that this process in PMNs controlled by Mcl-1 is dependent on the TLR2 and TLR6 signalling. Impaired TLRs expression can lead to insufficient activation of p38PAPK, resulting in low expression of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein responsible for shortened lifespan of the examined PMNs.",,"['Jablonska, Ewa', 'Garley, Marzena']","['Jablonska E', 'Garley M']","['Department of Immunology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. ewa.jablonska@umwb.edu.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 6/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2009/01/01 00:00,2010/07/21 06:00,['2010/05/01 06:00'],"['2010/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['T10541W66R26V764 [pii]', '10.2478/v10042-008-0118-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2009;47(4):615-9. doi: 10.2478/v10042-008-0118-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can not be excluded that these antigens may originate from bacteria and viruses. Toll like receptors (TLRs) interact with pathogen associated molecular patterns as part of innate immunity. TLRs are currently used to target different subclasses of B-cell leukemia, and TLR agonists are being evaluated in clinical trials. It is little known regarding the repertoire and function of TLR in B-CLL. The aim of the study was to assess the CD180, CD284 and mCD14 levels in CD19+ subpopulation of B-CLL peripheral blood lymphocytes and compare them with respective levels in the normal B-cells of adult volunteers, before and after LPS stimulation. We investigated the percentage of the CD19+CD180+, CD19+CD284+, CD19+CD14+ cells and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD180, CD284 and CD14 antigens among CD19+ B-CLL as well as in the normal B cells for comparison. MFI analysis revealed that CD180, CD284 and CD14 expression was higher on normal B cells then on CD19+ B-CLL (MFI CD180: 99.16 vs. 25.3, MFI CD284: 7.37 vs. 5.79 and MFI CD14 25.07 vs. 8.32). After 24-hour LPS activation of B-cells, CD180 MFI appeared to decrease, in both healthy and B-CLL patients. CD284 MFI in healthy controls decreased after LPS stimulation while slight increase of MFI was observed in leukemic cells. CD14 MFI in leukemic cells was moderately higher after LPS in comparison to CD14 MFI without LPS stimulation, whereas CD14 MFI in normal CD19+ cells after LPS stimulation decreased over three times. Variations observed in expression of both normal and leukemic receptors may be due to their different sensitivity to antigenic stimulation.",,"['Antosz, Halina', 'Sajewicz, Joanna', 'Marzec-Kotarska, Barbara', 'Kocki, Janusz', 'Dmoszynska, Anna']","['Antosz H', 'Sajewicz J', 'Marzec-Kotarska B', 'Kocki J', 'Dmoszynska A']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Medical University in Lublin, Poland. hagenetyka@wp.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD180 protein, human)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*analysis', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*analysis']",2009/01/01 00:00,2010/07/21 06:00,['2010/05/01 06:00'],"['2010/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['QK4X2158113G3R82 [pii]', '10.2478/v10042-009-0112-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2009;47(4):593-8. doi: 10.2478/v10042-009-0112-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rates of IPD in patients with various haematological and solid-organ malignancies were determined by obtaining the number of these patients at risk from the provincial cancer registry. Compared to the attack rate of IPD in the adult population aged >/=18 years (11.0 cases/100,000 per year, 95% CI 10.44-11.65), there were significantly increased rates of IPD in those with lung cancer (143.6 cases/100,000 per year, OR 13.4, 95% CI 9.3-19.4, P<0.001) and multiple myeloma (673.9 cases/100,000 per year, OR 62.8, 95% CI 39.6-99.8, P<0.001).

Expression studies implicated Topors as a tumor suppressor in various malignancies. To gain insight into the function of Topors, we generated a Topors-deficient mouse strain. RESULTS: Mice homozygous for a mutant Topors allele exhibited a high rate of perinatal mortality and decreased lifespan. In addition, heterozygotes were found to have an increased incidence of malignancy, involving a variety of tissues. Consistent with this finding, primary embryonic fibroblasts lacking Topors exhibited an increased rate of malignant transformation, associated with aneuploidy and defective chromosomal segregation. While loss of Topors did not alter sensitivity to DNA-damaging or microtubule-targeting agents, cells lacking Topors exhibited altered pericentric heterochromatin, manifested by mislocalization of HP1alpha and an increase in transcription from pericentric major satellite DNA. Topors-deficient cells exhibited a transcriptional profile similar to that of cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors, and were resistant to the anti-proliferative effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A.

The fundamental problem is that qPCR methods use mathematical models that explicitly or implicitly apply an estimate of amplification efficiency, the error of which is compounded in the analysis to unacceptable levels. RESULTS: We present a new method of qPCR analysis that is efficiency-independent and yields accurate and precise results in controlled experiments. The method depends on a computer-assisted deconvolution that finds the point of concordant amplification behavior between the ""unknown"" template and an admixed amplicon standard. We apply the method to demonstrate dexamethasone-induced changes in gene expression in lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: This method of qPCR analysis does not use any explicit or implicit measure of efficiency, and may therefore be immune to problems inherent in other qPCR approaches. It yields an estimate of absolute initial copy number of template, and controlled tests show it generates accurate results.",,"['Hirakawa, Yasuko', 'Medh, Rheem D', 'Metzenberg, Stan']","['Hirakawa Y', 'Medh RD', 'Metzenberg S']","['Department of Biology, California State University, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, California 91330, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100429,England,BMC Mol Biol,BMC molecular biology,100966983,"['0 (Actins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*standards', 'Reference Standards', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted']",2010/05/01 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/05/01 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2199-11-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2199-11-30 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Mol Biol. 2010 Apr 29;11:30. doi: 10.1186/1471-2199-11-30.,"['SC3 GM081099/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R15 CA122613-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SC3-GM081099/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'SC3 GM081099-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '1R15 CA122613-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R15 CA122613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2877679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout the past several decades, clinical scientists have continued to refine risk stratification in clinical trials with the understanding that individual patients have different subtypes of pediatric ALL that will respond to therapy in different, but predictable ways. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Discussed in this review are the most significant findings from pharmacogenomic studies of pediatric ALL from 1989 to the present. Pharmacogenomic studies related to the drugs commonly used to treat pediatric ALL are covered in detail, including an emphasis on both genome-wide and candidate gene/pathway approaches. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Readers of this paper will acquire a detailed understanding of how pharmacogenomic studies can be integrated into clinical trials, in addition to some of the discrepancies still present in the field.

Validation of efficient vitamin receptor-mediated endocytosis and drug release.,979-87,10.1021/bc9005656 [doi],"An efficient mechanism-based tumor-targeting drug delivery system, based on tumor-specific vitamin-receptor mediated endocytosis, has been developed. The tumor-targeting drug delivery system is a conjugate of a tumor-targeting molecule (biotin: vitamin H or vitamin B-7), a mechanism-based self-immolative linker and a second-generation taxoid (SB-T-1214) as the cytotoxic agent. This conjugate (1) is designed to be (i) specific to the vitamin receptors overexpressed on tumor cell surface and (ii) internalized efficiently through receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by smooth drug release via glutathione-triggered self-immolation of the linker. In order to monitor and validate the sequence of events hypothesized, i.e., receptor-mediated endocytosis of the conjugate, drug release, and drug-binding to the target protein (microtubules), three fluorescent/fluorogenic molecular probes (2, 3, and 4) were designed and synthesized. The actual occurrence of these processes was unambiguously confirmed by means of confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) and flow cytometry using L1210FR leukemia cells, overexpressing biotin receptors. The molecular probe 4, bearing the taxoid linked to fluorescein, was also used to examine the cell specificity (i.e., efficacy of receptor-based cell targeting) for three cell lines, L1210FR (biotin receptors overexpressed), L1210 (biotin receptors not overexpressed), and WI38 (normal human lung fibroblast, biotin receptor negative). As anticipated, the molecular probe 4 exhibited high specificity only to L1210FR. To confirm the direct correlation between the cell-specific drug delivery and anticancer activity of the probe 4, its cytotoxicity against these three cell lines was also examined. The results clearly showed a good correlation between the two methods. In the same manner, excellent cell-specific cytotoxicity of the conjugate 1 (without fluorescein attachment to the taxoid) against the same three cell lines was confirmed. This mechanism-based tumor-targeting drug delivery system will find a range of applications.",,"['Chen, Shuyi', 'Zhao, Xianrui', 'Chen, Jingyi', 'Chen, Jin', 'Kuznetsova, Larisa', 'Wong, Stanislaus S', 'Ojima, Iwao']","['Chen S', 'Zhao X', 'Chen J', 'Chen J', 'Kuznetsova L', 'Wong SS', 'Ojima I']","['Department of Chemistry and Institute of Chemical Biology & Drug Discovery, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11794-3400, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (SB T-1214)', '0 (Taxoids)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Biotin/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytotoxins/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Taxoids/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",2010/05/01 06:00,2010/08/18 06:00,['2010/05/01 06:00'],"['2010/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc9005656 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2010 May 19;21(5):979-87. doi: 10.1021/bc9005656.,"['R01 CA103314-18A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 103314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA103314-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA103314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM427980/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3036843,['NIHMS269845'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conjugation of folic acid to therapeutic and imaging agents has been shown to enhance their delivery to FR (+) cancer cells in vitro and in tumor-bearing mice via an FR-mediated cellular uptake mechanism. In this study, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was conjugated to folate and evaluated as a therapeutic antibody against folate receptor (FR)-positive tumors. Murine IgG (mIgG) was conjugated to folate via an amide bond to yield folate-conjugated mIgG (f-mIgG) that contained an average of approximately 2.6 folates per molecule. Selective uptake of f-IgG by FR (+) tumor cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy and by flow cytometry. Lysis of L1210JF cells by NK cells from murine donors was increased 1.4-9.0-fold at the effector:target (E:T) ratio of 25:1, relative to control mIgG. In mice bearing L1210JF tumors, f-mIgG was found to significantly inhibit tumor growth and to have prolonged the median survival time (MeST). Significantly, the antitumor efficacy of f-mIgG was greatly increased when combined with liposomal G3139, an 18-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. In fact, the combination resulted in a 100% cure rate among the tumor-bearing mice. Injection of f-mIgG significantly increased serum INF-gamma and IL-6 level in mice compared with mIgG and dramatically increased serum INF-gamma and IL-6 level when combined with liposomal G3139.

We found that one siRNA oligo pair can efficiently knock down BMI-1 in U937 cells as evaluated by real-time RT-PCR as well as Western blot analysis. Furthermore, we found that BMI-1 depletion leads to reduced cell growth and proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis. Our proof-of-principle findings confirm that Bmi-1 siRNA can be used as a therapeutic target of any Bmi-1 expressing leukemia and other cancer cells.",,"['Zhu, Wei', 'Huang, Ling', 'Xu, Xuejing', 'Qian, Hui', 'Xu, Wenrong']","['Zhu W', 'Huang L', 'Xu X', 'Qian H', 'Xu W']","['School of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine, Jiangsu University, Jiangsu 212013, P.R.

We previously demonstrated that B1647 cells, a human leukemic cell line, express Nox2 and Nox4, both at mRNA and protein level.

Nox-derived ROS are involved in early signaling events such as the autophosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2, and in the modulation of glucose uptake, a cellular activity strictly bound to VEGF-induced leukemic cell proliferation, as shown by experiments with antioxidants and Nox inhibitors and siRNA.

Here, we used the AOM model to measure the gene expression profiles of biomarkers related to tumor progression. We assessed tumor progression stages by computed tomographic (CT) colonography. Messenger RNAs were isolated from tumors and mucosal samples, and gene expression levels were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We show that early stages of tumor progression are associated with an upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and of genes involved in the inflammatory response, including interleukin (IL1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). The ratio of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X proteins (Bax) to Bcl-2 transcript (proapototic/antiapoptotic signals) is elevated in early stages of tumor progression (Bax/Bcl-2 >1) and reversed in more advanced stages of tumor development (Bax/Bcl-2 <1). These changes are associated with the reduced expression of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-death receptor 5 (DR5) and FAS (also known as CD95) apoptotic receptors. Advanced stages of tumor development are characterized by an increase in MMP-9 expression associated with the upregulation of components of the innate immune system: alpha-defensin 5 (DEF-5) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL).

However, HIV/AIDS epidemics appear not to have been associated with higher incidence of lymphomas in Africa. We therefore carried out this study to highlight the significance or otherwise of HIV/AIDS epidemics in the pathogenesis of lymphomas in a population of Nigerians with the disease. Since January 1993 to the present, all patients with haematologic cancers are routinely screened (following appropriate counseling) for HIV infection. Patients with a histological diagnosis of malignant chronic lymphoproliferative diseases {non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)} at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals' Complex, Ile-Ife from January 1993 to August 2008 were noted. Those patients confirmed to be HIV/AIDS positive among the cohort with lymphomas were retrospectively studied using their clinical case notes. Data obtained were analyzed using appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics. A total of 391 patients were histologically confirmed to have lymphoma {NHL-109, (27.9%); CLL-76, (19.4%); BL-178, (45.5%) and HL-28, (7.2%)} during the study period. Nine patients (2.3%) were confirmed to be HIV- positive, all within the age bracket 24-60 (median = 50) years. Six of these, five males and one female, ages 24-60 (median = 37.5) years, had NHL while another three, all females (age 50 - 68 years; median = 56 years) had CLL. None of the patients with HL and BL were HIV positive. Patients with NHL presented at advanced stage of the disease (at least clinical stage IIIb), and all those with CLL presented at stage C of the International Working Party Classification. All the HIV-positive patients with NHL succumbed to the disease within one to three weeks of admission into the hospital. The prevalence of AIDS-related lymphomas is 2.3% compared to 4.4% found in the general population. However, it is interesting that no single case of AIDS-associated BL was seen, despite the fact that Burkitt's lymphoma is endemic in this part of the world.

Although every 2-week-administration of WT1 peptides for 22 weeks did not show definite effects on the quantification of bcr-abl transcripts, by changing the administration from every 2 weeks to 4 weeks bcr-abl transcripts decreased remarkably. After 11 months of every 4-week-administration of the peptides and 12 months post cessation of the peptides bcr-abl transcripts achieved to the level below detection by RQ/RT-PCR (complete molecular response).

COX-2 is not expressed in lymphocytes of 11 patients with patch-stage MF, whereas sporadic COX-2 staining of stromal cells is observed in the majority of patients. COX-2 expression correlates with a constitutive production of PGE(2) in malignant T cells in vitro. These cells express prostaglandin receptors EP3 and EP4 and the receptor antagonist as well as small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against COX-2, and specific COX-2 inhibitors strongly reduce their spontaneous proliferation.

Because the in vivo survival, expansion and anti-lymphoma activity of CAR.19(+) T cells remain suboptimal even when the CAR contains a CD28 costimulatory endodomain, we generated a novel construct that also incorporates the interleukin-15 (IL-15) gene and an inducible caspase-9-based suicide gene (iC9/CAR.19/IL-15). We found that compared with CAR.19(+) T cells, iC9/CAR.19/IL-15(+) T cells had: (1) greater numeric expansion upon antigen stimulation (10-fold greater expansion in vitro, and 3- to 15-fold greater expansion in vivo) and reduced cell death rate (Annexin-V(+)/7-AAD(+) cells 10+/-6% for iC9/CAR.19/IL-15(+) T cells and 32+/-19% for CAR.19(+) T cells); (2) reduced expression of the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor upon antigen stimulation (PD-1(+) cells <15% for iC9/CAR.19/IL-15(+) T cells versus >40% for CAR.19(+) T cells); and (3) improved antitumor effects in vivo (from 4.7- to 5.4-fold reduced tumor growth). In addition, iC9/CAR.19/IL-15(+) T cells were efficiently eliminated upon pharmacologic activation of the suicide gene.

Most pathophysiological features of the early stages of MALT lymphomagenesis can be reproduced by experimental infection of BALB/c mice with Helicobacter species. We have previously shown that MALT lymphomas are infiltrated by T-helper cell type 2-polarized T cells and that human and murine tumor B cells carry polyreactive surface immunoglobulins. Using the murine model of the disease, in this study we show that explanted tumor B cells proliferate upon stimulation with the same panel of self and foreign antigens that are recognized by their surface antibodies. Tumor cell proliferation is strongly enhanced by the presence of intratumoral CD4(+) T cells in a CD40/CD40L-independent manner. A large proportion of tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells are CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) with highly suppressive activity, which are recruited by the tumor cells through secretion of the Treg-attracting chemokines CCL17 and CCL22. The depletion of CD25(+) cells was as efficient as CD4(+) T cell depletion in blocking tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that B-cell receptor-derived signals cooperate with T-helper cell signals in driving the progression of MALT lymphoma, providing an explanation for the unique antigen dependence of this B-cell malignancy.",,"['Craig, V J', 'Cogliatti, S B', 'Arnold, I', 'Gerke, C', 'Balandat, J-E', 'Wundisch, T', 'Muller, A']","['Craig VJ', 'Cogliatti SB', 'Arnold I', 'Gerke C', 'Balandat JE', 'Wundisch T', 'Muller A']","['Institute of Molecular Cancer Research, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100429,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Helicobacter/isolation & purification', 'Helicobacter Infections/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/immunology/microbiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/immunology/microbiology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism']",2010/04/30 06:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2010/04/30 06:00'],"['2010/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201076 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.76 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jun;24(6):1186-96. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.76.

However, none of these mutations were MPN specific, displayed mutual exclusivity or could be traced back to a common ancestral clone. JAK2 and MPL mutations appear to exert a phenotype-modifying effect and are distinctly associated with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis; the corresponding mutational frequencies are approximately 99, 55 and 65% for JAK2 and 0, 3 and 10% for MPL mutations. The incidence of TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH or IKZF1 mutations in these disorders ranges from 0 to 17%; these latter mutations are more common in chronic (TET2, ASXL1, CBL) or juvenile (CBL) myelomonocytic leukemias, mastocytosis (TET2), myelodysplastic syndromes (TET2, ASXL1) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia, including blast-phase MPN (IDH, ASXL1, IKZF1). The functional consequences of MPN-associated mutations include unregulated JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling, epigenetic modulation of transcription and abnormal accumulation of oncoproteins.

Both of these genes are regulated by the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in conventional alphabeta T cells. It is unclear if gammadelta T cells use similar mechanisms. In this study, we show that thymic gammadelta T cells express S1P(1) and that it is regulated by KLF2. Furthermore, KLF2 and S1P(1)-deficient gammadelta T cells accumulate in the thymus and fail to populate the secondary lymphoid organs or gut, in contrast to the expectation from published work. Interestingly, KLF2 but not S1P(1) deficiency led to the expansion of a usually rare population of CD4(+) promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger(+) ""gammadelta NKT"" cells.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient that can function as an antiinflammatory and antioxidative agent, and as such, it may have atheroprotective properties. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that zinc down-regulates the production of atherosclerosis-related cytokines/molecules in humans. DESIGN: To examine these effects, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo trial of zinc supplementation in elderly subjects. We recruited 40 healthy elderly subjects (aged 56-83 y) and randomly assigned them to 2 groups. One group was given an oral dose of 45 mg zinc/d as a gluconate for 6 mo. The other group was given a placebo. Cell culture models were conducted to study the mechanism of zinc as an atheroprotective agent. RESULTS: After 6 mo of supplementation, the intake of zinc, compared with intake of placebo, increased the concentrations of plasma zinc and decreased the concentrations of plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL)-6, macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), secretory phospholipase A2, and malondialdehyde and hydroxyalkenals (MDA+HAE) in elderly subjects. Regression analysis showed that changes in concentrations of plasma zinc were inversely associated with changes in concentrations of plasma hsCRP, MCP-1, VCAM-1, and MDA+HAE after 6 mo of supplementation. In cell culture studies, we showed that zinc decreased the generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, VCAM-1, and MDA+HAE and the activation of nuclear transcription factor kappaB and increased antiinflammatory proteins A20 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha in human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells and human aortic endothelial cells compared with zinc-deficient cells.

We provide evidence that Norrin has distinct neuroprotective properties that are independent from its effects on vascular development. The function of Norrin was investigated in a mouse model of excitotoxic retinal ganglion cell (RGC) damage after intravitreal injection of NMDA, and in cultured Muller glia or immortalized RGC-5 cells. Intravitreal injection of Norrin significantly increased the number of surviving RGC axons in the optic nerve and decreased apoptotic death of retinal neurons following NMDA-mediated damage. This effect could be blocked by adding dickkopf (DKK)-1, an inhibitor of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Treatment of eyes with combined Norrin/NMDA activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and increased the retinal expression of leukemia inhibitory factor and endothelin-2, as well as that of neurotrophic growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, lens epithelium-derived growth factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor. A similar activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and an increased expression of neurotrophic factors was observed in cultured Muller cells after treatment with Norrin, effects that again could be blocked by adding DKK-1.

Moreover, downstream target genes of NANOG/OCT4/SOX2 were shown to be transcriptionally activated. However, the NANOG1 gene belongs to a gene family, including a gene tandem duplication (named NANOG2 or NANOGP1) and several pseudogenes (NANOGP2-P11). Thus, it was unclear which of the NANOG family members were transcribed in t(4;11) leukemia cells. 5'-RACE experiments revealed novel 5'-exons of NANOG1 and NANOG2, which could give rise to the expression of two different NANOG1 and three different NANOG2 protein variants. Moreover, a novel PCR-based method was established that allows distinguishing between transcripts deriving from NANOG1, NANOG2 and all other NANOG pseudogenes (P2-P11). By applying this method, we were able to demonstrate that human hematopoietic stem cells and different leukemic cells transcribe NANOG2. Furthermore, we functionally tested NANOG1 and NANOG2 protein variants by recombinant expression in 293 cells. These studies revealed that NANOG1 and NANOG2 protein variants are functionally equivalent and activate a regulatory circuit that activates specific stem cell genes.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of definitive therapy with radiation therapy (external beam radiation therapy [EBRT] or brachytherapy) on acute myeloid leukemia incidence in a population-based cohort of patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. METHODS: We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify a cohort of men (n=168,612) with newly diagnosed prostate adenocarcinoma between January 1988 and December 2003. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of acute myeloid leukemia incidence following definitive therapy with EBRT alone, brachytherapy alone, or surgery alone compared to no definitive therapy (i.e. no EBRT, brachytherapy, or surgery). RESULTS: The cohort yielded 184 acute myeloid leukemia cases during 1,064,820 person-years of follow-up after prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosis. Patients treated with EBRT had a higher adjusted relative risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than patients treated with brachytherapy or surgery when each therapy group was compared to patients who were not treated with definitive therapy (EBRT: HR=2.05, 95% CI 1.29, 3.26; brachytherapy: HR=1.22, 95% CI 0.46, 3.22; surgery: HR=1.24, 95% CI 0.77, 1.98).

However, the limitation is that most studies focused on the cut-off value at 10(-4) and the time point after induction. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive values of different MRD levels detected at different chemotherapy phases in childhood ALL. METHODS: One hundred and two patients were enrolled in this study from January 2002 to December 2004 in our hospital. All the patients were treated with modified National Protocol of Childhood ALL in China 1997. MRD levels were detected on the 15th day, 29th day, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after initial chemotherapy. All samples were stained with a panel of four colour combinations of fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies according to the leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) defined at diagnosis and analyzed by multi-parametric flow cytometry. CD45CD19CD34CD10, CD45CD19CD34CD20 and CD45CD19CD10CD20 were the most common combinations in B lineage ALL, while CD45CD2CD3CD7 and CD45CD2CD3CD34 were the most frequently used immunophenotypes for T lineage ALL. The median follow-up time was 63.3 months ranged from 40.6 to 87.5 months. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 64 were male and 38 were female, with a median age of 5.7 (0.2 - 14.8) years. Eighty-eight cases were diagnosed as B lineage ALL and the remaining 14 were T-ALL. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and event free survival (EFS) rate for this cohort were (86.9 +/- 3.4)% and (79.9 +/- 4.0)%, respectively. Twelve patients underwent relapse. Among the 102 patients, 14.3% had negative MRD (MRD < 10(-4)) on day 15, 43.9% on day 29, 39.1%, 39.7% and 45.6% had negative MRD at the third, sixth and twelfth month after chemotherapy. Patients who could achieve negative MRD within one year had superior outcome to the others [5-year EFS rates: (92.5 +/- 3.2)% vs. (58.3 +/- 8.6)%, P < 0.001]. The EFS for patients based on MRD levels measured at different stages of therapy were compared by Kaplan-Meier analyses. MRD was predictive of outcome at all 5 time points at a range of thresholds. The optimum threshold, selected for each time point on the basis of log rank analysis, progressively dropped from 10(-2) of day 15 [5-year EFS rates (79.8 +/- 10.3)% vs. (28.6 +/- 17.1)%, P < 0.001], to 10(-3) of day 29 [5-year EFS rates (88.3 +/- 4.9)% vs. (51.3 +/- 14.4)%, P < 0.003], to 10(-4) at 3 [5-year EFS rates (92.4 +/- 5.1)% vs. (65.5 +/- 7.5)%, P < 0.015], 6 [5-year EFS rates (96.3 +/- 3.6)% vs. (65.4 +/- 7.5)%, P < 0.003] and 12 [5-year EFS rates (100.0 +/- 0.0)% vs. (67.7 +/- 8.4)%, P < 0.002] months. And the hazard ratios for relapse and death at higher MRD level groups were 5.91 (95%CI: 1.9 - 18.9), 5.02 (95%CI: 1.5 - 16.5), 5.21 (95%CI: 1.2 - 22.9) and 11.10 (95%CI: 1.5 - 84.5) on day 15, day 29, at month 3 and month 6, respectively. And MRD >or= 10(-2) on day 15 was proven to be an independent predictor by multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model.

The mechanisms of drug transport resistance may chiefly contribute to MDR. Expression and/or activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multiple resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1), lung-resistance related protein (LRP) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) have been considered to be associated with unfavourable outcomes in pediatric AML patients. In previous studies, we found WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein-1 (WAVE1) was involved in the MDR mechanisms in K562/A02 leukemia cells. To investigate the expression of WAVE1, P-gp, MRP1, LRP/MVP and BCRP; and if WAVE1 is involved in MDR of human leukemia cell. METHODS: WAVE1, P-gp, MRP1, LRP, BCRP mRNA and protein expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were measured by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) and Western blot in a cohort of 52 children with acute myeloblastic leukemia. During follow-up, of the 52 patients, 21 were documented as being relapsing or refractory, and 31 were induced into complete continuous remission. Furthermore, HL60 cells and HL60/ADR cells were transiently transfected with PCDNA3.1-WAVE1 reconstructed plasmid and specifically siRNA to WAVE1 respectively, and the expression of WAVE1, MRP1 and BCRP before and after transfection was assessed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: (1) The expression levels of WAVE1, P-gp, MRP, LRP and BCRP in refractory/relapsing group were much higher than that in complete continuous remission (CCR) group. (2) WAVE1 mRNA and protein expression in BMMCs of children were at higher levels when they were newly diagnosed or relapsed, compared with complete continuous remission. (3) The WAVE1 expression at mRNA and protein level in HL60/ADR cells was increased by about 353% and 95% respectively as compared with that in HL60 cells. (4) Overexpression of WAVE1 in HL60 cell lines upregulated the expression levels of MRP and BCRP (MRP mRNA and protein level were increased by about 16.54 times and 129% respectively, BCRP was increased by 4.93 times and 96%); whereas suppression of WAVE1 expression by RNA interference downregulated the expression levels of MRP1 and BCRP (MRP mRNA and protein level was only 11% and 43% of pre-disturbance respectively, BCRP was 14% and 71%).

A 12-14 GY fractioned total body irradiation (TBI) was given to children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Busulphan based myeloablative regimen was applied to all the other patients. ATG (Fresenius) 15 - 20 mg/kg + low dose cyclosporine A oral [CSA, 8 - 12 mg/(kg * d) with serum trough levels 150 - 200 ng/ml] +/- methotrexate (without methotrexate for cord blood transplant) were administered as graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Mycophenolate mofetil [MMF, 20 - 30 mg/(kg * d)] was added for 13 CML after Jan 1, 2006 because of more severe GVHD was observed in this group. RESULTS: The median age was 8.0 (2 - 17) years with the median follow up period of 23.5 (0.7 - 85) months. The estimated 3 years overall survival (OS) was 63.0%; 23.9% patients died of transplant related mortality, 13.0% patients died of leukemia relapse. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection recurred in 50% patients and hemorrhagic cystitis in 15.2% patients; 33.3% patients developed grade III-IV acute GVHD and 55.6% developed chronic GVHD (13.9% with extensive chronic GVHD). The OS was significantly different between the patients older (n = 20) and younger (n = 26) than 10 years (45.0% vs. 76.9%, P = 0.015) and among the patients with ALL (n = 13), CML (n = 18) and AML (n = 15) (38.4%, 66.7% vs.80.0%, P = 0.034). The OS in patient with high risk leukemia (n = 24) was lower than that in the patient with low risk leukemia (n = 22) (45.8% vs. 81.8%, P = 0.012). Except 8 cord blood transplant the OS of patients with HLA 6/6 high resolution completely matched (n = 16) and 1/6 mismatched (n = 16) bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplants was significantly higher than patients with 2/6 mismatched (n = 6) UDT (75.0%, 75.0% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.007). But the OS was not significantly different between patients with grade 0-II acute GVHD and III-IV acute GVHD (60.0% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.494). CONCLUSION: The outcome of UDT for Chinese children with refractory leukemia is encouraging. Patients younger than 10 years with 0-1/6 high resolution mismatched UDT had the best OS. The outcome of patients with myeloid and low risk leukemia is superior to those with other types of leukemia.",,"['Chen, Jing', 'Luo, Cheng-juan', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Luo, Chang-ying', 'Xue, Hui-liang', 'Tang, Jing-yan', 'Pan, Ci', 'Dong, Lu', 'Zhou, Min', 'Ye, Qi-dong', 'Wang, Yao-ping', 'Gu, Long-jun']","['Chen J', 'Luo CJ', 'Jiang H', 'Luo CY', 'Xue HL', 'Tang JY', 'Pan C', 'Dong L', 'Zhou M', 'Ye QD', 'Wang YP', 'Gu LJ']","[""Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine Shanghai Children's Medical Center Hematology/Oncology Department, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['chi'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/04/30 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/04/30 06:00'],"['2010/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2010 Mar;48(3):170-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In children older than 2 months, SP is also the most common cause of invasive bacterial infections. Invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) have become a severe problem of public health worldwide. The aim of this study was to summarize the clinical characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of IPD in children, and to raise the level of diagnosis and treatment of this disease. METHOD: The clinical data from 55 cases of IPD younger than 12 years old seen from January 2004 to June 2009 in Yuying Children's Hospital Affiliated to Wenzhou Medical College were analyzed retrospectively. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), seroperitoneum, mediastinum and soft tissue aspirate specimens were collected from these children, and 64 SP strains were cultured, isolated and confirmed and the antibiotics susceptibility to penicillin and other antibiotics of these strains were assessed. RESULT: The 55 cases of IPD were identified, among whom 32 were male and 23 female, the ratio was 1.39. The ages ranged from 47 days to 12 years. Most (62%) of the cases were aged less than 2 years, and 16% were aged from 2 to 5 years. Overall, 38 (69%) had septicemia, of whom 8 cases were complicated with meningitis, 2 with pneumonia complicated with empyema, 1 had pneumonia complicated with mediastinal abscess and 11 with pneumonia. Nine cases (16%) were diagnosed as meningitis. Seven cases (13%) had hip or neck abscess and 1 case had purulent peritonitis. Thirteen cases (24%) had an underlying disease, including mainly leukemia (31%), followed by congenital heart disease (23%) and head trauma (15%). Three cases (5%) had received a surgical operation; 3 cases (5%) had combined virus infections and 2 cases (4%) had mycoplasma infection. Most (73%) episodes occurred in winter and spring. The main origin of infection was community (89%). Forty of the patients were cured, 12 improved and 3 died (5%). Nine cases (16%) developed neurologic complications. There was a statistically significant differences in the annual detection rate of invasive SP (chi(2) = 33.93, P < 0.01). The incidence of penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were 30% and 41%, respectively; the resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin were found in as high as 94% and 88% of isolates, respectively; while the resistant rate to chloramphenicol and cefotaxime were low, 26% and 22%, respectively.

C/EBPdelta gene transcription is induced during cellular quiescence and repressed during active cell cycle progression. C/EBPdelta exhibits tumor suppressor gene properties including reduced expression in cancer cell lines and tumors and promoter methylation silencing. We previously reported that C/EBPdelta expression is inversely correlated with c-Myc (Myc) expression. Aberrant Myc expression is common in cancer and transcriptional repression is a major mechanism of Myc oncogenesis. A number of tumor suppressor genes are targets of Myc transcriptional repression including C/EBPalpha, p15INK4, p21CIP1, p27KIP1 and p57KIP2. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying Myc repression of C/EBPdelta expression. RESULTS: Myc represses C/EBPdelta promoter activity in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner that requires Myc Box II, Basic Region and HLH/LZ domains. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that Myc, Miz1 and Max are associated with the C/EBPdelta promoter in proliferating cells, when C/EBPdelta expression is repressed. EMSAs demonstrate that Miz1 binds to a 30 bp region (-100 to -70) of the C/EBPdelta promoter which contains a putative transcription initiator (Inr) element. Miz1 functions exclusively as a repressor of C/EBPdelta promoter activity. Miz1 siRNA expression or expression of a Miz1 binding deficient Myc (MycV394D) construct reduces Myc repression of C/EBPdelta promoter activity. Max siRNA expression, or expression of a Myc construct lacking the HLH/LZ (Max interacting) region, also reduces Myc repression of C/EBPdelta promoter activity. Miz1 and Max siRNA treatments attenuate Myc repression of endogenous C/EBPdelta expression. Myc Box II interacting proteins RuvBl1 (Pontin, TIP49) and RuvBl2 (Reptin, TIP48) enhances Myc repression of C/EBPdelta promoter activity. CONCLUSION: Myc represses C/EBPdelta expression by associating with the C/EBPdelta proximal promoter as a transient component of a repressive complex that includes Max and Miz1. RuvBl1 and RuvBl2 enhance Myc repression of C/EBPdelta promoter activity. These results identify protein interactions that mediate Myc repression of C/EBPdelta, and possibly other tumor suppressor genes, and suggest new therapeutic targets to block Myc transcriptional repression and oncogenic function.",,"['Si, Junling', 'Yu, Xueyan', 'Zhang, Yingjie', 'DeWille, James W']","['Si J', 'Yu X', 'Zhang Y', 'DeWille JW']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100428,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MNT protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ZBTB17 protein, human)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2010/04/30 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-92 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-92 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Apr 28;9:92. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-92.,"['CA57607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2879254,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, BMI1 expression levels correlated positively with the presence of lymph node metastases and negatively with patient survival rates, suggesting a role for BMI1 in the progression of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, stable down-regulation of BMI1 suppressed cell growth, delayed the G1/S transition, and enhanced the susceptibility of different pancreatic cell lines to apoptosis following expression of a lentiviral-mediated shRNA targeted for BMI1. Expression of the short-hairpin RNA also correlated with the up-regulation of p21 and Bax and the down-regulation of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-2 and -4, Bcl-2, and phospho-Akt.

The model predicts association with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies accurately when interaction data is available. At a false positive rate of 10%, the true positive rate is almost 50%, indicated by an independent nuclear proteome reference set. The model provides strong support for further expanding the protein complement with several important regulators and a richer functional repertoire.

A hereditary TP53 mutation supported the diagnosis of LFS in this family. The patients had many difficulties in treatment strategies and succumbed to death. The availability of a reliable molecular marker to detect the R337P TP53 mutation allows the rapid identification of carriers in families that have a child with ACC.

We and others have reported an increased risk of multiple myeloma and other malignancies in non-neuronopathic Type 1 GD (GD1). Here, we describe a subset of GD1 patients with multiple malignancies. In our cohort of 403 patients with GD1, nine patients (2.2%) developed two or three different types of cancers either consecutively or simultaneously. Patients were characterized by age at diagnosis of GD1, GBA1 genotype, disease severity, age at cancer diagnosis, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) status, and splenectomy status. Of the nine patients, six developed two types of malignancies and three had three cancers each. Overall, the hematologic malignancies comprised lymphoma/leukemia (4) and multiple myeloma (4). Nonhematologic malignancies included colon (2), lung (2), thyroid (2), and prostate cancer (1). Of the seven patients who received ERT, the first cancer was diagnosed before initiation of ERT in all but one. Asplenic patients were more likely to have single or multiple cancers compared with patients with intact spleens (P < 0.0072 and P < 0.0203, respectively). Our data strengthen the association of GD1 and cancer and suggest that patients may be at risk of developing multiple malignancies. We found an association between splenectomy and multiple cancers in GD1. It will be of interest to determine whether timely ERT and declining rates of splenectomy will translate into declining rates of multiple and single cancers.","['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Lo, Sarah M', 'Stein, Philip', 'Mullaly, Sean', 'Bar, Michael', 'Jain, Dhanpat', 'Pastores, Gregory M', 'Mistry, Pramod K']","['Lo SM', 'Stein P', 'Mullaly S', 'Bar M', 'Jain D', 'Pastores GM', 'Mistry PK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520-8064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['EC 3.2.1.21 (beta-Glucosidase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Enzyme Replacement Therapy', 'Female', 'Gaucher Disease/*complications/*genetics/therapy', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Splenectomy/*adverse effects', 'beta-Glucosidase/*genetics']",2010/04/29 06:00,2010/05/25 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21684 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2010 May;85(5):340-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21684.,"['K24 DK066306/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 DK066306-01A2/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK034989/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K24DK066306/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2875938,['NIHMS189140'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the genetic etiology of the disease is not yet fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs which regulate the expression of target mRNAs both at transcriptional and translational level. In recent years, miRNAs have been identified as a novel mechanism in gene regulation, which show variable expression during myeloid differentiation. We studied miRNA expression of leukemic blasts of 29 cases of newly diagnosed and genetically defined AML using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 365 human miRNA. We showed that miRNA expression profiling reveals distinctive miRNA signatures that correlate with cytogenetic and molecular subtypes of AML. Specific miRNAs with consolidated role on cell proliferation and differentiation such as miR-155, miR-221, let-7, miR-126 and miR-196b appear to be associated with particular subtypes. We observed a significant differentially expressed miRNA profile that characterizes two subgroups of AML with different mechanism of leukemogenesis: core binding factor (CBF) and cytogenetically normal AML with mutations in the genes of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD.

Resistance of patients with continued BCR-ABL inhibition despite leukemic progression indicates clonal evolution triggered by BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms. Current efforts to optimize BCR-ABL-targeted treatment focus on the difficulty in reaching CML stem cells.

Important clinical factors include the individual patient's age, performance status, and comorbidities.

The known molecular basis of CML has enabled the development of Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib mesylate.

By directly targeting this leukemogenic protein kinase, imatinib affords patients with CML sustained chromosomal remissions, which translate into prolonged survival. However, there has been concern over the emergence of resistance to imatinib, and some patients fail to respond or are intolerant of imatinib therapy because of untoward toxicity. This has spurred interest in developing novel TKIs to overcome the mechanisms of resistance that lead to treatment failure-most importantly, Bcr-Abl1 kinase domain mutations.

Traditional therapy with oral chlorambucil led to complete responses in less than 5% of treated patients, in marked contrast to modern regimens, which can reliably produce complete responses in over 50% of patients.

Novel combinations of these agents have emerged as effective new therapies for previously untreated patients. Clinical studies indicate that such combinations can induce higher response rates (including complete responses) than single-agent therapy. Those patients who achieve a complete response have superior progression-free survival compared with those who achieve only a partial response.

This process may be triggered by viral infections (eg, Epstein-Barr virus infection), which are common in immunosuppressed patients. The large cells of RS either arise through a transformation of the original CLL clone or, less frequently, represent a new or secondary neoplasm. Karyotypic changes, including trisomy 12, chromosome 11 abnormalities, and multiple cell-cycle regulator disruptions, have been found in patients with RS. Although these genetic defects are believed to cause CLL cells to proliferate and, by facilitating the acquisition of new genetic abnormalities, to transform into RS cells, none appears predominantly responsible for the transformation.

In addition, clinical studies have demonstrated that the donor-recipient mismatch may be beneficial in this setting, stimulating an immunologic cell-mediated antileukemia effect that results in lower disease recurrence rates.

Recent data using genome-wide gene expression profiling and assessment of the rearrangement status of the T-cell receptor loci confirm this notion. T-ALL cells differ from normal thymocytes in the overexpression of oncogenes that arise either from chromosomal translocations or via other mechanisms. In addition, signaling pathways that control the very first stages of thymocyte development (of note, the Notch and Wnt pathways) are involved in development of T-ALL in mice and humans when constitutively expressed.

A number of studies performed over the past 20 years have investigated the utility of prophylactic antimicrobials, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones, to prevent infection in the setting of mucositis and neutropenia. Many of these studies have found a benefit of prophylaxis in terms of the incidence of fever and bacterial infection. Clinical guidelines do not recommend antibacterial prophylaxis, however, in part because of increasing reports of infections due to resistant organisms, including fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli, fluoroquinolone-insensitive viridans streptococci, and Clostridium difficile. To effectively use prophylaxis and simultaneously limit emerging antibiotic resistance, only patients at high risk for bacterial infections should receive prophylaxis.",,"['Hammond, Sarah P', 'Baden, Lindsey R']","['Hammond SP', 'Baden LR']","[""Division of Infectious Diseases, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis Street, PBBA-4, Boston, MA 02115, USA. shammond2@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis/methods/standards', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Contraindications', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/etiology/immunology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/etiology/immunology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/complications', 'Patient Selection', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Unnecessary Procedures']",2007/05/01 00:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-007-0014-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2007 May;2(2):97-103. doi: 10.1007/s11899-007-0014-2.,,,,,,,,45,,,,,,,,,

The characteristic BCR-ABL fusion protein is a leukemia-specific antigen, and it has therefore received much immunologic attention, especially regarding the amino acid sequences that span the e14a2 junction. Other attractive targets are the Wilms' tumor 1 antigen and the PR1 epitope from proteinase 3, a granule protein overexpressed in CML. Imatinib may modulate several components of the immune response, although the clinical relevance of this effect is uncertain. In clinical trials, peptide vaccination appears safe and undoubtedly produces clinical effects, but randomized trials are now required to see if these are distinct from the effects of other concurrent therapy. These trials will be difficult to orchestrate in the competitive environment of novel therapies for CML.",,"['Clark, Richard E']",['Clark RE'],"['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Prescot St., Liverpool L7 8XP, UK. clarkre@liverpool.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry/*immunology', 'Benzamides', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clonal Anergy', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Epitopes/chemistry/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Myeloblastin/chemistry/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/immunology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Subunit/immunology/therapeutic use', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/immunology']",2007/05/01 00:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-007-0013-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2007 May;2(2):89-94. doi: 10.1007/s11899-007-0013-3.,,,,,,,,51,,,,,,,,,

The fusion gene that results (BCR-ABL) produces a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that exists in different isoforms depending on BCR break-points. Imatinib mesylate is a highly selective inhibitor of this kinase, producing normal blood-counts in 98% of patients in chronic phase CML and disappearance of the Philadelphia chromosome in 86%. However, 17% of patients in the chronic phase will either relapse or develop resistance resulting mainly from one or more point mutations affecting at least 30 amino acids within the Abl kinase protein.
