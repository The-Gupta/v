The antiproliferative activity towards human MCF-7 and HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells of novel nonintercalating complexes containing the 5-substituted phenanthroline ligands 5,6-dimethylphenanthroline, 5-chlorophenanthroline, and 5-nitrophenanthroline (phen*) increases dramatically in the order [(eta(5)-C(5)Me(5))IrCl(phen*)](CF(3)SO(3)) < [(eta(5)-C(5)Me(5))RhCl(phen*)](CF(3)SO(3)) < mer-[RhCl(3)(DMSO)(phen*)] (DMSO is dimethyl sulfoxide). Improved activity was also achieved by attaching a cell-penetrating peptide to the dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine (dppz) ligand of an organorhodium(III) complex. Whereas 5-substitution led to significant improvements in the activity of the organoiridium(III) and trichloridorhodium(III) compounds in comparison with the parent phenanthroline complex, the IC(50) values of their organorhodium(III) counterparts remained effectively invariable. The high activities of the trichloridorhodium(III) complexes (IC(50) = 0.06-0.13 muM) were accompanied by pronounced selectivity towards human cancer cells in comparison with immortalized HEK-293 cells. In contrast, [(eta(5)-C(5)Me(5))RhCl(5,6-Me(2)phen)](CF(3)SO(3)) (phen is phenanthroline) was markedly more active towards BJAB lymphoma cells than ex vivo healthy leukocytes and caused an immediate decrease in cellular adhesion possibly associated with interactions with membrane proteins. Its dppz analogue invoked an initial increase in glycolysis to compensate for reduced respiration before inducing a delayed onset of cell death. Strong antimitochondrial activity with respiration impairment and release of cytochrome c was established for both complexes.","['Geldmacher, Yvonne', 'Splith, Katrin', 'Kitanovic, Igor', 'Alborzinia, Hamed', 'Can, Suzan', 'Rubbiani, Riccardo', 'Nazif, M Ali', 'Wefelmeier, Pascal', 'Prokop, Aram', 'Ott, Ingo', 'Wolfl, Stefan', 'Neundorf, Ines', 'Sheldrick, William S']","['Geldmacher Y', 'Splith K', 'Kitanovic I', 'Alborzinia H', 'Can S', 'Rubbiani R', 'Nazif MA', 'Wefelmeier P', 'Prokop A', 'Ott I', 'Wolfl S', 'Neundorf I', 'Sheldrick WS']","['Fakultat fur Chemie und Biochemie, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Universitatsstrasse 150, 44780 Bochum, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Biol Inorg Chem,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,9616326,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00775-012-0883-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biol Inorg Chem. 2012 Apr;17(4):631-46. doi: 10.1007/s00775-012-0883-2.

Epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. However, published data are still inconclusive. METHODS: To derive a more precise assessment of this relevance, we performed a meta-analysis, up to September 2010, of 5,196 cases with different cancer types and 6,827 controls from 34 published case-control studies. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and cancer were estimated using fixed- and random-effects models when appropriate. RESULTS: The overall results suggested that the variant was associated with a moderately increased cancer risk in all comparison models tested (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06-1.50 for TT vs. CC; OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.04-1.37 for CT vs. CC; OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.32 for recessive model; OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06-1.38 for domain model, and OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.26 for allele contrast). In the subgroup analysis by cancer types, significant associations were found in breast cancer (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.24-2.21 for TT vs. CC; OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.14-1.82 for recessive model; OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.10-1.81 for domain model; and OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.13-1.52 for allele contrast) and renal cancer (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.37-2.90 for TT vs. CC; OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.25-2.42 for domain model; OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.09-1.88 for recessive model; and OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17-1.68 for allele contrast). However, no significant associations were found in colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia for all genetic models. In the ethnicity subgroup analysis, a significant association with cancer among Caucasians was found under the dominant model, homozygote comparison, CT versus CC comparison, and allele comparison. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that the MDR1 C3435T polymorphism is associated with cancer susceptibility, increasing the risk of breast and renal cancer.","['Wang, Jun', 'Wang, Baocheng', 'Bi, Jingwang', 'Li, Kainan', 'Di, Jianshi']","['Wang J', 'Wang B', 'Bi J', 'Li K', 'Di J']","[""Department of Oncology, General Hospital, Jinan Command of the People's Liberation Army, Shifan Street 25, Tianqiao District, Jinan 250031, China. ggjun2005@126.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/09/12 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2011/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-012-1171-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2012 Jun;138(6):979-89. doi: 10.1007/s00432-012-1171-9.

Because the population in Brazil is markedly heterogeneous, we analyzed the relationship between ABCB1 polymorphisms and Pgp expression/activity in Brazilian acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. METHODS: Acute myeloid leukemia samples from 109 patients were studied. ABCB1 gene variants rs1128503 (C1236T) and rs1045643 (C3435T) were analyzed by PCR-RFLP assay. Pgp expression and Pgp activity were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: There was a similar distribution of Pgp expression and activity on polymorphisms C1236T, C1236C, and T1236T for exon 12, and C3435T, C3435C, and T3435T for exon 26. An exception was observed in the lowest ratio of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) median for Pgp expression in the TT genotype for both studied exons, and its correspondence to a low MFI median for Pgp activity. Pgp expression did not show impact on the response to remission induction therapy, but the MFI median of Pgp expression in the remission failure group was higher than that of the complete remission (CR) group of patients (p = 0.04). Overall survival (OS) was significantly influenced by CR (p = 0.0001). Better 5-year OS and 5-year event-free survival rates (p = 0.04 and p = 0.007, respectively) were achieved in patients presenting the genetic variant CC in exon 12 followed by those presenting the variant CT in exon 26 (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene and the levels of Pgp expression could be useful to identify prognostic in AML patients.","['Scheiner, Marcos Antonio Mauricio', 'da Cunha Vasconcelos, Flavia', 'da Matta, Roberta Rodrigues', 'Dal Bello Figueira, Reinaldo Jr', 'Maia, Raquel Ciuvalschi']","['Scheiner MA', 'da Cunha Vasconcelos F', 'da Matta RR', 'Dal Bello Figueira R Jr', 'Maia RC']","['Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Programa de Pesquisa em Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Praca Cruz Vermelha 23, 6 masculine andar, Centro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ CEP 20230-130, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/09/12 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-012-1170-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2012 Jun;138(6):959-69. doi: 10.1007/s00432-012-1170-x.

In a search for potential multidrug resistance modulators we tested a group of oleanolic acid (OA) analogues modified at C-3, C-11, C-12 and C-28 using an experimental model consisting of three human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (CCRF-CEM and the multidrug resistant sublines CCRF-VCR1000 and CCRF-ADR5000). The most effective compound, methyl 3,11-dioxoolean-12-en-28-olate (DIOXOL) was more potent in cell viability inhibition than its precursor - OA, and showed similar or even higher activity in the drug resistant than in the wild-type cells. Resistance factor (RF) values obtained for CCRF-VCR1000 and CCRF-ADR-5000 cells using MTT assay were 0.7 and 0.8 (24 h of treatment) and after 72 h of treatment 0.9 and 1.1, respectively. Moreover, 5 muM DIOXOL significantly reduced the expression of the ABCB1 gene in MDR cells by around 30%, and also decreased the level of P-gp protein. Compared to untreated control cells, DIOXOL treatment resulted in a significant P-gp decrease (30% in CCRF-ADR5000 and 50% in CCRF-VCR1000), that was detected by western blot and confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. Moreover, DIOXOL (at 10 muM) significantly inhibited P-gp transport function by more than twofold comparing to control, untreated cells that was demonstrated using rhodamine 123-based functional test. The compound exhibited synergistic activity with ABCB1 substrate - adriamycin in CCRF-VCR1000 cells, indicating partial but significant MDR reversing ability.","['Paszel, Anna', 'Rubis, Blazej', 'Bednarczyk-Cwynar, Barbara', 'Zaprutko, Lucjusz', 'Kaczmarek, Mariusz', 'Hofmann, Johann', 'Rybczynska, Maria']","['Paszel A', 'Rubis B', 'Bednarczyk-Cwynar B', 'Zaprutko L', 'Kaczmarek M', 'Hofmann J', 'Rybczynska M']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Przybyszewskiego 49, PL 60-355 Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Pharmacol Rep,Pharmacological reports : PR,101234999,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/11/08 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1734-1140(11)70714-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1734-1140(11)70714-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Rep. 2011;63(6):1500-17. doi: 10.1016/s1734-1140(11)70714-9.,,,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Dioxolanes)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Dioxolanes/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Oleanolic Acid/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Astrocytes induce migration and proliferation of ECs via their production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and, conversely, ECs induce maturation of astrocytes possibly by the secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Together with the maturation of astrocytes, this finalizes angiogenesis. Thus far, the mechanisms triggering LIF production in ECs are unclear. Here we show that apelin, a ligand for the endothelial receptor APJ, induces maturation of astrocytes mediated by the production of LIF from ECs. APJ (Aplnr)- and Apln-deficient mice show delayed angiogenesis; however, aberrant overgrowth of endothelial networks with immature astrocyte overgrowth was induced.

Whether these two mechanisms operate together is not known. Here we report that GATA-1, SCL, and Klf1 form an erythroid core transcriptional network by co-occupying >300 genes. Importantly, we find that PU.1, a negative regulator of terminal erythroid differentiation, is a highly integrated component of this network. GATA-1, SCL, and Klf1 act to promote, whereas PU.1 represses expression of many of the core network genes. PU.1 also represses the genes encoding GATA-1, SCL, Klf1, and important GATA-1 cofactors. Conversely, in addition to repressing PU.1 expression, GATA-1 also binds to and represses >100 PU.1 myelo-lymphoid gene targets in erythroid progenitors. Mathematical modeling further supports that this dual mechanism of repressing both the opposing upstream activator and its downstream targets provides a synergistic, robust mechanism for lineage specification. Taken together, these results amalgamate two key developmental principles, namely, regulation of a core transcriptional network and repression of an alternative transcriptional program, thereby enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms that establish cellular identity.","['Wontakal, Sandeep N', 'Guo, Xingyi', 'Smith, Cameron', 'MacCarthy, Thomas', 'Bresnick, Emery H', 'Bergman, Aviv', 'Snyder, Michael P', 'Weissman, Sherman M', 'Zheng, Deyou', 'Skoultchi, Arthur I']","['Wontakal SN', 'Guo X', 'Smith C', 'MacCarthy T', 'Bresnick EH', 'Bergman A', 'Snyder MP', 'Weissman SM', 'Zheng D', 'Skoultchi AI']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1121019109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1121019109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Mar 6;109(10):3832-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1121019109.

Named xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), this was potentially the third class of retrovirus to be pathogenic in humans. XMRV made a more dramatic impact on the wider scientific community, and indeed the media, in 2009 when it was reported to be present in a remarkably high proportion of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome as well as a significant, albeit smaller, proportion of healthy controls. The apparent strong link to disease and the fear of a previously unknown retrovirus circulating in the general population lead to a surge in XMRV research. Subsequent studies failed to find an association of XMRV with disease and, in most cases, failed to find the virus in human samples. In 2011, the case against XMRV and human disease strengthened, ending with several decisive publications revealing the origin of the virus and demonstrating contamination of samples. In this review, we outline the passage of research on XMRV and its potential association with disease from its isolation to the present day, where we find ourselves at the end of a turbulent story.","['Groom, Harriet C T', 'Bishop, Kate N']","['Groom HCT', 'Bishop KN']","['Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, UK.', 'Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, UK.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.041038-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2012 May;93(Pt 5):915-924. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.041038-0.

The present studies sought to extend our analyses to the central nervous system (CNS) tumor cells and to further define mechanisms of drug action. Lapatinib and obatoclax killed multiple CNS tumor isolates. Cells lacking PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) function were relatively resistant to drug combination lethality; expression of PTEN in PTEN-null cells restored drug sensitivity, and knockdown of PTEN promoted drug resistance. On the basis of knockdown of ERBB1-4 (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1-4), we discovered that the inhibition of ERBB1/3/4 receptors were most important for enhancing obatoclax lethality rather than ERBB2. In parallel, we noted in CNS tumor cells that knockdown of BCL-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large)and MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) interacted in an additive fashion to facilitate lapatinib lethality. Pretreatment of tumor cells with obatoclax enhanced the lethality of lapatinib to a greater extent than concomitant treatment. Treatment of animals carrying orthotopic CNS tumor isolates with lapatinib- and obatoclax-prolonged survival. Altogether, our data show that lapatinib and obatoclax therapy could be of use in the treatment of tumors located in the CNS.","['Cruickshanks, Nichola', 'Hamed, Hossein A', 'Bareford, M Danielle', 'Poklepovic, Andrew', 'Fisher, Paul B', 'Grant, Steven', 'Dent, Paul']","['Cruickshanks N', 'Hamed HA', 'Bareford MD', 'Poklepovic A', 'Fisher PB', 'Grant S', 'Dent P']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298-0035, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/06/08 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.112.077586 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.112.077586 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2012 May;81(5):748-58. doi: 10.1124/mol.112.077586.

METHODS: Mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood of 47 children with AL and 20 controls (normal children or children with nonmalignant hematologic disease) were collected from February 2009 to July 2011. A two-step method to semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the gene expression of Notch1 and Jagged1. Of the 47 children with AL, there were 26 cases of B-ALL, 6 cases of T-ALL and 15 cases of AML. RESULTS: The positive expression rate of Notch1 in the ALL and AML groups was higher than in the control group (P<0.05). The expression level of Notch1 in T-ALL children was higher than in B-ALL children (P<0.01). The positive expression rate of Jagged1 in the ALL and AML groups was not significantly different from the control group, however, the expression level of Jagged1 in the ALL and AML groups was higher than in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the gene expression of Notch1 between children with different types of ALL, and a higher expression of Notch1 relates to T-ALL. The activation of Notch1 signal is common in children with AL. The abnormal gene expression of Notch1 in children with AML shows the role of Notch1 in AML. The gene expression of Jagged1 in children with ALL or AML is abnormal, and this needs to be confirmed by further research.","['Zhao, Xiao-Li', 'Pan, Kai-Li', 'Qian, Xin-Hong', 'Li, Ying-Xia', 'Du, Li', 'Wang, Ying-Juan', 'Luo, Jian-Feng', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Qiang, Huan']","['Zhao XL', 'Pan KL', 'Qian XH', 'Li YX', 'Du L', 'Wang YJ', 'Luo JF', 'Zhang Y', 'Qiang H']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2012)02-0105-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2012 Feb;14(2):105-9.,,,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In pediatric oncology, palliative care is a primary component of the cancer control plan. In low income countries also known as emerging nations or developing countries access to adequate care remains a challenge for most pediatric oncology patients. In Morocco the situation has dramatically improved in the last few years as both the government and NGOs have become more aware of the importance and urgency of the issue. The incidence of cancer in patients under 15 years of age in Morocco is estimated to be 1000 new cases per year and the incidence of leukemia to be 100 new cases diagnosed per year. Pediatric cancer patients are mostly managed by public hospitals. Thus they are highly influenced by the Moroccan public health system, which is now considering cancer management a priority. Since health cover is very limited, most chemotherapy drugs were purchased by local parent associations. Recently, a new large Moroccan NGO (ALSC) provides anti-cancer drugs to all government-run oncology units. Despite all the progress, Morocco has witnessed in the pediatric oncology field, the palliative aspect of the care is not yet organized. Pediatric oncology is supported by the work of the National Society of Pediatric Oncolgy. The opioide therapy is available. However its use is strongly limited by the current restrictive and obsolete legislation which represents a major barrier to care. Despite the latest progress, pediatric oncology in Morocco still needs to improve in order to achieve performances comparable to those of the developed world. These improvements include better survival rates, less treatment abandonment, developing new techniques, improving quality of life and creating data collection teams. In order for this action to succeed all the stakeholders (government, NGOs, medical societies, oncology teams) must work together and coordinate their efforts.","['Hessissen, Laila', 'Madani, Abdellah']","['Hessissen L', 'Madani A']","['Moroccan Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children Hospital of Rabat, Morocco. laila_hsn@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,2012/03/06 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318249abe3 [doi]', '00043426-201203001-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2012 Mar;34 Suppl 1:S21-2. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318249abe3.,,,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Medical Oncology', 'Morocco/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality', '*Pediatrics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were given 1.8 mg/m(2) inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously over 1 h every 3-4 weeks (the first three adults and three children received 1.3 mg/m(2) in the first course). The primary endpoint was overall response (complete response or marrow complete response with no recovery of platelet count or incomplete recovery of neutrophil and platelet counts). Analysis was done by intention to treat. This study is registered, number NCT01134575. FINDINGS: 49 patients were enrolled and treated. Median age was 36 years (range 6-80). CD22 was expressed in more than 50% of blasts in all patients. The median number of courses was two (range one to five) and the median time between courses was 3 weeks (range 3-6). Nine (18%) patients had complete response, 19 (39%) had marrow complete response, 19 (39%) had resistant disease, and two (4%) died within 4 weeks of starting treatment. The overall response rate was 57% (95% CI 42-71). The most frequent adverse events during course one of treatment were fever (grade 1-2 in 20 patients, grade 3-4 in nine), hypotension (grade 1-2 in 12 patients, grade 3 in one), and liver-related toxic effects (bilirubin: grade 1-2 in 12 patients, grade 3 in two; raised aminotransferase concentration: grade 1-2 in 27 patients, grade 3 in one). INTERPRETATION: Inotuzumab ozogamicin shows promise as a treatment for refractory and relapsed ALL.

For instance, many studies have shown that a significant number of NPCs will migrate to a site of injury and differentiate into all of the neural lineages. However, one of the main challenges affecting endogenous neural regeneration is that many of the NPCs that migrate to the injury site ultimately undergo apoptosis. Therefore, we sought to determine whether myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, would promote the survival of adult NPCs by impeding apoptosis. To do this, we first confirmed that Mcl-1 is endogenously expressed within the adult NPC population using BrdU labeling assays. Next, we conditionally deleted Mcl-1 in adult NPCs using cre/lox technology and expressed Cre from the NPC-specific promoter Nestin. In vitro, cells that had Mcl-1 conditionally deleted had a 2-fold increase in apoptosis when compared to controls. In vivo, we used electroporation to conditionally delete Mcl-1 in adult NPCs and assessed apoptosis at 72h. after electroporation. As in our in vitro results, there was a 2-fold increase in apoptosis when Mcl-1 was conditionally deleted. Finally, we found that Mcl-1 over-expression reduced the endogenous rate of adult NPC apoptosis 2-fold in vitro. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Mcl-1 is crucial for the survival of adult NPCs and may be a promising target for future neural regeneration therapies.","['Malone, Craig D', 'Hasan, S M Mahmudul', 'Roome, R Brian', 'Xiong, Jieying', 'Furlong, Michael', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Vanderluit, Jacqueline L']","['Malone CD', 'Hasan SM', 'Roome RB', 'Xiong J', 'Furlong M', 'Opferman JT', 'Vanderluit JL']","[""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, Canada, A1B 3V6.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2011/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-7431(12)00025-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcn.2012.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2012 Apr;49(4):439-47. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2012.02.003.

Acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) were exposed to atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma. To assess death caused by plasma exposure, cells were subjected to trypan blue exclusion assays and a kill-curve and assessment of death overtime were compiled using data from the assays. In addition to this, DNA was harvested from treated and untreated samples to determine if apoptotic ladders were present. Results have indicated that non-thermal plasma can cause cell death in THP-1 cells overtime, and the death that occurs corresponds directly to the amount of time that the cells were exposed to ionized plasma. Preliminary fluorescent imaging of the treated cells revealed that higher treatment doses are not only more likely to induce cellular death but are likely to induce necrotic death, while lower treatment doses that are capable of inducing death may induce apoptotic or programmed cellular death. Ideally the results obtained from these experiments will allow for further investigation of the effects of ionized non-thermal plasma on melanoma cell lines and will lead to an inexpensive method for treating early stage skin cancer and cancerous lesions.","['Thiyagarajan, Magesh', 'Waldbeser, Lillian', 'Whitmill, Amanda']","['Thiyagarajan M', 'Waldbeser L', 'Whitmill A']","['Plasma Engineering Research Lab (PERL), Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, TX, USA. magesh@tamucc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Stud Health Technol Inform,Studies in health technology and informatics,9214582,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Stud Health Technol Inform. 2012;173:515-7.,,,"['0 (Plasma Gases)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Plasma Gases/pharmacology', 'Trypan Blue']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this disease belongs to the new WHO category of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with abnormalities in PDGFRA, PDGFRB and FGFR1 genes. Although such genetic mutations are prone to multi-lineage differentiation, the present case is in fact the first report of concurrent AML and T lymphoblastic lymphoma involving PDGFRB mutations.

Invasive aspergillosis is more often associated with hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Recommendations concerning prophylactic treatment for invasive aspergillosis have been recently published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Candida albicans is the main Candida sp. associated with invasive candidiasis in children, even if a strong trend toward the emergence of Candida non-albicans has been observed. The epidemiology and the risk factors for invasive fungal infections are quite different if considering previously healthy children hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit, or children with a malignancy or a severe hematological disease (leukemia).

Oral HTLV-I infection and infection early in life are associated with a subsequent risk of ATL. Although the pathogenic mechanisms of ATL remain largely unknown, the host immune system seems to play an important role in HTLV-I pathogenesis. Previous studies have shown that monocytes from ATL patients had reduced capacity for dendritic cell (DC) differentiation. Therefore, we performed the present study to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the impairment of DC differentiation using HTLV-I-infected breast milk macrophages (HTLV-BrMMo). We found that when CD14(+) monocytes were cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 in the presence of HTLV-BrMMo, they altered the surface phenotype of immature DCs and the stimulatory capacity of T-cell proliferation. The presence of HTLV-BrMMo significantly blocked the increased expression of CD1a, CD1b, CD11b, DC-SIGN, and HLA-DR; however, increased expression of CD1d and CD86 was observed. These effects could be partially replicated by incubation with culture supernatants from HTLV-BrMMo. The impairment of monocyte differentiation might be not due to HTLV-I infection of monocytes, but might be due to unknown soluble factors. Since other HTLV-I-infected cells exhibited similar inhibitory effects on monocyte differentiation to DCs, we speculated that HTLV-I infection might cause the production of some inhibitory cytokines in infected cells. Identifying the factors responsible for the impairment of monocyte differentiation to DCs may be helpful to understand HTLV-I pathogenesis.","['Inagaki, Shinichiro', 'Takahashi, Megumi', 'Fukunaga, Yoshitaka', 'Takahashi, Hidemi']","['Inagaki S', 'Takahashi M', 'Fukunaga Y', 'Takahashi H']","['Departments of Microbiology and Immunology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/07/28 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/vim.2011.0069 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 2012 Apr;25(2):106-16. doi: 10.1089/vim.2011.0069.

Thirty-one post BMT hematological cancer patients were evaluated. Results show that higher educative levels are associated to lower number of infections, while age is associated with a delay in the time of engraftment; coping strategies, specially redefinition of the situation, relaxation, stoicism and passivity, are positively associated with the three clinical indices; depression is positively associated to number of infections during the hospitalization period; and rationality is associated with lower hemoglobin levels.

Cellular transport across membranes is crucial for uptake of these highly polar hydrophilic molecules. We assessed the ability of azacitidine, decitabine, and, for comparison, gemcitabine, to interact with human nucleoside transporters (hNTs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells (hENT1/2, hCNT1/2/3) or Xenopus laevis oocytes (hENT3/4). All three drugs inhibited hCNT1/3 potently (K (i) values, 3-26 muM), hENT1/2 and hCNT2 weakly (K (i) values, 0.5-3.1 mM), and hENT3/4 poorly if at all. Rates of transport of [(3)H]gemcitabine, [(14)C]azacitidine, and [(3)H]decitabine observed in Xenopus oocytes expressing individual recombinant hNTs differed substantially. Cytotoxicity of azacitidine and decitabine was assessed in hNT-expressing or hNT-deficient cultured human cell lines in the absence or presence of transport inhibitors where available. The rank order of cytotoxic sensitivities (IC (50) values, muM) conferred by hNTs were hCNT1 (0.1) > hENT1 (0.3) >> hCNT2 (8.3), hENT2 (9.0) for azacitidine and hENT1 (0.3) > hCNT1 (0.8) >>> hENT2, hCNT2 (>100) for decitabine. Protection against cytotoxicity was observed for both drugs in the presence of inhibitors of nucleoside transport, thus suggesting the importance of hNTs in manifestation of toxicity. In summary, all seven hNTs transported azacitidine, with hCNT3 showing the highest rates, whereas hENT1 and hENT2 showed modest transport and hCNT1 and hCNT3 poor transport of decitabine. Our results show for the first time that azacitidine and decitabine exhibit different human nucleoside transportability profiles and their cytotoxicities are dependent on the presence of hNTs, which could serve as potential biomarkers of clinical response.","['Damaraju, Vijaya L', 'Mowles, Delores', 'Yao, Sylvia', 'Ng, Amy', 'Young, James D', 'Cass, Carol E', 'Tong, Zeen']","['Damaraju VL', 'Mowles D', 'Yao S', 'Ng A', 'Young JD', 'Cass CE', 'Tong Z']","['Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,2012/02/24 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15257770.2011.652330 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2012;31(3):236-55. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2011.652330.,,,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '0 (cif nucleoside transporter)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Carbon Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Tritium/metabolism', 'Xenopus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This novel pharmaceutical molecule has demonstrated great in vitro activity against a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Daptomycin has a unique mechanism of action, not completely understood, involving a calcium-dependent dissipation of membrane potential leading to the release of intracellular ions from the cell and bacteria death. This antibiotic has been already approved for the treatment of patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, right-sided endocarditis and bacteraemia. Local delivery of daptomycin is an emerging area of study. Current in vitro studies show that daptomycin can be eluted from polymethylmethacrylate, calcium sulfate and chitosan films. Emerging cases of resistance to daptomycin have been reported, commonly occurring by spontaneous mutations, and have been associated with prolonged use, osteomyelitis, acute myeloid leukemia and leucocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome. This review examines the most recent literature evidences on daptomycin molecular structure, mechanism of action, bacterial spectrum, clinical uses, local delivery, toxicity and resistance.","['Vilhena, C', 'Bettencourt, A']","['Vilhena C', 'Bettencourt A']","['Research Institute for Medicines and Pharmaceutical Sciences (iMed.UL), Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lisbon.

Herein, we compared asparagine and aspartic acid concentrations in the BM and peripheral blood (PB), in order to determine whether this in vitro observation could be translated into in vivo differences of amino acid levels between both compartments. Asparagine and aspartic acid concentrations in BM (days 15 and 33) and PB (days 12, 15 and 33) were measured during L-Asp-containing Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-based 5-week multi-agent remission induction therapy in 11 children diagnosed with ALL at the St. Anna Children's Hospital in Vienna, Austria. The level of asparagine depletion did not differ significantly between both compartments at any time point measured, but aspartic acid concentrations were significantly higher in BM than PB at days 15 and 33 (p < 0.05). In the context of the reported mesenchymal asparagine production in BM, an increased asparagine production may indeed take place in BM. However, it may be overcome by continuous action of L-Asp, which is mirrored by increased aspartic acid levels but unchanged low asparagine levels in BM, suggesting a higher BM turnover of asparagine generated by L-Asp during induction therapy.","['Steiner, Manuel', 'Hochreiter, Daniela', 'Kasper, David C', 'Kornmuller, Rosa', 'Pichler, Herbert', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Potschger, Ulrike', 'Hutter, Caroline', 'Dworzak, Michael N', 'Mann, Georg', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe']","['Steiner M', 'Hochreiter D', 'Kasper DC', 'Kornmuller R', 'Pichler H', 'Haas OA', 'Potschger U', 'Hutter C', 'Dworzak MN', 'Mann G', 'Attarbaschi A']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/02/24 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.668681 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Sep;53(9):1682-7. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.668681.

Beyond their importance in the generation of lipid lowering effects, the regulatory effects of statins on the mevalonate pathway have a significant impact on multiple other cellular functions. There is now extensive evidence that statins have anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic properties, but the precise mechanisms by which such responses are generated are not well understood. In the present study we demonstrate that statins engage a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins, PKCdelta, in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. Our study shows that atorvastatin and fluvastatin induce proteolytic activation of PKCdelta in the APL NB4 cell line, which expresses the t(15;17) translocation. Such engagement of PKCdelta results in induction of its kinase domain and downstream regulation of pathways important for statin-dependent leukemia cell differentiation. Our research shows that the function of PKCdelta is essential for statin-induced leukemic cell differentiation, as demonstrated by studies involving selective targeting of PKCdelta using siRNAs. We also demonstrate that the potent enhancing effects of statins on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced gene expression for CCL3 and CCL4 requires the function of PKCdelta, suggesting a mechanism by which statins may promote ATRA-induced antileukemic responses. Altogether, our data establish a novel function for PKCdelta as a mediator of statin-induced differentiation of APL cells and antileukemic effects.","['Sassano, Antonella', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Gordon, Leo I', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Sassano A', 'Altman JK', 'Gordon LI', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

In recent years it has been discovered that components of cellular nuclear structures known as ND10 or PML nuclear bodies contribute to intrinsic resistance against a variety of viruses, notably of the herpesvirus family. Several ND10 components are rapidly recruited to sites that are closely associated with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genomes during the earliest stages of infection, and this property correlates with the efficiency of ND10 mediated restriction of HSV-1 replication. Similar but distinct recruitment of certain DNA damage response proteins also occurs during infection. These recruitment events are inhibited in a normal wild type HSV-1 infection by the viral regulatory protein ICP0. HSV1 mutants that do not express ICP0 are highly susceptible to repression through intrinsic resistance factors, but they replicate more efficiently in cells depleted of certain ND10 proteins or in which ND10 component recruitment is inefficient. This article presents the background to this recruitment phenomenon and summaries how it is conveniently studied by fluorescence microscopy.","['Everett, Roger D']",['Everett RD'],"['The Medical Research Council (MRC), University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, 8 Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland, UK. roger.everett@glasgow.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,2012/02/23 06:00,2012/06/28 06:00,['2012/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/v3122412 [doi]', 'v3122412 [pii]']",ppublish,Viruses. 2011 Dec;3(12):2412-24. doi: 10.3390/v3122412.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had relapsed/refractory HCL after >/= two prior therapies and required treatment because of abnormal blood counts. Patients received moxetumomab pasudotox 5 to 50 mug/kg every other day for three doses (QOD x3), with up to 16 cycles repeating at >/= 4-week intervals if patients did not experience disease progression or develop neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled, including three patients each at 5, 10, 20, and 30 mug/kg, four patients at 40 mug/kg, and 12 patients at 50 mug/kg QOD x3 for one to 16 cycles each (median, four cycles). Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. Two patients had transient laboratory abnormalities consistent with grade 2 hemolytic uremic syndrome with peak creatinine of 1.53 to 1.66 mg/dL and platelet nadir of 106,000 to 120,000/muL. Drug-related toxicities in 25% to 64% of the 28 patients included (in decreasing frequency) grade 1 to 2 hypoalbuminemia, aminotransferase elevations, edema, headache, hypotension, nausea, and fatigue. Of 26 patients evaluable for immunogenicity, 10 patients (38%) made antibodies neutralizing more than 75% of the cytotoxicity of 1,000 ng/mL of immunotoxin, but this immunogenicity was rare (5%) after cycle 1.

We reported previously that p14(ARF) is capable of triggering apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. However, the mechanism remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that the p53-independent activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by p14(ARF) is primarily mediated by the pro-apoptotic Bax-homolog Bak. Expression of p14(ARF) exclusively triggers a N-terminal conformational switch of Bak, but not Bax, which allows for mitochondrial permeability shift, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases, and subsequent fragmentation of genomic DNA. Although forced expression of Bak markedly sensitizes toward p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis, re-expression of Bax has no effect. Vice versa, knockdown of Bak by RNA interference attenuates p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of Bax has no effect. Bak activation coincides with a prominent, caspase-independent deprivation of the endogenous Bak inhibitors Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L). In turn, mitochondrial apoptosis is fully blocked by overexpression of either Mcl-1 or Bcl-x(L). Taken together, these data indicate that in the absence of functional p53 and Bax, p14(ARF) triggers mitochondrial apoptosis signaling by activating Bak, which is facilitated by down-regulating anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L). Moreover, our data suggest that the simultaneous inhibition of two central endogenous Bak inhibitors, i.e. Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L), may be sufficient to activate mitochondrial apoptosis in the absence of BH3-only protein regulation.","['Muer, Annika', 'Overkamp, Tim', 'Gillissen, Bernd', 'Richter, Antje', 'Pretzsch, Thomas', 'Milojkovic, Ana', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Daniel, Peter T', 'Hemmati, Philipp']","['Muer A', 'Overkamp T', 'Gillissen B', 'Richter A', 'Pretzsch T', 'Milojkovic A', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel PT', 'Hemmati P']","['Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Berlin Buch, D13125, Berlin, Germany; Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, D13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Berlin Buch, D13125, Berlin, Germany; Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, D13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Berlin Buch, D13125, Berlin, Germany; Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, D13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Berlin Buch, D13125, Berlin, Germany; Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, D13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Berlin Buch, D13125, Berlin, Germany; Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, D13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Berlin Buch, D13125, Berlin, Germany; Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, D13125, Berlin, Germany; Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Berlin Buch, D13125, Berlin, Germany; Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, D13125, Berlin, Germany; Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, 13353 Berlin, Germany.

The use of ATRA in other types of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) calls for the identification of novel strategies aimed at increasing its therapeutic activity. Here, we provide evidence that pharmacological inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, p38alpha, or silencing of the corresponding gene sensitizes APL and AML cell lines, as well as primary cultures of AML blasts to the anti-proliferative and cyto-differentiating activity of ATRA and synthetic retinoids. P38alpha inhibits ligand-dependent transactivation of the nuclear retinoic acid receptor, RARalpha, and the derived chimeric protein expressed in the majority of APL cases, PML-RARalpha. Inhibition is the consequence of ligand-independent binding of p38alpha, which results in stabilization of RARalpha and PML-RARalpha via blockade of their constitutive degradation by the proteasome. The inhibitory effect requires a catalytically active p38alpha and direct physical interaction with RARalpha and PML-RARalpha. Ser-369 in the E-region of RARalpha is essential for the binding of p38alpha and the ensuing functional effects on the activity of the receptor.","['Gianni, M', 'Peviani, M', 'Bruck, N', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Borleri, G', 'Terao, M', 'Kurosaki, M', 'Paroni, G', 'Rochette-Egly, C', 'Garattini, E']","['Gianni M', 'Peviani M', 'Bruck N', 'Rambaldi A', 'Borleri G', 'Terao M', 'Kurosaki M', 'Paroni G', 'Rochette-Egly C', 'Garattini E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/23 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/02/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201250 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Aug;26(8):1850-61. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.50.

The paucity of valid pre-clinical models has restricted investigations to determine the mechanism of acquired therapeutic resistance, thereby limiting the development of effective treatments. We generated selective FLT3 inhibitor-resistant cells by treating the FLT3-ITD(+) human AML cell line MOLM-13 in vitro with the FLT3-selective inhibitor MLN518, and validated the resistant phenotype in vivo and in vitro. The resistant cells, MOLM-13-RES, harboured a new D835Y tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation on the FLT3-ITD(+) allele. Acquired TKD mutations, including D835Y, have recently been identified in FLT3-ITD(+) patients relapsing after treatment with the novel FLT3 inhibitor, AC220. Consistent with this clinical pattern of resistance, MOLM-13-RES cells displayed high relative resistance to AC220 and Sorafenib. Furthermore, treatment of MOLM-13-RES cells with AC220 lead to loss of the FLT3 wild-type allele and the duplication of the FLT3-ITD-D835Y allele.

Acquired mutations in the transcription factor-encoding GATA1 gene are observed in nearly all individuals with DS who are born with transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), a clonal preleukemia, and/or who develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). Individuals who do not have DS but bear germline GATA1 mutations analogous to those detected in individuals with TMD and DS-AMKL are not predisposed to leukemia. To better understand the functional contribution of trisomy 21 to leukemogenesis, we used mouse and human cell models of DS to reproduce the multistep pathogenesis of DS-AMKL and to identify chromosome 21 genes that promote megakaryoblastic leukemia in children with DS. Our results revealed that trisomy for only 33 orthologs of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) genes was sufficient to cooperate with GATA1 mutations to initiate megakaryoblastic leukemia in vivo. Furthermore, through a functional screening of the trisomic genes, we demonstrated that DYRK1A, which encodes dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A, was a potent megakaryoblastic tumor-promoting gene that contributed to leukemogenesis through dysregulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation. Given that calcineurin/NFAT pathway inhibition has been implicated in the decreased tumor incidence in adults with DS, our results show that the same pathway can be both proleukemic in children and antitumorigenic in adults.","['Malinge, Sebastien', 'Bliss-Moreau, Meghan', 'Kirsammer, Gina', 'Diebold, Lauren', 'Chlon, Timothy', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Crispino, John D']","['Malinge S', 'Bliss-Moreau M', 'Kirsammer G', 'Diebold L', 'Chlon T', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Crispino JD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,2012/02/23 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2012/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['60455 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI60455 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2012 Mar;122(3):948-62. doi: 10.1172/JCI60455.

Although Fc-dependent mechanisms of mAb-mediated tumor clearance have been extensively studied, the ability of mAbs to directly evoke programmed cell death (PCD) in the target cell and the underlying mechanisms involved remain under-investigated. We recently demonstrated that certain mAbs (type II anti-CD20 and anti-HLA DR mAbs) potently evoked PCD through an actin-dependent, lysosome-mediated process. Here, we reveal that the induction of PCD by these mAbs, including the type II anti-CD20 mAb GA101 (obinutuzumab), directly correlates with their ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human B-lymphoma cell lines and primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. ROS scavengers abrogated mAb-induced PCD indicating that ROS are required for the execution of cell death. ROS were generated downstream of mAb-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization and lysosome membrane permeabilization. ROS production was independent of mitochondria and unaffected by BCL-2 overexpression. Instead, ROS generation was mediated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. These findings provide further insights into a previously unrecognized role for NADPH oxidase-derived ROS in mediating nonapoptotic PCD evoked by mAbs in B-cell malignancies. This newly characterized cell death pathway may potentially be exploited to eliminate malignant cells, which are refractory to conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy.","['Honeychurch, Jamie', 'Alduaij, Waleed', 'Azizyan, Mahsa', 'Cheadle, Eleanor J', 'Pelicano, Helene', 'Ivanov, Andrei', 'Huang, Peng', 'Cragg, Mark S', 'Illidge, Tim M']","['Honeychurch J', 'Alduaij W', 'Azizyan M', 'Cheadle EJ', 'Pelicano H', 'Ivanov A', 'Huang P', 'Cragg MS', 'Illidge TM']","['Targeted Therapy Group, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, School of Cancer and Enabling Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/23 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/02/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49141-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-395541 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Apr 12;119(15):3523-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-395541.

We review such models in light of relevant findings from radiobiology, emphasizing 3 points. First, the CML models almost all assert that the latency time, from CML initiation to diagnosis, is at most approximately 10 years. Meanwhile, current radiobiologic estimates, based on Japanese atomic bomb survivor data, indicate a substantially higher maximum, suggesting longer-term relapses and extra resistance mutations. Second, different CML models assume different numbers, between 400 and 10(6), of normal HSCs. Radiobiologic estimates favor values>10(6) for the number of normal cells (often assumed to be the HSCs) that are at risk for a CML-initiating BCR-ABL translocation. Moreover, there is some evidence for an HSC dead-band hypothesis, consistent with HSC numbers being very different across different healthy adults. Third, radiobiologists have found that sporadic (background, age-driven) chromosome translocation incidence increases with age during adulthood. BCR-ABL translocation incidence increasing with age would provide a hitherto underanalyzed contribution to observed background adult-onset CML incidence acceleration with age, and would cast some doubt on stage-number inferences from multistage carcinogenesis models in general.","['Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Hlatky, Lynn', 'Landaw, Julian', 'Sachs, Rainer K']","['Radivoyevitch T', 'Hlatky L', 'Landaw J', 'Sachs RK']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/23 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/02/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47872-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-09-381855 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 10;119(19):4363-71. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-09-381855.

PURPOSE: Although cure rate models based on the generalized exponential distribution have been developed, they have not been used in the design of randomized cancer clinical trials, which instead have relied exclusively on two-component exponential cure rate model with a proportional hazards (PH) alternative. In some studies, the efficacy of the experimental treatment is expected to emerge some time after randomization. Since this does not conform to a PH alternative, such studies require a more flexible model to describe the alternative hypothesis. METHODS: In this article, we report the study design of a phase III clinical trial of acute myeloid leukemia using a three-component exponential cure rate model to reflect the alternative hypothesis. A newly developed power calculation program that does not require PH assumption was used. RESULTS: Using a custom-made three-component cure rate model as an alternative hypothesis, the proposed sample size was 409, compared with a sample size of 209 under the assumption of exponential distribution and 228 under the PH alternative. A simulation study was performed to present the degree of power loss when the alternative hypothesis is not appropriately specified. LIMITATIONS: The power calculation program used in this study is for a single analysis and does not account for group sequential tests in phase III trials. However, the loss in power is small, and this was handled by inflating the sample size by 5%. CONCLUSION: Misspecification of the alternative hypothesis can result in a seriously underpowered study. We report examples of clinical trials that required a custom-made alternative hypothesis to reflect a later indication of experimental treatment efficacy. The proposed three-component cure rate model could be very useful for specifying non-PH alternative.","['Kim, Haesook Teresa', 'Gray, Robert']","['Kim HT', 'Gray R']","['Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA. kim.haesook@jimmy.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Clin Trials,"Clinical trials (London, England)",101197451,2012/02/23 06:00,2012/09/12 06:00,['2012/02/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1740774512436614 [pii]', '10.1177/1740774512436614 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Trials. 2012 Apr;9(2):155-63. doi: 10.1177/1740774512436614.

Here we show that they are direct targets of miRNA-196b, a microRNA (miRNA) located adjacent to and co-expressed with HOXA9, in MLL-rearranged leukaemic cells. Forced expression of miR-196b significantly delays MLL-fusion-mediated leukemogenesis in primary bone marrow transplantation through suppressing Hoxa9/Meis1 expression. However, ectopic expression of miR-196b results in more aggressive leukaemic phenotypes and causes much faster leukemogenesis in secondary transplantation than MLL fusion alone, likely through the further repression of Fas expression, a proapoptotic gene downregulated in MLL-rearranged leukaemia. Overexpression of FAS significantly inhibits leukemogenesis and reverses miR-196b-mediated phenotypes. Targeting Hoxa9/Meis1 and Fas by miR-196b is probably also important for normal haematopoiesis. Thus, our results uncover a previously unappreciated miRNA-regulation mechanism by which a single miRNA may target both oncogenes and tumour suppressors, simultaneously, or, sequentially, in tumourigenesis and normal development per cell differentiation, indicating that miRNA regulation is much more complex than previously thought.","['Li, Zejuan', 'Huang, Hao', 'Chen, Ping', 'He, Miao',

In this study, we examine susceptibility of various head and neck cancer (HNC) cells and mechanism of cell death to an anti-DR4 agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb), AY4. AY4 as a single agent induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death of KB and HN9, but not in SNU899 and FaDu cell lines. AY4 treatment resulted in accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from mitochondria in AY4-sensitive cells. Blockade of ROS production by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) resulted in protection of AY4-sensitive cells against AY4-induced apoptosis. ROS generation induced by AY4 treatment triggered down-regulation of anti-apoptotic molecules of Bcl-xL and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) without affecting the expression levels of DR4, Mcl-1, and survivin. AY4 also inhibited growth of pre-established HN9 tumors in a nude mouse xenograft model and did not show noticeable cytotoxicity in a zebrafish model. Our results provide further insight into the mechanism of DR4-mediated cell death and potential use of AY4 mAb as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent in AY4-sensitive HNC types.","['Lee, Bok-Soon', 'Kang, Sung Un', 'Hwang, Hye Sook', 'Kim, Yong-Sung', 'Sung, Eun-Sil', 'Shin, Yoo Seob', 'Lim, Young Chang', 'Kim, Chul-Ho']","['Lee BS', 'Kang SU', 'Hwang HS', 'Kim YS', 'Sung ES', 'Shin YS', 'Lim YC', 'Kim CH']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,2012/02/23 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2012/02/23 06:00'],"['2012/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(12)00107-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2012.02.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2012 Sep 1;322(1):45-57. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2012.02.007.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the anti-allergic effects of adlay bran on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the anti-allergic effects of adlay bran, the release of histamines and cytokines were measured using ELISA. To explore the mechanism of these effects, the protein expression levels were determined using western blotting. RESULTS: A 40.8mug/mL concentration of the ethyl acetate fraction of the ethanolic extracts of adlay bran (ABE-EtOAc) effectively inhibited mast cell degranulation. The 40-100% EtOAc/Hex subfractions of ABE-EtOAc inhibited histamine release with an IC(50) of 71-87mug/mL. Moreover, the ABE-EtOAc subfractions suppressed the secretion of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the RBL-2H3 cells, indicating that adlay bran can inhibit cytokine secretion in the late phase of the allergic reaction. In addition, adlay bran reduced the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species, inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and decreased the expression of protein kinase C. Furthermore, six phenolic acids and one flavone were isolated. Of these compounds, luteolin showed the most potent inhibitory activity (IC(50)=1.5mug/mL). CONCLUSION: Adlay bran extract reduced the release of histamines and cytokines and suppressed the production of Akt. These combined effects influenced the signal transduction in RBL-2H3 cells, thereby revealing the mechanisms of the anti-allergic effects of adlay.","['Chen, Hong-Jhang', 'Lo, Yi-Chen', 'Chiang, Wenchang']","['Chen HJ', 'Lo YC', 'Chiang W']","['Graduate Institute of Food Science and Technology, College of Bioresources and Agriculture, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,2012/02/23 06:00,2012/08/11 06:00,['2012/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(12)00090-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2012.02.009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2012 May 7;141(1):119-27. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2012.02.009.

However, the influence of cell source on the clinical outcome of SC transplantation is not yet well established. The aim of this study was to compare the results of PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) on the basis of engraftment, frequency and severity of immediate (mucositis, acute Graft versus Host Disease--aGvHD) and delayed (chronic GvHD--cGvHD) complications, as well as transplant-related mortality (TRM), transfusion needs, relapses and overall survival (OS). METHODS: We analyzed 158 patients, women/men ratio 64/94 median age 29 (range 9-57), who underwent allogeneic SC transplantation between 1989 and 2009. All included patients had diseases as follows: acute myeloid leukemia (AML)--39, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 47, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)--32, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)--10, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL)- 2, multiple myeloma (MM) 3, granulocytic sarcoma (GrSa) 3, severe aplastic anemia (sAA)--22. The patients underwent transplantations were divided into two groups: BMT group (74 patients) and PBSCT group (84 patients). Each recipient had HLA identical sibling donor. SCs from bone marrow were collected by multiple aspirations of iliac bone and from PB by one ""Large Volume Leukapheresis"" (after recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor, rHuG-CSF) application (5-12 microg/kgbm, 5 days). Conditioning regimens were applied according to primary disease, GvHD prophylaxis consisted of combination of a cyclosporine A and methotrexate. Results. Engraftment, according to the count of polymorphonuclear and platelets, were significantly (p < 0.001) faster in the PBSCT vs BMT group. The needs for transfusion support were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the BMT group. Those patients had more frequently oropharingeal mucositis grade 3/4 (33.3% vs 10.0%, p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidence of aGvHD and cGvHD between the two groups. The patients who underwent PBSCT had more frequently extensive cGvHD in comparison with the BMT group (29.1% vs 11.29%, p < 0.05). SC source (SCS) had no significant influence on the TRM (21.62% vs 23.8%, p = 0.64) and the incidence of relapses (21.6% vs 29.7%, p = 0.32). Finally, the patients treated by BMT hd a significantly better OS (logrank 2.33, p < 0.05). Conclusion. SCs harvesting from PB resulted in improved cell yield, faster engraftment, as well as in a decrease of immediate transplantation related complications with a reduced treatment cost. Allogeneic PBSCT were associated with more frequent extensive cGvHD, while the influence of SCS in TRM and relapses was not observed. Finally, the long-term OS was better in the patients treated by BMT. To verify impact of SC source on transplantation (PBSCT vs BMT) overall efficacy, more larger randomized clinical studies are needed.","['Stamatovic, Dragana', 'Balint, Bela', 'Tukic, Ljiljana', 'Elez, Marija', 'Tarabar, Olivera', 'Todorovic, Milena', 'Ostojic, Gordana', 'Tatomirovic, Zeljka', 'Ljubenov, Marika', 'Marjanovic, Slobodan', 'Malesevic, Milomir']","['Stamatovic D', 'Balint B', 'Tukic L', 'Elez M', 'Tarabar O', 'Todorovic M', 'Ostojic G', 'Tatomirovic Z', 'Ljubenov M', 'Marjanovic S', 'Malesevic M']","['Military Medical Academy, Clinic of Hematology, Belgrade, Serbia. stamatovicm@sbb.rs']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,2012/02/23 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2012/02/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2011 Dec;68(12):1026-32.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 60 crude plant extracts were prepared from 30 plant species using CH2Cl2 and MeOH. Effect upon cell proliferation by the extracts, for both bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei and human leukaemia HL-60 cells, was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. Of all CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts evaluated against the trypanosomes, the CH2Cl2 extracts from five plants showed trypanocidal activity with an IC50 value below 20 microg/mL: Dovyalis abyssinica (Flacourtiaceae), IC50 = 1.4 microg/mL; Albizia schimperiana (Fabaceae), IC50 = 7.2 microg/mL; Ocimum urticifolium (Lamiaceae), IC50 = 14.0 microg/mL; Acokanthera schimperi (Apocynaceae), IC50 = 16.6 microg/mL; and Chenopodium ambrosioides (Chenopodiaceae), IC50 = 17.1 microg/mL. A pronounced and selective killing of trypanosomes with minimal toxic effect on human cells was exhibited by Dovyalis abyssinica (CH2Cl2 extract, SI = 125.0; MeOH extract, SI = 57.7) followed by Albizia schimperiana (CH2Cl2 extract, SI = 31.3) and Ocimum urticifolium (MeOH extract, SI = 16.0). In conclusion, the screening of 30 Ethiopian medicinal plants identified three species with good antitrypanosomal activities and low toxicity towards human cells. Dovyalis abyssinica might be a promising candidate for phytotherapy of trypanosomiasis.","['Nibret, Endalkachew', 'Wink, Michael']","['Nibret E', 'Wink M']","['Institut fur Pharmazie und Molekulare Biotechnologie, Universitat Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, D-69120, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Prior reports have described the histopathologic characteristics on vertical sections; however, to our knowledge, immunohistochemical analysis of polyomavirus proteins has not been previously performed. OBSERVATIONS: We discuss the thorough diagnostic evaluation and therapy of an unusual case of viral-associated trichodysplasia due to a newly described human polyomavirus that occurred in a patient with posttreatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia and an abnormal white blood cell count. Unique to our study is the immunohistochemical staining for the polyomavirus middle T antigen, which demonstrated positive staining of cellular inclusions within keratinocytes that compose the inner root sheath. Further evaluation with scanning electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis of viral DNA confirmed the presence of the virus. Treatment with topical cidofovir resulted in dramatic clinical improvement and hair regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: Several tools, including immunohistochemical staining for the polyomavirus middle T antigen, can be used to identify the pathogenic virus associated with viral-associated trichodysplasia. This case highlights the utility of multiple diagnostic modalities and a robust response to a topical therapeutic agent, cidofovir.","['Wanat, Karolyn A', 'Holler, Phillip D', 'Dentchev, Tzvete', 'Simbiri, Kenneth', 'Robertson, Erle', 'Seykora, John T', 'Rosenbach, Misha']","['Wanat KA', 'Holler PD', 'Dentchev T', 'Simbiri K', 'Robertson E', 'Seykora JT', 'Rosenbach M']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania, 3600 Spruce St, Second Floor, Maloney Bldg, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/04/11 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['148/2/219 [pii]', '10.1001/archdermatol.2011.1413 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2012 Feb;148(2):219-23. doi: 10.1001/archdermatol.2011.1413.,,,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'JIL713Q00N (Cidofovir)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cidofovir', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Female', 'Hair Diseases/*drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Hair Follicle/chemistry/pathology/virology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Organophosphonates/*therapeutic use', 'Polyomavirus', 'Polyomavirus Infections/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",,,"['F32 AI058421-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AR057217/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AR007465/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-AR057217/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3346264,,,['NIHMS371635'],,,,,,,,,,,

Signals from the microenvironment support leukemic cell survival and proliferation and may confer chemotherapy resistance. ON 01910.Na (Rigosertib), a multikinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, is entering phase III trials for myelodysplastic syndrome. Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ON 01910.Na against CLL cells in vitro and investigate the molecular effects of this drug on tumor biology. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cytotoxicity of ON 01910.Na against CLL cells from 34 patients was determined in vitro with flow cytometry of cells stained with Annexin V and CD19. Global gene expression profiling on Affymetrix microarrays, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and cocultures with stroma cells were used to delineate ON 01910.Na mechanism of action. RESULTS: ON 01910.Na induced apoptosis in CLL B cells without significant toxicity against T cells or normal B cells. ON 01910.Na was equally active against leukemic cells associated with a more aggressive disease course [immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region unmutated, adverse cytogenetics] than against cells without these features. Gene expression profiling revealed two main mechanisms of action: PI3K/AKT inhibition and induction of ROS that resulted in an oxidative stress response through activating protein 1 (AP-1), c-jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase, and ATF3 culminating in the upregulation of NOXA. ROS scavengers and shRNA mediated knockdown of ATF3- and NOXA-protected cells from drug-induced apoptosis. ON 01910.Na also abrogated the prosurvival effect of follicular dendritic cells on CLL cells and reduced SDF-1-induced migration of leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the clinical development of ON 01910.Na in CLL.","['Chapman, Colby M', 'Sun, Xiameng', 'Roschewski, Mark', 'Aue, Georg', 'Farooqui, Mohamed', 'Stennett, Lawrence', 'Gibellini, Federica', 'Arthur, Diane', 'Perez-Galan, Patricia', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Chapman CM', 'Sun X', 'Roschewski M', 'Aue G', 'Farooqui M', 'Stennett L', 'Gibellini F', 'Arthur D', 'Perez-Galan P', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, NHLBI, NIH, Bld 10, CRC 3-5140, 10 Center Drive, 20892-1202 Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2113 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2113 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Apr 1;18(7):1979-91. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2113.

This study shows the potential therapeutic use of the HSP90 inhibitor (XL888) in six different models of vemurafenib resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The ability of XL888 to inhibit growth and to induce apoptosis and tumor regression of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines was shown in vitro and in vivo. A novel mass spectrometry-based pharmacodynamic assay was developed to measure intratumoral HSP70 levels following HSP90 inhibition in melanoma cell lines, xenografts, and melanoma biopsies. Mechanistic studies were carried out to determine the mechanism of XL888-induced apoptosis. RESULTS: XL888 potently inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis, and prevented the growth of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines in 3-dimensional cell culture, long-term colony formation assays, and human melanoma mouse xenografts. The reversal of the resistance phenotype was associated with the degradation of PDGFRbeta, COT, IGFR1, CRAF, ARAF, S6, cyclin D1, and AKT, which in turn led to the nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a, an increase in BIM (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) expression, and the downregulation of Mcl-1. In most resistance models, XL888 treatment increased BIM expression, decreased Mcl-1 expression, and induced apoptosis more effectively than dual mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (MEK/PI3K) inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: HSP90 inhibition may be a highly effective strategy at managing the diverse array of resistance mechanisms being reported to BRAF inhibitors and appears to be more effective at restoring BIM expression and downregulating Mcl-1 expression than combined MEK/PI3K inhibitor therapy.","['Paraiso, Kim H T', 'Haarberg, H Eirik', 'Wood, Elizabeth', 'Rebecca, Vito W', 'Chen, Y Ann', 'Xiang, Yun', 'Ribas, Antoni', 'Lo, Roger S', 'Weber, Jeffrey S', 'Sondak, Vernon K', 'John, Jobin K', 'Sarnaik, Amod A', 'Koomen, John M', 'Smalley, Keiran S M']","['Paraiso KH', 'Haarberg HE', 'Wood E', 'Rebecca VW', 'Chen YA', 'Xiang Y', 'Ribas A', 'Lo RS', 'Weber JS', 'Sondak VK', 'John JK', 'Sarnaik AA', 'Koomen JM', 'Smalley KS']","['The Department of Molecular Oncology, The Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, Tampa, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2612 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2612 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 May 1;18(9):2502-14. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2612.

Bone marrow aspiration showed an infiltration by a lymphoproliferative malignancy and the following cytochemical studies on bone marrow sample led to diagnosis of HCL. The biopsy of the skin lesion revealed a infiltrate of medium and large-size cells in the dermis with the the same cytologic features of leukemic blasts appearing in the bone marrow, upon which the diagnosis of Leukemia cutis was established. The differential diagnosis of leukemia includes other neoplastic hematopoietic disorders, such as lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, severe megaloblastic anemia, severe lymphocytosis, severe monocytosis, and bone marrow failure. In our case, the skin lesion was surgically removed and then left to heal by secondary intention due to the presence of bacterial infection by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The wound was finally medicated to total healing with Promogran(R), an advanced dressings which consists of a sterile, freeze-dried matrix composed of collagen and oxidised regenerated cellulose.

In the present study, the EtOAc extracts were further separated by silica-gel column chromatography into five fractions (Frs. 1-5), and their cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activity investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxic activity was determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) was determined from the dose-response curve. Tumor specificity (TS) was determined by the ratio of the mean CC(50) for normal cells to the one for tumor cell lines. DNA fragmentation was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Caspase-3/-7 activation was monitored by cleavage of substrates either spectrophotometrically or by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Among five fractions of the EtOAc extract, Fr. 1, eluted with CHCl(3)-MeOH (50:1), showed the highest tumor specificity (TS=3.3) as compared with other fractions eluted at higher concentrations of MeOH in CHCl(3) (TS=1.0-2.8). Fr. 1 did not induce internucleosomal DNA fragmentation or induced only marginal level of caspase-3 activity in either human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines HSC-2.

The overexpression of an ABC transporter, the ABCB1, is often associated with MDR in cancer. Previously it was observed that hydantoin compounds can modulate the activity of the ABCB1 pump. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen hydantoin derivatives were synthesized and studied for their capacity to increase accumulation of ethidium bromide (EB) by mouse lymphoma cancer cells that were transfected with the human ABCB1 gene and overexpress the human ABCB1 pump. RESULTS: It was observed that the accumulation of EB by the cells in the presence of four of the newly synthesized hydantoins was strongly increased. Similar but milder effects were also observed for the other seven hydantoins; the remaining three had no activity. CONCLUSION: The 14 hydantoin compounds studied belong to three different structural groups. Structure-activity relationships were studied and important molecular substituents that were possibly responsible for increased the activity of the molecules were identified. This important information may lead to the continuation of our work and to the future synthesis of more active compounds.","['Martins, Ana', 'Dymek, Anna', 'Handzlik, Jadwiga', 'Spengler, Gabriella', 'Armada, Ana', 'Molnar, Joseph', 'Kiec-Kononowicz, Katarzyna', 'Amaral, Leonard']","['Martins A', 'Dymek A', 'Handzlik J', 'Spengler G', 'Armada A', 'Molnar J', 'Kiec-Kononowicz K', 'Amaral L']","['Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['26/2/293 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2012 Mar-Apr;26(2):293-7.,,,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Hydantoins)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Ethidium/analysis/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydantoins/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ion Transport/drug effects', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the EtOAc layer was subjected to silica-gel column chromatography for further separation into five fractions, and the cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activity of the fractions against human normal oral and tumor cells was further investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxic activity was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) was determined by the dose-response curve. Tumor specificity (TS) was determined by the ratio of the mean CC(50) for normal cells to the one of tumor cell lines. DNA fragmentation was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis, caspase-3/-7 activation was monitored by cleavage of substrates either spectrophotometrically or by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Among five fractions, the most hydrophobic fraction (Fr. 1) showed the highest cytotoxicity against all cell lines tested, followed by Fr. 2 >Fr. 3 >Fr. 4 >Fr. 5, in order of increasing polarity. Fr. 2 had the highest tumor-specificity, followed by Fr. 3, Fr. 4, Fr. 1 and Fr. 5. Fr. 1 induced caspase-3 activation more potently in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, than in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) HSC-2 cells, whereas it did not induce internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in either of these cell lines. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that hydrophobic substances in the EtOAc extract of Odontioda Marie Noel 'Velano' exhibit tumor-specific cytotoxicity without inducing apoptosis in the HSC-2 OSCC cell line.","['Masuda, Yuko', 'Suzuki, Ryuichiro', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Umemura, Naoki', 'Ueda, Jun-ya', 'Shirataki, Yoshiaki']","['Masuda Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Sakagami H', 'Umemura N', 'Ueda JY', 'Shirataki Y']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Josai University, Sakado, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['26/2/265 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2012 Mar-Apr;26(2):265-9.,,,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Solvents)', '76845O8NMZ (ethyl acetate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Acetates', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Orchidaceae/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Solvents']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An elevated level of bFGF was recently found in CML patients, and bFGF was considered to play an important role in stimulating the growth of leukemia cells. Suppression of the mitogenic activity of bFGF may contribute to CML therapy. We have previously obtained a novel bFGF-binding peptide (named P7) with strong inhibitory activity against bFGF-induced cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effects of P7 on the proliferation of K562 cells derived from CML. The results demonstrated that P7 inhibited bFGF-stimulated proliferation, arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, repressed the activation of MAP kinase, reversed the effects of bFGF on cell membrane ultrastructure, and caused significant changes in the expression of proteins related to proliferation. Our results suggested that the bFGF-binding peptide may have a potential antitumor effect on CML from the point of view of targeting bFGF.","['Wang, Cong', 'Yu, Yonglin', 'Li, Quchou', 'Gao, Susu', 'Jia, Xinglong', 'Chen, Xilei', 'Wang, Ruixue', 'Li, Tao', 'Wang, Wenhui', 'Li, Xiaokun', 'Wu, Xiaoping']","['Wang C', 'Yu Y', 'Li Q', 'Gao S', 'Jia X', 'Chen X', 'Wang R', 'Li T', 'Wang W', 'Li X', 'Wu X']","['College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, Guangzhou, China 510632.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/10/20 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-012-0348-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2012 Aug;33(4):1085-93. doi: 10.1007/s13277-012-0348-9.

Occupational exposure to benzene has been associated with increased chromosomal aneuploidies in blood lymphocytes and, in separate studies, in sperm. However, aneuploidy detection in somatic and germ cells within the same benzene-exposed individuals has never been reported. To compare aneuploidies in blood lymphocytes and sperm within the same individuals exposed to benzene, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 33 benzene-exposed male workers and 33 unexposed workers from Chinese factories. Air benzene concentrations in the exposed workers ranged from below the detection limit to 24 ppm (median, 2.9 ppm) and were undetectable in the unexposed subjects. Aneuploidies of chromosomes 21, X, and Y in blood lymphocytes were examined by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization and were compared to the previously reported aneuploidies in sperm. The results showed that benzene exposure was positively associated with the gain of chromosome 21 but not sex chromosomes in blood lymphocytes. This was in contrast to analysis of sperm, where the gain of sex chromosomes, but not chromosome 21, was significantly increased in the exposed workers. Furthermore, a significant correlation in the gain of sex chromosomes between blood lymphocytes and sperm was observed among the unexposed subjects, but not among the exposed workers. The findings suggest that benzene exposure induces aneuploidies in both blood cells and sperm within the same individuals, but selectively affects chromosome 21 in blood lymphocytes and the sex chromosomes in sperm.","['Ji, Zhiying', 'Weldon, Rosana H', 'Marchetti, Francesco', 'Chen, Howard', 'Li, Guilan', 'Xing, Caihong', 'Kurtovich, Elaine', 'Young, Suzanne', 'Schmid, Thomas E', 'Waidyanatha, Suramya', 'Rappaport, Stephen', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Eskenazi, Brenda']","['Ji Z', 'Weldon RH', 'Marchetti F', 'Chen H', 'Li G', 'Xing C', 'Kurtovich E', 'Young S', 'Schmid TE', 'Waidyanatha S', 'Rappaport S', 'Zhang L', 'Eskenazi B']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/em.21683 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2012 Apr;53(3):218-26. doi: 10.1002/em.21683.

One class of diseases, including ataxia-telangiectasia, displays a defect in checkpoint response to DSBs. Another class of diseases exhibits severe combined immunodeficiency and defects in DSB repair. Importantly, radiosensitive human diseases are also associated with increased risks of leukemia/lymphoma. In this review, we summarize the molecular nature of IR-induced DNA damage, and provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms of checkpoint response to and repair of DSBs. Lastly, we discuss the roles of these mechanisms in the development of the immune system and the suppression of lymphoma/leukemia, based on the clinical features and experiments with model mice.","['Masuda, Yuji', 'Kamiya, Kenji']","['Masuda Y', 'Kamiya K']","['Department of Genome Dynamics, Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1008-y [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Mar;95(3):239-45. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1008-y.

The detection of XMRV in healthy individuals has raised concern about a possible virus transmission by blood products. However, recent studies challenge the association between XMRV and human disease. This study investigated whether or not XMRV is present in patients with altered immune function and individuals at increased risk of blood-borne viral infections in Germany. METHODS: We investigated 503 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 240 patients with iatrogenic immune suppression (71 haematopoietic stem cell recipients, 132 solid organ transplant recipients, 37 others) and 311 PBMC samples from 302 patients with HIV-1 infection for the presence of proviral XMRV by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: All 814 PBMC samples from 542 patients tested negative for XMRV DNA and positive for an internal herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) control. Human genomic DNA was detected in all samples, and 90% of the samples contained >10,000 cell equivalents per XMRV PCR reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our failure to detect proviral XMRV provides evidence against the presence of XMRV in patients at increased risk of viral infections in Germany.","['Korn, K', 'Reil, H', 'Ensser, A', 'Knoll, A']","['Korn K', 'Reil H', 'Ensser A', 'Knoll A']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/09/28 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s15010-012-0249-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 2012 Apr;40(2):181-4. doi: 10.1007/s15010-012-0249-2.

Here, we report the definition of critical CLL cell survival pathways that can be targeted by ectopic reexpression of the miRNA genes miR-130a and miR-143 which are widely downregulated in CLL. Notably, miR-130a inhibited autophagy by reducing autophagosome formation, an effect mediated by downregulation of the genes ATG2B and DICER1, the latter of which is a major component of the miRNA silencing machinery. In support of the concept of a fundamental connection between miRNA disregulation and altered autophagic flux in this cancer, we showed that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of DICER1 expression was sufficient to reduce autophagy in primary or established cultures of CLL cells. Together, our findings show that miR-130a modulates cell survival programs by regulating autophagic flux, and they define roles for miR-130a and Dicer1 in a regulatory feedback loop that mediates CLL cell survival.","['Kovaleva, Valentina', 'Mora, Rodrigo', 'Park, Yoon Jung', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Chiramel, Abhilash I', 'Bartenschlager, Ralf', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Pscherer, Armin', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Seiffert, Martina']","['Kovaleva V', 'Mora R', 'Park YJ', 'Plass C', 'Chiramel AI', 'Bartenschlager R', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Pscherer A', 'Lichter P', 'Seiffert M']","['University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-3671 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3671 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Apr 1;72(7):1763-72. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3671.

Here, we examine the associations of three HLA loci with medically refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) patients in a case-control study involving 2,438 cases and 41,750 controls. An analysis of alleles from the class I loci, HLA-A and HLA-B, and the class II locus DRB1 illuminates a spectrum of extremely significant allelic associations conferring both predisposition and protection. Genotypes constructed from predisposing, protective, and neutral allelic categories point to an additive mode of disease causation. For all three loci, genotypes homozygous for predisposing alleles are at highest disease risk while the favorable effect of homozygous protective genotypes is less striking. Analysis of A-B and B-DRB1 haplotypes reveals locus-specific differences in disease effects, while that all three loci influence pALL; the influence of HLA-B is greater than that of HLA-A, and the predisposing effect of DRB1 exceeds that of HLA-B. We propose that the continuum in disease susceptibility suggests a system in which many alleles take part in disease predisposition based on differences in binding affinity to one or a few peptides of exogenous origin. This work provides evidence that an immune response mediated by alleles from several HLA loci plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of pALL, adding to the numerous studies pointing to a role for an infectious origin in pALL.","['Klitz, William', 'Gragert, Loren', 'Trachtenberg, Elizabeth']","['Klitz W', 'Gragert L', 'Trachtenberg E']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. klitz@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/07/19 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00251-012-0605-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 2012 Jun;64(6):409-19. doi: 10.1007/s00251-012-0605-5.

Here we explore the hypothesis that Notch1 also alters T-ALL cell migration. Rho GTPases are well known to regulate cell adhesion and migration. We have analysed the expression levels of Rho GTPases in primary T-ALL samples compared with normal T cells by quantitative PCR. We found that 5 of the 20 human Rho genes are highly and consistently upregulated in T-ALL, and 3 further Rho genes are expressed in T-ALL but not detectable in normal T cells. Of these, RHOU expression is highly correlated with the expression of the Notch1 target DELTEX-1. Inhibition of Notch1 signalling with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) or Notch1 RNA interference reduced RhoU expression in T-ALL cells, whereas constitutively active Notch1 increased RhoU expression. In addition, Notch1 or RhoU depletion, or GSI treatment, inhibits T-ALL cell adhesion, migration and chemotaxis. These results indicate that NOTCH1 mutation stimulates T-ALL cell migration through RhoU upregulation that could contribute to the leukaemia cell dissemination.","['Bhavsar, P J', 'Infante, E', 'Khwaja, A', 'Ridley, A J']","['Bhavsar PJ', 'Infante E', 'Khwaja A', 'Ridley AJ']","[""Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2012/02/22 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201242 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.42 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Jan 10;32(2):198-208. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.42.

Owing to the technical challenge of distinguishing and isolating distinct cancer subclones, many aspects of this clonal evolution are poorly understood, including the diversity of different subclones in an individual cancer, the nature of the subclones contributing to relapse, and the identity of pre-cancerous mutations. These issues are not just important to our understanding of cancer biology, but are also clinically important given the need to understand the nature of subclones responsible for the refractory and relapsed disease that cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients. Recently, advanced genomic techniques have been used to investigate clonal diversity and evolution in acute leukemia. Studies of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) demonstrated that in individual patients there are multiple genetic subclones of leukemia-initiating cells, with a complex clonal architecture. Separate studies also investigating pediatric ALL determined that the clonal basis of relapse was variable and complex, with relapse often evolving from a clone ancestral to the predominant de novo leukemia clone. Additional studies in both ALL and acute myeloid leukemia have identified pre-leukemic mutations in some individual cases. This review will highlight these recent reports investigating the clonal evolution of acute leukemia genomes and discuss the implications for clinical therapy.","['Jan, M', 'Majeti, R']","['Jan M', 'Majeti R']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2012/02/22 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201248 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.48 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Jan 10;32(2):135-40. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.48.

Flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, down-regulates short-lived anti-apoptotic proteins via inhibition of transcription. In preclinical studies, flavopiridol synergizes with imatinib to induce apoptosis. We investigated this novel combination regimen in patients with Bcr-Abl(+) malignancies. METHODS: In a phase I dose-escalation study, imatinib was administered orally daily, and flavopiridol by 1 h intravenous infusion weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks. Adults with chronic myelogenous leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute leukemia were eligible. Patients were divided into two strata based on peripheral blood and bone marrow blast counts. The primary objective was to identify the recommended phase II doses for the combination. Correlative pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were also performed. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients received study treatment. Four dose levels were evaluated before the study was closed following the approval of the second-generation Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Five patients responded, including four sustained responses. Four patients had stable disease. All but one responder, and all patients with stable disease had previously been treated with imatinib. One patient had a complete response sustained for 30 months. Changes in expression of phospho-Bcr/Abl, -Stat5, and Mcl-1 were monitored. No major pharmacokinetic interaction was observed.

The combination of flavopiridol and imatinib is tolerable and produces encouraging responses, including in some patients with imatinib-resistant disease.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Perkins, Edward B', 'Honeycut, Connie', 'Wellons, Martha D', 'Stefan, Tammy', 'Jacobberger, James W', 'Kontopodis, Emmanouil', 'Beumer, Jan H', 'Egorin, Merrill J', 'Imamura, Chiyo K', 'Douglas Figg, W Sr', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Koc, Omer N', 'Cooper, Brenda W', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Colevas, A Dimitrios', 'Roberts, John D', 'Grant, Steven']","['Bose P', 'Perkins EB', 'Honeycut C', 'Wellons MD', 'Stefan T', 'Jacobberger JW', 'Kontopodis E', 'Beumer JH', 'Egorin MJ', 'Imamura CK', 'Douglas Figg W Sr', 'Karp JE', 'Koc ON', 'Cooper BW', 'Luger SM', 'Colevas AD', 'Roberts JD', 'Grant S']","['Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-012-1839-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Jun;69(6):1657-67. doi: 10.1007/s00280-012-1839-5.

Ectonucleotidase CD39 has anti-inflammatory properties as it hydrolyzes proinflammatory extracellular ATP, generates anti-inflammatory adenosine, and also protects regulatory T cells from ATP-induced cell death. In this study, we investigated the clinical significance of CD39 expression on CD4(+) T cells in 62 patients with CLL as well as its compartmental regulation and explored the possible mechanisms for its induction. Compared to healthy individuals, CD4(+)CD39(+) lymphocytes were increased in the peripheral blood of patients with CLL and correlated with the advanced stage of disease. CD4(+)CD39(+) cells were also higher in patients with CLL, who needed therapeutic intervention, and in those who had unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene, were ZAP70(+) or had beta2-microglobulin levels of >3 g/L. There were more CD4(+)CD39(+) lymphocytes in the bone marrow compartment than in the peripheral blood, and in vitro studies showed that CD39 can be induced on CD4(+) cells by exposure to ATP or indirectly, following B cell receptor engagement. This may support the notion that the leukemic cells contribute to create an immune-subversive environment, and perhaps to a poorer prognosis. CD39(+) may also serve as a future target for the development of novel therapies with immune-modulating antitumor agents in CLL.","['Perry, Chava', 'Hazan-Halevy, Inbal', 'Kay, Sigi', 'Cipok, Michal', 'Grisaru, Dan', 'Deutsch, Varda', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Naparstek, Elizabeth', 'Herishanu, Yair']","['Perry C', 'Hazan-Halevy I', 'Kay S', 'Cipok M', 'Grisaru D', 'Deutsch V', 'Polliack A', 'Naparstek E', 'Herishanu Y']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, 6 Weizman Street, Tel Aviv, Israel 64239. chavap@tasmc.health.gov.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1425-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Aug;91(8):1271-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1425-2.

In this study, we analyzed the cytogenetic profiles of 1,863 Philadelphia (Ph)/BCR-ABL-positive CML patients from a research center in China. Of 1,266 newly diagnosed CML patients, the median age was 41 years, which is younger than the median age of diagnosis in western populations. The incidence of additional chromosome abnormalities (ACA) was 3.1% in newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP), 9.1% in CP after therapy, 35.4% in accelerated phase, and 52.9% in blast crisis (BC), reflecting cytogenetic evolution with CML progression. A higher prevalence of ACA was observed in variant Ph translocations than in standard t(9;22) in the disease progression, especially in BC (88.2% vs. 50%, P = 0.002). Moreover, a hyperdiploid karyotype and trisomy 8 were closely correlated with myeloid BC, while a hypodiploid karyotype and monosomy 7 were associated with lymphoid-BC. Among subsets of myeloid-BC, myeloid-BC with minimal differentiation had a higher ACA rate than myeloid-BC with granulocytic differentiation (80% vs. 46.8%, P = 0.009) and myeloid-BC with monocytic differentiation (80% vs. 42.9%, P = 0.006).

This is accomplished by careful regulation of HSC activity to balance quiescence, self-renewal and differentiation.

However, it has recently been demonstrated that protein regulation via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is crucial for normal HSC function; the loss of which can lead to transformation and leukemogenesis. The effective use of a general and reversible inhibitor of the UPS, bortezomib, in treating mantle cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma has demonstrated that targeting the UPS has therapeutic potential. Thus, understanding the emerging field of how the UPS regulates HSC activity may lead to novel targets for therapy of leukemia.","['Moran-Crusio, Kelly', 'Reavie, Linsey B', 'Aifantis, Iannis']","['Moran-Crusio K', 'Reavie LB', 'Aifantis I']","['Department of Pathology and NYU Cancer Institute, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Trends Immunol,Trends in immunology,100966032,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1471-4906(12)00010-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.it.2012.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Immunol. 2012 Jul;33(7):357-63. doi: 10.1016/j.it.2012.01.009.

Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors are capable to overcome resistance mediated by most mutations except T315I. As this mutation is causative for 20% of clinically observed resistances, the need for novel treatment strategies becomes obvious and urgent. The autophosphorylated BCR/ABL Tyr177 recruits Grb2 via its SH2 domain, which is required for efficient induction of the myeloproliferative disease by BCR/ABL. The death effector domain (DED) is the critical factor for activation of caspase-8 induced apoptosis signal. We thus speculated that transduction of an exogenous SH2-DED (SD) fragment into the CML cells may inhibit the binding of BCR/ABL Tyr177 and Grb2, activate caspase-8 induced apoptosis and serve as a novel CML treatment strategy. The infection of the recombinant adenovirus Ad5/F35-SD was verified to show both cell proliferation-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effect. Further exploration into the underlying mechanisms revealed that Ad5/F35-SD exerted its function by binding to the phospho-BCR/ABL Tyr177 site, reducing Ras, MAPK and AKT kinase activities, and activating caspase-8 induced apoptosis signal by DED protein binding to DED domain of precursor caspase-8. Moreover, high anti-proliferative activity of Ad5/F35-SD was observed in nude mice and its leukemia-protective effect was evident in chronic myeloid leukemia model mice injected with BCR/ABL(+) BaF3 cells. In conclusion, Ad5/F35-SD exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity on BCR/ABL positive leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo through disruption of Grb2 SH2-phospho-BCR/ABL Tyr177 complex formation and induction of caspase-8 activation.","['Peng, Zhi', 'Yuan, Ying', 'Li, Ya-Juan', 'Wang, Hai-Xia', 'Shi, Jing', 'Cao, Wei-Xi', 'Luo, Hong-Wei', 'Deng, Jing-Rong', 'Feng, Wen-Li']","['Peng Z', 'Yuan Y', 'Li YJ', 'Wang HX', 'Shi J', 'Cao WX', 'Luo HW', 'Deng JR', 'Feng WL']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education; Chongqing Medical University, 1 Yixueyuan Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing 400016, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(12)00052-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2012.02.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2012 Jun;44(6):861-8. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2012.02.008.

In other cases, new fields for effective drug therapy opened up, such as in chronic myeloid leukemia, and renal-cell carcinoma. In most cases, however, the benefit-risk balance was considered to be only borderline favorable. Based on our assessment of advice procedures for marketing authorization, 'need for speed' seems to be the guiding principle in anticancer drug development. Although, for drugs that make a difference, early licensure is of obvious importance to patients, this is less evident in the case of borderline drugs. Without proper incentives and with hurdles inside and outside companies, a change in drug development cannot be expected; drugs improving benefit-risk modestly over available therapies will be brought forward towards licensure.

A better knowledge of the apoptotic pathways involved in leukemic cell death resistance may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies, aimed to prevent chemotherapy resistance.","['Sarmento-Ribeiro, A B', 'Dourado, M', 'Paiva, A', 'Freitas, A', 'Silva, T', 'Regateiro, F', 'Oliveira, C R']","['Sarmento-Ribeiro AB', 'Dourado M', 'Paiva A', 'Freitas A', 'Silva T', 'Regateiro F', 'Oliveira CR']","['Applied Molecular Biology/Biochemistry Institute and Center of Investigation in Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal. absarmento@fmed.uc.pt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/07357907.2012.659925 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2012 Jun;30(5):331-42. doi: 10.3109/07357907.2012.659925.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a novel immunohistochemical panel for the diagnosis of acute and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias in bone marrow biopsies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical labelling for CD14, CD123, CD33, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD68R was assessed in 49 myeloid neoplasms with monocytic differentiation (24 CMMLs and 25 Mo-AMLs) and compared with that of 15 non-monocytic acute myeloid leukaemias (NM-AMLs) and 17 non-neoplastic controls. More than 20% CD14 immunohistochemistry (IHC)+ cells were seen only in Mo-AMLs and CMMLs, although Mo-AMLs showed wide variability and overlapped with other categories. More than 20% CD68R IHC+ cells had the highest sensitivity and specificity for Mo-AML. Discrepant MPO-/CD33+ expression was specific for Mo-AML but insensitive. A subset of blasts in Mo-AMLs and NM-AMLs were weakly CD123+. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly increased number of CD14+ cells raises the possibility of a myelomonocytic neoplasm but does not distinguish between CMML and Mo-AML. Significantly increased numbers of CD68R IHC+ cells and a discrepant MPO-/CD33+ staining pattern are specific for Mo-AML but are best utilized in a comprehensive panel.","['Rollins-Raval, Marian A', 'Roth, Christine G']","['Rollins-Raval MA', 'Roth CG']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.2012.04175.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2012 May;60(6):933-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2012.04175.x.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one cases of CPAM and six pulmonary sequestrations were included. TTF-1 expression was observed in all cases but was not seen in mucinogenic growths in CPAM. CDX2 expression was completely negative. MUC1 expression was noted in 12 (29%) CPAM and in 33% sequestrations. MUC5AC was noted in only five cases (26%) by immunohistochemistry and was found in the mucinogenic proliferations of type 1 CPAM. No immunolabelling was noted for the other mucins.

The NPM1 mutation induces a myeloproliferative disorder, but evidence indicates that other insults are necessary for the development of AML. We utilised microRNA microarrays and functional assays to determine if microRNA dysregulation could be involved in the pathogenesis of in NPM1 mutated (NPM1mut)-AML. RESULTS: We used a stringent locked nucleic acid (LNA) based microRNA microarray platform to profile bone marrow samples of patients with normal karyotype AML. A panel of five microRNAs dichotomised AML patients according to their NPM1 mutational status. miR-10a, let-7b and let-7c were significantly over-expressed, while miR-130a and miR-335 were under-expressed in NPM1mut-AML when compared to NPM1wildtype-AML. Of these, miR-10a is the most differentially expressed in NPM1mut-AML versus NPM1wildtype-AML (> 10 fold higher as confirmed by qRT-PCR). To investigate the functions of miR-10a, the OCI-AML3 cell line was utilised, which is the only commercially available cell line bearing NPM1mut. OCI-AML3 cells were firstly demonstrated to have a similarly high miR-10a expression to primary NPM1mut-AML patient samples. Inhibition of miR-10a expression by miRCURY LNA Inhibitors (Exiqon) in these cells resulted in increased cell death as assessed by MTS, cell cycle and Annexin-V assays and reduced clonogenic capacity, indicative of an involvement in leukaemic cell survival. In silico filtering of bioinformatically predicted targets of miR-10a identified a number of potential mRNA targets with annotated functions in haematopoiesis, cell growth and apoptosis. Lucferase reporter assays confirmed a number of these putative tumorogenic genes that are miR-10a suppressible including KLF4 and RB1CC1. This provides a potential mechanism for the pathogenic role of miR-10a in NPM1mut-AML. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides, for the first time, in vitro evidence of a pro-survival role of miR-10a in NPM1mut-AML, that it may contribute to the pathogenesis of NPM1mut-AML and identifies putative tumorogenic targets.","['Bryant, Adam', 'Palma, Catalina A', 'Jayaswal, Vivek', 'Yang, Yee Wa', 'Lutherborrow, Mark', 'Ma, David Df']","['Bryant A', 'Palma CA', 'Jayaswal V', 'Yang YW', 'Lutherborrow M', 'Ma DD']","[""Blood, Stem Cells and Cancer Research, St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-11-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-11-8 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2012 Feb 20;11:8. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-11-8.,,20120220,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (MIRN10 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Cell Death/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology']",,,,PMC3306826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike intrabodies, ankyrins are composed of highly structured repeat modules characterized by disulfide bridge-independent folding. Artificial ankyrin molecules, designed to target viral components, might act as intracellular antiviral agents and contribute to the cellular immunity against viral pathogens such as HIV-1. RESULTS: A phage-displayed library of artificial ankyrins was constructed, and screened on a polyprotein made of the fused matrix and capsid domains (MA-CA) of the HIV-1 Gag precursor. An ankyrin with three modules named Ank(GAG)1D4 (16.5 kDa) was isolated. Ank(GAG)1D4 and MA-CA formed a protein complex with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and a dissociation constant of K(d) ~ 1 muM, and the Ank(GAG)1D4 binding site was mapped to the N-terminal domain of the CA, within residues 1-110. HIV-1 production in SupT1 cells stably expressing Ank(GAG)1D4 in both N-myristoylated and non-N-myristoylated versions was significantly reduced compared to control cells. Ank(GAG)1D4 expression also reduced the production of MLV, a phylogenetically distant retrovirus. The Ank(GAG)1D4-mediated antiviral effect on HIV-1 was found to occur at post-integration steps, but did not involve the Gag precursor processing or cellular trafficking. Our data suggested that the lower HIV-1 progeny yields resulted from the negative interference of Ank(GAG)1D4-CA with the Gag assembly and budding pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance of Ank(GAG)1D4-expressing cells to HIV-1 suggested that the CA-targeted ankyrin Ank(GAG)1D4 could serve as a protein platform for the design of a novel class of intracellular inhibitors of HIV-1 assembly based on ankyrin-repeat modules.","['Nangola, Sawitree', 'Urvoas, Agathe', 'Valerio-Lepiniec, Marie', 'Khamaikawin, Wannisa', 'Sakkhachornphop, Supachai', 'Hong, Saw-See', 'Boulanger, Pierre', 'Minard, Philippe', 'Tayapiwatana, Chatchai']","['Nangola S', 'Urvoas A', 'Valerio-Lepiniec M', 'Khamaikawin W', 'Sakkhachornphop S', 'Hong SS', 'Boulanger P', 'Minard P', 'Tayapiwatana C']","['Division of Clinical Immunology, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-17 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-17 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 Feb 20;9:17. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-17.,,20120220,"['0 (Ankyrins)', '0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ankyrins/*pharmacology', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/growth & development', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Virus Assembly/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,PMC3308923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the incidence of malignancies and the system of haematopoietic stem cells donor surveillance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: prospective observation of sibling donors of the Haemato-Oncology Department University Hospital in Plzen (Pilsen) and of unrelated donors of the Czech National Marrow Donors Registry (CNMDR) in 2001-2010. RESULTS: No malignancy was observed in a group of 344 unrelated CNMDR donors, providing 753 person-years; one case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia manifested 6 years after bone marrow donation, with leukaemia clone retrospectively detected by DNA analysis in blood samples taken prior to the marrow donation. Acute myeloid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, renal and colorectal carcinoma were observed in a group of 84 peripheral stem cells sibling donors, providing 337 person-years observation. The respective incidence of the two haematologic malignancies was 593 cases and the expected incidence rate was 143 per 100,000. The sibling (related) donors age was significantly higher: 48 (16-75) vs. 31 (20-42) years, (p<0.0001). Significantly more lost-to-follow-up donors were among the related donors (32% vs. 3%, p<0.0001), even though active surveillance system was implemented. CONCLUSION: The development of malignancies in hematopoietic stem cells donors can naturally be expected. Related (sibling) donors are at higher risk because of their generally older age, and higher susceptibility to haematological malignancies developed within the family. The contribution of filgrastim exposure needs to be further investigated. The follow-up cooperation with related (sibling) donors is limited.","['Vokurka, S', 'Koza, V', 'Jungova, A', 'Navratilova, J', 'Svoboda, T', 'Jindra, P', 'Steinerova, K', 'Hrabetova, M', 'Vyrutova, R', 'Novak, L']","['Vokurka S', 'Koza V', 'Jungova A', 'Navratilova J', 'Svoboda T', 'Jindra P', 'Steinerova K', 'Hrabetova M', 'Vyrutova R', 'Novak L']","['Hematologicko-onkologicke oddeleni, FN Plzen. vokurka@fnplzen.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2012/02/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['37107 [pii]'],ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2012;25(1):42-6.,,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*adverse effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects', 'Siblings', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vyskyt malignit a dispenzarizace darcu krvetvornych bunek--vysledky sledovani Hematologicko-onkologickeho oddeleni FN Plzen a Ceskeho narodniho registru darcu drene,,,,

New WHO classification 2008 divides de novo AML according to cytogenetic and molecular prognostic and predictive markers. Recently, it is increasingly possible to identify a subgroup of poorer prognosis patients among those with normal karyotype AML. The aim of our study was to identify prognostically important molecular markers in children with AML, to stratify patients with normal karyotype and to monitor the disease according the genetic findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2008-2010, we analyzed bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of 20 children with de novo AML by conventional cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and molecular diagnostics. The molecular analysis was performed on the cDNA level, with the restriction analysis of PCR products (FLT3-TKD), conventional PCR (MLL-PTD, NPM1mut, FLT3-ITD) and quantification RT-PCR method (expression of fusion transcripts, BAALC, WT1). RESULTS: Samples from 20 children with AML were analyzed using the conventional cytogenetics, FISH and molecular methods. Abnormal karyotype was identified in 13 patients (65%).

The protein known as eIF6 is a ribosome anti-association factor that has been implicated in translational initiation and in ribosome synthesis. Over-expression of eIF6 is observed in many natural tumours, and causes developmental and differentiation defects in certain animal models. Here we show that the transcription of the gene encoding eIF6 is modulated by the receptor Notch-1, a protein involved in embryonic development and cell differentiation, as well as in many neoplasms. Inhibition of Notch-1 signalling by gamma-secretase inhibitors slowed down cell-cycle progression and reduced the amount of eIF6 in lymphoblastoid and ovarian cancer cell lines. Cultured ovarian cancer cell lines engineered to stably over-expressing eIF6 did not show significant changes in proliferation rate, but displayed an enhanced motility and invasive capacity. Inhibition of Notch-1 signalling in the cells over-expressing eIF6 was effective in slowing down the cell cycle, but did not reduce cell migration and invasion. On the whole, the results suggest that eIF6 is one of the downstream effectors of Notch-1 in the pathway that controls cell motility and invasiveness.","['Benelli, Dario', 'Cialfi, Samantha', 'Pinzaglia, Michela', 'Talora, Claudio', 'Londei, Paola']","['Benelli D', 'Cialfi S', 'Pinzaglia M', 'Talora C', 'Londei P']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, University of Rome Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/01 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0032047 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13328 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e32047. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0032047.

We calculated the free energy change during folding of the target sequence DNA and found a close correlation between the calculated free energy change and the number of integrations. Indeed, the integrations closely correlated with fluctuation of the structure of the target DNA segment. These data suggest that the fluctuation may generate a DNA structure favorable for in vitro integration into the target DNA.

However, numerous studies have found little to no trace of XMRV in different human cohorts. Based on evidence suggesting common transmission routes between XMRV and HIV-1, HIV-1 infected individuals may represent a high-risk group for XMRV infection and spread. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 179 HIV-1 infected treatment naive patients, 86 of which were coinfected with HCV, and 54 healthy blood donors. DNA was screened for XMRV provirus with two sensitive, published PCR assays targeting XMRV gag and env and one sensitive, published nested PCR assay targeting env. Detection of XMRV was confirmed by DNA sequencing. One of the 179 HIV-1 infected patients tested positive for gag by non-nested PCR whereas the two other assays did not detect XMRV in any specimen. All healthy blood donors were negative for XMRV proviral sequences. Sera from 23 HIV-1 infected patients (15 HCV(+)) and 12 healthy donors were screened for the presence of XMRV-reactive antibodies by Western blot. Thirteen sera (57%) from HIV-1(+) patients and 6 sera (50%) from healthy donors showed reactivity to XMRV-infected cell lysate. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The virtual absence of XMRV in PBMCs suggests that XMRV is not associated with HIV-1 infected or HIV-1/HCV coinfected patients, or blood donors. Although we noted isolated incidents of serum reactivity to XMRV, we are unable to verify the antibodies as XMRV specific.","['Gingaras, Cosmina', 'Danielson, Bryan P', 'Vigil, Karen J', 'Vey, Elana', 'Arduino, Roberto C', 'Kimata, Jason T']","['Gingaras C', 'Danielson BP', 'Vigil KJ', 'Vey E', 'Arduino RC', 'Kimata JT']","['Section of Retrovirology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/01 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0031398 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-16217 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31398. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0031398.

Though much regarding the function of LTK remains unknown, it shares a high degree of similarity with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which is found mutated in human cancer. In order to determine if LTK has transforming potential, we created two LTK mutants, F568L and R669Q, that correspond to two well-characterized activating mutations of ALK (F1174L and R1275Q). LTK-F568L, but not wildtype LTK or LTK-R669Q, transformed hematopoietic cells to cytokine independence. LTK-F568L exhibited a stronger ability to induce loss of contact inhibition and anchorage-independent growth of epithelial cells compared to LTK-R669Q, while wildtype LTK was non-transforming in the same cells. Likewise, LTK-F568L induced greater neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells than R669Q, while wildtype LTK could not. Correlating with transforming activity, LTK-F568L displayed significantly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation compared to wildtype LTK and LTK-R668Q and induced activation of various signaling proteins including Shc, ERK and the JAK/STAT pathway. Expression of wildtype LTK or LTK-R669Q generally led to weaker activation of signaling proteins than expression of LTK-F568L, or no activation at all. Thus, mutating LTK at residue F568, and to a lesser extent at R669, activates the receptor tyrosine kinase, inducing cell signaling that results in transforming properties. These studies suggest that aberrant activation of LTK may contribute to neoplastic cell growth.","['Roll, J Devon', 'Reuther, Gary W']","['Roll JD', 'Reuther GW']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, Florida, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/01 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0031733 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-16997 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31733. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0031733.

Although the genomic revolution appears to have had little impact on this problem, and might even have exacerbated it because of the flood of additional and usually ineffective leads, the emergence of high throughput resources promises the possibility of rapid, reliable and systematic identification of approved drugs for originally unintended uses. In this paper we develop and apply a method for identifying such repositioned drug candidates against breast cancer, myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer by looking for inverse correlations between the most perturbed gene expression levels in human cancer tissue and the most perturbed expression levels induced by bioactive compounds. The method uses variable gene signatures to identify bioactive compounds that modulate a given disease. This is in contrast to previous methods that use small and fixed signatures. This strategy is based on the observation that diseases stem from failed/modified cellular functions, irrespective of the particular genes that contribute to the function, i.e., this strategy targets the functional signatures for a given cancer. This function-based strategy broadens the search space for the effective drugs with an impressive hit rate. Among the 79, 94 and 88 candidate drugs for breast cancer, myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer, 32%, 13% and 17% respectively are either FDA-approved/in-clinical-trial drugs, or drugs with suggestive literature evidences, with an FDR of 0.01. These findings indicate that the method presented here could lead to a substantial increase in efficiency in drug discovery and development, and has potential application for the personalized medicine.","['Shigemizu, Daichi', 'Hu, Zhenjun', 'Hung, Jui-Hung', 'Huang, Chia-Ling', 'Wang, Yajie', 'DeLisi, Charles']","['Shigemizu D', 'Hu Z', 'Hung JH', 'Huang CL', 'Wang Y', 'DeLisi C']","['Bioinformatics Program, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002347 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-11-00651 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2012 Feb;8(2):e1002347. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002347.

A subpopulation of the leukemic blasts, known as leukemia stem cells, that are capable of propagating the leukemia, remain sheltered in the bone marrow microenvironment, exhibit resistance to chemotherapy, and serve as the origin of relapse after a variable period of remission. Detachment of these cells from the bone marrow in combination with chemotherapy may improve the outcome of therapy for AML.","['Becker, Pamela S']",['Becker PS'],"['Division of Hematology, Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, University of Washington, Campus Box 358056, 815 Mercer Street N415, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. pbecker@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1100/2012/856467 [doi]'],ppublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2012;2012:856467. doi: 10.1100/2012/856467.

Loss of CYP3A5 expression was mainly conferred by a single nucleotide polymorphism at 6986A>G (CYP3A5*3). We investigated the association between CYP3A5*3 polymorphism and acute leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and eighty nine acute leukemia cases comprising of 145 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 144 acute myeloid leukemia and 241 control samples were analyzed for CYP3A5*3 polymorphism using PCR-RFLP method. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version (15.0) to detect the association between CYP3A5*3 polymorphism and acute leukemia. RESULTS: The CYP3A5*3 polymorphism 3/3 genotype was significantly associated with acute leukemia development (chi(2)- 133.53; df-2, P 0.000). When the data was analyzed with respect to clinical variables, mean WBC, blast % and LDH levels were increased in both ALL and AML cases with 3/3 genotype. The epidemiological variables did not contribute to the genotype risk to develop either AML or ALL. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the CYP3A5*3 polymorphism might confer the risk to develop ALL or AML emphasizing the significance of effective phase I detoxification in carcinogenesis. Association of the polymorphism with clinical variables indicate that the 3/3 genotype might also contribute to poorer survival of the patients.","['Rao, D Nageswara', 'Manjula, G', 'Sailaja, K', 'Surekha, D', 'Raghunadharao, D', 'Rajappa, Senthil', 'Vishnupriya, S']","['Rao DN', 'Manjula G', 'Sailaja K', 'Surekha D', 'Raghunadharao D', 'Rajappa S', 'Vishnupriya S']","['Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Hum Genet,Indian journal of human genetics,101223637,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/02/22 06:01,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-6866.92098 [doi]', 'IJHG-17-175 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hum Genet. 2011 Sep;17(3):175-8. doi: 10.4103/0971-6866.92098.,,,,,,,,,PMC3276986,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'CYP3A5', 'drug metabolism', 'polymorphism']",,,,,,,,,

These results provide new impetus for the generation of selective Mcl-1 inhibitors.","['Gores, Gregory J', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Gores GJ', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. gores.gregory@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Comment']",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['26/4/305 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.186189.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2012 Feb 15;26(4):305-11. doi: 10.1101/gad.186189.111.,,,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism']",,,"['R01 DK059427/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK059427-11/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK59427/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3289878,,['Genes Dev. 2012 Jan 15;26(2):120-5.

TSLP requires a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IL-7 receptor alpha subunit and its unique TSLP receptor (gene symbol CRLF2) to transmit signals in cells. Abnormal TSLP signaling (e.g. overexpression of TSLP or its unique receptor TSLPR) contributes to the development of a number of diseases including asthma and leukemia. However, a detailed understanding of the signaling pathways activated by TSLP remains elusive. In this study, we performed a global quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling network using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture. By employing titanium dioxide in addition to antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as enrichment methods, we identified 4164 phosphopeptides on 1670 phosphoproteins. Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based quantitation, we determined that the phosphorylation status of 226 proteins was modulated by TSLP stimulation. Our analysis identified activation of several members of the Src and Tec families of kinases including Btk, Lyn, and Tec by TSLP for the first time. In addition, we report TSLP-induced phosphorylation of protein phosphatases such as Ptpn6 (SHP-1) and Ptpn11 (Shp2), which has also not been reported previously. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Shp2 binds to the adapter protein Gab2 in a TSLP-dependent manner. This is the first demonstration of an inducible protein complex in TSLP signaling. A kinase inhibitor screen revealed that pharmacological inhibition of PI-3 kinase, Jak family kinases, Src family kinases or Btk suppressed TSLP-dependent cellular proliferation making them candidate therapeutic targets in diseases resulting from aberrant TSLP signaling. Our study is the first phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling pathway that greatly expands our understanding of TSLP signaling and provides novel therapeutic targets for TSLP/TSLPR-associated diseases in humans.","['Zhong, Jun', 'Kim, Min-Sik', 'Chaerkady, Raghothama', 'Wu, Xinyan', 'Huang, Tai-Chung', 'Getnet, Derese', 'Mitchell, Christopher J', 'Palapetta, Shyam M', 'Sharma, Jyoti', ""O'Meally, Robert N"", 'Cole, Robert N', 'Yoda, Akinori', 'Moritz, Albrecht', 'Loriaux, Marc M', 'Rush, John', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Pandey, Akhilesh']","['Zhong J', 'Kim MS', 'Chaerkady R', 'Wu X', 'Huang TC', 'Getnet D', 'Mitchell CJ', 'Palapetta SM', 'Sharma J', ""O'Meally RN"", 'Cole RN', 'Yoda A', 'Moritz A', 'Loriaux MM', 'Rush J', 'Weinstock DM', 'Tyner JW', 'Pandey A']","['McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 733 N Broadway, Baltimore, 21205 Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)30440-0 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M112.017764 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012 Jun;11(6):M112.017764. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M112.017764.

Of the 32 strains isolated, 13 were selected for biological evaluation of their crude extracts. The acetate extract obtained from a Gram-negative bacterium was strongly active against cancer cell lines with IC(50) values that ranged from 0.04 (HL60 leukemia cells) to 0.26 mug/ml (MDA MB-435 melanoma cells). The bacterium was identified as a Pseudoalteromonas sp. based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A bioassay-guided fractionation of the active extract led to the isolation of prodigiosin, a well-known tripyrrole red pigment with immunosuppressive and anticancer activities. Further experiments with ErbB-2 overexpressing cell lines, including HB4a-C3.6 (moderate overexpression), HB4a-C5.2 (high overexpression), and the parental HB4a cell line, were performed. Prodigiosin was moderately active toward HB4a cells with an IC(50) of 4.6 mug/ml, while it was 115 and 18 times more active toward HB4a-C3.6 cells (IC(50) of 0.04 mug/ml) and HB4a-C5.2 (IC(50) of 0.26 mug/ml) cells, respectively. These data suggest that, in spite of its previously described apoptosis-inducing properties, prodigiosin can selectively recognize cells overexpressing ErbB-2, which could be highly appealing in human breast cancer therapy.","['Arthaud, Isabelle D B', 'Rodrigues, Felipe A R', 'Jimenez, Paula C', 'Montenegro, Raquel C', 'Angelim, Alysson L', 'Maciel, Vania M M', 'Silveira, Edilberto R', 'Freitas, Hozana P S', 'Sousa, Thiciana S', 'Pessoa, Otilia D L', 'Lotufo, Tito M C', 'Costa-Lotufo, Leticia V']","['Arthaud ID', 'Rodrigues FA', 'Jimenez PC', 'Montenegro RC', 'Angelim AL', 'Maciel VM', 'Silveira ER', 'Freitas HP', 'Sousa TS', 'Pessoa OD', 'Lotufo TM', 'Costa-Lotufo LV']","['Instituto de Ciencias do Mar, LABOMAR, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Fortaleza, CE, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Chem Biodivers,Chemistry & biodiversity,101197449,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/23 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbdv.201100092 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biodivers. 2012 Feb;9(2):418-27. doi: 10.1002/cbdv.201100092.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zurich.']",,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'OL369FU7CJ (Prodigiosin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brazil', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Phylogeny', 'Prodigiosin/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Pseudoalteromonas/*drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs), which are transcribed from the DNA strand opposite to that for mRNA of the gene, are recognized as important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotic cells, but the effects on cis-NAT expression by IR are unknown to date. Therefore, we investigated the effects of X-ray irradiation on cis-NAT expression together with mRNA expression using a human B lymphoblast cell line (IM-9), a custom-microarray and strand-specific RT-qPCR. Eighteen, 33 and 106 mRNAs were demonstrated to be differentially expressed in IM-9 cells after 1, 2 and 4 Gy irradiation, respectively, as compared to 0 Gy by microarray analysis (fold change, FC >2.0). On the other hand, 10, 22 and 43 NATs were demonstrated to be differentially expressed in IM-9 cells after 1, 2 and 4 Gy irradiation, respectively, as compared to 0 Gy by microarray analysis (FC >2.0). Among these mRNAs/NATs, the IR dose-dependent up-regulation of mRNAs and cis-NATs of MDM2 and CDKN1A were confirmed by strand-specific RT-qPCR. Additionally, the cis-NATs of MDM2 were indicated to be localized in the cytoplasm, while cis-NATs of CDKN1A were located in the nucleus and cytoplasm. In conclusion, the radiation-responsive cis-NATs in conjunction with mRNAs were identified for the first time in the present study. It is possible that these cis-NATs regulate the gene expression in a post-transcriptional fashion. The IR dose-dependent up- and down-regulation of these mRNAs/cis-NATs may be a marker for ionizing radiation.","['Chiba, Mitsuru', 'Miura, Tomisato', 'Kasai, Kosuke', 'Monzen, Satoru', 'Kashiwakura, Ikuo', 'Yasue, Hiroshi', 'Nakamura, Toshiya']","['Chiba M', 'Miura T', 'Kasai K', 'Monzen S', 'Kashiwakura I', 'Yasue H', 'Nakamura T']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Division of Medical Life Sciences, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hirosaki, Aomori 036-8564, Japan. mchiba32@cc.hirosaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/07/04 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2012.787 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2012 May;5(5):1151-7. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2012.787.

Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as dasatinib, eliminate CML progenitor cells, but fail to target the stem cell fraction resulting in persistent disease. In order to achieve a cure for CML in the majority of patients, we need an improved understanding of intracellular signalling dynamics, including the shuttling of BCR-ABL between cytosolic and nuclear compartments. In the past, the instability of BCR-ABL in assays using conventional immunohistochemical techniques has made this difficult and has not allowed for reliable analysis at the single cell level. Here we show how the utilization of rapid on-chip cell fixation within a microfluidic platform provides a means to immunofluorescently analyze the spatiotemporal localization of both BCR-ABL and c-ABL, as well as the linked apoptosis mediator, BCL-XL, in arrays of single CD34+ CML stem/progenitor cells, without cell loss. We demonstrate this proceeds up to 4 times faster than benchtop methods. Our results indicate that whilst both BCR-ABL and c-ABL shuttle from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following dasatinib treatment, the temporal dynamics are not synchronized. The microfluidic platform has the potential to provide insights into the intracellular signalling events in single cells. The ability to examine signalling events and assess BCR-ABL expression/activity in isolated cells in ""real-time"" may help elucidate the characteristics of rare CML stem cell events, which lead to the resistance of CML stem cells to TKIs.","['Faley, Shannon', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Reboud, Julien', 'Cooper, Jonathan M']","['Faley S', 'Copland M', 'Reboud J', 'Cooper JM']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37235, USA. shannon.faley@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/10/18 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c2ib00086e [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2012 Apr;4(4):368-73. doi: 10.1039/c2ib00086e.

Here we show a biochemical mechanism by which bone marrow stromal cells modulate the redox status of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells and promote cellular survival and drug resistance. Primary CLL cells from patients exhibit a limited ability to transport cystine for glutathione (GSH) synthesis owing to a low expression level of Xc-transporter. In contrast, bone marrow stromal cells effectively import cystine and convert it to cysteine, which is then released into the microenvironment for uptake by CLL cells to promote GSH synthesis. The elevated level of GSH enhances leukaemia cell survival and protects them from drug-induced cytotoxicity.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Nd: YAG Laser hyaloidotomy in 11 eyes of 8 patients with pre-macular haemorrhage in acute childhood leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Premacular sub-hyaloid haemorrhage is one of the leading causes of visual disability in children with acute leukemia. Eleven eyes of 8 patients attending Kanti Children Hospital and BP Koirala Lions Centre for Ophthalmic Studies from January 2006 to July 2007 with premacular subhyaloid haemorrhage were included in the study and treated with Nd: YAG Laser. The haemorrhage originated from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 4 cases (6 eyes) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 4 cases (5 eyes). RESULTS: Drainage of premacular sub-hyaloid haemorrhage into the vitreous cavity within 3 months succeeded in 9 eyes out of 11 eyes treated. One eye had a dense clotted haemorrhage and the other had a re-bleed. Overall visual improvement was equal in both AML and ALL cases. No obvious epiretinal membrane, retinal breaks and tractional retinal detachment occurred in any eye. CONCLUSION: Nd: Yag laser hyaloidotomy is a relatively safe, simple and alternative treatment for eyes with a dense premacular sub-hyaloid haemorrhage in acute childhood leukemia. The risks and benefits have to be weighed in randomized clinical trials to establish Nd: YAG hyaloidotomy treatment as a routine procedure in leukemic children.","['Khadka, D', 'Sharma, A K', 'Shrestha, J K', 'Pant, B', 'Pant, S', 'Shrestha, A']","['Khadka D', 'Sharma AK', 'Shrestha JK', 'Pant B', 'Pant S', 'Shrestha A']","['Geta Eye Hospital, Dhanagadi, Nepal. drdeepak123@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Nepal,Nepal J Ophthalmol,Nepalese journal of ophthalmology : a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal of the Nepal Ophthalmic Society : NEPJOPH,101505288,2012/02/22 06:00,2013/02/27 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3126/nepjoph.v4i1.5860 [doi]'],ppublish,Nepal J Ophthalmol. 2012 Jan-Jun;4(1):102-7. doi: 10.3126/nepjoph.v4i1.5860.,['(c) NEPjOPH.'],,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Laser Therapy/*methods', 'Lasers, Solid-State/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Retina/pathology/surgery', 'Retinal Hemorrhage/etiology/pathology/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Visual Acuity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Splice gene mutations were detected in 95 of 221 patients. These mutations were mutually exclusive and less likely to occur in patients with complex cytogenetics or TP53 mutations. SF3B1(mut) patients presented with lower hemoglobin levels, increased WBC and platelet counts, and were more likely to have DNMT3A mutations. SRSF2(mut) patients clustered in RAEB-1 and RAEB-2 subtypes and exhibited pronounced thrombocytopenias. ZRSR2(mut) patients clustered in International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1 and intermediate-2 risk groups, had higher percentages of bone marrow blasts, and more often displayed isolated neutropenias. SRSF2 and ZRSR2 mutations were more common in TET2(mut) patients. U2AF35(mut) patients had an increased prevalence of chromosome 20 deletions and ASXL1 mutations. Multivariate analysis revealed an inferior overall survival and a higher AML transformation rate for the genotype ZRSR2(mut)/TET2(wt) (overall survival: hazard ratio = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-7.7; P = .006; AML transformation: hazard ratio = 3.6; 95% CI, 2-4.2; P = .026). Our results demonstrate that splice gene mutations are among the most frequent molecular aberrations in myelodysplastic syndrome, define distinct clinical phenotypes, and show preferential associations with mutations targeting transcriptional regulation.","['Damm, Frederik', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Gelsi-Boyer, Veronique', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Carbuccia, Nadine', 'Hidalgo-Curtis, Claire', 'Della Valle, Veronique', 'Couronne, Lucile', 'Scourzic, Laurianne', 'Chesnais, Virginie', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Slama, Bohrane', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Schmidt-Tanguy, Aline', 'Stamatoullas-Bastard, Aspasia', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Morgan, Michael A', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Birnbaum, Daniel', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Fontenay, Michaela']","['Damm F', 'Kosmider O', 'Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Renneville A', 'Carbuccia N', 'Hidalgo-Curtis C', 'Della Valle V', 'Couronne L', 'Scourzic L', 'Chesnais V', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Slama B', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Schmidt-Tanguy A', 'Stamatoullas-Bastard A', 'Dreyfus F', 'Prebet T', 'de Botton S', 'Vey N', 'Morgan MA', 'Cross NC', 'Preudhomme C', 'Birnbaum D', 'Bernard OA', 'Fontenay M']","['Institut Gustave Roussy, 39 rue Camille Desmoulins,Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/20 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)48019-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-400994 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Apr 5;119(14):3211-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-400994.

Their activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, mainly by the PI3K-PKB pathway, which controls nuclear export and degradation. We show that FOXO1 is highly expressed in normal germinal center B cells as well as in non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma. In contrast, in 31 of 32 classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cases, Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells were FOXO1 negative. Neoplastic cells of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma were negative in 14 of 20 cases. FOXO1 was down-regulated in cHL cell lines, whereas it was expressed in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines at levels comparable with normal B cells. Ectopic expression of a constitutively active FOXO1 induced apoptosis in cHL cell lines and blocked proliferation, accompanied with cell-cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. We found that, in cHL cell lines, FOXO1 is inactivated by multiple mechanisms, including constitutive activation of AKT/PKB and MAPK/ERK kinases and up-regulation of microRNAs miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183.

The resultant RUNX1/ETO fusion protein is a leukemia-initiating transcription factor that interferes with RUNX1 function. The result of this interference is a block in differentiation and, finally, the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To obtain insights into RUNX1/ETO-dependant alterations of the epigenetic landscape, we measured genome-wide RUNX1- and RUNX1/ETO-bound regions in t(8;21) cells and assessed to what extent the effects of RUNX1/ETO on the epigenome depend on its continued expression in established leukemic cells. To this end, we determined dynamic alterations of histone acetylation, RNA Polymerase II binding and RUNX1 occupancy in the presence or absence of RUNX1/ETO using a knockdown approach. Combined global assessments of chromatin accessibility and kinetic gene expression data show that RUNX1/ETO controls the expression of important regulators of hematopoietic differentiation and self-renewal. We show that selective removal of RUNX1/ETO leads to a widespread reversal of epigenetic reprogramming and a genome-wide redistribution of RUNX1 binding, resulting in the inhibition of leukemic proliferation and self-renewal, and the induction of differentiation. This demonstrates that RUNX1/ETO represents a pivotal therapeutic target in AML.","['Ptasinska, A', 'Assi, S A', 'Mannari, D', 'James, S R', 'Williamson, D', 'Dunne, J', 'Hoogenkamp, M', 'Wu, M', 'Care, M', 'McNeill, H', 'Cauchy, P', 'Cullen, M', 'Tooze, R M', 'Tenen, D G', 'Young, B D', 'Cockerill, P N', 'Westhead, D R', 'Heidenreich, O', 'Bonifer, C']","['Ptasinska A', 'Assi SA', 'Mannari D', 'James SR', 'Williamson D', 'Dunne J', 'Hoogenkamp M', 'Wu M', 'Care M', 'McNeill H', 'Cauchy P', 'Cullen M', 'Tooze RM', 'Tenen DG', 'Young BD', 'Cockerill PN', 'Westhead DR', 'Heidenreich O', 'Bonifer C']","['Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201249 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.49 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Aug;26(8):1829-41. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.49.

Concomitant microRNA and gene expression profiling in purified CLL cells (n=17) expressing either unmutated (UM) or mutated (M) IGHV genes selected microRNAs from the miR-17 approximately 92 family as significantly upregulated and in part responsible for modifications in the gene expression profile of UM CLL cells stimulated with the TLR9 agonist CpG. Notably, the stable and sustained upregulation of miR-17 approximately 92 microRNAs by CpG was preceded by a transient induction of the proto-oncogene MYC. The enforced expression of miR-17, a major member from this family, reduced the expression of the tumor suppressor genes E2F5, TP53INP1, TRIM8 and ZBTB4, and protected cells from serum-free-induced apoptosis (P </= 0.05). Consistently, transfection with miR-17 approximately 92 family antagomiRs reduced Bromo-deoxy-uridine incorporation in CpG-stimulated UM CLL cells. Finally, miR-17 expression levels, evaluated in 83 CLL samples, were significantly higher in UM (P=0.03) and ZAP-70(high) (P=0.02) cases. Altogether, these data reveal a role for microRNAs of the miR-17 approximately 92 family in regulating pro-survival and growth-promoting responses of CLL cells to TLR9 triggering.

A total of 356 consecutive paediatric ALL stem cell transplants performed between 1988 and 2007 were reviewed; 80 of them were performed following the introduction of HR HLA class I and class II matching to the transplant programme in 2002. Comparisons of matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant outcomes before and after this period were made. Matching at the HR level for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 (HR-MUD) correlated with a greater than 25% improvement in 2- and 5-year OS in paediatric ALL patients transplanted with MUDs (P=0.009, P=0.005, respectively). Two-year OS for contemporaneous HLA-matched sibling transplants (80.8%) and HR-MUD transplants (78.8%) was equivalent. At 6%, non-relapse mortality (NRM) in MUD transplants since 2002 was significantly reduced compared with previous epochs. Changes in treatment and epoch-dependent improvements in outcome were reviewed for possible confounders to the influence of HR typing using univariate and multivariate analysis.","['Harvey, J', 'Green, A', 'Cornish, J', 'Steward, C', 'Cummins, M', 'Keen, L', 'Culliford, S', 'Poles, A', 'Hunt, L', 'Breslin, P', 'Li, Y', 'Moppett, J']","['Harvey J', 'Green A', 'Cornish J', 'Steward C', 'Cummins M', 'Keen L', 'Culliford S', 'Poles A', 'Hunt L', 'Breslin P', 'Li Y', 'Moppett J']","['Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Department, NHS Blood and Transplant, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,2012/02/22 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt20128 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2012.8 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 Oct;47(10):1294-300. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2012.8.

A viral aetiology has been proposed, but to date no virus has been conclusively demonstrated to be involved. Recently, two new viruses, namely Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) and xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV) have been identified and implicated in the pathogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and familial form of prostate cancer, respectively. METHODS: We examined 204 samples from 58 different cases of breast cancer for presence of MCV or XMRV by PCR. Samples consisted of both malignant and non-malignant tissues. Additionally, we included 6 cases of MCC and 12 cases of prostate cancer as potential controls for MCV and XMRV, respectively. RESULTS: All of the breast cancer samples examined were negative for both MCV and XMRV. However, 4/6 MCC and 2/12 prostate cancer samples were found to be positive for MCV and XMRV, respectively. Sequence analysis of the amplified products confirmed that these sequences belonged to MCV and XMRV. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is no evidence for the involvement of MCV or XMRV in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. What role these viruses have in the pathogenesis of MCC and prostate carcinomas remains to be demonstrated.","['Khan, G', 'Philip, P S', 'Naase, M', 'Al Zarouni, K M I']","['Khan G', 'Philip PS', 'Naase M', 'Al Zarouni KM']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. g_khan@uaeu.ac.ae']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc201251 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.51 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 Mar 13;106(6):1166-70. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.51.

By utilizing sensitive, non-invasive imaging guidance, detection of early leukemic infiltration and the extent of residual tumor burden after targeted therapy can be expedited, leading to more efficient treatment planning. We demonstrated marked survival benefit and therapeutic efficacy of a new-generation vascular disrupting agent, combretastatin-A1-diphosphate (OXi4503), using reporter gene-imaging technologies and mice systemically administered luc+ and GFP+ human leukemic cells (LCs). Before treatment, homing of double-transduced cells was serially monitored and whole-body cellular distributions were mapped using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Imaging findings strongly correlated with quantitative GFP expression levels in solid organs/tissues, suggesting that the measured BLI signal provides a highly sensitive and reliable biomarker of tumor tissue burden in systemic leukemic models. Such optical technologies can thereby serve as robust non-invasive imaging tools for preclinical drug discovery and for rapidly screening promising therapeutic agents to establish potency, treatment efficacy and survival advantage. We further show that GFP+ HL-60 cells reside in close proximity to VE-cadherin- and CD31-expressing endothelial cells, suggesting that the perivascular niche may have a critical role in the maintenance and survival of LCs.","['Benezra, M', 'Phillips, E', 'Tilki, D', 'Ding, B-S', 'Butler, J', 'Dobrenkov, K', 'Siim, B', 'Chaplin, D', 'Rafii, S', 'Rabbany, S', 'Bradbury, M S']","['Benezra M', 'Phillips E', 'Tilki D', 'Ding BS', 'Butler J', 'Dobrenkov K', 'Siim B', 'Chaplin D', 'Rafii S', 'Rabbany S', 'Bradbury MS']","['Department of Radiology, Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201248 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.48 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Aug;26(8):1771-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.48.

Hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 is dynamically regulated by upstream regulatory element (URE), whose deletion causes downregulation of PU.1 leading to AML in mouse. In this study a significant group of the high-risk MDS patients, as well as MDS cell lines, displayed downregulation of PU.1 expression within CD34+ cells, which was associated with DNA methylation of the URE. AZA treatment in vitro significantly demethylated URE, leading to upregulation of PU.1 followed by derepression of its transcriptional targets and onset of myeloid differentiation. Addition of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs; granulocyte-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF and macrophage-CSF) modulated AZA-mediated effects on reprogramming of histone modifications at the URE and cell differentiation outcome. Our data collectively support the importance of modifying the URE chromatin structure as a regulatory mechanism of AZA-mediated activation of PU.1 and induction of the myeloid program in MDS.","['Curik, N', 'Burda, P', 'Vargova, K', 'Pospisil, V', 'Belickova, M', 'Vlckova, P', 'Savvulidi, F', 'Necas, E', 'Hajkova, H', 'Haskovec, C', 'Cermak, J', 'Krivjanska, M', 'Trneny, M', 'Laslo, P', 'Jonasova, A', 'Stopka, T']","['Curik N', 'Burda P', 'Vargova K', 'Pospisil V', 'Belickova M', 'Vlckova P', 'Savvulidi F', 'Necas E', 'Hajkova H', 'Haskovec C', 'Cermak J', 'Krivjanska M', 'Trneny M', 'Laslo P', 'Jonasova A', 'Stopka T']","['First Faculty of Medicine, Institute of pathologic physiology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201247 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.47 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Aug;26(8):1804-11. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.47.

Transplantation strategies face many difficulties including low viability, lack of control of stem-cell fate, and low levels of cell engraftment after transplantation. An alternative strategy for CNS repair without transplantation is using endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) and precursor cells. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a pleiotropic cytokine of mesenchymal origin, exerts a strong chemoattractive effect on stem cells. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a key regulator for stem-cell proliferation, mobilization, and fate choices, is currently being characterized for endogenous NSC manipulation for brain regeneration. In this study, HGF and LIF have been loaded into hydrogels and degradable nanoparticles, respectively, for sustained, long-term, localized delivery. We examine the use of HGF-loaded hydrogels and LIF-loaded nanoparticles for manipulating migration and mobilization of human NSCs in vitro. The combination of LIF-loaded nanoparticles and HGF-loaded hydrogels significantly mobilized hNSCs and promoted their migration in vitro. Studies are in progress to evaluate endogenous NSC mobilization and migration in vivo with simultaneous, controlled delivery of LIF at the natural reservoir of endogenous NSCs and HGF at the injury or disease site for in situ tissue regeneration.","['Li, Xiaowei', 'Liu, Xiaoyan', 'Zhao, Wen', 'Wen, Xuejun', 'Zhang, Ning']","['Li X', 'Liu X', 'Zhao W', 'Wen X', 'Zhang N']","['Clemson-MUSC Bioengineering Program, Department of Bioengineering, Clemson University, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Acta Biomater,Acta biomaterialia,101233144,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1742-7061(12)00061-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.actbio.2012.02.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biomater. 2012 Jul;8(6):2087-95. doi: 10.1016/j.actbio.2012.02.008.

It was used in the 18th century in treating hematopoietic malignancies, discarded in 1950s in favor of chemotherapeutic agents (busulphan and others), and was revived in the 1970s due to its dramatic efficacy on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) driven by the t(15;17) translocation-generated PML-RARalpha fusion. Arsenic represents the most potent single agent for APL, and achieves a five-year overall survival of 90% in APL patients when combined with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy (daunorubicin and cytarabine), turning this disease from highly fatal to highly curable. Arsenic triggers sumoylation/ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of PML-RARalpha via directly binding to the C3HC4 zinc finger motif in the RBCC domain of the PML moiety and induction of its homodimerization/multimerization and interaction with the SUMO E2 conjugase Ubc9. Because of its multiplicity of targets and complex mechanisms of action, arsenic is widely tested in combination with other agents in a variety of malignancies. Other arsenic containing recipes including oral formulations and organic arsenicals are being developed and tested, and progress in these areas will definitely expand the use of arsenicals in other malignant diseases.","['Liu, Jian-Xiang', 'Zhou, Guang-Biao', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu']","['Liu JX', 'Zhou GB', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dong Chuan Road, Shanghai 200240, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Chem Biol,Current opinion in chemical biology,9811312,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/07/26 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1367-5931(12)00007-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.01.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2012 Apr;16(1-2):92-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.01.015.

However, its antitumor ability toward hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been studied. In this study, we demonstrated that DHA significantly inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo via inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The induction of p21 and the inhibition of cyclin B and CDC25C contributed to DHA-induced G2/M arrest. DHA-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases, and DNA fragmentation. Activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, but not caspase 8, was detected in DHA-treated cells. Attenuation of apoptosis in cells pretreated with Z-VAD-FMK suggested the involvement of caspase cascade. Furthermore, p53 facilitated apoptosis caused by DHA. Bcl-2 family proteins were also responsible for DHA-induced apoptosis. DHA exposure decreased Mcl-1 expression but increased the levels of Noxa and active Bak. Bak was released from the Mcl-1/Bak complex due to the decline of Mcl-1. Further study revealed that Mcl-1 was rapidly degraded in DHA-treated cells and that DHA-induced apoptosis was largely inhibited by overexpression of Mcl-1 or RNAi-mediated decrease of Bak and Noxa. In a HCC-xenograft mouse model, the intraperitoneal injection of DHA resulted in significant inhibition of HCC xenograft tumors. Taken together, our data, for the first time, demonstrate the potential antitumor activity of DHA in HCC.","['Zhang, Chris Zhiyi', 'Zhang, Haitao', 'Yun, Jingping', 'Chen, George Gong', 'Lai, Paul Bo San']","['Zhang CZ', 'Zhang H', 'Yun J', 'Chen GG', 'Lai PB']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China; Department of Pathology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China; Department of Surgery, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(12)00104-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2012.02.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 May 1;83(9):1278-89. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2012.02.002.

CASE REPORT: We report a 62-year-old woman admitted to an intensive care unit for an essential thrombocytemia associated with bone marrow necrosis complicated by septic shock and progressive multi-organ failure. To our knowledge, this is the second case reported in the literature. The clinical presentation of bone marrow necrosis includes non-specific symptoms such as fever, bone pain and sometimes a clinically significant medullar insufficiency syndrome. Biology can reveal cytopenias, elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase serum levels. The diagnosis is confirmed by bone marrow trephine biopsy. Bone marrow necrosis is classified as extensive if more than 50% of the bone marrow biopsy show necrosis. Haematological malignancies (particularly leukaemia), and solid malignant tumours (particularly gastro-intestinal or lung cancers) represent up to 90% of aetiologies and must be actively researched. Also, sickle cell disease and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome must also be investigated. Essential thrombocytemia remains an exceptional cause of bone marrow necrosis. CONCLUSION: Overall the prognosis of bone marrow necrosis is poor unless appropriate and intensive treatment, especially for sickle cell disease in which complete medullar regeneration has been observed.","['Riviere, E', 'Pillot, J', 'Saghi, T', 'Castaing, Y', 'Pellegrin, J L', 'Gruson, D', 'Boyer, A']","['Riviere E', 'Pillot J', 'Saghi T', 'Castaing Y', 'Pellegrin JL', 'Gruson D', 'Boyer A']","['Service de medecine interne et maladies infectieuses, hopital Haut-Leveque, avenue Magellan, 33600 Pessac, France. e.riviere@neuf.fr']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0248-8663(12)00016-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.revmed.2012.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 2012 May;33(5):279-83. doi: 10.1016/j.revmed.2012.01.011.

The interrelation and the functional interplay of these two different proteins are not defined yet. We have shown here that the tumour suppressor TIS21 negatively regulated c-Myc expression during all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation that accelerated differentiation and reduced proliferation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) HL-60 cells. TIS21 downregulated c-Myc mRNA and additionally decreased c-Myc protein stability by increasing its phosphorylation at S(62) and T(58) residues via activation of Erk1/2 and inhibition of PI3K/Akt along with the subsequent activation of GSK-3beta in response to ATRA treatment. HL-60 cells treated with GSK-3beta or proteosome inhibitors revealed marked accumulation of c-Myc both in the presence and absence of ATRA plus TIS21, confirming ATRA plus TIS21 mediated c-Myc phosphorylation and its consequent degradation in proteosome.

This capacity for discrimination creates an opportunity to use oncolytic viruses as ex vivo purging agents of autologous hematopoietic cell grafts in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, the mechanisms by which oncolytic viruses select malignant hematopoietic cells are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how MYXV specifically targets human AML cells. MYXV prevented chloroma formation and bone marrow engraftment of two human AML cell lines, KG-1 and THP-1. The reduction in human leukemia engraftment after ex vivo MYXV treatment was dose-dependent and required a minimum MOI of 3. Both AML cell lines demonstrated MYXV binding to leukemia cell membranes following co-incubation: however, evidence of productive MYXV infection was observed only in THP-1 cells. This observation, that KG-1 can be targeted in vivo even in the absence of in vitro permissive viral infection, contrasts with the current understanding of oncolytic virotherapy, which assumes that virus infection and productive replication is a requirement. Preventing MYXV binding to AML cells with heparin abrogated the purging capacity of MYXV, indicating that binding of infectious virus particles is a necessary step for effective viral oncolysis. Our results challenge the current dogma of oncolytic virotherapy and show that in vitro permissiveness to an oncolytic virus is not necessarily an accurate predictor of oncolytic potency in vivo.","['Madlambayan, Gerard J', 'Bartee, Eric', 'Kim, Manbok', 'Rahman, Masmudur M', 'Meacham, Amy', 'Scott, Edward W', 'McFadden, Grant', 'Cogle, Christopher R']","['Madlambayan GJ', 'Bartee E', 'Kim M', 'Rahman MM', 'Meacham A', 'Scott EW', 'McFadden G', 'Cogle CR']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00039-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.01.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 May;36(5):619-24. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.01.020.

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tokyo Medical University. PATIENT(S): Subjects comprised 41 patients in the abnormal uterine cavity group who underwent resection of a uterine submucosal myoma or an endometrial polyp by transcervical resectoscopy (TCR) and 18 patients in the control group who underwent laparoscopic surgery. INTERVENTION(S): In the abnormal uterine cavity group, endometrial tissue specimens were obtained before resection under hysteroscopy. In the control group, endometrial tissue specimens were obtained by curettage at the time of laparoscopic surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT(S): We divided the patients into four groups according to menstrual cycle and measured the endometrial expression of LIF, IL-11, and IL-6ST/gp130 with the use of quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULT(S): Significant increases in LIF and IL-11 mRNA expression were recognized during the midsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle in the control group. However, no difference in IL-6ST/gp130 mRNA expression was observed in any phase during the menstrual cycle in either group. In terms of LIF and IL-11 mRNA expression at the midsecretory phase, the abnormal uterine cavity group showed a significantly decreased LIF mRNA expression compared with the control group. CONCLUSION(S): LIF mRNA expression was significantly decreased in abnormal uterine cavities during the midsecretory phase, indicating that endometrial cavity defects are a possible cause of poor reproductive outcomes.","['Hasegawa, Ei', 'Ito, Hiroe', 'Hasegawa, Fumiko', 'Hatano, Keiko', 'Kazuka, Masahiro', 'Usuda, Saburo', 'Isaka, Keiichi']","['Hasegawa E', 'Ito H', 'Hasegawa F', 'Hatano K', 'Kazuka M', 'Usuda S', 'Isaka K']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/31 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0015-0282(12)00172-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.01.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2012 Apr;97(4):953-8. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.01.113.

Classification of HLA-DPB1 mismatches based on T-cell-epitope groups could identify mismatches that might be tolerated (permissive) and those that would increase risks (non-permissive) after transplantation. We did a retrospective study to compare outcomes between permissive and non-permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches in unrelated-donor haemopoietic-cell transplantation. METHODS: HLA and clinical data for unrelated-donor [corrected] transplantations submitted to the International Histocompatibility Working Group in haemopoietic-cell transplantation were analysed retrospectively. HLA-DPB1 T-cell-epitope groups were assigned according to a functional algorithm based on alloreactive T-cell crossreactivity patterns. Recipients and unrelated donors matching status were classified as HLA-DPB1 match, non-permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch (those with mismatched T-cell-epitope groups), or permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch (those with matched T-cell-epitope groups). The clinical outcomes assessed were overall mortality, non-relapse mortality, relapse, and severe (grade 3-4) acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). FINDINGS: Of 8539 transplantations, 5428 (64%) were matched for ten of ten HLA alleles (HLA 10/10 matched) and 3111 (36%) for nine of ten alleles (HLA 9/10 matched). Of the group overall, 1719 (20%) were HLA-DPB1 matches, 2670 (31%) non-permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches, and 4150 (49%) permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches. In HLA 10/10-matched transplantations, non-permissive mismatches were associated with a significantly increased risk of overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.25; p=0.002), non-relapse mortality (1.28, 1.14-1.42; p<0.0001), and severe aGvHD (odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.54; p=0.001), but not relapse (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.02; p=0.10), compared with permissive mismatches. There were significant differences between permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches and HLA-DPB1 matches in terms of non-relapse mortality (0.86, 0.75-0.98; p=0.03) and relapse (1.34, 1.17-1.54; p<0.0001), but not for overall mortality (0.96, 0.87-1.06; p=0.40) or aGvHD (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69-1.03; p=0.09). In the HLA 9/10 matched population, non-permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches also increased the risk of overall mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.22; p=0.06), non-relapse mortality (1.19, 1.05-1.36; p=0.007), and severe aGvHD (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.13-1.66; p=0.002) compared with permissive mismatches, but the risk of relapse was the same in both groups (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78-1.11; p=0.44). Outcomes for HLA 10/10-matched transplantations with non-permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches did not differ substantially from those for HLA 9/10-matched transplantations with permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches or HLA-DPB1 matches. INTERPRETATION: T-cell-epitope matching defines permissive and non-permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches. Avoidance of an unrelated donor with a non-permissive T-cell-epitope mismatch at HLA-DPB1 might provide a practical clinical strategy for lowering the risks of mortality after unrelated-donor haemopoietic-cell transplantation.

JIH-3 cells were maintained without any cytokines for 27 months. The JIH-3 cell line showed typical myelomonocytic morphological features. Additionally, it mainly expressed myeloid and monocytic markers (CD13, CD14, CD11b, CD15 and CD33), although it also expressed other antigens such as the markers of T and B lymphocytic lineage as well as stem cell, progenitor cell, and natural killer cell-related antigens (CD4, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD22, CD34, CD38, HLADR, CD16/CD56 and CD56); the expression of these markers, suggested that this cell line was in the early stage of myelomonocytic differentiation. Cytogenetic analysis initially showed a karyotype of 46, XY, del(7) (p1?3p2?2). During the passage period, the cells with this karyotype gradually decreased and were replaced by cells with a 45,XY,dic(4;7)(p11;p11),del(15)(q2?2) karyotype. Chromosome painting showed a deletion in the short arm of chromosome 7 for del(7)(p1?3p2?2) and der(4;7)(p11;p11). The latter had larger deleted segment than the former. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed the dicentric nature of der(4;7), and Multiplex FISH (M-FISH) confirmed that der(4;7) was an unbalanced translocation. A deletion involving the 7p region on dic(4;7)(p11;p11) harbors many genes, including CDC2L5, C7ORF11, C7ORF10 and INHBA. Haploinsufficiency of the genes on 4p, 7p and 15q caused by deletions of 4p, 7p and 15q2?2 that resulted from dic(4;7)(p11;p11) and del(15)(q2?2) may play important roles in leukemogenesis and in the establishment of the JIH-3 cell line. JIH-3 cells did not express multidrug resistance (MDR)-related genes and apoptosis-related genes such as MDR1, multidrug resistance-related protein, lung resistance protein, BCL-2, Bax, GS-pi or Fax, only P21 expression was detected, which probably leads the MDR indirectly through inhibition of the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). JIH-3 cells had tumorigenic capacity in nude mice. In conclusion, JIH-3 is a new acute myelomonocytic leukemia cell line. It is from a well-characterized background and provides a new useful tool for the study of leukemia patients with a 7p deletion.","['Pan, Jinlan', 'Xue, Yongquan', 'Chen, Suning', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Wu, Chunxiao', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Wang, Qian', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Bai, Suxiao', 'Wu, Yafang', 'Wang, Yong', 'Shen, Juan']","['Pan J', 'Xue Y', 'Chen S', 'Qiu H', 'Wu C', 'Jiang H', 'Wang Q', 'Zhang J', 'Bai S', 'Wu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Shen J']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Suzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/08/03 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00031-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.01.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Jul;36(7):889-94. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.01.012.

It will cover the signaling pathways that are dysregulated by the oncogenic tyrosine kinase, BCR-ABL1, which both defines and drives the disease, and the barriers to disease control. These will include the mechanisms that underlie drug resistance, as well as the features of CML that prevent its cure by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the second section, we will cover the proteins and pathways that lead to the transformation of early chronic-phase CML to the more advanced blast phase of the disease. Here, we will outline the key pathophysiologic differences between the chronic and the blast phase, the mechanisms that contribute to these differences, and how these might be therapeutically targeted in patients. In the final section, we will summarize the major lessons learnt from the CML clinic. We will focus on how these observations have impacted our understanding of the therapeutic potential of modulating protein phosphorylation in human diseases and areas in which future research in CML pathophysiology may be important.","['Juan, Wen Chun', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Juan WC', 'Ong ST']","['Program in Cancer and Stem Cell Biology, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,Progress in molecular biology and translational science,101498165,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/07/25 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-396456-4.00007-9 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-396456-4.00007-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci. 2012;106:107-42. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-396456-4.00007-9.,['Copyright A(c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We describe here a patient who developed VZV meningoencephalitis 2 years after human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated HSCT for acute myeloblastic leukemia. She developed chronic graft-versus-host disease, and cyclosporine (CSA) was continued until 17 months after HSCT. Low-dose acyclovir (ACV) at 200 mg/day was administered to prevent the reactivation of VZV from day -7 to the termination of CSA. At 22 months, she suddenly developed fever, loss of consciousness, and seizure, with generalized skin rash. A high level of VZV DNA was detected in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). She was diagnosed to have VZV meningoencephalitis. Intravenous ACV at 30 mg/kg/day was given for 2 months. Although loss of consciousness was quickly resolved, some neurologic symptoms persisted. She did not have any known risk factors for VZV reactivation. Therefore, we should keep in mind that any HSCT recipient may develop VZV meningoencephalitis, and examination of CSF for VZV infection with an empiric administration of ACV may be recommended for HSCT recipients with central nervous system symptoms, even in the absence of skin manifestations.","['Suzuki, J', 'Ashizawa, M', 'Okuda, S', 'Wada, H', 'Sakamoto, K', 'Terasako, K', 'Sato, M', 'Kimura, S-I', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Nakasone, H', 'Kako, S', 'Yamazaki, R', 'Oshima, K', 'Nishida, J', 'Kanda, Y']","['Suzuki J', 'Ashizawa M', 'Okuda S', 'Wada H', 'Sakamoto K', 'Terasako K', 'Sato M', 'Kimura SI', 'Kikuchi M', 'Nakasone H', 'Kako S', 'Yamazaki R', 'Oshima K', 'Nishida J', 'Kanda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,2012/02/22 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1399-3062.2012.00720.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2012 Aug;14(4):E7-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3062.2012.00720.x.

Thus, strategies targeting LSC are required to achieve cure. We show that the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 is overexpressed in human CML LSC. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 or SIRT1 knockdown increased apoptosis in LSC of chronic phase and blast crisis CML and reduced their growth in vitro and in vivo. SIRT1 effects were enhanced in combination with the BCR-ABL TKI imatinib. SIRT1 inhibition increased p53 acetylation and transcriptional activity in CML progenitors, and the inhibitory effects of SIRT1 targeting on CML cells depended on p53 expression and acetylation.

In the present study, we determined the accuracy of DNA synthesis of the reverse transcriptases (RTs) of XMRV and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) using a combination of pre-steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation and an M13mp2-based forward mutation assay. The results obtained were compared with those previously reported for the HIV type 1 BH10 strain (HIV-1(BH10)) RT. MoMLV and XMRV RTs were 13.9 and 110 times less efficient [as determined by the catalytic rate constant of the nucleotide incorporation reaction ((pol))/equilibrium constant (K(d))] than the HIV-1(BH10) RT in incorporating correct nucleotides. Misinsertion and mispair extension kinetic studies demonstrated that MoMLV RT was more accurate than the HIV-1(BH10) RT. In comparison with the MoMLV RT, the XMRV RT showed decreased mispair extension fidelity and was less faithful when misincorporating C or A opposite A. However, the XMRV RT showed stronger selectivity against G in misinsertion fidelity assays. Forward mutation assays revealed that XMRV and MoMLV RTs had similar accuracy of DNA-dependent DNA synthesis, but were > 13 times more faithful than the HIV-1(BH10) enzyme. The mutational spectra of XMRV and MoMLV RTs were similar in having a relatively higher proportion of frameshifts and transversions compared with the HIV-1(BH10) RT.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of second malignant neoplasms in childhood cancer survivors in a tertiary paediatric oncology centre in Hong Kong, China. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with childhood cancer treated in Children's Cancer Centre in Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, China between May 1984 and June 2009. Case records of patients who developed second malignant neoplasms were reviewed. RESULTS: Totally 1374 new cases aged less than 21-year old were treated in our centre in this 25-year study period. Twelve cases developed second malignant neoplasms with 10-year and 20-year cumulative incidence of 1.3% (95% confidence interval 0.3% - 2.3%) and 2.9% (95% confidence interval 1.1% - 4.7%) respectively. Another 4 cases were referred to us from other centres for the management of second malignant neoplasms. In this cohort of 16 children with second malignant neoplasms, the most frequent second malignant neoplasms were acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 6) and central nervous system tumor (n = 4). Median interval between diagnosis of primary and second malignant neoplasms was 7.4 years (range 2.1 - 13.3 years). Eight patients developed second solid tumor within the previous irradiated field. Radiotherapy significantly increased the risk of development of second solid tumor in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P = 0.027). Seven out of 16 patients who developed second malignant neoplasms had a family history of cancer among the first or second-degree relatives. Nine patients died of progression of second malignant neoplasms, mainly resulted from second central nervous system tumor and osteosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative incidence of second cancer in our centre was comparable to western countries. Radiotherapy was associated with second solid tumour among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients who developed second brain tumor and osteosarcoma had a poor outcome.","['Sun, Wai-Fun', 'Cheng, Frankie Wai-Tsoi', 'Lee, Vincent', 'Leung, Wing-Kwan', 'Shing, Ming-Kong', 'Yuen, Patrick Man-Pan', 'Li, Chi-Kong']","['Sun WF', 'Cheng FW', 'Lee V', 'Leung WK', 'Shing MK', 'Yuen PM', 'Li CK']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2011 Nov;124(22):3686-92.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the possible role of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in predicting CNSL. METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2010, 380 children were enrolled in this study at Shijitan Hospital, China. These children were from 2 to 16 years old, and the median age was 6.5 years. They were divided into a CNSL group (7 cases), a leukemia group (307 cases), a non-leukemia group (26 cases) and a healthy group (40 children). CSF specimens were obtained from conventional lumbar punctured, then centrifuged and supernatants preserved for H(2)S detection. Leukemic cells precipitates from CSF were found in three cases, the hCSE and hCBS mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and H(2)S levels in serum were also measured. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) were used to assess the predictive diagnosis role of CSF H(2)S in children with ALL and CNSL. RESULTS: The serum H(2)S contents of the CNSL and leukemia groups were (96.98 +/- 15.77) micromol/L and (93.35 +/- 17.16) micromol/L respectively, much higher than those of healthy, (44.29 +/- 2.15) micromol/L, and non-leukemia, (46.32 +/- 6.54) micromol/L, groups (P < 0.01). Compared with the leukemia group, CSF H(2)S content of the CNSL group was significantly high (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, in contrast to the non-leukemia group, CSF H(2)S contents of the CNSL and leukemia groups were both significantly increased (P < 0.01). In addition, leukemic cells from CSF precipitations could express CBS and CSE mRNA. Furthermore, the ROC analysis showed the UAC was 0.929 (95%CI: 0.857 - 1.000), and the optimum cut-off value of CSF H(2)S was 12.08 micro mol/L, and the sensitivity and specificity were 83.3% and 97.2% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CSF H(2)S contents were significantly increased in children with CNSL. After treatment, H(2)S contents were decreased subsequently. Therefore, we speculated that H(2)S levels of CSF would predict CNSL in ALL children.","['DU, Shu-Xu', 'Xiao, Jiang', 'Guan, Feng', 'Sun, Li-Ming', 'Wu, Wan-Shui', 'Tang, Hong', 'DU, Jun-Bao', 'Tang, Chao-Shu', 'Jin, Hong-Fang']","['DU SX', 'Xiao J', 'Guan F', 'Sun LM', 'Wu WS', 'Tang H', 'DU JB', 'Tang CS', 'Jin HF']","['Department of Pediatrics, Capital Medical College Shijitan Hospital, Beijing 100038, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/27 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2011 Nov;124(21):3450-4.,,,"['EC 4.- (Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.1.22 (Cystathionine beta-Synthase)', 'EC 4.4.1.8 (cystathionine beta-lyase)', 'YY9FVM7NSN (Hydrogen Sulfide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Sulfide/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Leukemia/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Lyases/genetics', 'Male']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Clinical data of 60 DLBCL patients treated in our hospital from 2008.1 to 2010.1 were collected. The expression levels of Cdc7 and MCM2 in peripheral blood and bone marrow were determined by real-time PCR. A statistical analysis was carried out to evaluate their association with prognosis in DLBCL patients. RESULTS: The 2-year survival rate of patients with high expression of peripheral blood Cdc7 was 38.3% and those with low expression 65.4% (P = 0.001). The 2-year survival rate of patients with high expression of bone marrow Cdc7 was 37.2% and those with low expression was 75.5% (P = 0.032). The 2-year survival rate of patients with high expression of MCM2 in peripheral blood was 44.0% and those with low expression was 68.2% (P = 0.025). The 2-year survival rate of patients with high expression of MCM2 in bone marrow was 39.0% and those with low expression was 63.4% (P = 0.007). A poor disease specific survival was observed in DLBCL patients with high level expression of Cdc7 and MCM2. CONCLUSIONS: Cdc7 and MCM2 expression can be used to assess tumor proliferation and may be useful as an additional marker in combination with conventional markers in prediction of the outcome of DLBCL patients. Moreover, the Cdc7 and MCM2 signal pathway might be useful as a new approach in the treatment of refractory DLBCL lymphoma patients.","['Hou, Yun', 'Wang, Hua-qing', 'Fu, Kai', 'Zhang, Hui-lai', 'Qian, Zheng-zi', 'Qiu, Li-hua', 'Li, Wei', 'Zhou, Shi-yong', 'Li, Lan-fang', 'Hao, Xi-shan']","['Hou Y', 'Wang HQ', 'Fu K', 'Zhang HL', 'Qian ZZ', 'Qiu LH', 'Li W', 'Zhou SY', 'Li LF', 'Hao XS']","['Cancer Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2011 Dec;33(12):911-5.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (CDC7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (MCM2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins/*blood', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*blood', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2009, 67 newly diagnosed ALL children and adolescents over 10 years of age were enrolled in protocol of ALL-2005. All of the clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed. The statistics was done by SPSS 13.0. RESULTS: There were 40 males (59.7%) and 27 females (40.3%). The mean age at diagnosis was 12.3 +/- 1.7 (10.0 to 17.8) years with median age of 12.2 years. Of 67 patients, 48 were in medium risk group, and 19 in high risk group. During induction therapy, 83.6% and 86.6% patients had good response to prednisone and bone marrow blasts </= 5% at day 19, respectively. The overall hematologic response rate in these 67 patients was 88.1% (59) in complete remission (CR) after induction therapy, 15 patients relapsed with mean continuous CR period of (14.9 +/- 9.9) months. The five-year event-free survivals (EFS) and overall survivals (OS) were (64.4 +/- 6.3)% and (74.1 +/- 6.1)%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, elevated serum ferritin, bcr-abl translocation, poor response to prednisone, high bone marrow blasts at day 19 or after induction therapy, and high minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy increased risk for recurrence. Multivariate analysis indicated that high MRD after induction therapy was associated with recurrence (RR = 2.20, 95%CI 1.26 - 3.84, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Survival has improved for children and adolescents with ALL by ALL-2005 protocol.

METHODS: The clinical data of 117 newly diagnosed adults with Ph(+)ALL in our hospital between January 1995 and December 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. And their prognoses were followed up. RESULTS: There were 117(16.1%) of 727 aALL patients diagnosed as Ph(+)aALL. Among the 117 cases, 64.1% patients were classified as pre-B immunophenotype and 31.3% as common B immunophenotype, 37.5% patients with co-expression of myeloid antigens (CD13 or CD33), and 98.4% patients with positive CD34. The complete remission (CR) rate after 1 or 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy was 62.2% in Ph(+)aALL group versus 82% in Ph(-)aALL group (P = 0.000). The median disease-free survival time of Ph(+) group was 6 months and the median survival time was 9 months. Sole karyotype abnormality subgroup t(9;22) accounted for 53% of all Ph(+)aALL patients and additional karyotype abnormality subgroup, t(9;22) plus other chromosome variation, accounted for 47%. Patients in sole karyotype abnormality subgroup had slightly lower CR rate (59.6% vs 62.5%, P = 0.768), longer median survival time (7 months vs 4 months, P = 0.158), and higher 3-year overall survival rate (27.3% vs 14.4%, P = 0.271). For the myeloid antigen co-expressed patients and the only lymphocytic antigen expressed ones, CR rate was 56.0% and 61.5% (P = 0.750), the median survival time was 5 months and 4 months (P = 0.182), and the 3-year overall survival rate was 16.0% and 15.0% (P = 0.354), respectively. In the imatinib plus combination chemotherapy treatment group, 81.3% patients achieved CR, compared with that of 58.3% in patients treated with only traditional combination chemotherapy (P = 0.083). The median survival time was 9.5 months and 6 months (P = 0.003) in these two subgroup, and 3-year overall survival rate was 52.2% and 10.3% (P = 0.029), respectively. For the patients receiving allo-HSCT after CR and that receiving traditional consolidation chemotherapy, the median survival time was 15 months and 6 months (P = 0.000), and the 3-year overall survival rate was 62.0% and 10.3% (P = 0.000), respectively. For the patients receiving imatinib as consolidation-maintenance treatment and that receiving allo-HSCT, the median survival time was 12 months and 15 months (P = 0.300), and the 3-year overall survival rate was 64.7% and 62% (P = 0.505), respectively. CONCLUSION: Of all adult ALL patients, the Ph(+) subgroup accounted for about 16.1%, which have unfavorable prognosis such as lower CR rate and shorter survival duration under traditional chemotherapy. Neither additional chromosome abnormalities to t(9;22) nor co-expression of myeloid antigen had negative effect on CR rate and survival duration. Addition of imatinib to the therapy was beneficial to improve the CR rate and survival duration. Either receiving imatinib as consolidation-maintenance treatment or allo-HSCT after complete remission can improve long-term survival rate of Ph(+) adult ALL group significantly.","['Zhang, Yue-feng', 'Chen, Zhi-mei', 'Lou, Ji-yu', 'Ni, Wan-mao', 'Wang, Yun-gui', 'Meng, Hai-tao', 'Tong, Hong-yan', 'Qian, Wen-bin', 'Jin, Jie']","['Zhang YF', 'Chen ZM', 'Lou JY', 'Ni WM', 'Wang YG', 'Meng HT', 'Tong HY', 'Qian WB', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Dec;32(12):814-8.,,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 115 APL patients (54 in HHT group, 61 in DNR group) after long-term follow-up were enrolled in the analyses of clinical feature, chromosome karyotype, molecular biology, OS and EFS. RESULTS: The overall CR of 115 patients was 100%, the median interval to achieve hematological CR was 32 (22 - 43) days, the overall median OS was within 0.23 - 77.34 months, median EFS was within 0.23 - 77.34 months. 3-year OS rate was 93%, 5-year OS rate 93%, 3-year EFS rate 85% and 5-year RFS rate 75% respectively. Converting to PML-RARalpha PCR-negative after the induction therapy in the HHT and DNR group was 31.3% and 15.5% respectively, at the end of 1 consolidation course was 68.6% and 77.6% respectively, while the remaining 4 patients tested PML-RARalpha PCR-negative at the end of 2 consolidation courses in the DNR group. While both groups obtained the identical molecular biology relapse rate (9.8% and 8.6%, respectively). Survival analysis indicated that no significant difference was found on OS and EFS between the HHT group and the DNR group (P = 0.206 and 0.506). 5-year OS rate was 87% for the HHT group while 98% for the DNR group, 5-years EFS rate was 80% for the HHT group while 71% for the DNR group. And the risk group was not the factor affecting OS and EFS (P = 0.615 and 0.416). Grade 2 fever in the HHT group was less than in the DNR group during induction therapy.

METHODS: From April 2005 to July 2009, AL patients who had got CR(1) after chemotherapy were regularly monitored for MRD in bone marrow by FCM to relapse or to July 2010 in Beijing Daopei Hospital (not including those received stem cell transplantation). The special antibody combinations were employed for each patient according to aberrant expression of leukemia cells. MRD(+) was defined as the aberrant cells more than 0.01%. The probability of continuous CR (CCR) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier formula, and the statistical difference between two CCR probabilities was evaluated by log-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 163 AL patients in CR(1) were monitored to relapse or to July 2010. Among 89 AML patients referred to our hospital within 1 year after diagnosis, 30 cases were in MRD(+) and 59 cases MRD(-) till 12 months following chemotherapy, 3/30 patients in MRD(+) and 47/59 remained in CCR to July 2010. The probability of CCR at 24, 36 months was 13%, 13%in MRD(+) group, 94%, 78% in MRD(-) group respectively, the difference between them was statistically significant (P < 0.01).

METHODS: A retrospective study from single center involved in 262 evaluable cases of leukemia received allo-HSCT over the past 8 years, of them 69 cases with ALL, 90 AML (except APL) and 103 CML. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis to screen the high risk factors. RESULTS: The risk factors significantly affecting relapse in ALL included: Cytogenetic risk classification, the cycles of initial induction chemotherapy; AML: Cytogenetic risk classification, minimal residual disease (MRD) level before transplant, reconstitution of WBC, and CD4(+)/CD8(+) lymphocyte ratio in the graft; CML: disease stage before transplant. CONCLUSIONS: The relapse risk after HSCT of ALL mainly depends on the grade of malignancies, and the relapse risk of AML is closely related to the course of transplant.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia in a 37-year-old Turkish woman in complete remission from breast cancer. Our patient presented to our facility with fatigue, fever, sore throat, peripheral lymphadenopathy, and moderate hepatosplenomegaly. On peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate smears, monoblasts were present. Immunophenotypic analysis of the bone marrow showed expression of CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD45 and human leukocyte antigen-DR, findings compatible with the diagnosis of acute monoblastic leukemia (French-American-British classification M5a). Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia developed three years after adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of an alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide and DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, doxorubicin and adjuvant radiotherapy. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a 46, XX, deletion 7 (q22q34), deletion 20 (q11.2q13.1) karyotype in five out of 20 metaphases and inversion 16 was detected by fluorescence in situhybridization. There was no response to chemotherapy (cytarabine and idarubicin, FLAG-IDA protocol, azacitidine) and our patient died in the 11th month after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The median survival in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia is shorter compared to de novoacute myeloid leukemia. Also, the response to therapy is poor. In therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, complex karyotypes have been associated with abnormalities of chromosome 5, rather than 7. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia showing the co-presence of deletion 7q, 20q and the inversion 16 signal.","['Yonal, Ipek', 'Hindilerden, Fehmi', 'Ozcan, Erkan', 'Palanduz, Sukru', 'Aktan, Melih']","['Yonal I', 'Hindilerden F', 'Ozcan E', 'Palanduz S', 'Aktan M']","['Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Istanbul, Turkey. ipekyonal@yahoo.com.tr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/02/22 06:01,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-6-67 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-6-67 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2012 Feb 16;6:67. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-6-67.,,20120216,,,,,,,PMC3327634,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median age of onset was higher for mutKIT17 than for wide-type c-Kit (wtKIT) patients (55 vs 31, P = 0.003). c-Kit mutations were significantly associated with decreased overall survival (OS) and continuous complete remission (CCR) rates (P = 0.053, and 0.048 respectively), and so did more for exon17 mutated patients reduced (P = 0.005, and 0.013 respectively). FLT3-TKD mutation showed no effects on prognosis of CBF-AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: RTK mutations are common in patients with CBF-AML. c-Kit mutations frequently and JAK2V617F mutation rarely appear in CBF-AML. c-Kit mutations, especially mutKIT17 confers higher relapse risk and poorer prognosis.","['Qiao, Man', 'Li, Wei-yang', 'Sun, Ai-ning', 'Chen, Su-ning', 'Liang, Jian-ying', 'Ding, Zi-xuan', 'Feng, Yu-feng', 'Wu, De-pei']","['Qiao M', 'Li WY', 'Sun AN', 'Chen SN', 'Liang JY', 'Ding ZX', 'Feng YF', 'Wu DP']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Oct;32(10):679-83.,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the follow up to March 31, 2011, the clinical parameters. overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM) and prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS: All 16 patients achieved morphological complete remission (CR), and 10 of them achieved molecular CR. After transplantation, all patients obtained successful engraftments. With a median follow-up of 27.1 (7.4 - 65.8) months, 14 patients were alive, 2 died from NRM, and 2 relapsed.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of CS055 on proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in human leukaemia cell lines and primary myeloid leukaemia cells. The results showed that at low concentrations (<1 muM), CS055 induced G1 arrest. At moderate concentrations (0.5 muM-2 muM), CS055 induced differentiation, as determined by the increased expression of the myeloid differentiation marker CD11b. At relatively high concentrations (2 muM-4 muM), CS055 potently induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Co-treatment with the ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavengers N-acetyl-L-cysteine or Tiron blocked CS055-induced cell differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting an essential role for ROS in these effects. Cytochrome c release and ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction are involved in CS055-induced apoptosis of leukaemia. In addition to cell lines, CS055 also exhibits therapeutic effects in human primary leukaemia cells. Moreover, daily oral CS055 treatment of nude mice bearing HL60 cell xenografts suppressed tumour growth, induced tumour cell apoptosis and prolonged the survival of tumour-bearing mice. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that CS055 is a novel HDACi with potential chemotherapeutic value in several haematological malignancies, especially leukaemia.","['Gong, Ke', 'Xie, Jia', 'Yi, Hong', 'Li, Wenhua']","['Gong K', 'Xie J', 'Yi H', 'Li W']","['College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/06/09 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20111685 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20111685 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2012 May 1;443(3):735-46. doi: 10.1042/BJ20111685.,,,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '87CIC980Y0', '(N-(2-amino-5-fluorobenzyl)-4-(N-(pyridine-3-acrylyl)aminomethyl)benzamide)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) respond to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-mediated activity, whereas human ESCs depend upon Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and activin signaling. In the majority of mammals investigated, however, the signals that support stem cell pluripotency are not well defined, as is evident by the persistent difficulties in maintaining authentic stable ESC lines. Induction of pluripotency by transcription factor-mediated reprogramming could provide an alternative way to produce ESC-like cells from nonpermissive species, and facilitate identification of core ESC signaling requirements. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in pigs, we transduced porcine foetal fibroblasts with retroviruses expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, and maintained the resulting cultures in medium containing either LIF or FGF2. Alkaline phosphatase positive colonies with compact, mouse ESC-like morphology were preferentially recovered using serum-free medium supplemented with LIF. These cell lines expressed the endogenous stem cell transcription factors, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, and the cell surface marker SSEA-4, consistent with acquisition of an undifferentiated state. However, restricted differentiation potential, and persistent expression of retroviral transgenes indicated that reprogramming was incomplete. Interestingly, LIF activated both the transcription factor STAT3 and its target gene SOCS3, and stimulated cell growth, indicating functional coupling of the signaling pathway in these cells. This demonstration of LIF-dependence in reprogrammed pig cells supports the notion that the connection between LIF/STAT3 signaling and the core regulatory network of pluripotent stem cells is a conserved pathway in mammals.","['Thomson, Alison J', 'Pierart, Hadrien', 'Meek, Stephen', 'Bogerman, Alexandra', 'Sutherland, Linda', 'Murray, Helen', 'Mountjoy, Edward', 'Downing, Alison', 'Talbot, Richard', 'Sartori, Chiara', 'Whitelaw, C Bruce A', 'Freeman, Tom C', 'Archibald, Alan L', 'Burdon, Tom']","['Thomson AJ', 'Pierart H', 'Meek S', 'Bogerman A', 'Sutherland L', 'Murray H', 'Mountjoy E', 'Downing A', 'Talbot R', 'Sartori C', 'Whitelaw CB', 'Freeman TC', 'Archibald AL', 'Burdon T']","['The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, The University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Midlothian, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Reprogram,Cellular reprogramming,101528176,2012/02/22 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/02/21 06:00'],"['2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cell.2011.0078 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Reprogram. 2012 Apr;14(2):112-22. doi: 10.1089/cell.2011.0078.

The few known causes/associations usually are readily identifiable (e.g., drug reaction, Felty syndrome, megaloblastosis, large granular lymphocytic leukemia, etc.). We report a novel association with mast cell disease. A 61-year-old morbidly obese man developed rheumatoid arthritis unresponsive to several medications. Agranulocytosis developed shortly after sulfasalazine was started but did not improve when the drug was soon stopped. Other symptoms across many systems developed including hives and presyncope. Marrow aspiration and biopsy showed only neutropenia. Serum tryptase was mildly elevated; urinary prostaglandin D2 was markedly elevated. Other causes were not found. Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) was diagnosed. Oral antihistamines, montelukast, and cromolyn were unhelpful; aspirin was initially felt contraindicated. Imatinib immediately increased neutrophils from 0% to 25% but did not help symptoms; subsequent addition of aspirin increased neutrophils further and abated symptoms. Different presentations of different MCAS patients reflect elaboration of different mediators likely consequent to different Kit mutations. Mast cells (MCs) help regulate adipocytes, and adipocytes can inhibit granulopoiesis; thus, a Kit-mutated MC clone may have directly and/or indirectly driven agranulocytosis. MCAS should be considered in otherwise idiopathic agranulocytosis presenting with comorbidities best explained by MC mediator release.","['Afrin, Lawrence B']",['Afrin LB'],"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Medical Service, Ralph H.

It appears most frequently in patients with M2, M4 and M5 subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia CASE OUTLINE: A 58-year-old female presented with pain and oedema of the right upper limb in November 2009. After two months the patinet had fracture dislocation and numerous osteolytic lesions of the right femur. Immunohistochemistry of tumour biopsy showed megakaryoblastic granulocytic sarcoma which was CD31++, F-XIII++, CD34-, FVIII+++, S100-, aktin-, EMA++, Bcl2++, CD43++, with positive proliferative marker measured with Ki-67 positivity in more of 50% of cells. Aspirate of bone marrow and immunophenotyping with flowcytometry revealed diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia. The course of the disease was rapid and the patient died before commencing chemotherapy, five months after first complaints. CONCLUSION: Granulocytic sarcoma is extramedullary localization of collection of leukaemia cells which can proceed, to arise concomitantly with leukaemia, or may be the only manifestation of the disease.

Some patients have a progressive course of the disease and require therapy immediately after the diagnosis, while others have a stable form without the need for treatment. Recently, two new biological markers, the expression of CD38 antigen and ZAP-70 have shown independent significance in the prognosis in CLL patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical value of CD38 antigen and ZAP-70 expression as predictors of the disease progression and to analyze the correlation of these markers with other B-CLL prognostic markers. METHODS: We assessed the expression of CD38 antigens by flow cytometry on peripheral blood samples and the expression of ZAP-70 by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed bone marrow (BM) biopsies in 40 newly diagnosed B-CLL patients. Disease progression was defined by the period elapsed from diagnosis to the time to first treatment (TFT). RESULTS: Expression of CD38 antigen correlated positively with ZAP-70 expression (Pearson, r = 0.476; p = 0.002). Also, correlation analysis results showed that a positive expression of CD38 and ZAP-70 statistically significantly correlated with unfavourable classical prognostic parameters, such as advanced Binet stage C, diffuse BM infiltration, increased lactate-dehydrogenase and beta-2 microglobulin serum levels. Patients with positive expression of CD38 antigen and ZAP-70 had a shorter TFT (log rank, 0.003 vs. 0.049). CONCLUSION: Both new biological markers were shown to have an exceptional significance in the prediction of prognosis in CLL patients.","['Lekovic, Danijela', 'Mihaljevic, Biljana', 'Kraguljac-Kurtovic, Nada', 'Peruncic-Jovanovic, Maja', 'Bogdanovic, Andrija', 'Colovic, Milica', 'Gotic, Mirjana']","['Lekovic D', 'Mihaljevic B', 'Kraguljac-Kurtovic N', 'Peruncic-Jovanovic M', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Colovic M', 'Gotic M']",,['srp'],['Journal Article'],Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2012/02/18 06:00'],"['2012/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh1112753l [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2011 Nov-Dec;139(11-12):753-8. doi: 10.2298/sarh1112753l.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*blood', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*analysis', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and type of allergic reactions, as well as to identify potential risk factors for the development of allergic reactions during L-ASP therapy in children with ALL. METHODS: The study encompassed 70 patients under 18 years of age, who were treated at the Institute for Child and Youth Healthcare of Vojvodina, Novi Sad in the period January 2000 - June 2009. We analyzed the frequency and type of allergic reactions during the administration of L-ASP, the onset of allergic reaction in relation to the phase of therapy of underlying disease, as well as the prevalence of allergic reactions in relation to drug administration method. RESULTS: Allergic reaction manifested in 17 patients (24%). In 14 patients (82%) allergic reaction to L-ASP manifested as urticaria, bronchospasm or anaphylaxis, whereas a mild local reaction was observed in only three patients (18%). In a group treated, according to the high-risk protocol, the prevalence of allergic reactions was statistically significantly higher in the intermediate-risk group of patients (p < 0.01), i.e. statistically significantly more frequent, as compared to the standard-risk group of patients (p < 0.05). The majority of patients (11; 65%) developed allergic reactions to the 9th dose of L-ASP, i.e. the first dose during the reinduction phase. The time interval between the last L-ASP dose in the induction phase and the 1st dose in the reinduction phase was at least four weeks. With respect to administration method, the majority of patients (16; 94%) developed allergic reaction after intravenous application of L-ASP. CONCLUSION: Potential risk factors for the development of allergic reaction to L-ASP are a high-risk therapy group, intravenous administration route and repeated application of the drug after at least four-week cessation period.","['Konstantinidis, Nadaa', 'Kolarovic, Jovanka', 'Kacanski, Natasa', 'Vijatov-Djuric, Gordana', 'Konstantinidis, Georgios']","['Konstantinidis N', 'Kolarovic J', 'Kacanski N', 'Vijatov-Djuric G', 'Konstantinidis G']",,['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2012/02/18 06:00'],"['2012/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh1112749k [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2011 Nov-Dec;139(11-12):749-52. doi: 10.2298/sarh1112749k.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Pakistan, a few studies highlighted the response of ALL to chemotherapy. The Present study was planned to see the response rate of Pakistani children with ALL to Medical Research Council ALL 97 (MRCALL97) chemotherapy protocol. This descriptive case series was conducted at the Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the Department of Paediatric Oncology, Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi from 16th of February 2007 to 16th of August 2007. METHODS: Diagnosed children with ALL fulfilling the inclusion criteria were interviewed regarding history of the present, past illnesses, and family history. Physical examination was performed. Presenting clinical features, blood counts and blood and bone marrow blasts percentage were used to see the response on day 29 post chemotherapy. The data was recorded on a structured proforma for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients were studied including 26 males and 7 females. Twenty-five patients belonged to age group 2-9 years, and 8 to < 2 or > 9 years, median age being 4.5 years. Presenting WBC count was < 50 x 10(9)/L in 30 patients and > 50 x 10(9)/L in 3 patients.

METHODS: Ex vivo cultures of HL-60/ADM cells and fresh refractory AML cells were treated with LBH589, bortezomib or their combination at varying concentrations. Proliferation capacity, apoptosis rate and reversal of drug resistance were evaluated by MTT assay, dual staining of Hoechst 33342 and Annexin VFITC/PI by flow cytometry, and adriamycin uptake rate with proliferation inhibition, respectively. The change of signal pathway at protein level was analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Synergistic cytotoxicity was observed in the combination treatment with LBH589 and bortezomib against HL-60/ADM cells, as well as the fresh AML cells, the most powerful synergy being observed at 21 nmol/L LBH589 plus 12 nmol/L bortezomib, with CI values of 0.531 and 0.498, respectively by Calcusyn software analysis. Moreover, the accumulation of adriamycin in HL-60/ADM cells was increased more in combination treatment [(64.81 +/- 3.69)%] than in either LBH589 [(28.96 +/- 2.52)%] or bortezomib [(37.29 +/- 3.71)%] alone (P < 0.05), and so did the uptake rate of adriamycin being (64.81 +/- 3.69)%, (28.96 +/- 2.52)% and (37.29 +/- 3.71)% respectively (P < 0.05). The combination treatment induced multiple apoptotic molecules co-action and intracellular drug accumulation contributed to the synergistic cytotoxicity, including caspase activation, PARP cleavage, XIAP downregulation, p53-dependent suppression of Bcl-2 and MRP1 expression via the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Combination treatment of drug resistant AML cells with LBH589 and bortezomib produces a synergistic effect of in creating sensitivity to chemotherapy.

METHODS: Multiplex PCR was used to identify the expression of IgVH segment and its mutation status in CLL. RESULTS: Analyses were successfully performed in 80 of 85 samples. Marked skewed IgVH families were disclosed. The most commonly used VH was VH3 (40.0%), followed by VH4 (30.0%), VHI (13.8%), VH2 (10.0%) and VH5, VH7 (2.5%). Fifty-six patients (70.0%) had mutated VH, 24 (30.0%) unmutated VH. Nine cases (11.3%) were with 100% germline sequence. Fifteen cases (15/24, 62.5%) in VH4, 29 (29/32, 90.7%) in VH3, and 4 (4/11, 36.3%) in VH1 had mutated VH. The most frequently used IgVH gene was VH4-39 (13.8%), and VH4-34 (8.8%). J4 (36/66, 54.5%) and D3 (25/66, 37.8%) were the most frequently used in J and D genes. The progression-free survival (PFS) was 82 and 17 months (P = 0.000), and the overall survival (OS) was 90 and 41 months (P = 0.009), respectively, for mutated and unmutated cases. Recurrent CDR3 sequences were found in our patients and 2 patients with VH1-69 had CDR3 sequences highly similar to those reported in literature. CONCLUSION: There is difference in IgVH gene segment usage and mutational status in different area CLL patients. Recurrent CDR3 sequences were found in specific IgVH gene segments, which highlights the importance of immunoglobulin mediated stimulation in the development of CLL.","['Yu, Zhen', 'Li, Zeng-Jun', 'Yi, Shu-Hua', 'Zhou, Ke-Shu', 'Hao, Mu', 'Qi, Jun-Yuan', 'Li, Chang-Hong', 'Qiu, Lu-Gui']","['Yu Z', 'Li ZJ', 'Yi SH', 'Zhou KS', 'Hao M', 'Qi JY', 'Li CH', 'Qiu LG']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Aug;32(8):529-32.,,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Donor's inhibitory and activating KIRs and recipient's HLA-C from 47 cases who received haplo-identical HSCT were tested by PCR-SSP. 2 year overall survival (OS), incidence of severe (grade III to IV) acute GVHD (aGVHD) and relapse rate (RR) were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) According to Matched (M) vs Mis-Matched (MM) between donor's inhibitory KIR and recipient's HLA-C1/C2 subgroup, 2 year OS rate in M group [(87.5 +/- 8.3)%] was significantly higher than that in MM group (54.5 +/- 9.0)%, (P = 0.03). Lower incidence of relapse rate was seen in M group than in M/MM groups [0 vs (25.4 +/- 9.5)%, P = 0.05]. In 30 cases of myeloid leukemia patients, there was lower RR in M group than in MM groups [0 vs (35.0 +/- 14.4)%, P = 0.04]. (2) According to the 3 activating KIR genes: KIR2DS1/ KIR2DS2/ KIR2DS3, lower incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD was seen in KIR2DS1 (+) group than in KIR2DS1 (-) group (13% vs 28%, respectively, P > 0.05); and so was done in KIR2DS3 (+) group (11% vs 26%, respectively, P > 0.05). The RR was lower in KIR2DS2 (+) group [0% vs (17.3 +/- 7.1)%, respectively, P > 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: In our haplo-identical HSCT setting, match between donor's inhibitory KIR and recipient's HLA-C can significantly reduce the incidence of relapse rate and improve OS. Although lower incidences of severe aGVHD are noted in the donors with KIR2DS1 (+) or KIR2DS3 (+), and lower relapse rate is noted in the donors with KIR2DS2 (+) but without statistic difference, no remarkable effects of activating KIRs on OS have been found in our relatively small clinical series.","['Zhang, Xian', 'Zhang, Yan-Ling', 'Wang, Jian-Ling', 'Tong, Chun-Rong', 'Cai, Peng', 'Liu, Hong-Xing', 'Wang, Jing-Bo', 'Cao, Xing-Yu', 'Ying, Yu-Ming', 'Wu, Tong']","['Zhang X', 'Zhang YL', 'Wang JL', 'Tong CR', 'Cai P', 'Liu HX', 'Wang JB', 'Cao XY', 'Ying YM', 'Wu T']","['Beijing Daopei Hospital, Beijing 100049, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Aug;32(8):525-8.,,,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'HLA-C Antigens/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Receptors, KIR/classification', 'Recurrence', 'Siblings', 'Survival Rate', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 96.1%, among which the CR rate after the first treatment course was 77.2%. The overall median OS was 51.64 (0.26-132.5) months, while the median RFS did not reach 1.18-96.62 months. The 3-year OS was 50% and the 5-year OS was 41%; the 3-year RFS was 59% and the 5-year RFS was 54%.

We therefore evaluated 1q25 gain across three age- and treatment-defined European clinical trial cohorts of pediatric intracranial ependymoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Frequency of 1q gain was assessed across 48 ependymomas (42 primary, 6 recurrent) using Affymetrix 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Gain of 1q25 was then evaluated by interphase FISH across 189 tumors treated on the Children's Cancer Leukaemia Group/International Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) CNS9204 (n = 60) and BBSFOP (n = 65) adjuvant chemotherapy trials, or with primary postoperative radiotherapy (SIOP CNS9904/RT, n = 64). Results were correlated with clinical, histologic, and survival data. RESULTS: Gain of 1q was the most frequent imbalance in primary (7/42, 17%) and recurrent ependymomas (2/6, 33%). Gain of 1q25 was an independent predictor of tumor progression across the pooled trial cohort [HR = 2.55; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-4.16; P = 0.0002] and both CNS9204 (HR = 4.03; 95% CI: 1.88-8.63) and BBSFOP (HR = 3.10; 95% CI: 1.22-7.86) groups. The only clinical variable associated with adverse outcome was incomplete tumor resection. Integrating tumor resectability with 1q25 status enabled stratification of cases into disease progression risk groups for all three trial cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to validate a prognostic genomic marker for childhood ependymoma across independent trial groups. 1q25 gain predicts disease progression and can contribute to patient risk stratification. We advocate the prospective evaluation of 1q25 gain as an adverse marker in future international clinical trials.","['Kilday, John-Paul', 'Mitra, Biswaroop', 'Domerg, Caroline', 'Ward, Jennifer', 'Andreiuolo, Felipe', 'Osteso-Ibanez, Teresa', 'Mauguen, Audrey', 'Varlet, Pascale', 'Le Deley, Marie-Cecile', 'Lowe, James', 'Ellison, David W', 'Gilbertson, Richard J', 'Coyle, Beth', 'Grill, Jacques', 'Grundy, Richard G']","['Kilday JP', 'Mitra B', 'Domerg C', 'Ward J', 'Andreiuolo F', 'Osteso-Ibanez T', 'Mauguen A', 'Varlet P', 'Le Deley MC', 'Lowe J', 'Ellison DW', 'Gilbertson RJ', 'Coyle B', 'Grill J', 'Grundy RG']","[""Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre, Queen's Medical Centre, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2UH, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2489 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2489 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Apr 1;18(7):2001-11. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2489.

To identify transcription factors that regulate CD133 expression, we conducted parallel large-scale RNA interference screens in Caco-2 cancer cells that endogenously express CD133 and in engineered HEK293 cells that express CD133 from a heterologous promoter. The transcription factor AF4 was identified following a comparative analysis between the two screens. We then showed that AF4 is a promoter of CD133 transcription in multiple cancer cell lines. Knockdown of AF4 resulted in a dramatic reduction in CD133 transcript levels. Importantly, a subset of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) harbor a fusion oncogene results from a chromosomal translocation that juxtaposes the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene and the AF4 gene. An investigation of the functional role of CD133 in the MLL-AF4-dependent ALL cells revealed that CD133 was required for leukemia cell survival. Together, our findings show AF4-dependent regulation of CD133 expression, which is required for the growth of ALL cells.

However, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been shown to be expressed in ruptured rotator cuff tendon. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of IL-6 family members in painful posterior tibialis tendon (PTT) and in painful and ruptured Achilles tendon (AT) compared with normal tendon. METHODS: AT samples were obtained from cadavers (normal) or from patients undergoing surgical procedures to treat chronic painful tendinopathy or ruptured tendon. PTT samples were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for other reasons (normal) and from patients with PTT dysfunction (painful). Total RNA was extracted and mRNA expression was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Collagen type I alpha-chain I (COL1A1) expression was increased in both painful PTT and AT compared with normal. Ciliary neurotrophic factor levels were increased in painful PTT only. In the painful AT, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and IL-6 expression increased compared with normal. In the ruptured AT, levels of VEGF A, COX2, oncostatin-M, leukaemia inhibitory factor and IL-6 expression were higher compared with both normal and painful AT. IL-6R expression decreased in both painful and ruptured AT compared with normal. CONCLUSION: Painful AT and PTT show different expression patterns, indicating a substantial difference between those two tendinopathies. Inflammatory markers are up-regulated in painful and particularly in ruptured AT, pointing towards a role of inflammation not only in rupture healing, but also in Achilles tendinopathy.","['Legerlotz, Kirsten', 'Jones, Eleanor R', 'Screen, Hazel R C', 'Riley, Graham P']","['Legerlotz K', 'Jones ER', 'Screen HR', 'Riley GP']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich NR4 7TJ, UK. k.legerlotz@uea.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",100883501,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['kes002 [pii]', '10.1093/rheumatology/kes002 [doi]']",ppublish,Rheumatology (Oxford). 2012 Jul;51(7):1161-5. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/kes002.

Recruitment was halted prematurely because of excess toxicity; 8 patients died in the FCCam group, 3 from lymphoma and 5 from in-fection. Overall response rates were 91% with FCR and 90% with FCCam (P = .79). Complete remission rates were 33.75% with FCR and 19.2% with FCCam (P = .04). Three-year progression-free survival was 82.6% with FCR and 72.5% with FCCam (P = .21). Three-year overall survival was similar between the 2 arms at 90.1% in the FCR arm and 86.4% in the FCCam arm (P = .27).

In addition to its role in promoting preleukemic hematopoietic cell self-renewal, AE represses DNA repair genes, which leads to DNA damage and increased mutation frequency. Although this latter function may promote leukemogenesis, concurrent p53 activation also leads to an increased baseline apoptotic rate. It is unclear how AE expression is able to counterbalance this intrinsic apoptotic conditioning by p53 to promote survival and self-renewal. In this report, we show that Bcl-xL is up-regulated in AE cells and plays an essential role in their survival and self-renewal. Further investigation revealed that Bcl-xL expression is regulated by thrombopoietin (THPO)/MPL-signaling induced by AE expression. THPO/MPL-signaling also controls cell cycle reentry and mediates AE-induced self-renewal. Analysis of primary AML patient samples revealed a correlation between MPL and Bcl-xL expression specifically in t(8;21) blasts. Taken together, we propose that survival signaling through Bcl-xL is a critical and intrinsic component of a broader self-renewal signaling pathway downstream of AML1-ETO-induced MPL.","['Chou, Fu-Sheng', 'Griesinger, Andrea', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Lin, Shan', 'Link, Kevin A', 'Shrestha, Mahesh', 'Goyama, Susumu', 'Mizukawa, Benjamin', 'Shen, Shuhong', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Mulloy, James C']","['Chou FS', 'Griesinger A', 'Wunderlich M', 'Lin S', 'Link KA', 'Shrestha M', 'Goyama S', 'Mizukawa B', 'Shen S', 'Marcucci G', 'Mulloy JC']","[""Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46570-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-403212 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 26;120(4):709-19. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-403212.

Standard treatment includes mono- or poly-chemotherapies. Nowadays, monoclonal antibodies are added, especially alemtuzumab and rituximab. However, the impact of these agents remains unclear, as there are hints of an increased risk of severe infections. OBJECTIVES: To assess alemtuzumab compared with no further therapy, or with other anti-leukaemic therapy in patients with CLL. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL and MEDLINE (from January 1985 to November 2011), and EMBASE (from 1990 to 2009) as well as conference proceedings for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two review authors (KB, NS) independently screened search results. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing alemtuzumab with no further therapy or comparing alemtuzumab with anti-leukaemic therapy such as chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies in patients with histologically-confirmed B-cell CLL. Both pretreated and chemotherapy-naive patients were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used hazard ratios (HR) as an effect measure for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and risk ratios (RRs) for response rates, treatment-related mortality (TRM) and adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategies led to 1542 potentially relevant references. Of these, we included five RCTs involving 845 patients. Overall, we judged the quality of the five trials as moderate. All trials were reported as randomised and open-label studies. However, two trials were published as abstracts only, therefore, we were unable to assess the potential risk of bias for these trials in detail. Because of the small number of studies in each analysis (two), the quantification of heterogeneity was not reliable.Two trials (N = 356) assessed the efficacy of alemtuzumab compared with no further therapy. One trial (N = 335), reported a statistically significant OS advantage for all patients receiving alemtuzumab (HR 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.94; P = 0.021). However, no improvement was seen for the subgroup of patients in Rai stage I or II (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.84; P = 0.82). In both trials, the complete response rate (CRR) (RR 2.61; 95% CI 1.26 to 5.42; P = 0.01) and PFS (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.76; P < 0.0001) were statistically significantly increased under therapy with alemtuzumab. The potential heterogeneity seen in the forest plot could be due to the different study designs: One trial evaluated alemtuzumab additional to fludarabine as relapse therapy; the other trial examined alemtuzumab compared with no further therapy for consolidation after first remission.There was no statistically significant difference for TRM between both arms (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.90; P = 0.36). A statistically significant higher rate of CMV reactivation (RR 10.52; 95% CI 1.42 to 77.68; P = 0.02) and infections (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.74; P = 0.04) occurred in patients receiving alemtuzumab. Seven severe infections (64%) in the alemtuzumab arm in the GCLLSG CLL4B study led to premature closure.Two trials (N = 177), evaluated alemtuzumab versus rituximab. Neither study reported OS or PFS. We could not detect a statistically significant difference for CRR (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.08; P = 0.18) or TRM (RR 3.20; 95% CI 0.66 to 15.50; P = 0.15) between both arms. However, the CLL2007FMP trial was stopped early due to an increase in mortality in the alemtuzumab arm. More serious adverse events occurred in this arm (43% versus 22% (rituximab), P = 0.006).One trial (N = 297), assessed the efficacy of alemtuzumab compared with chemotherapy (chlorambucil). For this trial, no HR is reported for OS. Median survival has not yet been reached, 84% of patients were alive in each arm at the data cut-off or at the last follow-up date (24.6 months). The TRM between arms shows no statistical significant difference (0.6% versus 2.0%; P = 0.34). Alemtuzumab statistically significantly improves PFS (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; P = 0.0001), time to next treatment (23.3 compared with 14.7 months; P = 0.0001), ORR (83.2% versus 55.4%; P < 0.0001), CRR (24.2% versus 2.0%; P < 0.0001), and minimal residual disease rate (7.4% versus 0%; P = 0.0008) compared with chlorambucil. Statistically, significantly more asymptomatic (51.7% versus 7.4%) and symptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections (15.4% versus 0%) occurred in the patients treated with alemtuzumab. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the currently available evidence suggests an OS, CRR and PFS benefit for alemtuzumab compared with no further therapy, but an increased risk for infections in general, CMV infections and CMV reactivations. The role of alemtuzumab versus rituximab still remains unclear, further trials with longer follow-up and overall survival as primary endpoint are needed to evaluate the effects of both agents compared with each other. Alemtuzumab compared with chlorambucil seems to be favourable in terms of PFS, but a longer follow-up period and trials with overall survival as primary endpoint are needed to determine whether this effect will translate into a survival advantage.","['Skoetz, Nicole', 'Bauer, Kathrin', 'Elter, Thomas', 'Monsef, Ina', 'Roloff, Verena', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Engert, Andreas']","['Skoetz N', 'Bauer K', 'Elter T', 'Monsef I', 'Roloff V', 'Hallek M', 'Engert A']","['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne,Germany. nicole.skoetz@uk-koeln.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/05/24 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008078.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Feb 15;(2):CD008078. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008078.pub2.,,20120215,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,,['MC_U105285807/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC6486055,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age. SEARCH METHODS: For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA: We used comparative prospective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement. MAIN RESULTS: We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, five time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts.Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella.The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was observed within the third week after immunisation with Urabe-containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunisation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad-Zagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person-time cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in children aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case-control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assessed in one other case-control study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: SCT after BU-CY and FLU-BU12-TG was performed in 21 and 10 AML patients. There were no significant differences between groups in number of patients treated in complete disease remission, gender, age, donors, CD34+, mononuclear cell (MNC) count in the graft and follow-up period. However, significantly more SCTs from unrelated (90% vs. 19%; p=0.00018) and HLA-mismatched donors (50% vs. 0%; p=0.0004) were performed in the FLU-BU12-TG group. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the risk of post-transplant AML relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM). The probability of post-transplant 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the FLU-BU12-TG and BU-CY groups in risk of AML relapse (HR=1.036; 95% CI [0.102 - 10.47]; p=0.9), post-transplant NRM (HR=0.25; 95% CI [0.031 - 1.96]; p=0.18), 2-year EFS (89% vs. 43%; p=0.19) or OS (79% vs. 57%; p=0.23). CONCLUSION: These pilot results demonstrate the efficacy of the new FLU-BU12-TG conditioning regimen in patients allografted for high-risk AML. This conditioning might become an alternative approach in patients at high risk of severe post-transplant complications after the standard BU-CY myeloablative regimen.","['Raida, Ludek', 'Tucek, Pavel', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Vondrakova, Jana', 'Rusinakova, Zuzana', 'Skoumalova, Iva', 'Hubacek, Jaromir', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Katrincsakova, Beata', 'Pikalova, Zuzana', 'Kurfurst, Pavel', 'Indrak, Karel']","['Raida L', 'Tucek P', 'Faber E', 'Vondrakova J', 'Rusinakova Z', 'Skoumalova I', 'Hubacek J', 'Jarosova M', 'Katrincsakova B', 'Pikalova Z', 'Kurfurst P', 'Indrak K']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Olomouc and Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic. raida@fnol.cz']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2011.040 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2011 Dec;155(4):327-32. doi: 10.5507/bp.2011.040.,,,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'D7RD81HE4W (thymoglobulin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This current study was designed to determine if functional responses to cicaprost in HEL cells were dependent on STAT3 phosphorylation. Cicaprost significantly enhanced the rapid change in HEL cell morphology induced by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), and this effect was inhibited by the IP receptor antagonist RO1138452 and a STAT3 inhibitory peptide. Other indicators of PMA-induced HEL cell differentiation, such as increased expression of CD41/CD61 and an increase in cell complexity/granularity, were inhibited by cicaprost in an IP receptor-dependent and STAT3-dependent manner. Although thrombopoietic cytokines promote megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet production via activation of STAT3, the predominant STAT3-dependent effects of cicaprost in HEL cells were inhibitory towards the process of PMA-induced megakaryocytopoeisis.","['Lau, Alaster H Y', 'Lai, Henry K H', 'Yeung, Barry H S', 'Leung, Sze Lee', 'Tsang, Suk Ying', 'Wong, Yung H', 'Wise, Helen']","['Lau AH', 'Lai HK', 'Yeung BH', 'Leung SL', 'Tsang SY', 'Wong YH', 'Wise H']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",8802730,2012/02/18 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0952-3278(12)00005-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.plefa.2011.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 2012 Mar;86(3):119-26. doi: 10.1016/j.plefa.2011.12.002.

METHODS: The clinical and pathologic features were analyzed in 10 patients with ANKL. The complete blood count, peripheral blood smears, bone marrow aspirates and bone marrow biopsies were studied. Immunophenotypic analysis was carried out by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma gene rearrangement was studied by PCR method. RESULTS: The most frequent hematologic abnormalities observed were anemia (7 cases) and thrombocytopenia (9 cases). Large granular lymphocytes were found on peripheral blood smears of 6 patients. In bone marrow aspirates, lymphocytosis (> 20.0%) was demonstrated in 8 cases and large granular lymphocytes in 6 cases. Bone marrow biopsies revealed various degrees of neoplastic infiltration, as follows: mild (5 cases), moderate (3 cases) and severe (2 cases). The neoplastic cells were mainly interstitial in distribution in 8 cases and diffuse in 2 cases. Hemophagocytosis was observed in 4 cases. Flow cytometry showed CD2+ sCD3- CD4- CD56+ CD57- in all cases, CD7+ in 9 cases, CD16+ in 5 cases, CD8+ in 4 cases and CD5+ in 1 case. Immunohistochemistry performed in 8 cases showed the following results: cCD3+ in 4 cases, CD56+ in 6 cases, TIA-1+ in 6 cases, granzyme B+ in 4 cases and perforin+ in 2 cases. PCR study revealed germline TCRgamma gene configuration in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: ANKL is a highly aggressive NK cell-derived lymphoid neoplasm.

The recent studies clarified that IL-28B polymorphism rs8099917 is associated with not only the HCV therapeutic response by IFN, but also innate immunity and antiviral activity. The aim of our research was to clarify study whether IL-28B gene polymorphism (rs8099917) is associated with HTLV-1/HCV co-infection. RESULTS: The genotyping and viral-serological analysis for 340 individuals showed that IL-28B genotype distribution of rs8099917 SNP did not differ significantly by respective viral infection status. However, the IL-28B mRNA expression level was 3.8 fold higher in HTLV-1 mono-infection than HTLV-1/HCV co-infection. The high expression level was associated with TT (OR, 6.25), whiles the low expression was associated with co-infection of the two viruses (OR, 9.5). However, there was no association between down-regulation and ATL development (OR, 0.8). CONCLUSION: HTLV-1 mono-infection up-regulates the expression of IL-28B transcripts in genotype-dependent manner, whiles HTLV-1/HCV co-infection down-regulates regardless of ATL development.","['Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Usui, Tetsuya', 'Ichikawa, Tatsuki', 'Uno, Naoki', 'Morinaga, Yoshitomo', 'Mori, Sayaka', 'Nagai, Kazuhiro', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Honda, Takuya', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Kanematu, Takashi', 'Nakao, Kazuhiko']","['Kamihira S', 'Usui T', 'Ichikawa T', 'Uno N', 'Morinaga Y', 'Mori S', 'Nagai K', 'Sasaki D', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yanagihara K', 'Honda T', 'Yamada Y', 'Iwanaga M', 'Kanematu T', 'Nakao K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan. kamihira@nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-9-40 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-9-40 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2012 Feb 15;9:40. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-9-40.,,20120215,"['0 (IFNL3 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Cell Line', 'Coinfection/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Hepatitis C/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Humans', 'Interferons', 'Interleukins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Risk Factors', 'Viral Load']",,,,PMC3308917,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate and better understand the classification and diagnosis of AL as well as pathogenesis and prognosis of this disease. METHODS: A total of 93 children with AL and and 12 cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (as control group) were enrolled in this study. Microarray chip analysis of their bone marrow samples was conducted to evaluate the microRNA profiles. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for validating the abnormal expression of microRNA. RESULTS: The microRNA expression profiles were different between acute granulocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia and also between the three subtypes (M1, M2 and M3) of acute granulocytic leukemia according to FAB classification based on leukemic cell differentiation. These three subtypes of leukemia could be identified by unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of microRNA expression and had specific up-regulation of miR-335, miR-126 and miR-125b, respectively. However, in the M2 and M3 subtypes with positive AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha, respectively, which have a better prognosis, the expressions of miR-126 and miR-125b were significantly higher than those with negative AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha. Further more, miR-335 and miR-146 were up-regulated in acute granulocytic leukemia observed in this study, which are different from those reported for adult patients.

The increased risk of obesity-related cancers could be mediated by insulin resistance, adipokines, obesity-related inflammatory cytokines, sex hormones, transcription factors and oxidative stress, which disrupt the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. The yellowish compound, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), is known to possess multifaceted pharmacological effects. The molecular mechanisms linking obesity to cancer risk, and how curcumin mediates anticancer and obesity activities, have not yet been publicized. Curcumin modulates multiple molecular targets and reverses insulin resistance as well as other symptoms that are associated with obesity-related cancers. In this study, we show that ample evidence exists to support recommendations that curcumin mediates multiple molecular pathways, and is considered to be of therapeutic value in the treatment and prevention of obesity-related cancers.","['Shehzad, Adeeb', 'Khan, Salman', 'Sup Lee, Young']","['Shehzad A', 'Khan S', 'Sup Lee Y']","['School of life Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, 1370 Sangeok-dong, Buk-ku, Daegu 702-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/fon.11.145 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2012 Feb;8(2):179-90. doi: 10.2217/fon.11.145.,,,"['0 (Adipokines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Insulin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Adipokines/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Curcumin/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Oxidative Stress']",,,,,,,,,,,,,['Future Oncol. 2012 Apr;8(4):490'],,,,,

MBL may be diagnosed in individuals with a normal lymphocyte count via a screening assay (screening MBL) or through the clinical evaluation of lymphocytosis (clinical MBL). Clinical MBL, which resembles CLL with a good prognosis, has attracted considerable interest because of its clinical and biological implications. The biological profile of clinical MBL appears indistinguishable from that of CLL for a large variety of markers. Differential diagnosis between clinical MBL and CLL is mainly based on peripheral blood B-cell counts. The 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria changed the definition of CLL to a B-cell count >/= 5.0 x 10(9)/L to eliminate overlap between CLL and MBL. However, this cut-off is arbitrary, and recent studies suggest that a B-cell count of 10.0-11.0 x 10(9)/L may represent the threshold that best predicts time to first treatment. After a diagnosis of clinical MBL, patients should be educated about appropriate monitoring and follow-up keeping in mind that, with time and counseling, most patients will understand that clinical MBL and CLL represent a continuum.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Foa, Robin']","['Molica S', 'Mauro FR', 'Molica M', 'Del Giudice I', 'Foa R']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/02/18 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.666542 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Sep;53(9):1660-5. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.666542.

Klk6 RNA expression was elevated in the brain and spinal cord by 7 days postinfection (dpi). Thereafter, Klk6 expression persisted primarily in the spinal cord reaching a peak of fivefold over controls at mid-chronic stages (60 dpi-120 dpi). Significant elevations in Klk6 RNA were also induced in splenocytes stimulated with viral capsid proteins in vitro and in activated human acute monocytic leukemia cells. Klk6-neutralizing antibodies reduced TMEV-driven brain and spinal cord pathology and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses when examined at early chronic time points (40 dpi). Reductions in spinal cord pathology included a decrease in activated monocytes/microglia and reductions in the loss of myelin basic protein (MBP).

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a condition clustering together several risk factors of those complications such as visceral obesity, glucose intolerance, arterial hypertension and dislipidemia. The risk of obesity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors is higher than in general population. We aimed to assess (1) the relationships between chosen adipokines and neuropeptides, chemotherapy, CRT, and body fatness and (2) evaluate adipokines and neuropeptides concentrations as a new markers of MS in children. We conducted cross-sectional evaluation of 82 ALL survivors (median age: 13.2 years; range: 4,8-26,2; median time from treatment: 3.2 years), including fasting laboratory testing: peptides (leptin, GLP-1, orexin, PYY, apelin), total cholesterol and its fractions, triglycerides; anthropometric measurements (weight, height), systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We estimated percentiles of body mass index and percentiles of blood pressure. Between 82 survivors overweight and diastolic hypertension was diagnosed in 31% of patients (35% in CRT group) and 15% respectively. At least one abnormality in lipids concentrations was found in 43%. Girls were more affected than boys. Statistically significant increased in leptin and apelin concentrations and decreased in soluble leptin receptor concentrations in the overweight group were observed compared to the non overweight subjects. Significant increase in orexin levels in females who had received CRT compared to those who had not received CRT was found. CRT is the main risk factor of elevated of body mass among survivors of childhood leukemia. Dyslipidemia and hypertension, along with increased adiposity indicate higher risk of MS development. Girls are more affected than boys. Leptin, orexin and apelin seem to be good markers of increased adiposity especially after CRT. Higher leptin levels may be related to central resistance to those peptides. Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia should be screened for markers of the metabolic syndrome.","['Skoczen, Szymon', 'Tomasik, Przemyslaw', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Surmiak, Marcin', 'Sztefko, Krystyna', 'Galicka-Latala, Danuta']","['Skoczen S', 'Tomasik P', 'Balwierz W', 'Surmiak M', 'Sztefko K', 'Galicka-Latala D']","['Zaklad Immunologii Klinicznej, Katedry Immunologii Klinicznej i Transplantologii, Polsko-Amerykanski Instytut Pediatrii, Collegium Medicum Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego, Krakow. skoczenkr@interia.pl']",['pol'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,2012/02/18 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2012/02/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Przegl Lek. 2011;68(9):592-6.,,,"['0 (Adipokines)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Orexins)']",IM,"['Adipokines/*blood', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/blood/epidemiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/blood', 'Leptin/blood', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/*blood/epidemiology', 'Neuropeptides/*blood', 'Obesity/blood/epidemiology', 'Orexins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/epidemiology/radiotherapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wskazniki zespolu metabolicznego i peptydy regulujace metabolizm u osob wyleczonych w dziecinstwie z ostrej bialaczki limfoblastycznej.,,,,

Our aim was to determine if transfusions with IPF-rich solutions, during autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, reduce the occurrence of bleeding and hemorrhagic complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Transfusions were administered to 40 children, affected with hematological pathologies, who underwent autologous peripheral hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. There were two groups of 20 patients, one group treated with IPF-poor and the other with IPF-rich solutions. In the two groups, the conditioning regimen was the same for the same pathology (hematological pathologies: 14 acute lymphoblastic leukemia; twelve acute myelocytic leukemia; four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; two Hodgkin's lymphoma; eight solid tumors). A new automated analyzer was used to quantify the IPF: the XE2100 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) blood cell counter with upgraded software. RESULTS: The 20 patients who received solutions with a high percentage of IPF (3%-9% of total number of infused platelets) required fewer transfusions than the 20 patients who received transfusions with a low percentage of IPF (0%-1% of total number of infused platelets): 83 versus 129 (mean of number of transfusions 4.15 versus 6.45) and a significant difference was found between the two groups by using the Mann-Whitney test (P < 0.001). The prophylactic transfusions decreased from three to two per week. There was only one case of massive hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: The use of IPF solutions reduces the number of transfusions and bleedings after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients.","['Parco, Sergio', 'Vascotto, Fulvia']","['Parco S', 'Vascotto F']","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,2012/02/16 06:00,2012/02/16 06:01,['2012/02/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S27883 [doi]', 'ott-5-001 [pii]']",ppublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2012;5:1-5. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S27883.

By using a model of early neonatal post-natal day (PND) 1 to 5 exposure of male rats to a xenoestrogen, estradiol benzoate (EB), we investigated the role of microRNA and DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) on the developmental effects of EB on the adult germ cell death process. Neonatal exposure to EB induced adult germ cell apoptosis together with a dose-dependent increase in miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c expression. Increased miR-29 expression resulted in a decrease in DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b and antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) protein levels as shown in 1) germ cells of adult rats exposed neonatally to EB and 2) in spermatogonial GC-1 transfected with miR-29. The DNMT decrease was associated with a concomitant increase in transcript levels of DNA methylation target genes, such as L1td1-1 ORF1 and ORF2, Cdkn2a, and Gstp1, in correlation with their pattern of methylation. Finally, GC-1 cell lines transfection with miR-29a, miR-29b, or miR-29c undergo apoptosis evidenced by Annexin-V expression. Together, the increased miR-29 with a subsequent reduction in DNMT and Mcl-1 protein levels may represent a basis of explanation for the adult expression of the germ cell apoptosis phenotype. These observations suggest that the increased expression of the ""apoptomir"" miR-29 family represents the upstream mechanism identified until now that is involved in adult germ cell apoptosis induced by a neonatal hormonal disruption.","['Meunier, Leo', 'Siddeek, Benazir', 'Vega, Aurelie', 'Lakhdari, Nadjem', 'Inoubli, Lilia', 'Bellon, Rachel Paul', 'Lemaire, Geraldine', 'Mauduit, Claire', 'Benahmed, Mohamed']","['Meunier L', 'Siddeek B', 'Vega A', 'Lakhdari N', 'Inoubli L', 'Bellon RP', 'Lemaire G', 'Mauduit C', 'Benahmed M']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Team 5, Nice F-06204, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,2012/02/16 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/02/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['en.2011-1109 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2011-1109 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2012 Apr;153(4):1936-47. doi: 10.1210/en.2011-1109.

It has, however, been challenging to demonstrate the impact of cell-level organization on stem cell fate control and to relate stem cell fate outcomes to autocrine and paracrine signaling. We address this fundamental problem using a combined in silico and experimental approach in which we directly manipulate, using laminar fluid flow, the local impact of endogenously secreted gp130-activating ligands and their activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3) signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). Our model analysis predicted that flow-dependent changes in autocrine and paracrine ligand binding would impact heterogeneity in cell- and colony-level STAT3 signaling activation and cause a gradient of cell fate determination along the direction of flow. Interestingly, analysis also predicted that local cell density would be inversely proportional to the degree to which endogenous secretion contributed to cell fate determination. Experimental validation using functional activation of STAT3 by secreted factors under microfluidic perfusion culture demonstrated that STAT3 activation and consequently mESC fate were manipulable by flow rate, position in the flow field, and local cell organization. As a unique demonstration of how quantitative control of autocrine and paracrine signaling can be integrated with spatial organization to elicit higher order cell fate effects, this work provides a general template to investigate organizing principles due to secreted factors.","['Moledina, Faisal', 'Clarke, Geoff', 'Oskooei, Ali', 'Onishi, Kento', 'Gunther, Axel', 'Zandstra, Peter W']","['Moledina F', 'Clarke G', 'Oskooei A', 'Onishi K', 'Gunther A', 'Zandstra PW']","['Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 3G9.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2012/02/16 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1111478109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1111478109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 28;109(9):3264-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1111478109.

Overt hyperhaploid (24-34 chromosomes) tumors constitute a small minority (0.2-0.3% of cytogenetically investigated lesions), but occur in many different disease entities. In these karyotypes, most chromosomes are present in one copy; one or a few chromosomes are disomic. Published reports on 141 strictly hyperhaploid tumors, supplemented with nine previously unpublished cases, were used for evaluating the pattern of disomic chromosomes. Only one tumor type, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), was sufficiently common (n = 75) to allow proper evaluation; other neoplasms were lumped together in as reasonably logical groups as possible, including 10 myeloid leukemias (ML), nine plasma cell neoplasms (PCN), 13 chondrosarcomas (CS), 11 soft tissue tumors (STT), nine adeno- or squamous cell carcinomas (ASC), and eight tumors of the nervous system (TNS); the remaining 15 tumors could not be grouped. It was evident that the pattern of disomies is nonrandom. Moreover, unique signatures for each tumor group were detected. Among ALL, most disomies were independent of age and gender, except for disomy 10, which was overrepresented in females. Chromosome 21 was invariably disomic, whereas chromosome 17 was always monosomic. The most frequent disomies were two gonosomes in ML, chromosomes 7, 9, 11, 3, 18, and 19 in PCN, 7, 5, 20, 19, and 21 in CS, 20 in STT, 7 in ASC, and 1, 7, and 9 in TNS. Chromosome 1 was often partially disomic, due to unbalanced structural rearrangements, with segment 1q21-31 in common. Doubling of the hyperhaploid clone was found in at least one-third of the cases, apart from in ML where only one of 10 cases showed chromosome doubling. The present findings indicate that retention of disomy for some chromosomes is pathogenetically important and that the chromosome(s) maintained in two copies is related to cell type or histological context.","['Mandahl, Nils', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Mertens, Fredrik', 'Mitelman, Felix']","['Mandahl N', 'Johansson B', 'Mertens F', 'Mitelman F']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. nils.mandahl@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,2012/02/16 06:00,2012/09/26 06:00,['2012/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.21947 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2012 Jun;51(6):536-44. doi: 10.1002/gcc.21947.

SCNP-based biomarker assays predictive of response to induction therapy and relapse risk in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients are being developed. Such assays have typically used bone marrow (BM) as the sample source of blasts. Because circulating peripheral blasts are detectable in approximately 65% of AML patients and peripheral blood (PB) sampling is less invasive than BM sampling, this study was performed to assess the effect of sample source on AML blasts signaling as measured in SCNP assay. METHODS: SCNP using multiparametric flow cytometry was used to evaluate the activation state of intracellular signaling molecules in leukemic blasts under basal conditions and after treatment with modulators in 46 pairs of BM mononuclear cells/PB mononuclear cells. The relationship between readouts of modulated intracellular proteins (""nodes"") was measured using linear regression, Bland-Altman method, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The majority (156/161) of signaling nodes show strong correlations between paired PB and BM samples independently from the statistical method used. Notable exceptions were two PB samples with almost undetectable levels of circulating blasts compared with paired BM samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that specimen source (BM or PB) does not significantly affect proteomic signaling in patients with AML and circulating blasts. The ability to use PB as a sample source will facilitate the monitoring of cellular signaling effects following administration of targeted therapies and at time points when BM aspirates are not clinically justifiable.","['Cesano, Alessandra', 'Rosen, David B', ""O'Meara, Pat"", 'Putta, Santosh', 'Gayko, Urte', 'Spellmeyer, David C', 'Cripe, Larry D', 'Sun, Zhuoxin', 'Uno, Hajime', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Paietta, Elisabeth']","['Cesano A', 'Rosen DB', ""O'Meara P"", 'Putta S', 'Gayko U', 'Spellmeyer DC', 'Cripe LD', 'Sun Z', 'Uno H', 'Litzow MR', 'Tallman MS', 'Paietta E']","['Clinical Affairs, Nodality Inc., South San Francisco, California 94080, USA. alessandra.cesano@nodality.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Outpatient oncology providers may not be using the ""teachable moment"" of cancer diagnosis to provide smoking cessation assistance. PROVIDERS AND METHODS: Physicians and midlevel providers (n = 74) who provide outpatient oncology services completed an online survey regarding smoking cessation counseling behaviors, beliefs, and perceived barriers. Outpatient medical records for 120 breast, lung, head and neck, colon, prostate, and acute leukemia cancer patients were reviewed to assess current smoking cessation assessment and intervention documentation practices. RESULTS: Providers reported commonly assessing smoking in new patients (82.4% frequently or always), but rates declined at subsequent visits for both current smokers and recent quitters. Rates of advising patients to quit smoking were also high (86.5% frequently or always), but <30% of providers reported frequently or always providing intervention to smoking patients (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy or other medications, self-help materials, and/or referrals). Only 30% of providers reported that they frequently or always followed up with patients to assess progress with quitting. Few providers (18.1%) reported high levels of confidence in their ability to counsel smoking patients. Patients' lack of motivation was identified as the most important barrier to smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Although beliefs about providing cessation services to smoking patients were generally positive, few providers reported commonly providing interventions beyond advice to quit. Additional training and clinic-based interventions may improve adherence to tobacco cessation practice guidelines in the outpatient oncology setting.","['Weaver, Kathryn E', 'Danhauer, Suzanne C', 'Tooze, Janet A', 'Blackstock, A William', 'Spangler, John', 'Thomas, Leslie', 'Sutfin, Erin L']","['Weaver KE', 'Danhauer SC', 'Tooze JA', 'Blackstock AW', 'Spangler J', 'Thomas L', 'Sutfin EL']","['Department of Social Sciences & Health Policy, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Wells Fargo Building, 14th Floor, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA. keweaver@wakehealth.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,2012/02/16 06:00,2012/09/25 06:00,['2012/02/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2011-0350 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0350 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2012;17(3):455-62. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0350.

However, there are now at least six examples of intrachromosomal interstitial deletions caused by aberrant V(D)J recombination between nonantigen receptor loci; five of out these six are associated with lymphoid malignancy. The SIL-SCL fusion and deletions of CDKN2A, IKZF1, Notch1, and Bcl11b are all associated with lymphoid malignancy. These interstitial deletions seem to be species specific, as the deletions seen in mice are not seen in humans; the converse is true as well. Nucleotide sequence analysis of these rearrangements reveals the hallmarks of V(D)J recombination, including site specificity near cryptic heptamer signal sequences, exonucleolytic ""nibbling"" at the junction site, and nontemplated ""N""-region nucleotide insertion at the junction site. Two of these interstitial deletions (murine Notch1 and Bcl11b deletions) have been detected, at low frequency, in tissues from healthy mice with no evidence of malignancy, similar to the finding of chromosomal translocations in the peripheral blood or tonsils of healthy individuals. The contention that these are mediated via V(D)J recombination is strengthened by in vivo assays using extrachromosomal substrates, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequence analysis which shows Rag2 binding at the sites of rearrangement. Although the efficiency of these ""illegitimate"" recombination events is several orders of magnitude less than that at bona fide antigen receptor loci, the consequence of such deletions, namely activation of proto-oncogenes or deletion of tumor suppressor genes, is devastating, and a major cause for lymphoid malignancy.","['Onozawa, Masahiro', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Onozawa M', 'Aplan PD']","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,2012/02/16 06:00,2012/09/26 06:00,['2012/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.21942 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2012 Jun;51(6):525-35. doi: 10.1002/gcc.21942.

F3 (TF gene) expression profiling was analyzed in 55 human MM cell lines (HMCL) and in 223 solid tumor cell lines obtained from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Cancer Cell Line Genomic Profiling Dataset. TF was not expressed in any of the 55 HMCLs studied, in sharp contrast to solid tumors, 90% of which showed TF expression. F3 expression was also absent in tumor samples from 239 MM patients. Immunohistochemistry for TF was negative, with either no or focal (1+) staining in 70/73 MM patients. Only three marrow biopsies were moderately (2+) positive either focally or diffusely, suggesting that in rare cases bone marrow microenvironment may support TF expression.

PTEN, Survivin, Xiap and Smac mRNA levels were detected by real-time fluorescent relative-quantification reverse transcriptional PCR (FQ-PCR) while PTEN protein levels analyzed by Western blot. (2) The expression levels of PTEN, Survivin, Xiap and Smac mRNA were detected in 10 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase (CML-CP), 10 CML patients in blast crises (CML-BC) and 10 normal control marrow mononuclear cells (MMNC). RESULTS: The growth of K562 cells was suppressed markedly. And the maximal growth inhibition rate was 38.6% after the transfection of PTEN. Survivin, Xiap, Smac mRNA expression levels were down-regulated by around 6.14, 7.44 and 2.95 folds respectively (0.0700 +/- 0.0059, 0.0089 +/- 0.0006, 0.0600 +/- 0.0039 vs 0.4370 +/- 0.0790, 0.0661 +/- 0.0072, 0.1580 +/- 0.0078 vs 0.4530 +/- 0.0810, 0.0700 +/- 0.0079, 0.1770 +/- 0.0085, all P < 0.01). The mRNA expression level of PTEN in CML-BC patients was lower than that in CML-CP patients and normal control. But Survivin, Xiap, Smac mRNA expression levels were higher in CML-BC patients than those in CML-CP and normal control. CONCLUSION: The over-expression of PTEN gene may inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and promote cell apoptosis via the regulation of Survivin, Xiap and Smac genes.","['Cheng, Zhi-yong', 'Wan, Jian-she', 'Wang, Ya-li', 'Liang, Li-qing', 'Liang, Wen-tong', 'Mu, Jing', 'Lu, Xi', 'Pan, Ling']","['Cheng ZY', 'Wan JS', 'Wang YL', 'Liang LQ', 'Liang WT', 'Mu J', 'Lu X', 'Pan L']","['Department of Hematology, First Hospital of Baoding, Baoding 071000, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,2012/02/16 06:00,2012/08/03 06:00,['2012/02/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Nov 1;91(40):2868-72.,,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Transfection', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Peripheral blood drawn from the litters of C57BL/6 females was used as umbilical cord blood (UCB) graft. BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 7 groups (n = 12 each). The grouping was as follows. Control group 1, inoculated with leukemia. Control group 2, inoculated with leukemia at -4 d and total body irradiation (TBI) treatment. Control group 3, TBI treatment and reconstituted with 2 x 10(6) UCB-TNCs. Control group 4, injected with PBS subcutaneously, TBI treatment and reconstituted with UCB-TNCs with platelet transfusion.

Experiment group 1, injected with KGF subcutaneously, TBI treatment and reconstituted with UCB-TNCs with platelet transfusion. Experiment group 2, inoculated with leukemia, injected with KGF subcutaneously, TBI treatment and reconstituted with UCB-TNCs with platelet transfusion. The survival status, pathohistological changes, splenic lymphoid cell subsets and thymic output post-UCBT were compared between groups. RESULTS: The survival time of control group 1 was (11.1 +/- 1.5) days and all died of leukemia. The survival time of control group 2 was (11.5 +/- 2.5) days and all died of aplasia. Five of 12 mice of control group 3 survived for 100 days and 7 mice died of visceral hemorrhage. Four of 12 mice of control group 5 survived for 100 days and 8 mice died of leukemia with a survival rate of 33.3%. Nine of 12 mice of experiment group 2 survived for 100 days and 3 mice died of leukemia with a survival rate of 75.0%. The survival was prolonged in experiment group 2 mice as compared with that of control group 5 mice (chi(2) = 4.996, P = 0.0254). The splenic T, NK and B cell counts in control group 4 mice at +35 d were (9.32 +/- 0.48) x 10(6), (1.59 +/- 0.11) x 10(6) and (18.74 +/- 2.01) x 10(6) respectively.

The counts of T cell and NK cell of group 6 were higher than those of group 4 (both P < 0.05). The level of signal joint T-Cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECs) in control group 4 mice was (167 +/- 17) copies per 10(5) cells while that of experiment group 1 mice (228 +/- 24) copies per 10(5) cells. They were higher than that of control mice (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Hematopoietic stem/precursor cells are abundant in full-term murine fetal peripheral blood.

Here, we report a technical advance in the diagnosis of JAK2(V617F) in MPNs by melting curve analysis (MCA). METHODS: From January through December 2006, we prospectively enrolled 78 patients with PV (n = 21), ET (n = 32), myelofibrosis (n = 5), secondary erythrocytosis (n = 4), secondary thrombocytosis (n = 2), acute myelocytic leukemia (n = 4), chronic myelocytic leukemia (n = 8), and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2). Mutation analysis for JAK2(V617F) was performed on either bone marrow or peripheral blood cells using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) or sequencing and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes with MCA. RESULTS: For the initial 30 samples, the detection rate of JAK2(V617F) using MCA was comparable to the gold standard of the PCR sequencing methods. However, the turnaround times for MCA and PCR were 2 hours and 2 days, respectively. The detection rate of JAK2(V617F) was 76.2% for PV (homozygous in 14.3%), 46.9% for ET, 80% for myelofibrosis (homozygous in 20%), and 0% for the other conditions. In PV, patients with homozygous JAK2(V617F) presented with significantly longer disease durations than heterozygous patients. In ET, there were no differences in the clinical parameters of patients harboring JAK2(V617F) compared with those with wild-type JAK2. CONCLUSION: Heterozygous and homozygous JAK2(V617F) mutations can be identified using the rapid and reliable assay based on FRET probes and MCA.

B cell-T cell interactions are modulated by chemokines. In B cell malignancies, these interactions may have tumor-promoting consequences. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes physiological B cell-T cell interactions and discusses their pathological role in the onset and progression of B cell malignancies with a special focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Experimental data on chemokine-guided B cell-T cell actions in B cell malignancies from murine models as well as in vitro data are summarized and their potential as future therapeutic targets is critically discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Direct or indirect targeting of chemokine receptors involved in localization and T-cell-dependent activation of B lymphocytes can provide strong synergisms with conventional or immunomodulatory therapies by disrupting the microenvironmental conditions necessary for survival and proliferation of malignant B lymphocytes. However, further knowledge of these interactions between B and T cells is needed.","['Johrer, Karin', 'Hofbauer, Sebastian W', 'Zelle-Rieser, Claudia', 'Greil, Richard', 'Hartmann, Tanja N']","['Johrer K', 'Hofbauer SW', 'Zelle-Rieser C', 'Greil R', 'Hartmann TN']","['Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, Innsbruck, Austria.

Research on Extremely Low-Frequency (ELF) magnetic fields has been performed for more than two decades, and the methodology and quality of studies have improved over time. Studies have consistently shown increased risk for childhood leukemia associated with ELF magnetic fields. There are still inadequate data for other outcomes. More recently, focus has shifted toward Radio Frequencies (RF) exposures from mobile telephony. There are no persuasive data suggesting a health risk, but this research field is still immature with regard to the quantity and quality of available data. This technology is constantly changing and there is a need for continued research on this issue. To investigate whether exposure to high-frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) could induce adverse health effects, we cultured acute T-lymphoblastoid leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM) in the presence of 900 MHz MW-EMF generated by a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell at short and long exposure times. We evaluated the effect of high-frequency EMF on gene expression and we identified functional pathways influenced by 900 MHz MW-EMF exposure.","['Trivino Pardo, Juan Carlos', 'Grimaldi, Settimio', 'Taranta, Monia', 'Naldi, Ilaria', 'Cinti, Caterina']","['Trivino Pardo JC', 'Grimaldi S', 'Taranta M', 'Naldi I', 'Cinti C']","['Institute of Clinical Physiology, CNR, Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Electromagn Biol Med,Electromagnetic biology and medicine,101133002,2012/02/16 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/02/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/15368378.2011.596251 [doi]'],ppublish,Electromagn Biol Med. 2012 Mar;31(1):1-18. doi: 10.3109/15368378.2011.596251.,,,,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics/radiation effects', 'Chromosomes/genetics/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics/radiation effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Microwaves/*adverse effects', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/genetics/radiation effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*radiation effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the late nineteenth century onwards, the notion of stem cells became customary in scientific communities of Imperial Germany. Adopting the term Stammzelle from Ernst Haeckel, Theodor Boveri was influential in introducing the concept in embryological studies and early genetics around 1900, describing a capacity of stem cells for self-renewal as well as differentiation. At the same time, blood stem cells were conceptualized by histologists such as Ernst Neumann and Artur Pappenheim in studies of physiological haematopoiesis and various forms of leukaemia. Furthermore, building on Julius Cohnheim's theory that tumours arise from 'embryonic remnants' in the adult body, pathologists aimed at identifying the cells of origin, particularly in the embryo-like teratomas. Embryonic stem cells thus assumed an ambiguous status, partly representing common heritage and normal development, and partly being seen as potential causes of cancer if they had been left behind or displaced during ontogeny. In the 1950s and 1960s experimental research on teratocarcinomas by Leroy Stevens and Barry Pierce in the USA brought together the strands of embryological and pathological work. Alongside the work of Ernest McCulloch and James Till at the Ontario Cancer Institute from the early 1960s on stem cells in haematopoiesis, this led into the beginnings of modern stem cell research.","['Maehle, Andreas-Holger']",['Maehle AH'],"['Department of Philosophy, Durham University, 50 Old Elvet, Durham DH1 3HN, UK. a.h.maehle@durham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Notes Rec R Soc Lond,Notes and records of the Royal Society of London,7505774,2012/02/16 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2012/02/16 06:00'],"['2012/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1098/rsnr.2011.0023 [doi]'],ppublish,Notes Rec R Soc Lond. 2011 Dec 20;65(4):359-78. doi: 10.1098/rsnr.2011.0023.,,,,,"['Europe', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Research/*history', '*Stem Cells', 'United States']",,,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '082800/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",PMC3793240,,,['EMS55070'],,,,,['NLM: EMS55070'],,,,,,

Since the implementation of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) in 1997, knowledge concerning the prognostic impact of abnormalities has increased substantially. The present study proposes a new and comprehensive cytogenetic scoring system based on an international data collection of 2,902 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were included from the German-Austrian MDS Study Group (n = 1,193), the International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop (n = 816), the Spanish Hematological Cytogenetics Working Group (n = 849), and the International Working Group on MDS Cytogenetics (n = 44) databases. Patients with primary MDS and oligoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after MDS treated with supportive care only were evaluated for overall survival (OS) and AML evolution. Internal validation by bootstrap analysis and external validation in an independent patient cohort were performed to confirm the results. RESULTS: In total, 19 cytogenetic categories were defined, providing clear prognostic classification in 91% of all patients. The abnormalities were classified into five prognostic subgroups (P < .001): very good (median OS, 61 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; n = 81); good (49 months; HR, 1.0 [reference category]; n = 1,809); intermediate (26 months; HR, 1.6; n = 529); poor (16 months; HR, 2.6; n = 148); and very poor (6 months; HR, 4.2; n = 187). The internal and external validations confirmed the results of the score. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these data should contribute to the ongoing efforts to update the IPSS by refining the cytogenetic risk categories.","['Schanz, Julie', 'Tuchler, Heinz', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Mallo, Mar', 'Luno, Elisa', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma', 'Steidl, Christian', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Nosslinger, Thomas', 'Valent, Peter', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Krieger, Otto', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Bennett, John M', 'Greenberg, Peter', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haase, Detlef']","['Schanz J', 'Tuchler H', 'Sole F', 'Mallo M', 'Luno E', 'Cervera J', 'Granada I', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Slovak ML', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Steidl C', 'Fonatsch C', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Nosslinger T', 'Valent P', 'Giagounidis A', 'Aul C', 'Lubbert M', 'Stauder R', 'Krieger O', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Faderl S', 'Pierce S', 'Le Beau MM', 'Bennett JM', 'Greenberg P', 'Germing U', 'Haase D']","['University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.35.6394 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.35.6394 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Mar 10;30(8):820-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.6394.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients with MM or MCC reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and analyzed the effects of history of CLL/NHL on overall (OS) and cause-specific survival after MM or MCC. Expected survival was derived from patients with MM or MCC without CLL/NHL. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2006, 212,245 patients with MM and 3,613 patients with MCC were identified, of whom 1,246 with MM and 90 with MCC had a prior diagnosis of CLL/NHL. Patients with MM and a history of CLL/NHL had worse-than-expected OS as measured by standardized mortality ratio (SMR; SMR for CLL, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.3 to 3.0; SMR for NHL, 2.3; 95% CI, 2.1 to 2.6). MM cause-specific survival was worse than expected for patients with a history of CLL (SMR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.2 to 3.4) or NHL (SMR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7 to 2.6). Among patients with MCC, OS was worse than expected for those with a history of CLL (SMR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 4.3) or NHL (SMR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.8). MCC cause-specific survival was worse than expected for patients with a history of CLL (SMR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.5 to 5.9), but no difference was observed for NHL (SMR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.1).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: MRD levels were prospectively quantified in 1,775 blood and bone marrow samples from 493 patients randomly assigned to receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) or FC plus rituximab (FCR). Patients were categorized by MRD into low- (< 10(-4)), intermediate- (>/= 10(-4) to <10(-2)), and high-level (>/= 10(-2)) groups. RESULTS: Low MRD levels during and after therapy were associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; P < .0001). Median PFS is estimated at 68.7, 40.5, and 15.4 months for low, intermediate, and high MRD levels, respectively, when assessed 2 months after therapy. Compared with patients with low MRD, greater risks of disease progression were associated with intermediate and high MRD levels (hazard ratios, 2.49 and 14.7, respectively; both P < .0001). Median OS was 48.4 months in patients with high MRD and was not reached for lower MRD levels. MRD remained predictive for OS and PFS in multivariate analyses that included the most important pretherapeutic risk markers in CLL. PFS and OS did not differ between treatment arms within each MRD category. However, FCR induced low MRD levels more frequently than FC. CONCLUSION: MRD levels independently predict OS and PFS in CLL. Therefore, MRD quantification might serve as a surrogate marker to assess treatment efficacy in randomized trials before clinical end points can be evaluated.","['Bottcher, Sebastian', 'Ritgen, Matthias', 'Fischer, Kirsten', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Busch, Raymonde M', 'Fingerle-Rowson, Gunter', 'Fink, Anna Maria', 'Buhler, Andreas', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Wenger, Michael Karl', 'Mendila, Myriam', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Eichhorst, Barbara F', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Hallek, Michael J', 'Kneba, Michael']","['Bottcher S', 'Ritgen M', 'Fischer K', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Busch RM', 'Fingerle-Rowson G', 'Fink AM', 'Buhler A', 'Zenz T', 'Wenger MK', 'Mendila M', 'Wendtner CM', 'Eichhorst BF', 'Dohner H', 'Hallek MJ', 'Kneba M']","['University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany. s.boettcher@med2.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.36.9348 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.36.9348 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Mar 20;30(9):980-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.36.9348.

RESULTS: Values that were above the upper limit of normal for kappa or lambda FLC were documented in 33% of 240 patients with PMF and 46% of 74 patients with MDS. Increased FLC was significantly associated with increased creatinine, and advanced age in PMF (P < .001) and hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL in MDS (P = .005). In multivariable analysis, increased FLC predicted shortened survival in both PMF and MDS, independent of age, creatinine, and other conventional risk factors. Cutoff levels based on receiver operating characteristic analysis for kappa plus lambda total FLCs delineated risk groups with highly significant differences in overall survival; International Prognostic Scoring System-adjusted hazard ratio in PMF was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), and was 6.3 (95% CI, 2.7 to 16.6) in MDS. No correlations were seen with leukemia-free survival, karyotype, or JAK2, MPL, or IDH mutations. In patients with PMF who were studied by cytokine profiling, the prognostic value of an increased FLC level was independent of that from circulating interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) or IL-8 levels. CONCLUSION: Increased plasma FLC concentration predicts inferior survival in both PMF and MDS. Its lack of correlation with leukemia-free survival and tumor-specific genetic markers suggests a primarily host-driven biologic phenomenon that might be more broadly applicable.","['Pardanani, Animesh', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Finke, Christy M', 'Rajkumar, S Vincent', 'Singh, Preet Paul', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Katzmann, Jerry A', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Pardanani A', 'Lasho TL', 'Finke CM', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Singh PP', 'Ketterling RP', 'Hanson CA', 'Katzmann JA', 'Tefferi A']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/08/25 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.39.0310 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.39.0310 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Apr 1;30(10):1087-94. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.39.0310.

We addressed the combined consequences of promoter hypermethylation of p15, CDH1, ER, MDR1, and RARB2 and mutation of NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3, and WT1 in a Danish cohort of 70 pediatric and 383 adult AML patients. PROCEDURE: Mutation analysis was done by fragment analysis followed by sequencing or by sequencing alone. Methylation status was determined using methylation-sensitive melting curve analysis (MS-MCA) after initial bisulfite modification. RESULTS: Among pediatric AMLs, we found promoter hypermethylation in p15 (47%), CDH1 (64%), ER (62%), MDR1 (8%), and RARB2 (22%) and mutations in NPM1 (11%), CEBPA (3%), FLT3ITD (4%), FLT3D835 (7%), and WT1 (7%). Promoter hypermethylation was significantly more frequent in core binding factor leukemias (CBF) compared to AMLs with abnormalities involving 11q23 (P = 0.024). Compared to adult AML we found a significant difference in p15 (47% vs. 73%, P < 0.001) and RARB2 (22% vs. 42%, P = 0.003) methylation, as well as in NPM1 (11% vs. 31%, P = 0.001) and FLT3ITD (4% vs. 26%, P < 0.001) mutation. CONCLUSION: Age-related differences exist in the frequency of mutations and it appears that promoter hypermethylation occurs in a non-random pattern in childhood AML accompanying specific genetic aberrations, and might represent an important step in the leukemogenic transformation.","['Juhl-Christensen, Caroline', 'Ommen, Hans Beier', 'Aggerholm, Anni', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Hokland, Peter']","['Juhl-Christensen C', 'Ommen HB', 'Aggerholm A', 'Lausen B', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Hasle H', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23397 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Apr;58(4):525-31. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23397.

METHODS: Data of BC patients followed at Hacettepe University Institute of Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology between 2004 and 2010 were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: There were 1,475 BC patients followed between 2004 and 2010 at our department; 1,319 (89.4%) of them had not metastatic disease. One thousand, one hundred eighty three (89.7%) early-stage BC patients received at least one treatment modality (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). The number of patients receiving only chemotherapy or only radiotherapy were 228 (17.3%) and 117 (8.9%), respectively. Eleven (1%) out of 1,066 BC patients receiving adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy were also treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The frequency of secondary hematological malignancies among adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy BC patients was 0.56% (6/1,066); it was 0.59% (7/1,183) among radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy treated non-metastatic BC patients. Five patients developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML); 3 of them were AML-FAB M3 and 2 could not be subclassified. The 6th patient had multiple myeloma and the 7th had diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the latter did not receive cytotoxic chemotherapy for BC. CONCLUSION: Treatment-associated secondary hematological malignancies, especially myeloid leukemias, are a growing problem due to high prevalence of BC and the dismal outcome of secondary leukemias. Further studies are needed to determine the risk for other hematological malignancies, possible responsible agents, and mechanisms.","['Arslan, C', 'Ozdemir, E', 'Dogan, E', 'Ozisik, Y', 'Altundag, K']","['Arslan C', 'Ozdemir E', 'Dogan E', 'Ozisik Y', 'Altundag K']","['Hacettepe University Institute of Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology, Ankara, Turkey. arslancagatay@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2011 Oct-Dec;16(4):744-50.,,,,IM,"['Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus, and a small risk of disease progression into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis. DIAGNOSIS: Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation. When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2 mutation confirms the diagnosis and its absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, excludes the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of ET had to include chronic myelogenous leukemia and prefibrotic myelofibrosis. A JAK2 mutation is found in approximately 60% of patients with ET. RISK STRATIFICATION: Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk is defined by the presence of age >60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >1,000 x 10(9)/L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include advanced age, leukocytosis, and history of thrombosis. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV. The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is <1%/1% in ET and <3%/10% in PV. In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%. The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications and this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin (PV and ET), phlebotomy (PV) and hydroxyurea (high risk PV and ET). Treatment with busulfan or interferon-alpha is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures. Screening for clinically significant AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.","['Tefferi, Ayalew']",['Tefferi A'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23135 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Mar;87(3):285-93. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23135.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Alkylating Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Phlebotomy', '*Polycythemia Vera/blood/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', '*Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Thrombophilia/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology', 'Thrombosis/epidemiology/prevention & control']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization of these signals and the pathways that propagate them to the interior of the cell is important for the identification of novel potential targets for therapeutic intervention. DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the gene expression profiles of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells purified from bone marrow and peripheral blood to identify genes that are induced by the bone marrow microenvironment. Two of the differentially expressed genes were further studied in cell culture experiments and in an animal model to determine whether they could represent appropriate therapeutic targets in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. RESULTS: Functional classification analysis revealed that the majority of differentially expressed genes belong to gene ontology categories related to cell cycle and mitosis. Significantly up-regulated genes in bone marrow-derived tumor cells included important cell cycle regulators, such as Aurora A and B, survivin and CDK6. Down-regulation of Aurora A and B by RNA interference inhibited proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived cell lines and induced low levels of apoptosis. A similar effect was observed with the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells that were induced to proliferate by CpG-oligonucleotides and interleukin-2. Moreover, VX-680 significantly blocked leukemia growth in a mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Aurora A and B are up-regulated in proliferating chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and represent potential therapeutic targets in this disease.","['de Paula Careta, Francisco', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Panepucci, Rodrigo Alexandre', 'Bojnik, Engin', 'Morato de Oliveira, Fabio', 'Mazza Matos, Daniel', 'Falcao, Roberto P', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Zago, Marco A', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['de Paula Careta F', 'Gobessi S', 'Panepucci RA', 'Bojnik E', 'Morato de Oliveira F', 'Mazza Matos D', 'Falcao RP', 'Laurenti L', 'Zago MA', 'Efremov DG']","['Hematology Division and Center for Cell-Based Therapy, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/12/13 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.054668 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.054668 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Aug;97(8):1246-54. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.054668.

The technique uses DNA probes with unique sequences that hybridize to whole chromosomes or specific chromosomal regions, and serves as a powerful adjunct to classic cytogenetics. For instance, many earlier studies reported the frequent detection of increased chromosome aberrations in leukemia patients related with benzene exposure, benzene-poisoning patients, and healthy workers exposed to benzene, using classic cytogenetic analysis(2). Using FISH, leukemia-specific chromosomal alterations have been observed to be elevated in apparently healthy workers exposed to benzene(3-6), indicating the critical roles of cytogentic changes in benzene-induced leukemogenesis. Generally, a single FISH assay examines only one or a few whole chromosomes or specific loci per slide, so multiple hybridizations need to be conducted on multiple slides to cover all of the human chromosomes. Spectral karyotyping (SKY) allows visualization of the whole genome simultaneously, but the requirement for special software and equipment limits its application(7). Here, we describe a novel FISH assay, OctoChrome-FISH, which can be applied for Chromosomics, which we define here as the simultaneous analysis of all 24 human chromosomes on one slide in human studies, such as chromosome-wide aneuploidy study (CWAS)(8). The basis of the method, marketed by Cytocell as the Chromoprobe Multiprobe System, is an OctoChrome device that is divided into 8 squares, each of which carries three different whole chromosome painting probes (Figure 1). Each of the three probes is directly labeled with a different colored fluorophore, green (FITC), red (Texas Red), and blue (Coumarin). The arrangement of chromosome combinations on the OctoChrome device has been designed to facilitate the identification of the non-random structural chromosome alterations (translocations) found in the most common leukemias and lymphomas, for instance t(9;22), t(15;17), t(8;21), t(14;18)(9). Moreover, numerical changes (aneuploidy) in chromosomes can be detected concurrently. The corresponding template slide is also divided into 8 squares onto which metaphase spreads are bound (Figure 2), and is positioned over the OctoChrome device. The probes and target DNA are denatured at high-temperature and hybridized in a humid chamber, and then all 24 human chromosomes can be visualized simultaneously. OctoChrome FISH is a promising technique for the clinical diagnosis of leukemia and lymphoma and for detection of aneuploidies in all chromosomes. We have applied this new Chromosomic approach in a CWAS study of benzene-exposed Chinese workers(8,10).","['Ji, Zhiying', 'Zhang, Luoping']","['Ji Z', 'Zhang L']","['Genes and Environment Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Video-Audio Media']",United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['3619 [pii]', '10.3791/3619 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2012 Feb 6;(60). pii: 3619. doi: 10.3791/3619.,,20120206,,IM,"['Aneuploidy', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics']",,,"['R01 ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3369631,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently found that the human tumorigenic LN-229 glioma cell line failed to form neurospheres in serum-free conditions and generated mostly small tumors in vivo, suggesting that either LN-229 GSCs are not active in these conditions or GSCs are absent in the LN-229 cell line. METHODS: Using self-renewal assay, soft-agar colony assay, cell proliferation assay, invasion assay, real time PCR analysis, ELISA and in vivo tumorigenic assay, we investigated the effects of interleukin (IL)-1beta and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta on the development of GSCs from LN-229 cells. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that the combination of IL-1beta and TGF-beta can induce LN-229 cells to form neurospheres in serum-free medium. IL-1beta/TGF-beta-induced neurospheres display up-regulated expression of stemness factor genes (nestin, Bmi-1, Notch-2 and LIF), and increased invasiveness, drug resistance and tumor growth in vivo: hallmarks of GSCs. These results indicate that IL-1beta and TGF-beta cooperate to induce a GSC phenotype in the LN-229 cell line. Induction of nestin, LIF and Notch-2 by IL-1beta/TGF-beta can be reverted after cytokine withdrawal. Remarkably, however, up-regulated Bmi-1 levels remained unchanged after cytokine withdrawal; and the cytokine-withdrawn cells maintained strong clonogenicity, suggesting that Bmi-1 may play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding indicates that glioma cells without self-renewal capability in standard conditions could also contribute to glioma malignancy when cytokines, such as IL-1beta and TGF-beta, are present in the tumor environment. Targeting GSC-promoting cytokines that are highly expressed in glioblastomas may contribute to the development of more effective glioma therapies.","['Wang, Lei', 'Liu, Ziyan', 'Balivada, Sivasai', 'Shrestha, Tej', 'Bossmann, Stefan', 'Pyle, Marla', 'Pappan, Loretta', 'Shi, Jishu', 'Troyer, Deryl']","['Wang L', 'Liu Z', 'Balivada S', 'Shrestha T', 'Bossmann S', 'Pyle M', 'Pappan L', 'Shi J', 'Troyer D']","['Department of Anatomy and Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA. leiwang@vet.k-state.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/10/05 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['scrt96 [pii]', '10.1186/scrt96 [doi]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2012 Feb 10;3(1):5. doi: 10.1186/scrt96.,,20120210,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Glioma/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/*pharmacology', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch2/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",,,"['P20-RR017686/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI085416/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA135599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3340549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although LDV infection generally does not cause disease, infected mice that are homozygous for the Fv1(n) allele are prone to develop poliomyelitis when immunosuppressed, a condition known as age-dependent poliomyelitis. The development of age-dependent poliomyelitis requires coinfection with endogenous murine leukemia virus. Even though LDV is a common contaminant of transplantable tumors, clinical signs of poliomyelitis after inadvertent exposure to LDV have not been described in recent literature. In addition, LDV-induced poliomyelitis has not been reported in SCID or ICR mice. Here we describe the occurrence of poliomyelitis in ICR-SCID mice resulting from injection of LDV-contaminated basement membrane matrix. After exposure to LDV, a subset of mice presented with clinical signs including paresis, which was associated with atrophy of the hindlimb musculature, and tachypnea; in addition, some mice died suddenly with or without premonitory signs. Mice presenting within the first 6 mo after infection had regions of spongiosis, neuronal necrosis and astrocytosis of the ventral spinal cord, and less commonly, brainstem. Axonal degeneration of ventral roots prevailed in more chronically infected mice. LDV was identified by RT-PCR in 12 of 15 mice with typical neuropathology; positive antiLDV immunolabeling was identified in all PCR-positive animals (n = 7) tested. Three of 8 mice with neuropathology but no clinical signs were LDV negative by RT-PCR. RT-PCR yielded murine leukemia virus in spinal cords of all mice tested, regardless of clinical presentation or neuropathology.","['Carlson Scholz, Jodi A', 'Garg, Rohit', 'Compton, Susan R', 'Allore, Heather G', 'Zeiss, Caroline J', 'Uchio, Edward M']","['Carlson Scholz JA', 'Garg R', 'Compton SR', 'Allore HG', 'Zeiss CJ', 'Uchio EM']","['Section of Comparative Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. jodi.carlson@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Comp Med,Comparative medicine,100900466,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/06/22 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Comp Med. 2011 Oct;61(5):404-11.,,,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Basement Membrane/virology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', '*Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Poliomyelitis/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Rodent Diseases/*pathology/*virology', 'Spinal Cord/pathology/virology']",,,"['P30 AG021342/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30AG21342/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3193062,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously isolated a new ellagic acid glucoside, okicamelliaside (OCS), from Camellia japonica leaves for use as a potent degranulation inhibitor. Crude extracts from leaves also suppressed allergic conjunctivitis in rats. In this study, we evaluated the in vivo effect of OCS using a pure sample and performed in vitro experiments to elucidate the mechanism underlying the extraordinary high potency of OCS and its aglycon. The IC(50) values for degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) were 14 nM for OCS and 3 muM for aglycon, indicating that the two compounds were approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more potent than the anti-allergic drugs ketotifen fumarate, DSCG, and tranilast (0.17, 3, and >0.3 mM, respectively). Antigen-induced calcium ion (Ca(2+)) elevation was significantly inhibited by OCS and aglycon at all concentrations tested (p<0.05). Upstream of the Ca(2+) elevation in the principle signaling pathway, phosphorylation of Syk (Tyr525/526) and PLCgamma-1 (Tyr783 and Ser1248) were inhibited by OCS and aglycon. In DNA microarray-screening test, OCS inhibited expression of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13], cytokine-producing signaling factors, and prostaglandin-endoperoxidase 2, indicating that OCS broadly inhibits allergic inflammation. During passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice, OCS significantly inhibited vascular hyperpermeability by two administration routes: a single intraperitoneal injection at 10 mg/kg and per os at 5 mg/kg for 7 days (p<0.05). These results suggest the potential for OCS to alleviate symptoms of immediate-type allergy.","['Kuba-Miyara, Megumi', 'Agarie, Kengo', 'Sakima, Rina', 'Imamura, Shihoko', 'Tsuha, Kazuyo', 'Yasumoto, Takeshi', 'Gima, Shinichi', 'Matsuzaki, Goro', 'Ikehara, Tsuyoshi']","['Kuba-Miyara M', 'Agarie K', 'Sakima R', 'Imamura S', 'Tsuha K', 'Yasumoto T', 'Gima S', 'Matsuzaki G', 'Ikehara T']","['Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan. kubame93@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1567-5769(12)00033-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2012.01.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2012 Apr;12(4):675-81. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2012.01.013.

T cell activation by T cell receptor (TCR) engagement or its pharmacological mimics, PMA plus ionomycin (PMA/Io), induces immunomodulatory FasL and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. In this study, we examined the role and mechanisms of AMPK in PMA/Io-induced expression of FasL and COX-2 in Jurkat T human leukemic cells. Inhibition of AMPK by a pharmacological agent, compound C, or AMPKalpha1 siRNA suppressed expression of FasL and COX-2 mRNAs and proteins in PMA/Io-activated Jurkat cells. It also reduced secretion of FasL protein and prostaglandin E2, a main product of COX-2, in Jurkat cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes activated with PMA/Io or monoclonal anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. Consistently, inhibition of AMPK blocked promoter activities of FasL and COX-2 in activated Jurkat cells. As protein kinase C theta (PKCtheta) is a central molecule for TCR signaling, we examined any possible cross-talk between AMPK and PKCtheta in activated T cells. Of particular importance, we found that inhibition of AMPK blocked phosphorylation and activation of PKCtheta, suggesting that AMPK is an upstream kinase of PKCtheta. Moreover, we showed that AMPK was directly associated with PKCtheta and phosphorylated Thr538 of PKCtheta in PMA/Io-stimulated Jurkat cells. We also showed that inhibition of PKCtheta by rottlerin or dominant negative PKCtheta reduced AMPK-mediated transcriptional activation of NF-AT and AP-1 in activated Jurkat cells. Taken together, these results suggest that AMPK regulates expression of FasL and COX-2 via the PKCtheta and NF-AT and AP-1 pathways in activated Jurkat cells.","['Lee, Jung Yeon', 'Choi, A-Young', 'Oh, Young Taek', 'Choe, Wonchae', 'Yeo, Eui-Ju', 'Ha, Joohun', 'Kang, Insug']","['Lee JY', 'Choi AY', 'Oh YT', 'Choe W', 'Yeo EJ', 'Ha J', 'Kang I']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Medical Research Center for Bioreaction to Reactive Oxygen Species, Biomedical Science Institute, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/07/27 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(12)00038-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.01.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2012 Jun;24(6):1195-207. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.01.015.

Our research provides evidence that RalA might also serve as linchpin modulators in leukemia, and combinatorial therapies of dual inhibition of bcr-abl and ras signaling pathways have a great potential in treatment of CML.","['Zhu, Xuejiao', 'Li, Yumin', 'Luo, Xiaochuang', 'Fei, Jia']","['Zhu X', 'Li Y', 'Luo X', 'Fei J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/07/27 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(12)00039-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2012 Jun;24(6):1134-40. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.01.016.

However, its effect on mast cell-mediated anaphylactic reaction is still not known. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of nilotinib on the anaphylactic allergic reaction and study its possible mechanism(s) of action. Nilotinib administration prevented systemic anaphylaxis in mice, mediated by compound 48/80, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Also, nilotinib significantly inhibited (P<0.05) allergic paw edema in rats. Furthermore, nilotinib significantly decreased (P<0.05) the IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in a dose dependent manner. In addition, nilotinib dose-dependently reduced histamine release from the rat peritoneal mast cells activated either by compound 48/80 or by ovalbumin. Moreover, nilotinib attenuated the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression in the rat peritoneal mast cells. These findings provide evidence that nilotinib inhibits mast cell-derived immediate-type allergic reactions and so it could be a candidate as an anti-allergic agent.","['El-Agamy, Dina S']",['El-Agamy DS'],"['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura, 35516, Egypt. dinaagamy1@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,2012/02/15 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(12)00109-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.01.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2012 Apr 5;680(1-3):115-21. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.01.039.

The clinical spectrum of the disease varies from only cutaneous lesions to highly aggressive systemic involvement such as mast cell leukemia. Mastocytosis can present from birth to adulthood. In children, mastocytosis is usually benign, and there is a good chance of spontaneous regression at puberty, unlike adult-onset disease, which is generally systemic and more severe. Moreover, individuals with systemic mastocytosis may be at risk of developing hematologic malignancies. We describe a girl who presented to us with a solitary mastocytoma at age 5 and later developed maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis. At age 23, after an episode of anaphylactic shock, a bone marrow examination revealed mast cell leukemia.

In the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) MM6 randomized study comparing consolidation thalidomide and prednisolone with prednisolone alone following autologous stem cell transplant, patients on consolidation thalidomide and prednisolone had superior progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We now show that thalidomide consolidation benefited both t(4;14)-positive (PFS 29 vs. 17 months, p =0.03) and -negative (52 vs. 24 months, p =0.04) disease. PFS for patients with normal FGFR3 expression was significantly better than for those with up-regulated FGFR3 (31 vs. 21 months, p =0.02). Consolidation thalidomide conferred an improved PFS in patients with normal FGFR3 expression (41 vs. 19 months, p =0.02), but there was no improvement in patients with up-regulated FGFR3 (31 vs. 29 months, p =0.76). We conclude that consolidation thalidomide may mitigate the poor prognostic effect of t(4;14), and improves PFS in normal but not up-regulated FGFR3 expression. Thus the level of FGFR3 expression provides additional prognostic information to t(4;14) in myeloma induction and consolidation therapy.","['Ho, P Joy', 'Brown, Ross D', 'Spencer, Andrew', 'Jeffels, Melinda', 'Daniher, Daniel', 'Gibson, John', 'Joshua, Douglas E']","['Ho PJ', 'Brown RD', 'Spencer A', 'Jeffels M', 'Daniher D', 'Gibson J', 'Joshua DE']","['Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia. joy.ho@sswahs.nsw.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/02/15 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/02/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.664842 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Sep;53(9):1728-34. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.664842.

According to correlation analysis, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CD38 positivity were found to be independent predictors of transformation to RS. Survival analysis showed that presence of RS, advanced Binet stage, high level of LDH, high level of beta(2)-microglobulin, high concentration of thymidine kinase (TK), ZAP-70 and CD38 expression, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene status and del(17p13) were adverse factors in determining overall survival (OS). Only del(17p13) was strongly associated with survival by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Median OS after transformation was 16 months (95% confidence interval, 5.6-26.4 months).

We have performed genome-wide DNA methylation arrays and mutational analysis of TET2, IDH1, IDH2, EZH2 and JAK2 in a group of 24 patients with CMML. 249 genes were differentially methylated between CMML patients and controls. Using Ingenuity pathway analysis, we identified enrichment in a gene network centered around PLC, JNK and ERK suggesting that these pathways, whose deregulation has been recently described in CMML, are affected by epigenetic mechanisms. Mutations of TET2, JAK2 and EZH2 were found in 15 patients (65%), 4 patients (17%) and 1 patient (4%) respectively while no mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes were identified. Interestingly, patients with wild type TET2 clustered separately from patients with TET2 mutations, showed a higher degree of hypermethylation and were associated with higher risk karyotypes. Our results demonstrate the presence of aberrant DNA methylation in CMML and identifies TET2 mutant CMML as a biologically distinct disease subtype with a different epigenetic profile.","['Perez, Cristina', 'Martinez-Calle, Nicolas', 'Martin-Subero, Jose Ignacio', 'Segura, Victor', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Fernandez-Mercado, Marta', 'Garate, Leire', 'Alvarez, Sara', 'Rifon, Jose', 'Varea, Sara', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Wainscoat, James S', 'Cruz Cigudosa, Juan', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Agirre, Xabier']","['Perez C', 'Martinez-Calle N', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Segura V', 'Delabesse E', 'Fernandez-Mercado M', 'Garate L', 'Alvarez S', 'Rifon J', 'Varea S', 'Boultwood J', 'Wainscoat JS', 'Cruz Cigudosa J', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Cross NC', 'Prosper F', 'Agirre X']","['Laboratory of Myeloproliferative Syndromes, Oncology Area, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0031605 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-18772 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31605. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0031605.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples from de novo AML patients of all cytogenetic risk groups were collected at diagnosis and subjected to MFC based on a four-color antibody panels against 33 CD membrane markers and retrospectively analyzed for the leukemia blast expression pattern and mean fluorescence intensity. Identification of the leukemic blast cells was based on right angle light scatter (SSC) and expression of CD45 and the cellular heterogeneity identified by the presence of at least two distinct subsets by any CD marker. RESULTS: Analysis of marrow samples from 86 patients with cytogenetic intermediate risk identified recurrent heterogeneous blast phenotypes for selected CD markers, three of which had prognostic impact with loss or gain of CD58, CD117, or CD14 expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis of diagnostic variables identified poor prognostic factors: Age >55 years, presence of extramedullary disease, WHO performance score >2, a heterogeneous CD58, CD117, or CD14 expression on blast cells. Each variable added to a simple and clinical useful and MFC based prognostic score system associated to inferior survival in the intermediate risk group of AML patients.

Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed. It has recently been proven in cancer systems that differentially expressed T-UCRs could alter the functional characteristics of malignant cells. Genome-wide profiling revealed that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemia and carcinoma. METHODS: In our study, we examined the expression levels of uc.43, uc.73, uc.134, uc.230, uc.339, uc.388 and uc.399 in 54 samples of primary colorectal carcinomas and 15 samples of non-tumoral adjacent tissues by real-time PCR. T-UCR expression levels were also correlated with commonly used clinicopathological features of CRC. RESULTS: Expression levels of uc.73 (p = 0.0139) and uc.388 (p = 0.0325) were significantly decreased in CRC tissue, and uc.73 indicated a positive correlation with overall survival (p = 0.0315). The lower expression of uc.388 was associated with the distal location of CRC (p = 0.0183), but no correlation of any evaluated T-UCR with clinical stage, grade and tumor diameter was observed. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that uc.73 and uc.388 could be potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in CRC patients.","['Sana, J', 'Hankeova, S', 'Svoboda, M', 'Kiss, I', 'Vyzula, R', 'Slaby, O']","['Sana J', 'Hankeova S', 'Svoboda M', 'Kiss I', 'Vyzula R', 'Slaby O']","['Department of Comprehensive Cancer Care, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['000336479 [pii]', '10.1159/000336479 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2012;82(2):114-8. doi: 10.1159/000336479.

Patients in CML-CP usually respond to treatment with ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, though some patients who respond initially may become resistant later. CML-CP leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are intrinsically insensitive to TKIs and thus survive in the long term. These LSCs or their progeny may at some stage acquire additional genetic changes that cause the leukemia to transform further, from CML-CP to a more advanced phase, which has been subclassified as either accelerated phase (CML-AP) or blastic phase (CML-BP). CML-BP is characterized by a major clonal expansion of immature progenitors, which have either myeloid or lymphoid features. CML-BP responds poorly to treatment and is usually fatal. This review discusses the role of genomic instability leading to blastic transformation of CML and proposes some novel therapeutic approaches.","['Skorski, Tomasz']",['Skorski T'],"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA. tskorski@temple.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/07/19 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-012-0114-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2012 Jun;7(2):87-93. doi: 10.1007/s11899-012-0114-5.,,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,"['CA123014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA133646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We mutated recombinant (r) RTA to disable this site, but await testing of the IT prepared with this mutant RTA in humans. Another possible approach to reducing IT-induced VLS is to shorten the half-life of the IT in vivo. We previously constructed a mouse-human chimeric RFB4 by grafting the variable genes of RFB4 onto the human IgG1k constant regions. Here, we report the expansion of our panel of mutant chimeric RFB4s (mcRFB4s) that lack the ability to bind to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). In comparison with cRFB4, which had a T1/2 of 263 h, the mcRFB4s had T1/2s ranging from 39 to 106 h. ITs were constructed with these mcRFB4s and rRTA. The mcRFB4-RTA ITs retained their cytotoxicity in vitro and had shorter half lives than the parental cRFB4-RTA IT.

Menin interacts with many proteins and is involved in a variety of cellular processes. Menin binds the JUN family transcription factor JUND and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Several MEN1 missense mutations disrupt the menin-JUND interaction, suggesting a correlation between the tumour-suppressor function of menin and its suppression of JUND-activated transcription. Menin also interacts with mixed lineage leukaemia protein 1 (MLL1), a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, and functions as an oncogenic cofactor to upregulate gene transcription and promote MLL1-fusion-protein-induced leukaemogenesis. A recent report on the tethering of MLL1 to chromatin binding factor lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) by menin indicates that menin is a molecular adaptor coordinating the functions of multiple proteins. Despite its importance, how menin interacts with many distinct partners and regulates their functions remains poorly understood. Here we present the crystal structures of human menin in its free form and in complexes with MLL1 or with JUND, or with an MLL1-LEDGF heterodimer. These structures show that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of MLL1 or JUND in the same manner, but that it can have opposite effects on transcription. The menin-JUND interaction blocks JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated JUND phosphorylation and suppresses JUND-induced transcription. In contrast, menin promotes gene transcription by binding the transcription activator MLL1 through the peptide pocket while still interacting with the chromatin-anchoring protein LEDGF at a distinct surface formed by both menin and MLL1.","['Huang, Jing', 'Gurung, Buddha', 'Wan, Bingbing', 'Matkar, Smita', 'Veniaminova, Natalia A', 'Wan, Ke', 'Merchant, Juanita L', 'Hua, Xianxin', 'Lei, Ming']","['Huang J', 'Gurung B', 'Wan B', 'Matkar S', 'Veniaminova NA', 'Wan K', 'Merchant JL', 'Hua X', 'Lei M']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/03/30 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['nature10806 [pii]', '10.1038/nature10806 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2012 Feb 12;482(7386):542-6. doi: 10.1038/nature10806.,,20120212,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JunD protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (lens epithelium-derived growth factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Fibroblasts', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,"['PDB/3U84', 'PDB/3U85', 'PDB/3U86', 'PDB/3U88']","['Y1-GM-1104/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK085121/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R37-DK45729/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM083015-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM083015/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK097555/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK085121/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'Y1-CO-1020/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK045729/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3983792,,,['NIHMS515115'],,,,,,,,,,,

Reprogramming involves both the resetting of epigenetic marks and the activation of pluripotent-cell-specific genes such as Nanog and Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1). The tight regulation of these genes is crucial for reprogramming, but the mechanisms that regulate their expression in vivo have not been uncovered. Here we show that Nanog--but not Oct4--is monoallelically expressed in early pre-implantation embryos. Nanog then undergoes a progressive switch to biallelic expression during the transition towards ground-state pluripotency in the naive epiblast of the late blastocyst. Embryonic stem (ES) cells grown in leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum express Nanog mainly monoallelically and show asynchronous replication of the Nanog locus, a feature of monoallelically expressed genes, but ES cells activate both alleles when cultured under 2i conditions, which mimic the pluripotent ground state in vitro. Live-cell imaging with reporter ES cells confirmed the allelic expression of Nanog and revealed allelic switching. The allelic expression of Nanog is regulated through the fibroblast growth factor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signalling pathway, and it is accompanied by chromatin changes at the proximal promoter but occurs independently of DNA methylation. Nanog-heterozygous blastocysts have fewer inner-cell-mass derivatives and delayed primitive endoderm formation, indicating a role for the biallelic expression of Nanog in the timely maturation of the inner cell mass into a fully reprogrammed pluripotent epiblast. We suggest that the tight regulation of Nanog dose at the chromosome level is necessary for the acquisition of ground-state pluripotency during development. Our data highlight an unexpected role for allelic expression in controlling the dose of pluripotency factors in vivo, adding an extra level to the regulation of reprogramming.","['Miyanari, Yusuke', 'Torres-Padilla, Maria-Elena']","['Miyanari Y', 'Torres-Padilla ME']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS/INSERM U964, Universite de Strasbourg, F-67404 Illkirch, Cite Universitaire de Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/04/20 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['nature10807 [pii]', '10.1038/nature10807 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2012 Feb 12;483(7390):470-3. doi: 10.1038/nature10807.,,20120212,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Mediator Complex)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (cohesins)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology/*metabolism', 'Blastocyst Inner Cell Mass/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*genetics', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'DNA Replication', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers/cytology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mediator Complex/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the remaining patients, a matched unrelated donor (MUD) is an alternative. Prior studies comparing MRD and MUD HCT provide conflicting results, and the relative efficacy of MRD and MUD transplantation is an area of active investigation. To address this issue, we analyzed outcomes of 2223 adult acute myelogenous leukemia patients who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2002 and 2006 (MRD, n = 624; 8/8 HLA locus matched MUD, n = 1193; 7/8 MUD, n = 406). The 100-day cumulative incidence of grades B-D acute GVHD was significantly lower in MRD HCT recipients than in 8/8 MUD and 7/8 MUD HCT recipients (33%, 51%, and 53%, respectively; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, 8/8 MUD HCT recipients had a similar survival rate compared with MRD HCT recipients (relative risk [RR], 1.03; P = .62). 7/8 MUD HCT recipients had higher early mortality than MRD HCT recipients (RR, 1.40; P < .001), but beyond 6 months after HCT, their survival rates were similar (RR, 0.88; P = .30). These results suggest that transplantation from MUD and MRD donors results in similar survival times for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Saber, Wael', 'Opie, Shaun', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Schriber, Jeff']","['Saber W', 'Opie S', 'Rizzo JD', 'Zhang MJ', 'Horowitz MM', 'Schriber J']","['Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, 9200 W Wisconsin Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA. wsaber@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47949-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-09-381699 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Apr 26;119(17):3908-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-09-381699.

NFI-A is a posttranscriptional microRNA-223 (miR-223) target directing human hematopoietic progenitor lineage decision: NFI-A induction or silencing boosts erythropoiesis or granulopoiesis, respectively. Here we show that NFI-A promoter silencing, which allows granulopoiesis, is guaranteed by epigenetic events, including the resolution of opposing chromatin ""bivalent domains,"" hypermethylation, recruitment of polycomb (PcG)-RNAi complexes, and miR-223 promoter targeting activity. During granulopoiesis, miR-223 localizes inside the nucleus and targets the NFI-A promoter region containing PcGs binding sites and miR-223 complementary DNA sequences, evolutionarily conserved in mammalians. Remarkably, both the integrity of the PcGs-RNAi complex and DNA sequences matching the seed region of miR-223 are required to induce NFI-A transcriptional silencing. Moreover, ectopic miR-223 expression in human myeloid progenitors causes heterochromatic repression of NFI-A gene and channels granulopoiesis, whereas its stable knockdown produces the opposite effects. Our findings indicate that, besides the regulation of translation of mRNA targets, endogenous miRs can affect gene expression at the transcriptional level, functioning in a critical interface between chromatin remodeling complexes and the genome to direct fate lineage determination of hematopoietic progenitors.","['Zardo, Giuseppe', 'Ciolfi, Alberto', 'Vian, Laura', 'Starnes, Linda M', 'Billi, Monia', 'Racanicchi, Serena', 'Maresca, Carmen', 'Fazi, Francesco', 'Travaglini, Lorena', 'Noguera, Nelida', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Nanni, Mauro', 'Cimino, Giuseppe', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Grignani, Francesco', 'Nervi, Clara']","['Zardo G', 'Ciolfi A', 'Vian L', 'Starnes LM', 'Billi M', 'Racanicchi S', 'Maresca C', 'Fazi F', 'Travaglini L', 'Noguera N', 'Mancini M', 'Nanni M', 'Cimino G', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Grignani F', 'Nervi C']","['San Raffaele Bio-medical Park Foundation, Rome, Italy. zardo@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47964-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-371344 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Apr 26;119(17):4034-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-371344.

From the transduced cells several clones widely differing in the production of either cytokine were isolated. For further experiments, clones with the highest secretion of the cytokines were selected. When administered subcutaneously to mice, the IL-2-secreting cell line was approximately hundred times less pathogenic than the parental cells. A portion of animals developed small, spontaneously regressing tumours and most of them became resistant to challenge with the parental cells. Cell populations from either solid tumours or from organs infiltrated by the tumour cells predominantly consisted of cells which did not produce IL-2 and had lost resistance to blasticidine. This indicated that the IL-2 secreting cells were genetically unstable in the course of their propagation in vivo. On the other hand, the GMCSFsecreting cells were more pathogenic than the parental cells, induced extensive organ damage and remained genetically stable in the course of their growth in vivo. The pathogenicity of different GMCSF secreting clones directly depended on the magnitude of production of this cytokine. When used in the form of inactivated vaccines, the GM-CSF-secreting cells were more immunogenic than the IL-2-secreting cells. In comparative experiments, similar results were obtained with GMCSF- and IL-2-secreting cells derived from B210 cells, another bcr-abl transformed cell line.","['Petrackova, Martina', 'Tachezy, Ruth', 'Vonka, Vladimir']","['Petrackova M', 'Tachezy R', 'Vonka V']","['Department of Experimental Virology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague 128 20, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2012.1365 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 May;40(5):1668-76. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1365.

Exposure of APL NB4 cells to recombinant human soluble TM (rTM, 1500 ng/mL) inhibited clonogenic growth of these cells by approximately 30%, and induced expression of CD11b, a marker of myeloid differentiation, on their surfaces, in association with upregulation of nuclear levels of myeloid-specific transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein epsilon. These antileukemic effects of rTM were mediated by thrombin/activated protein C-dependent mechanisms, as hirudin, an inhibitor of thrombin and a blocking antibody against endothelial receptor for protein C to which activated protein C binds, hampered the ability of rTM to induce expression of CD11b in NB4 cells. This study also found that rTM downregulated expression of Annexin II, a receptor for both plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, and inhibited plasmin activity in APL cells. Interestingly, rTM significantly enhanced the ability of all-trans retinoic acid to induce growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis, and inhibited plasmin activity in APL cells. Taken together, these results suggest that administration of rTM should be considered for treatment of individuals with disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with APL.","['Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Yang, Jing', 'Nishioka, Chie', 'Isaka, Mayuka', 'Iwabu, Naomi', 'Sakai, Mizu', 'Taniguchi, Ayuko', 'Honda, Goichi', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Ikezoe T', 'Yang J', 'Nishioka C', 'Isaka M', 'Iwabu N', 'Sakai M', 'Taniguchi A', 'Honda G', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan. ikezoet@kochi-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/07/14 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00045-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Jun;40(6):457-65. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.01.016.

Occupational diseases caused by chemical agents have decreased to 0.6% of all cases. However, there were several social disputes related to occupational diseases caused by low level of chemicals such as leukemia in a semiconductor company. Korea planned to reduce the fatal injury rate and total workday loss by 30% by 2015. In order to achieve this goal, the government will focus on vulnerable groups in collaboration with allies such as professional associations or organizations.","['Kang, Seong-Kyu']",['Kang SK'],"['Seoul Regional Headquaters, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA), 14th Floor, Yukan bldg, 74 Noryangjin-ro, Donjak-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea. skk@koska.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Ind Health,Industrial health,2985065R,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/indhealth/MS1345 [pii]', '10.2486/indhealth.ms1345 [doi]']",ppublish,Ind Health. 2012;50(1):12-6. doi: 10.2486/indhealth.ms1345.,,,,IM,"['Accidents, Occupational/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology', '*Occupational Health/trends', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term survival of patients with AML has changed little over the past decade, necessitating the identification and validation of new AML targets. Integration of genomic approaches with small-molecule and genetically based high-throughput screening holds the promise of improved discovery of candidate targets for cancer therapy. Here, we identified a role for glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha (GSK-3alpha) in AML by performing 2 independent small-molecule library screens and an shRNA screen for perturbations that induced a differentiation expression signature in AML cells. GSK-3 is a serine-threonine kinase involved in diverse cellular processes, including differentiation, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and proliferation. We demonstrated that specific loss of GSK-3alpha induced differentiation in AML by multiple measurements, including induction of gene expression signatures, morphological changes, and cell surface markers consistent with myeloid maturation. GSK-3alpha-specific suppression also led to impaired growth and proliferation in vitro, induction of apoptosis, loss of colony formation in methylcellulose, and anti-AML activity in vivo. Although the role of GSK-3beta has been well studied in cancer development, these studies support a role for GSK-3alpha in AML.","['Banerji, Versha', 'Frumm, Stacey M', 'Ross, Kenneth N', 'Li, Loretta S', 'Schinzel, Anna C', 'Hahn, Cynthia K', 'Kakoza, Rose M', 'Chow, Kwan T', 'Ross, Linda', 'Alexe, Gabriela', 'Tolliday, Nicola', 'Inguilizian, Haig', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Stone, Richard M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Roti, Giovanni', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Hahn, William C', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly']","['Banerji V', 'Frumm SM', 'Ross KN', 'Li LS', 'Schinzel AC', 'Hahn CK', 'Kakoza RM', 'Chow KT', 'Ross L', 'Alexe G', 'Tolliday N', 'Inguilizian H', 'Galinsky I', 'Stone RM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Roti G', 'Aster JC', 'Hahn WC', 'Kung AL', 'Stegmaier K']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston 02215, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['46465 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI46465 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2012 Mar;122(3):935-47. doi: 10.1172/JCI46465.

About 80% are precursor-B cell in origin (CD19+, CD10+), and this immunophenotype has increased in incidence over the past several decades in the Western world. Part of this increase may be due to the introduction of new chemical exposures into the child's environment including parental smoking, pesticides, traffic fumes, paint and household chemicals. However, much of the increase in leukemia rates is likely linked to altered patterns of infection during early childhood development, mirroring causal pathways responsible for a similarly increased incidence of other childhood-diagnosed immune-related illnesses including allergy, asthma, and type 1 diabetes. Factors linked to childhood leukemia that are likely surrogates for immune stimulation include exposure to childcare settings, parity status and birth order, vaccination history, and population mixing. In case-control studies, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is consistently inversely associated with greater exposure to infections, via daycare and later birth order. New evidence suggests also that children who contract leukemia may harbor a congenital defect in immune responder status, as indicated by lower levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 at birth in children who grow up to contract leukemia, as well as higher need for clinical care for infections within the first year of life despite having lower levels of exposure to infections. One manifestation of this phenomenon may be leukemia clusters which tend to appear as a leukemia ""outbreak"" among populations with low herd immunity to a new infection. Critical answers to the etiology of childhood leukemia will require incorporating new tools into traditional epidemiologic approaches - including the classification of leukemia at a molecular scale, better exposure assessments at all points in a child's life, a comprehensive understanding of genetic risk factors, and an appraisal of the interplay between infectious exposures and the status of immune response in individuals.","['Wiemels, Joseph']",['Wiemels J'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, Helen Diller Cancer Center Research Building, 1450 3rd Street, HD274, San Francisco, CA 94158, United States. joe.wiemels@ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(12)00017-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2012.01.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2012 Apr 5;196(3):59-67. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2012.01.007.

The aim of this work is to present a planning technique useful to reduce the dose inhomogeneity resulting from the matching of the 2 helical dose distributions. Three HT plans were generated for each of the 18 patients enrolled. Upper TMI (UTMI) and lower TMI (LTMI) were planned onto the whole-body computed tomography (CT) and on the lower-limb CT, respectively. A twin lower TMI plan (tLTMI) was designed on the whole-body CT. Agreement between LTMI and tLTMI plans was assessed by computing for each dose-volume histogram (DVH) structure the gamma index scored with 1% of dose and volume difference thresholds. UTMI and tLTMI plans were summed together on the whole-body CT, enabling the evaluation of dose inhomogeneity. Moreover, a couple of transition volumes were used to improve the dose uniformity in the abutment region. For every DVH, a number of points >99% passed the gamma analysis, validating the method used to generate the twin plan. The planned dose inhomogeneity at the junction level resulted within +/-10% of the prescribed dose. Median dose reduction to organs at risk ranged from 30-80% of the prescribed dose. Mean conformity index was 1.41 (range 1.36-1.44) for the whole-body target. The technique provided a ""full helical"" dose distribution for TMI treatments, which can be considered effective only if the dose agreement between LTMI and tLTMI plans is met. The planning of TMI with HT for the whole body with adequate dose homogeneity and conformity was shown to be feasible.","['Zeverino, Michele', 'Agostinelli, Stefano', 'Taccini, Gianni', 'Cavagnetto, Francesca', 'Garelli, Stefania', 'Gusinu, Marco', 'Vagge, Stefano', 'Barra, Salvina', 'Corvo, Renzo']","['Zeverino M', 'Agostinelli S', 'Taccini G', 'Cavagnetto F', 'Garelli S', 'Gusinu M', 'Vagge S', 'Barra S', 'Corvo R']","['Medical Physics Department, IRCCS, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul cancro, Genoa, Italy. michele.zeverino@istge.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Dosim,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,8908862,2012/02/14 06:00,2013/01/16 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0958-3947(11)00211-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.meddos.2011.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Dosim. 2012 Autumn;37(3):314-20. doi: 10.1016/j.meddos.2011.12.001.

Data for safety and effectiveness of therapy are scarce and mostly retrospective. This report provides updated guidance for management, focusing on chemotherapy and biological agents. The primary goal of treatment is to preserve the mother's health; hence, pregnancy termination is often advisable at early stages, allowing delivery of adequate therapy.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that early recognition, sodium pentosan polysulfate (SPP), and avoidance of urethral catheterisation improve outcomes in children with HC. METHODS: A retrospective case note review was performed of all patients treated for HC in our hospital from 2002 to 2010. A protocol for the management of HC was introduced in 2007 advocating early detection, use of SPP, and avoidance of urethral catheterisation. Data collected on each patient included primary condition, medications at onset, blood transfusions, duration of symptoms, catheter usage, and outcome. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and Fisher's Exact test as appropriate, P < .05 being significant. RESULTS: Five patients were treated using protocol with 5 historical controls. There was no significant difference between the ages of the group, diagnosis, and treatment at onset of HC. In the historical group, 4 of 5 died with HC, but all recovered in the protocol group (P < .05). Blood transfusion requirements were also significantly reduced after protocol introduction (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Early identification, avoidance of urethral catheterisation, and use of SPP significantly reduces blood transfusion requirements and mortality from HC.","['Duthie, Gillian', 'Whyte, Lisa', 'Chandran, Harish', 'Lawson, Sarah', 'Velangi, Mark', 'McCarthy, Liam']","['Duthie G', 'Whyte L', 'Chandran H', 'Lawson S', 'Velangi M', 'McCarthy L']","[""Department of Paediatric Urology, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Steelhouse Lane, B6 4NH Birmingham, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/06/29 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-3468(11)01017-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2011.11.037 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2012 Feb;47(2):375-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2011.11.037.,['Crown Copyright (c) 2012.

Eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders (EGID), including eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE), is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with various GI symptoms. We report a case of a 50-year-old male who developed Isospora superinfection of the small bowel while receiving systemic corticosteroids for EGE. He presented with worsening diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting with worsening peripheral eosinophilia. I. belli infection was diagnosed by the detection of oocysts in stool samples and by the presence of the parasite on duodenal biopsy in the background of tissue eosinophilia. I. belli can cause severe chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients on corticosteroids. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole often provided rapid cure. Even though peripheral blood eosinophilia was seen in both EGE and Isospora infection, the identification of subnuclear protozoal inclusions as a new histologic finding, as well as the absence of this finding in previous duodenal biopsies coupled with the continued presence of tissue eosinophilia, favored a parasitic superinfection in the setting of underlying EGE.","['Navaneethan, Udayakumar', 'Venkatesh, Preethi G K', 'Downs-Kelly, Erinn', 'Shen, Bo']","['Navaneethan U', 'Venkatesh PG', 'Downs-Kelly E', 'Shen B']","['Digestive Disease Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Crohns Colitis,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,101318676,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1873-9946(11)00214-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.crohns.2011.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Crohns Colitis. 2012 Mar;6(2):236-9. doi: 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.08.010.

Defects in their function result in muscular dystrophy, neuronal diseases and leukemia in humans. In contrast to the animal lineage, where genes encoding both active and inactive myotubularins (phosphoinositide 3-phosphatases) have appeared and proliferated in the basal metazoan group, myotubularin genes are not found in the unicellular relatives of green plants. However, they are present in land plants encoding proteins highly similar to the active metazoan enzymes. Despite their remarkable structural conservation, plant and animal myotubularins have significantly diverged in their functions. While loss of myotubularin function causes severe disease phenotypes in humans it is not essential for the cellular homeostasis under normal conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana. Instead, myotubularin deficiency is associated with altered tolerance to dehydration stress. The two Arabidopsis genes AtMTM1 and AtMTM2 have originated from a segmental chromosomal duplication and encode catalytically active enzymes. However, only AtMTM1 is involved in elevating the cellular level of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate in response to dehydration stress, and the two myotubularins differentially affect the Arabidopsis dehydration stress-responding transcriptome. AtMTM1 and AtMTM2 display different localization patterns in the cell, consistent with the idea that they associate with different membranes to perform specific functions. A single amino acid mutation in AtMTM2 (L250W) results in a dramatic loss of subcellular localization. Mutations in this region are linked to disease conditions in humans.","['Ding, Yong', 'Ndamukong, Ivan', 'Zhao, Yang', 'Xia, Yuannan', 'Riethoven, Jean-Jack', 'Jones, David R', 'Divecha, Nullin', 'Avramova, Zoya']","['Ding Y', 'Ndamukong I', 'Zhao Y', 'Xia Y', 'Riethoven JJ', 'Jones DR', 'Divecha N', 'Avramova Z']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska at Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68588, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Plant J,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,9207397,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04936.x [doi]'],ppublish,Plant J. 2012 Jun;70(5):866-78. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04936.x.

Apoptosis is particularly well studied in hematological neoplasms, thus these varied diseases present opportunities for pro-apoptotic drug development both as single agents and in combination with established therapies. Accordingly, several agents targeting function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members have entered clinical trials in the last decade and are discussed. AREAS COVERED: The pan Bcl-2 family member BH3 domain mimetic obatoclax (GX15-070) is currently under clinical evaluation in solid tumors and hematological neoplasms. This agent offers the attractive property of uniformly inhibiting all of the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family. Its chemistry and preclinical development and activity are reviewed. Pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, drug resistance and clinical use of this agent in leukemias and lymphomas are discussed. The prospects for obatoclax in changing clinical practice are addressed. EXPERT OPINION: Obatoclax may not prove to have dramatic single agent activity for hematological neoplasms. It seems more likely that its activity will be manifest in combination therapy with other agents, particularly cytotoxic chemotherapies. Results of ongoing studies are awaited.","['Joudeh, Jamal', 'Claxton, David']","['Joudeh J', 'Claxton D']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Division, Penn State College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/06/02 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.652302 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Mar;21(3):363-73. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.652302.

PATIENT AND METHODS: We describe here a patient with mast cell leukemia characterized by 42% of circulating mast cells associated with a previously unidentified c-Kit mutation in adult mastocytosis: dup(501-502). MAIN FINDINGS: This patient was treated with masitinib, a novel c-Kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with a dramatic response observed following 3 months of treatment, including clinical improvement, disappearance of circulating mast cells, and decrease in both serum histamine and tryptase levels. In vitro and ex vivo research was performed on the patient's cells and revealed constitutive c-Kit phosphorylation in mast cell leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of sequencing all c-Kit exons when the classical D816V c-Kit mutation is not found, even in adults with SM. It also indicates that masitinib may be safe and effective for the treatment for some mast cell leukemia.","['Georgin-Lavialle, Sophie', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Yang, Ying', 'Letard, Sebastien', 'Hanssens, Katia', 'Feger, Frederic', 'Renand, Amedee', 'Brouze, Chantal', 'Canioni, Danielle', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Chandesris, Marie-Olivia', 'Aouba, Achille', 'Gineste, Paul', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Mansfield, Colin D', 'Moussy, Alain', 'Lepelletier, Yves', 'Dubreuil, Patrice', 'Hermine, Olivier']","['Georgin-Lavialle S', 'Lhermitte L', 'Suarez F', 'Yang Y', 'Letard S', 'Hanssens K', 'Feger F', 'Renand A', 'Brouze C', 'Canioni D', 'Asnafi V', 'Chandesris MO', 'Aouba A', 'Gineste P', 'Macintyre E', 'Mansfield CD', 'Moussy A', 'Lepelletier Y', 'Dubreuil P', 'Hermine O']","['Centre de Reference des Mastocytoses, Faculte de Medecine et AP-HP Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01761.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Jul;89(1):47-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01761.x.

The patient had no history of previous vesicular eruption. She developed a painful burning sensation on the neck. Clinical examination revealed a cluster of small erythematous firm papules and plaques in a zosteriform distribution on the left ear, face, neck, and shoulder (Figure 1A). The lesions were unilateral and did not cross the midline. Multiple cervical and axillary lymph nodes were palpable. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in white blood cells of 25,000/mm3, with 17,910/mm3 lymphocytes and a normal range of hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and liver enzymes. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 87 mm. Blood smear results showed small, morphologically mature lymphocyte cells. In immune phenotyping, lymphocyte cells co-express CD5 and B-cell-surface antigens CD19 and CD23, as well as a restriction of kappa immunoglobulin light chains. The cells were CD22-, CD79b-, CD38-, CD10-, CD25- and FMC7-. Computed thoracoabominal tomography revealed cervical, mediastinal, abdominal, and pelvic adenopathy confirming the diagnosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) stage B. Histology of a skin biopsy from a papule showed a dense nodular granulomatous infiltrate in the dermis (Figure 2A). The infiltrate contained epithelioid and giant cells surrounded by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Small monomorphic lymphocytes without mitotic figures predominated (Figure 2B). The epidermis was irregularly thickened. Immunohistology revealed a polymorphous infiltrate with a phenotype of reactive T lymphocytes (CD3, CD5 positive) (Figure 2C), B lymphocytes (CD20 positive) (Figure 2D). Epithelioid and giant cells were positive for CD68 (Figure 2E). A latent herpes zoster infection with granulomatous reaction at the site ofzoster lesions was highly suspected as the patient reported a unilateral burning sensation without a history of vesicular zosteriform eruption. She received treatment with intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours. The papular lesions resolved markedly (60%) on macular plaques at the end of the treatment. Following topical treatment with corticosteroids, the lesions healed completely within 4 weeks (Figure 1B). Concerning leukemia, our patient was monitored without therapy by the hematologist.","['Trojjet, Sondes', 'Hammami, Houda', 'Zaraa, Ines', 'Bouzguarrou, Alia', 'Joens, Meriem', 'Haouet, Slim', 'Ben Osman, Amel', 'Mokni, Mourad']","['Trojjet S', 'Hammami H', 'Zaraa I', 'Bouzguarrou A', 'Joens M', 'Haouet S', 'Ben Osman A', 'Mokni M']","['Department of Dermatology, La Rabat Hospital, Tunis Tunisia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Skinmed,Skinmed,101168327,2012/02/14 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2012/02/14 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Skinmed. 2012 Jan-Feb;10(1):50-2.,,,['X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)'],IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Skin Diseases, Viral/*diagnosis/drug therapy/virology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These progenitors can respond to injury, but their ability to proliferate, migrate, differentiate, and survive is usually insufficient to replace lost cells and restore normal function. Potentiating the progenitor response with exogenous factors is an attractive strategy for the treatment of nervous system injuries and neurodegenerative and demyelinating disorders. Previously, we reported that delivery of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to the CNS stimulates the self-renewal of neural stem cells and the proliferation of parenchymal glial progenitors. Here we identify these parenchymal glia as oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitor cells (OPCs) and show that LIF delivery stimulates their proliferation through the activation of gp130 receptor signaling within these cells. Importantly, this effect of LIF on OPC proliferation can be harnessed to enhance the generation of OLs that express myelin proteins and reform nodes of Ranvier in the context of chronic demyelination in the adult mouse hippocampus. Our findings, considered together with the known beneficial effects of LIF on OL and neuron survival, suggest that LIF has both reparative and protective activities that make it a promising potential therapy for CNS demyelinating disorders and injuries.","['Deverman, Benjamin E', 'Patterson, Paul H']","['Deverman BE', 'Patterson PH']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['32/6/2100 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3803-11.2012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2012 Feb 8;32(6):2100-9. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3803-11.2012.,,,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hippocampus/cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myelin Sheath/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neurogenesis/physiology', 'Oligodendroglia/pathology/*physiology', ""Ranvier's Nodes/pathology/physiology"", 'Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology']",,,"['R01 NS045744-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045744-01A1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045744/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045744-06/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS045744/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045744-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045744-05A2/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045744-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3561904,,,['NIHMS357143'],,,,,,,,,,,

The evolutionary explanation for how these polymorphisms are maintained has been controversial. One leading explanation, antagonistic coevolution (also known as the Red Queen), postulates a never-ending molecular arms race where pathogens evolve to evade immune recognition by common MHC alleles, which in turn provides a selective advantage to hosts carrying rare MHC alleles. This cyclical process leads to negative frequency-dependent selection and promotes MHC diversity if two conditions are met: (i) pathogen adaptation must produce trade-offs that result in pathogen fitness being higher in familiar (i.e., host MHC genotype adapted to) vs. unfamiliar host MHC genotypes; and (ii) this adaptation must produce correlated patterns of virulence (i.e., disease severity). Here we test these fundamental assumptions using an experimental evolutionary approach (serial passage). We demonstrate rapid adaptation and virulence evolution of a mouse-specific retrovirus to its mammalian host across multiple MHC genotypes. Critically, this adaptive response results in trade-offs (i.e., antagonistic pleiotropy) between host MHC genotypes; both viral fitness and virulence is substantially higher in familiar versus unfamiliar MHC genotypes. These data are unique in experimentally confirming the requisite conditions of the antagonistic coevolution model of MHC evolution and providing quantification of fitness effects for pathogen and host. These data help explain the unprecedented diversity of MHC genes, including how disease-causing alleles are maintained.","['Kubinak, Jason L', 'Ruff, James S', 'Hyzer, Cornelius Whitney', 'Slev, Patricia R', 'Potts, Wayne K']","['Kubinak JL', 'Ruff JS', 'Hyzer CW', 'Slev PR', 'Potts WK']","['Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA. jason.kubinak@path.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1112633109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1112633109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 28;109(9):3422-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1112633109.

Various somatic mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. Recently, mutations in a gene encoding a spliceosomal protein, SF3B1, were discovered in a distinct form of MDS with ring sideroblasts. Whole exome sequencing of 15 patients with myeloid neoplasms was performed, and somatic mutations in spliceosomal genes were identified. Sanger sequencing of 310 patients was performed to assess phenotype/genotype associations. To determine the functional effect of spliceosomal mutations, we evaluated pre-mRNA splicing profiles by RNA deep sequencing. We identified additional somatic mutations in spliceosomal genes, including SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2. These mutations alter pre-mRNA splicing patterns. SF3B1 mutations are prevalent in low-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts, whereas U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations are frequent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and advanced forms of MDS. SF3B1 mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations are predictive for shorter survival. Mutations affecting spliceosomal genes that result in defective splicing are a new leukemogenic pathway.

Here we show that a novel immune receptor, T-cell Ig and mucin-containing domain-3 (Tim-3), is expressed on resting human NK cells and is up-regulated on activation. The NK92 NK-cell line engineered to overexpress Tim-3 showed a marked increase in IFN-gamma production in the presence of soluble rhGal-9 or Raji tumor cells engineered to express Gal-9. The Tim-3(+) population of low-dose IL-12/IL-18-activated primary NK cells significantly increased IFN-gamma production in response to soluble rhGal-9, Gal-9 presented by cell lines, and primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) targets that endogenously express Gal-9. This effect is highly specific as Tim-3 Ab blockade significantly decreased IFN-gamma production, and Tim-3 cross-linking induced ERK activation and degradation of IkappaBalpha. Exposure to Gal-9-expressing target cells had little effect on CD107a degranulation. Reconstituted NK cells obtained from patients after hematopoietic cell transplantation had diminished expression of Tim-3 compared with paired donors.

FLT3/ITD mutations have also been observed in myelodysplastic syndrome patients both before and during progression to AML. Previous work has shown that insertion of an FLT3/ITD mutation into the murine Flt3 gene induces a myeloproliferative neoplasm, but not progression to acute leukemia, suggesting that additional cooperating events are required. We therefore combined the FLT3/ITD mutation with a model of myelodysplastic syndrome involving transgenic expression of the Nup98-HoxD13 (NHD13) fusion gene. Mice expressing both the FLT3/ITD and NHD13 transgene developed AML with 100% penetrance and short latency. These leukemias were driven by mutant FLT3 expression and were susceptible to treatment with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We also observed a spontaneous loss of the wild-type Flt3 allele in these AMLs, further modeling the loss of the heterozygosity phenomenon that is seen in human AML with FLT3-activating mutations. Because resistance to FLT3 inhibitors remains an important clinical issue, this model may help identify new molecular targets in collaborative signaling pathways.","['Greenblatt, Sarah', 'Li, Li', 'Slape, Christopher', 'Nguyen, Bao', 'Novak, Rachel', 'Duffield, Amy', 'Huso, David', 'Desiderio, Stephen', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Aplan, Peter', 'Small, Donald']","['Greenblatt S', 'Li L', 'Slape C', 'Nguyen B', 'Novak R', 'Duffield A', 'Huso D', 'Desiderio S', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Aplan P', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49221-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-382283 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 22;119(12):2883-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-382283.

CT antigen expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. This contrasts with other types of lymphoma or leukemia, which scarcely express these CT antigens. Humoral immune responses, particularly against NY-ESO-1, were detected in 11.6% (5 of 43) and NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were observed in 55.6% (5 of 9) of ATLL patients.

The SCF (Skip-Cullin1-F-box protein) E3 ligase family provides homeostatic feedback control of cell division by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of cell-cycle proteins. By screening several previously undescribed E3 ligase components, we describe the behavior of a relatively new SCF subunit, termed FBXL2, that ubiquitinates and destabilizes cyclin D2 protein leading to G(0) phase arrest and apoptosis in leukemic and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. FBXL2 expression was strongly suppressed, and yet cyclin D2 protein levels were robustly expressed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient samples. Depletion of endogenous FBXL2 stabilized cyclin D2 levels, whereas ectopically expressed FBXL2 decreased cyclin D2 lifespan. FBXL2 did not bind a phosphodegron within its substrate, which is typical of other F-box proteins, but uniquely targeted a calmodulin-binding signature within cyclin D2 to facilitate its polyubiquitination. Calmodulin competes with the F-box protein for access to this motif where it bound and protected cyclin D2 from FBXL2. Calmodulin reversed FBXL2-induced G(0) phase arrest and attenuated FBXL2-induced apoptosis of lymphoblastoid cells. These results suggest an antiproliferative effect of SCF(FBXL2) in lymphoproliferative malignancies.","['Chen, Bill B', 'Glasser, Jennifer R', 'Coon, Tiffany A', 'Zou, Chunbin', 'Miller, Hannah L', 'Fenton, Moon', 'McDyer, John F', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Mallampalli, Rama K']","['Chen BB', 'Glasser JR', 'Coon TA', 'Zou C', 'Miller HL', 'Fenton M', 'McDyer JF', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Mallampalli RK']","['Department of Medicine, Acute Lung Injury Center of Excellence, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49183-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-358911 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 29;119(13):3132-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-358911.

Here we show that the cells of origin of both, BCR/ABL-induced chronic myeloid (CML) and B-cell acute lymphoid leukaemia (B-ALL), resemble long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs). During disease-maintenance, CML LT-HSCs persist to function as cancer stem cells (CSCs) that maintain leukaemia and require signalling by the transcription factor STAT5. In contrast, B-ALL LT-HSCs differentiate into CSCs that correspond to pro-B cells. This transition step requires a transient IL-7 signal and is lost in IL-7Ralpha-deficient cells.

The capacity of melanoma to develop in young patients is reflected by the rather alarming statistic that it has become one of the top causes of death in both men and women between the ages of 25 and 40 (3). Indeed, among Caucasian females, melanoma is the leading cause of death from malignancy between the ages of 25 and 29 (3).

Recently, in an examination of various types of mesenchymal tumor, IDH1/2 mutations were only found in cartilaginous tumors including central conventional and periosteal enchondromas/chondrosarcomas. The frequency of IDH1/2 mutations was 56%, and the IDH1 R132C mutation, which is not common in diffuse gliomas or AML, accounted for 40% of these mutations. In this study, we investigated the IDH1/2 mutation status of intracranial chondrosarcomas and chordomas, which are morphologically similar and affect similar regions of the cranial cavity. Of the 13 chondrosarcomas analyzed, six (46.1%) displayed IDH1/2 mutations (the predominant type was IDH1 R132C). Also, an IDH2 mutation (R172S) was observed in one case. Conversely, none of the ten chordomas analyzed displayed any IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Our data suggest that the IDH1/2 mutation status could be valuable for distinguishing intracranial chondrosarcomas from chordomas.","['Arai, Motohiro', 'Nobusawa, Sumihito', 'Ikota, Hayato', 'Takemura, Sunao', 'Nakazato, Yoichi']","['Arai M', 'Nobusawa S', 'Ikota H', 'Takemura S', 'Nakazato Y']","['Department of Human Pathology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Brain Tumor Pathol,Brain tumor pathology,9716507,2012/02/11 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10014-012-0085-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Brain Tumor Pathol. 2012 Oct;29(4):201-6. doi: 10.1007/s10014-012-0085-1.

The role of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) and the proper time for its performance are controversial. The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency and nature of specific diagnoses revealed by FOB. Children with leukemia submitted to FOB because of suspicion of pulmonary involvement (mainly pneumonia) were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 33 FOB procedures performed in 31 patients (20 males) with an average age of 9.4 years (range, 3.5 to 15 y) were evaluated. Microorganisms isolated from 21 (63.6%) bronchoalveolar lavage samples were mainly fungi including Candida in 13 cases (39.4%) and Aspergillus in 3 cases (9.1%). Isolation rate in 10 procedures performed within the first 3 days was 90%. Tracheobronchitis was present in > 50% of patients, pulmonary hemorrhage was seen in 7 (21.0%) patients, and leukemic infiltration was demonstrated in 2 patients (6.1%), among other conditions visualized by FOB. Complications of FOB were minimal and transient. Our study suggests that FOB is a useful and safe procedure in patients with leukemia and pulmonary infiltrates. The earlier the FOB was performed, the higher the isolation rate of causative agents. In addition, this procedure allowed the identification of noninfectious airway comorbidities.

A global gene expression profile of 24,500 genes was performed on MOLT-4 tumor cells following exposure to 5 Gy of ionizing radiation ((60)Co) using a bead chip array (Illumina). Signaling pathways and processes significantly altered following irradiation were explored using MetaCore. Cellular viability [3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide], activation of cell cycle checkpoints [fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)], and induction of apoptosis (FACS, caspase assays) were evaluated to correlate these biological responses to the gene expression changes. Totally, 698 different genes displayed a significantly altered expression following radiation, and out of these transcripts, all but one showed increased expression. One hour following irradiation, the expression was changed only for a few genes. Striking changes appeared at later time-points. From 3 to 24 h post-irradiation, a significant fraction of the genes with altered expression were found to be involved in cell cycle checkpoints and their regulation (CDKN1A), DNA repair (GADD45A, DDB2, XPC), apoptosis induction (DR5, FasR, Apo-2L, Bax), and T-cell activation/proliferation (CD70, OX40L). Irradiated MOLT-4 cells were arrested at the G2-checkpoint, followed by a decrease in cell viability, most pronounced 48 h after exposure. The cell death was executed by induced apoptosis and was visualized by an increase in subG1 cells and an increased activation of initiator (caspase-8 and caspase-9) and execution (caspase-3) caspases. Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis correlated well in time with the changes in gene expression of those genes important for these biological processes. Activation of the apoptotic signaling pathways in MOLT-4 cells following irradiation includes components from the intrinsic as well as the extrinsic apoptotic pathways. This study indicates that the altered gene expression pattern induced by irradiation is important for the sequential steps observed in MOLT-4 cells during apoptosis induction.","['Lindgren, Theres', 'Stigbrand, Torgny', 'Riklund, Katrine', 'Johansson, Lennart', 'Eriksson, David']","['Lindgren T', 'Stigbrand T', 'Riklund K', 'Johansson L', 'Eriksson D']","['Department of Immunology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-012-0329-z [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2012 Jun;33(3):689-700. doi: 10.1007/s13277-012-0329-z.

We have tested 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), an inhibitor of pyruvate-associated reactions. Firstly, we tested this agent, in vitro, in two mesothelioma cell lines. Cellular response would appear to depend on the mode of administration (immediately or 24 h after seeding). Depending on the line, 3-BrPA induced a cytostatic or cytotoxic effect. This effect was accompanied by cell death induction even in cells highly refractory to cisplatin. Mitochondrial apoptotic death appeared to involve both lines; however, a different death pathway such as necrosis cannot be excluded. Interestingly, 3-BrPA leads to a diminution of the expression of the anti-apotptoic protein Mcl-1. We then tested 3-BrPA in vivo. Survival of nude mice bearing human mesothelioma was significantly prolonged (p < 0.0001). Toxicity and clinical studies should be performed to test 3- BrPA as local therapy for patients suffering from pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma. Association with cisplatin should be particularly considered.","['Icard, Philippe', 'Zhang, Xiao-Dong', 'Lemoisson, Edwige', 'Louis, Marie-Helene', 'Allouche, Stephane', 'Lincet, Hubert', 'Poulain, Laurent']","['Icard P', 'Zhang XD', 'Lemoisson E', 'Louis MH', 'Allouche S', 'Lincet H', 'Poulain L']","['Service de Chirurgie Thoracique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Caen Basse-Normandie, Avenue de la Cote de Nacre, Caen 14000, France. icard-p@chu-caen.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bioenerg Biomembr,Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes,7701859,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2011/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10863-012-9415-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bioenerg Biomembr. 2012 Feb;44(1):81-90. doi: 10.1007/s10863-012-9415-6.

SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(+)-dependent histone/protein deacetylase, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, such as aging, metabolism, neurogenesis and apoptosis, owing to its ability to deacetylate numerous substrates, such as histone and NF-kappaB, which is implicated as an exacerbation factor in ATL. Here, we assessed how SIRT1 is regulated in primary ATL cells and leukemic cell lines. SIRT1 expression in ATL patients was significantly higher than that in healthy controls, especially in the acute type. Sirtinol, a SIRT1 inhibitor, induced significant growth inhibition or apoptosis in cells from ATL patients and leukemic cell lines, especially HTLV-1-related cell lines. Sirtinol-induced apoptosis was mediated by activation of the caspase family and degradation of SIRT1 in the nucleus.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed 463 patients with CLL with available immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene status and B-cell receptor (BCR) configuration [heavy-chain complementary-determining region 3 (HCDR3)], of whom thirty-six developed ITP, according to previously defined criteria. Most of them had available cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: We observed a significant association between ITP occurrence and IGHV unmutated gene status (P < 0.0001), unfavorable cytogenetic lesions (P = 0.005), and stereotyped HCDR3 (P = 0.006). The more frequent stereotyped HCDR3 subsets were #1 (IGHV1-5-7/IGHD6-19/IGHJ4; 16 of 16 unmutated) and #7 (IGHV1-69 or IGHV3-30/IGHD3-3/IGHJ6; 13 of 13 unmutated), both being significantly more represented among patients developing ITP (P = 0.003 and P = 0.001, respectively). Moreover, restricting the analysis to unmutated patients, subset #7 confirmed its independent significant association with the occurrence of ITP (P = 0.013). Both unmutated IGHV mutational status, del(11)(q23) and stereotyped BCR were significantly associated with shorter time to ITP development (P < 0.0001, P = 0.02, and P = 0.005, respectively) than other patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that patients with CLL and peculiar BCR conformations are at higher risk of developing secondary ITP and that stereotyped BCR may be involved in the pathogenesis of this complication.","['Visco, Carlo', 'Maura, Francesco', 'Tuana, Giacomo', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Novella, Elisabetta', 'Giaretta, Ilaria', 'Reda, Gianluigi', 'Barcellini, Wilma', 'Baldini, Luca', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino']","['Visco C', 'Maura F', 'Tuana G', 'Agnelli L', 'Lionetti M', 'Fabris S', 'Novella E', 'Giaretta I', 'Reda G', 'Barcellini W', 'Baldini L', 'Neri A', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Cortelezzi A']","['Department of Hematology, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-3019 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3019 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Apr 1;18(7):1870-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3019.

Drug resistance and tumor recurrence have become major problems for the treatment of this disease. Therefore, new therapeutic methods need to be developed. Antigens expressed on the surface of cancer cells are potential targets for antibody-mediated drug delivery. In our study, an anti-CML cell single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody has been produced and characterized because it is the first step towards the construction of a novel cancer-targeted agent for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, a 46 kDa antibody derivative was produced by genetic fusion of a humanized scFv antibody against a CML cell surface antigen with the 6xHis-tag, which can specifically bind to CML cells. The recombinant scFv against CML cells was expressed as a fusion protein containing the 6xHis-tag at its N-termini, and purified by Ni2+-NTA column chromatography. The recombinant scFv, which was soluble, was expressed and produced in bacteria, and was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot assays. Finally, its cell-binding activity and immunoactivity were demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that this scFv specifically targeted CML cells expressing the associated antigen (47.9 and 34.4%) other than non-expressing tumor cells (1.25%) in vitro. The results presented in this study illustrate that the humanized anti-CML cell scFv antibody may function as a novel therapeutic tool for CML.","['Zhu, Xiaoying', 'Wang, Dong', 'Li, Shenfeng', 'Xiao, Qing', 'Tao, Kun', 'Hu, Jing', 'Cao, Weixi', 'Feng, Wenli']","['Zhu X', 'Wang D', 'Li S', 'Xiao Q', 'Tao K', 'Hu J', 'Cao W', 'Feng W']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

METHODS: By 4/5-color multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC, CD45/SSC gating) for detecting MRD at pre-(day-30) and post-transplant (day +30, +60, +100, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months), the investigators retrospectively analyzed the MRD levels and the prognosis of 90 high-risk patients. According to the MRD cutoff value of 0.1%, the low-level and high-level groups were defined. In the high-level group, the patients were divided into two sub groups according to the subsequent treatment (intervention therapy group and non-intervention therapy group). RESULTS: MRD pre-transplant had no predictive value for the clinical outcome. The patients with high levels of MRD post-transplant (+60 d and +100 d) showed higher relapse rates than those of the low-level group. In addition, regarding MRD +100 d post-transplant, differences were significant among 3 groups (high-level MRD and intervention therapy group, high-level MRD and non-intervention therapy group and low-level MRD group) including 1-year relapse-free survival (RFS) (100% vs 60.87% vs 91.30%, P < 0.05) and 3-year RFS (85.71% vs 44.72% vs 68.48%, P < 0.05). The median time from first high level MRD detected to clinical relapse was 2.5 (1 - 26) months. In the high level MRD group (+100 d post-transplant), 7 of 30 patients received intervention therapy without relapse. However another 23 patients had no intervention treatment and 11 of them relapsed latter (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The MFC-based quantification of MRD post-transplant reveals important prognostic information in patients with high-risk AL. MRD check point at day +100 (cutoff: 0.1%) may discriminate different risk populations. Those patients with MRD levels >/= 0.1% should receive early intervention at an early stage and a low tumor burden so as to reduce the relapse rate and boost survival.","['Shi, Xiao-lan', 'Tang, Xiao-wen', 'Wei, Xiao-ai', 'Zhao, Bing-rui', 'Zhou, Qian-lan', 'Ye, Fan', 'Lu, Yu-xia', 'Sun, Xing-wei', 'Zhu, Ming-qing', 'Shen, Wen-hong', 'Qiu, Hui-ying', 'Sun, Ai-ning', 'Wu, De-pei']","['Shi XL', 'Tang XW', 'Wei XA', 'Zhao BR', 'Zhou QL', 'Ye F', 'Lu YX', 'Sun XW', 'Zhu MQ', 'Shen WH', 'Qiu HY', 'Sun AN', 'Wu DP']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology; Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Oct 18;91(38):2692-6.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of PARP1 activity is considered a potentially important strategy in clinical practice, especially to sensitize tumor cells to chemo- and radio-therapy. Here we examined the influence of inhibition of PARP1 on formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and on DNA repair in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). K562 (human myelogenous leukaemia) cells were grown and exposed to 4 or 12 Gy of ionizing radiation in presence or absence of the PARP inhibitor NU1025 (100 muM). Intracellular ROS were assayed using the probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescein with detection by flow cytometry and the rejoining of DNA strand breaks were followed by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assays. In untreated cells a significant increase in PAR formation occurred during the first 5 min after IR, followed by a gradual decrease up to 30 min. Addition of a PARP inhibitor arrested the production of PAR almost completely and decreased the rate of rejoining of DNA strand breaks significantly; however, 3h after irradiation we observed no difference in the amount of DNA strand breaks between PARP inhibitor-treated and untreated cells. Twelve to 48 h after irradiation, an increase of ROS concentration was observed in irradiated cells and ROS levels in PARP inhibitor-treated cells were significantly higher than in cells without inhibitor. Irradiated cells grown in the presence or absence of PARP inhibitor did not differ in the frequencies of apoptotic and necrotic cells or in the activity of caspases at 24, 48 and 72 h after irradiation. Poly(ADP-ribosylation) and inhibition of PARP1 appeared to modulate DNA strand break rejoining and influence the concentration of ROS in irradiated cells.","['Cieslar-Pobuda, Artur', 'Saenko, Yuriy', 'Rzeszowska-Wolny, Joanna']","['Cieslar-Pobuda A', 'Saenko Y', 'Rzeszowska-Wolny J']","['Biosystems Group, Institute of Automatic Control, Silesian University of Technology, Akademicka 16, 44-100 Gliwice, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,2012/02/11 06:00,2015/04/29 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0027-5107(12)00040-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2012.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2012 Apr 1;732(1-2):9-15. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2012.01.005.

Mononuclear cells were isolated and B cells purified with a CD19(+) magnetic-bead system. Total RNA was extracted from purified CD19(+) cells and the expression of microRNA-223 measured by TaqMan microRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The clinical data of these patients were collected and their outcomes analyzed with SPSS 16.0 software. RESULTS: (1) The levels of microRNA-223 in CLL, MCL and SMZL were 4.58 +/- 0.62, 4.03 +/- 0.54 and 4.63 +/- 0.57 respectively. And they were significantly lower than that in normal B cells (5.69 +/- 0.60, P < 0.01). The expression of microRNA-223 decreased significantly in MCL versus CLL and SMZL (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between CLL and SMZL (P > 0.05). (2) The down-regulation of microRNA-223 was associated with disease aggressiveness in CLL. Patients with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) expressed significantly a lower level of microRNA-223 (4.05 +/- 0.69 vs 4.67 +/- 0.51, P = 0.003). In 13q-negative patients, the expression of microRNA-223 decreased more significantly than that in 13q-positive patients (4.25 +/- 0.67 vs 4.76 +/- 0.45, P = 0.044). (3) Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the microRNA-223 cutoffs were defined according to the IgVH mutational status. The patients were divided into the positive and negative subgroups. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of microRNA-223 positive patient subgroup was 48 months. It was significantly longer than the negative subgroup (P = 0.001). In the microRNA-223 positive subgroup, no patient died at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNA-223 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of B lymphoproliferative disorders. The down-regulation of microRNA-223 is associated with disease aggressiveness and poor prognostic factors in CLL. It may become a new reliable prognostic predictor.","['Zhou, Ke-Shu', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Yi, Shu-Hua', 'Li, Zeng-Jun', 'An, Gang', 'Wang, Yan-Ying', 'Zou, De-Hui', 'Qi, Jun-Yuan', 'Zhao, Yao-Zhong', 'Song, Yong-Ping', 'Qiu, Lu-Gui']","['Zhou KS', 'Yu Z', 'Yi SH', 'Li ZJ', 'An G', 'Wang YY', 'Zou DH', 'Qi JY', 'Zhao YZ', 'Song YP', 'Qiu LG']","['Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC,State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,2012/02/11 06:00,2016/04/24 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Sep 13;91(34):2384-7.,,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', '*Lymphoproliferative Disorders', '*MicroRNAs/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From April 2007 to November 2010, 20 patients of descending aortic pseudoaneurysm were treated. There were 18 male and 2 female, aged from 28 to 82 years with a mean of (58 +/- 16) years. In this group, 4 patients were diagnosed as Behcet's syndrome, 6 patients as mycotic pseudoaneurysms with positive blood culture, 6 patients as suspected mycotic pseudoaneurysms, 1 patient with iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm and 1 patient with chronic grain-mononuclear cell leukemia, the other 3 patients with unknown reasons. The 88.5% of aortic pseudoaneurysms were located at abdominal aorta. Fifteen patients underwent endovascular therapy and 2 patients were treated by traditional open surgery. The other 3 patients underwent conservative treatments. The data of treatments and follow-up in the 15 patients who received endovascular repairs were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Endovascular therapy was performed successfully on the 15 patients, and the technique successful rate was 15/15. Total 15 stents were transluminal placed including 6 bifurcate stent-grafts, 6 abdominal straight stent-grafts, 2 thoracic straight stent-grafts and 1 abdominal bare stent. One patient was treated by stent assisted embolization. Perioperative mortality rate was 0. Only 2 primary type IV endoleaks were found. Fourteen patients were successfully followed up. During a mean follow-up of 538 days, 8 (57.1%) patients were uneventful. Six (42.9%) patients were complicated by aneurysm related events, including 4 (28.6%) aneurysm-related deaths, 1 (7.14%) with delayed endoleak and 1 (7.14%) with recurrent pseudoaneurysm which was retreated by another stent-graft. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular therapy for descending aortic pseudoaneurysms is a feasible and mini-invasive option with high technique success rate and low perioperative mortality rate. However, risk of recurrence and rupture to death of pseudoaneurysm remains high during follow-up. Treating the underlying reasons and intensively follow-up may be good for improving the prognosis of descending aortic pseudoaneurysms treated by endovascular therapy.","['Chen, Yue-xin', 'Liu, Chang-wei', 'Li, Yong-jun', 'Zheng, Yue-hong', 'Ye, Wei', 'Liu, Bao', 'Shao, Jiang', 'Zeng, Rong', 'Wu, Wei-wei', 'Song, Xiao-jun']","['Chen YX', 'Liu CW', 'Li YJ', 'Zheng YH', 'Ye W', 'Liu B', 'Shao J', 'Zeng R', 'Wu WW', 'Song XJ']","['Department of Vascular Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing 100730, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",China,Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery],0153611,2012/02/11 06:00,2013/03/19 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2011 Oct 1;49(10):897-902.,,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aneurysm, False/*surgery', '*Aorta, Thoracic', 'Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stents']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Polymorphism were determined by a case-control study through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry method of Mass-ASSAY platform in 114 confirmed ALL cases and 169 age- and sex-matched controls, so as to compare the relationship between different genotypes and ALL risk. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals carrying at least one 23G variant allele (AG/GG genotypes) had a significantly increased risk for ALL (adjusted OR 2.02; 95%CI 1.08 - 3.78) compared with the wild-type genotype (23AA), and evidence that positive interactions between the polymorphisms in XPC C499T and XPA A23G might occur. Furthermore, individuals with both putative risk genotypes had a significantly higher risk (adjusted OR 5.60; 95%CI 1.57 - 19.90), compared with those with both wild-genotypes. By contrast, no significant association was observed between the XPD T751G, XRCC1 G399A, C194T polymorphism and ALL risk.

It has been suggested such events may serve as critical check points. METHODS: The present study analyzed the methylation status of CpG islands within the promoters of secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) in 87 acute leukemia (AL) patients, 20 normal controls, and four AL cell lines. 5-aza-2'- deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was employed to determine its effect on SFRP expression. RESULT: Methylation of at least one SFRP promoter was observed in 69% of the AL patients analyzed. In addition, methylation of all four SFRP promoters was observed in Molt-4, Jurkat, HL60 and NB4 cells. In Jurkat cells, methylation levels of four SFRP promoters decreased in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with 5-Aza-CdR, which coincided with increased mRNA expression. With increasing 5-Aza-CdR concentrations, the expression of DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that SFRP gene methylation may be involved in AL progression, with a possible epigenetic mechanism influencing Wnt signaling.","['Shen, Jian-Zhen', 'Xu, Cheng-Bo', 'Fu, Hai-Ying', 'Wu, Dang-Sen', 'Zhou, Hua-Rong', 'Fan, Li-Ping']","['Shen JZ', 'Xu CB', 'Fu HY', 'Wu DS', 'Zhou HR', 'Fan LP']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fuzhou, China. jianzhen_shen@126.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/06/29 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2011;12(10):2617-21.,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SFRP1 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP2 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP4 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP5 protein, human)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'China', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eye Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Frizzled Receptors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations in microRNAs (miRNAs) expression have been proposed to play a role in CLL pathogenesis. Dicer and Drosha are the main regulators of miRNA biogenesis, and deregulation of their expression has been indicated as a possible cause of miRNA alterations observed in various cancers. To investigate the role of Dicer and Drosha in CLL, we assessed the expression of Dicer and Drosha and their correlation with other prognostic factors, including Binet stages, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) mutation status, TP53 mutation status, ZAP-70 protein and CD38 expression level in 165 CLL patients by using real-time polymerase chain reaction methods. Patients with unmutated IGHV genes had significantly lower expression of Dicer than patients with IGHV mutations. The lower expression level of Dicer was also significantly associated with higher level of CD38 and ZAP-70, and more aggressive Binet stage. We also analyzed Dicer expression in different cytogenetic subgroups. Lower Dicer level was found in patients with unfavorable cytogenetic aberrations (deletion in 17p13 or 11q22.3) in contrast to higher level in good risk cytogenetics (deletion in 13q14 as the sole abnormality). Furthermore, the lower expression of Dicer in CLL shows a strong association with shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0046) as well as with reduced treatment free survival (TFS) (P = 0.0006). By contrast, no differences in the expression of Drosha among these groups of patients were observed. Our data suggest that Dicer expression may play an important role in the progression and prognosis of CLL.","['Zhu, Dan-Xia', 'Fan, Lei', 'Lu, Rui-Nan', 'Fang, Cheng', 'Shen, Wen-Yi', 'Zou, Zhi-Jian', 'Wang, Yin-Hua', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Miao, Kou-Rong', 'Liu, Peng', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Zhu DX', 'Fan L', 'Lu RN', 'Fang C', 'Shen WY', 'Zou ZJ', 'Wang YH', 'Zhu HY', 'Miao KR', 'Liu P', 'Xu W', 'Li JY']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,2012/02/11 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02234.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 May;103(5):875-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02234.x.

We therefore retrospectively analysed the number and the volume of hepatic fungal lesions in 24 CT of 20 consecutive patients treated for acute leukaemia during late-arterial and porto-venous phase. The mean number of lesions per patient was 31 (range: 3-105) in the late-arterial and 26 (3-81) in the porto-venous CT (P = 0.026). The mean total volume of all lesions was 6.45 ml in the late-arterial and 4.07 ml in the porto-venous CT representing a 1.6fold difference between the two CT scans (P = 0.008). The total volume of the lesions negatively correlated to the absolute contrast difference between liver parenchyma and liver vein (Pearson correlation, r = -0.62; P = 0.002). In conclusion, the late-arterial CT provides a superior distinction of hepatic lesions due to a delayed perfusion of the outer rim of the fungal lesions resulting in an extended visibility. The late-arterial CT is superior to the porto-venous CT for initial diagnosis and follow-up of hepatic fungal infection.","['Petrausch, Ulf', 'Frauenfelder, Thomas', 'Mueller, Nicolas J', 'Arn, Kornelius', 'Stussi, Georg', 'Schanz, Urs']","['Petrausch U', 'Frauenfelder T', 'Mueller NJ', 'Arn K', 'Stussi G', 'Schanz U']","['Clinic of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. ulf.petrausch@usz.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,2012/02/11 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/02/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1439-0507.2012.02172.x [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2012 Sep;55(5):447-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2012.02172.x.

Much attention has focused on the changes that accompany this regeneration in two places, the distal nerve segment (where phagocytosis of axonal debris, changes in the surface properties of Schwann cells, and induction of growth factors and cytokines occur) and the neuronal cell body (where dramatic changes in cell morphology and gene expression occur). The changes in the axotomized cell body are often referred to as the ""cell body response."" The focus of the current review is a family of cytokines, the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) cytokines, which produce their actions through a common gp130 signaling receptor and which function as injury signals for axotomized peripheral neurons, triggering changes in gene expression and in neurite outgrowth. These cytokines play important roles in the responses of sympathetic, sensory, and motor neurons to injury. The best studied of these cytokines in this context are leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)-6, but experiments with conditional gp130 knockout animals suggest that other members of this family, not yet determined, are also involved. The primary gp130 signaling pathway shown to be involved is the activation of Janus kinase (JAK) and the transcription factors Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT), though other downstream pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) may also play a role. gp130 signaling may involve paracrine, retrograde, and autocrine actions of these cytokines. Recent studies suggest that manipulation of this cytokine system can also stimulate regeneration by injured central neurons.","['Zigmond, Richard E']",['Zigmond RE'],"['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Mol Neurosci,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,101477914,2012/02/10 06:00,2012/02/10 06:01,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fnmol.2011.00062 [doi]'],epublish,Front Mol Neurosci. 2012 Jan 20;4:62. doi: 10.3389/fnmol.2011.00062. eCollection 2011.,,20120120,,,,,,['R01 NS017512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3262188,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['axotomy', 'conditioning lesion', 'galanin', 'gp130 cytokine', 'neuropeptide', 'regeneration associated genes', 'sympathetic ganglion', 'vasoactive intestinal peptide']",,,,,,,,,

It is indeed involved in centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle formation, chromosome separation, and cytokinesis. PLK1 is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and its overexpression often correlates with poor prognosis. Although five different PLKs are described in humans, depletion or inhibition of kinase activity of PLK1 is sufficient to induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cell lines and in xenograft tumor models. NMS-P937 is a novel, orally available PLK1-specific inhibitor. The compound shows high potency in proliferation assays having low nanomolar activity on a large number of cell lines, both from solid and hematologic tumors. NMS-P937 potently causes a mitotic cell-cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in cancer cell lines and inhibits xenograft tumor growth with clear PLK1-related mechanism of action at well-tolerated doses in mice after oral administration. In addition, NMS-P937 shows potential for combination in clinical settings with approved cytotoxic drugs, causing tumor regression in HT29 human colon adenocarcinoma xenografts upon combination with irinotecan and prolonged survival of animals in a disseminated model of acute myelogenous leukemia in combination with cytarabine. NMS-P937, with its favorable pharmacologic parameters, good oral bioavailability in rodent and nonrodent species, and proven antitumor activity in different preclinical models using a variety of dosing regimens, potentially provides a high degree of flexibility in dosing schedules and warrants investigation in clinical settings.","['Valsasina, Barbara', 'Beria, Italo', 'Alli, Cristina', 'Alzani, Rachele', 'Avanzi, Nilla', 'Ballinari, Dario', 'Cappella, Paolo', 'Caruso, Michele', 'Casolaro, Alessia', 'Ciavolella, Antonella', 'Cucchi, Ulisse', 'De Ponti, Anna', 'Felder, Eduard', 'Fiorentini, Francesco', 'Galvani, Arturo', 'Gianellini, Laura M', 'Giorgini, Maria L', 'Isacchi, Antonella', 'Lansen, Jaqueline', 'Pesenti, Enrico', 'Rizzi, Simona', 'Rocchetti, Maurizio', 'Sola, Francesco', 'Moll, Jurgen']","['Valsasina B', 'Beria I', 'Alli C', 'Alzani R', 'Avanzi N', 'Ballinari D', 'Cappella P', 'Caruso M', 'Casolaro A', 'Ciavolella A', 'Cucchi U', 'De Ponti A', 'Felder E', 'Fiorentini F', 'Galvani A', 'Gianellini LM', 'Giorgini ML', 'Isacchi A', 'Lansen J', 'Pesenti E', 'Rizzi S', 'Rocchetti M', 'Sola F', 'Moll J']","['Nerviano Medical Sciences Srl, Nerviano, Milan, Italy. barbara.valsasina@nervianoms.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,2012/02/10 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0765 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0765 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Apr;11(4):1006-16. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0765.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified children with acute leukemia who had received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation at Samsung Medical Center in Korea from October 1998 to December 2009. RESULTS: In total, 134 recipients were identified. The patients were classified into the following three groups: unrelated cord blood (CB, n=36), related bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells (RD, n=41), and unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells (UD, n=57). The 365-day cumulative incidence of CMV antigenemia was not significantly different among the three groups (CB 67% vs. RD 49% vs. UD 65%, p=0.17). However, CB recipients had the highest median value of peak antigenemia (CB 160/2x10(5) leukocytes vs. RD 7/2x10(5) leukocytes vs. UD 19/2x10(5) leukocytes, p<0.01) and the longest duration of CMV antigenemia than the other stem cell source recipients (CB 87 days vs. RD 17 days vs. UD 28 days, p<0.01). In addition, the 730-day cumulative incidence of CMV disease was the highest in the CB recipients (CB 36% vs. RD 2% vs. UD 5%, p<0.01). Thirteen CB recipients developed CMV disease, in which five of them had more than one organ involvement. Two patients, who were CB recipients, died of CMV pneumonia. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that CB recipients had both longer and higher cumulative incidences of CMV infection. Therefore, a more aggressive and effective strategy of CMV management should be considered in CB recipients.","['Yi, Eun Sang', 'Kim, Yae-Jean']","['Yi ES', 'Kim YJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 50 Irwon-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 135-710, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Yonsei Med J,Yonsei medical journal,0414003,2012/02/10 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['201203393 [pii]', '10.3349/ymj.2012.53.2.393 [doi]']",ppublish,Yonsei Med J. 2012 Mar;53(2):393-400. doi: 10.3349/ymj.2012.53.2.393.,,,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,,PMC3282973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings of this study are part of a larger mixed-methods study, representing one data time point of the larger study. METHODS: This paper will discuss the baseline data collected at the time of discharge for 282 allogeneic transplant patients, which include sociodemographic data combined with disease, treatment, functional status, and QOL data to present a comprehensive portrait of the transplant patient at discharge. RESULTS: Mean age was 48 years, males represented 52%, and 22% of the patients were Hispanic. The majority of the patients had acute leukemia (55%), were diagnosed within the last 3 years, and had matched unrelated (52%) transplants. The time from transplant to discharge averaged 30 days. Mean scores for QOL (scale = 1-10, with 10 = best QOL) included a low score of 5.7 for both psychological and social well-being, 6.3 for overall QOL, and 7.1 for both physical and spiritual well-being. Males had significantly higher QOL than females, as did non-Hispanics. Patients with Hodgkin's disease had significantly lower overall QOL scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual challenges which present for patients and their caregivers at the time of hospital discharge following allogeneic transplant.","['Grant, Marcia', 'Cooke, Liz', 'Williams, Anna Cathy', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Popplewell, Leslie', 'Uman, Gwen', 'Forman, Stephen']","['Grant M', 'Cooke L', 'Williams AC', 'Bhatia S', 'Popplewell L', 'Uman G', 'Forman S']","['Division of Nursing Research and Education, City of Hope, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. mgrant@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,2012/02/10 06:00,2013/03/28 06:00,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-012-1389-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2012 Nov;20(11):2697-704. doi: 10.1007/s00520-012-1389-8.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of oncogene cooperation remain unclear because of a lack of disease models. We have generated an AML mouse model using knockin mouse strains to study cooperation of an internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation in the Flt3 gene with commonly observed CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) mutations. This study provides evidence that FLT3 ITD cooperates in leukemogenesis by enhancing the generation of leukemia-initiating granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) otherwise prevented by a block in differentiation and skewed lineage priming induced by biallelic C/EBPalpha mutations. These cellular changes are accompanied by an upregulation of hematopoietic stem cell and STAT5 target genes. By gene expression analysis in premalignant populations, we further show a role of FLT3 ITD in activating genes involved in survival/transformation and chemoresistance. Both multipotent progenitors and GMP cells contain the potential to induce AML similar to corresponding cells in human AML samples showing that this model resembles human disease.","['Reckzeh, K', 'Bereshchenko, O', 'Mead, A', 'Rehn, M', 'Kharazi, S', 'Jacobsen, S-E', 'Nerlov, C', 'Cammenga, J']","['Reckzeh K', 'Bereshchenko O', 'Mead A', 'Rehn M', 'Kharazi S', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Nerlov C', 'Cammenga J']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/10 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201237 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.37 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jul;26(7):1527-36. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.37.

Natural killer (NK) cells are potent antitumoral effectors, particularly against hematological malignancies. Defective recognition of B-CLL leukemic cells by NK cells has been previously described. Here, we deciphered the mechanisms that hamper NK cell-mediated clearance of B-CLL and evaluated the potential of NK cells as therapeutic tools for treatment of CLL. First of all, leukemic B cells resemble to normal B cells with a weak expression of ligands for NK receptors. Conversely, NK cells from B-CLL patients were functionally and phenotypically competent, despite a decrease of expression of the activating receptor NKp30. Consequently, resting allogeneic NK cells were unable to kill leukemic B cells in vitro. These data suggest that patients' NK cells cannot initiate a proper immune reaction due to a lack of leukemic cell recognition. We next set up a xenotransplantation mouse model to study NK-CLL cell interactions. Together with our in vitro studies, in vivo data revealed that activation of NK cells is required in order to control B-CLL and that activated NK cells synergize to enhance rituximab effect on tumor load. This study points out the requirements for immune system manipulation for treatment of B-CLL in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy.","['Veuillen, Caroline', 'Aurran-Schleinitz, Therese', 'Castellano, Remy', 'Rey, Jerome', 'Mallet, Francoise', 'Orlanducci, Florence', 'Pouyet, Laurent', 'Just-Landi, Sylvaine', 'Coso, Diane', 'Ivanov, Vadim', 'Carcopino, Xavier', 'Bouabdallah, Reda', 'Collette, Yves', 'Fauriat, Cyril', 'Olive, Daniel']","['Veuillen C', 'Aurran-Schleinitz T', 'Castellano R', 'Rey J', 'Mallet F', 'Orlanducci F', 'Pouyet L', 'Just-Landi S', 'Coso D', 'Ivanov V', 'Carcopino X', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Collette Y', 'Fauriat C', 'Olive D']","['Laboratoire Immunologie et Cancer, INSERM U 1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, 27 Bd Lei Roure, BP 30059, 13273, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,2012/02/10 06:00,2012/09/12 06:00,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10875-011-9624-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 2012 Jun;32(3):632-46. doi: 10.1007/s10875-011-9624-5.

To explore the underlying mechanisms for BC, which is characterized by a blockage of blood cell differentiation, we screened several genes crucial to hematopoiesis and identified 10 types of mutations in RUNX1 among 11 of 85 (12.9%) patients with acute transformation of CML. Most of the mutations occurred in the runt homology domain, including H78Q, W79C, R139G, D171G, R174Q, L71fs-ter94, and V91fs-ter94. Further studies indicated that RUNX1 mutants not only exhibited decreased transactivation activity but also had an inhibitory effect on the WT RUNX1.

However, current methods used to determine HTLV-I infection do not differentiate between HTLV-I asymptomatic carriers (ACs) and ATL and HAM/TSP patients. Using the luciferase immunoprecipitation system, a highly sensitive, quantitative technology that can efficiently detect HTLV-I Ab responses, we examined Ab responses for HTLV-I in serum/plasma samples from 439 subjects in Jamaica, including HTLV-I-seronegative donors, ACs, and ATL and HAM/TSP patients. The Ab responses of HTLV-I-infected subjects differed significantly from those of seronegative donors for all 3 immunodominant proteins, Gag, Env, and Tax. HAM/TSP patients had significantly higher Ab responses for Gag and Env compared with ACs, and Ab responses for all 3 Ags were higher in HAM/TSP patients than in ATL patients. Moreover, immunoreactivities for HTLV-I Ags as determined by the luciferase immunoprecipitation system could distinguish HAM/TSP patients from ACs at a true-positive rate of 85.42% and from ATL patients at a true-positive rate of 75.00%, and modeled in conjunction with subject information to distinguish HAM/TSP patients from ACs (odds ratio = 14.12) and from ATL patients (odds ratio = 7.00). The relative risk assessment resulting from these significant differences between Ab responses in HTLV-I-infected groups may be a useful diagnostic tool in the future.","['Enose-Akahata, Yoshimi', 'Abrams, Anna', 'Johnson, Kory R', 'Maloney, Elizabeth M', 'Jacobson, Steven']","['Enose-Akahata Y', 'Abrams A', 'Johnson KR', 'Maloney EM', 'Jacobson S']","['Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/10 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49215-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-11-390807 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 22;119(12):2829-36. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-11-390807.

Replication of HTLV-1 is under the control of two major trans-acting proteins, Tax and Rex. Previous studies suggested that Tax activates transcription from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) through recruitment of cellular CREB and transcriptional coactivators. Other studies reported that Rex acts posttranscriptionally and allows the cytoplasmic export of unspliced or incompletely spliced viral mRNAs carrying gag/pol and env only. As opposed to HIV's Rev-responsive element (RRE), the Rex-responsive element (RxRE) is present in all viral mRNAs in HTLV-1. However, based on indirect observations, it is believed that nuclear export and expression of the doubly spliced tax/rex RNA are Rex independent. In this study, we demonstrate that Rex does stimulate Tax expression, through nuclear-cytoplasmic export of the tax/rex RNA, even though a Rex-independent basal export mechanism exists. This effect was dependent upon the RxRE element and the RNA-binding activity of Rex. In addition, Rex-mediated export of tax/rex RNA was CRM1 dependent and inhibited by leptomycin B treatment. RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) experiments confirmed Rex binding to the tax/rex RNA in both transfected cells with HTLV-1 molecular clones and HTLV-1-infected T cells. Since both Rex and p30 interact with the tax/rex RNA and with one another, this may offer a temporal and dynamic regulation of HTLV-1 replication. Our results shed light on HTLV-1 replication and reveal a more complex regulatory network than previously anticipated.","['Bai, X T', 'Sinha-Datta, U', 'Ko, N L', 'Bellon, M', 'Nicot, C']","['Bai XT', 'Sinha-Datta U', 'Ko NL', 'Bellon M', 'Nicot C']","['University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Viral Oncology, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2012/02/10 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/02/10 06:00'],"['2012/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06361-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06361-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Apr;86(8):4559-65. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06361-11.

By using recombinant DNA techniques, a lentiviral vector was constructed to express chimeric antigen receptors in cytotoxic T cells from patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The purpose of the chimeric receptors was to direct the cytotoxic T cell activity against cells causing the cancer. The effect of infusing the engineered T cells back into the cancer patients was tested in a Phase I trial at the University of Pennsylvania, and the initial results were described in two articles from the research team of Dr. Carl June.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:2 to 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day imatinib. Imatinib C(min) levels were collected at pre-dose before treatment, and at the end of months 1 (day 29), 6, 9, and 12. RESULTS: Imatinib C(min) were stable over time in the 400 mg/day dose arm, but showed a slight decrease in the 800 mg/day arm due to dose adjustments between months 1-6. The overall median imatinib C(min) levels were 1040, 1200, 1935, and 2690 ng/mL for the actual 300, 400, 600, and 800 mg/day doses, respectively. The rates of major molecular response (MMR) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 6 and 12 months were significantly lower among patients with the lowest imatinib C(min) levels at Day 29 (<1165 ng/mL, 25th percentile). There was an apparent association between high imatinib C(min) and the occurrence of grade 3/4 neutropenia and all-grade rash, diarrhea, arthralgia/myalgia, and all-cause edema. Conclusions Imatinib C(min) levels were relatively stable over time and proportional to the dose administered.

Little is known about the impact of obesity on the outcome of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the baseline characteristics and effect on treatment and survival in 1,974 previously untreated adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing treatment, according to international classification of body-mass index. RESULTS: The median body-mass index was 26.7 (15.5-61) and 63% of patients were overweight/obese. After adjustment for other confounders, such as age, gender, performance status, karyotype, white blood cell, platelet and peripheral blast counts, obese patients had better complete remission rates (P=0.0046), lower rates of resistant disease (P=0.038) but similar rates of survival and severe adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in adults, obesity was associated with increased response rates and no apparent increase in toxicity.

The discovery of CDH loci using standard genetic approaches has been hindered by its genetic heterogeneity. We hypothesized that gene expression profiling of developing embryonic diaphragms would help identify genes likely to be associated with diaphragm defects. We generated a time series of whole-transcriptome expression profiles from laser captured embryonic mouse diaphragms at embryonic day (E)11.5 and E12.5 when experimental perturbations lead to CDH phenotypes, and E16.5 when the diaphragm is fully formed. Gene sets defining biologically relevant pathways and temporal expression trends were identified by using a series of bioinformatic algorithms. These developmental sets were then compared with a manually curated list of genes previously shown to cause diaphragm defects in humans and in mouse models. Our integrative filtering strategy identified 27 candidates for CDH. We examined the diaphragms of knockout mice for one of the candidate genes, pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (Pbx1), and identified a range of previously undetected diaphragmatic defects. Our study demonstrates the utility of genetic characterization of normal development as an integral part of a disease gene identification and prioritization strategy for CDH, an approach that can be extended to other diseases and developmental anomalies.","['Russell, Meaghan K', 'Longoni, Mauro', 'Wells, Julie', 'Maalouf, Faouzi I', 'Tracy, Adam A', 'Loscertales, Maria', 'Ackerman, Kate G', 'Pober, Barbara R', 'Lage, Kasper', 'Bult, Carol J', 'Donahoe, Patricia K']","['Russell MK', 'Longoni M', 'Wells J', 'Maalouf FI', 'Tracy AA', 'Loscertales M', 'Ackerman KG', 'Pober BR', 'Lage K', 'Bult CJ', 'Donahoe PK']","['Pediatric Surgical Research Laboratories, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/04/13 06:00,['2012/02/09 06:00'],"['2012/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1121621109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1121621109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 21;109(8):2978-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1121621109.

The activity of SCH 727965 was evaluated against the PPTP's in vitro and in vivo panels. PROCEDURES: SCH 727965 was tested against the PPTP in vitro panel using 96 hours exposure at concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 1.0 microM. It was tested against the PPTP in vivo panels at a dose of 40 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally twice weekly for 2 weeks and repeated at Day 21 with a total observation period of 6 weeks. RESULTS: The median IC(50) value for the cell lines was 7.5 nM, with less than fourfold range between the minimum (3.4 nM) and maximum (11.2 nM) IC(50) values. SCH 727965 demonstrated an activity pattern consistent with cytotoxicity for most of the cell lines. Forty-three xenograft models were studied and SCH 727965 induced significant delays in event free survival distribution compared to control in 23 of 36 (64%) evaluable solid tumor xenografts and in 3 of 7 ALL xenografts. SCH 727965 did not induce objective responses in the solid tumor panels and the best response observed was stable disease for one osteosarcoma xenograft. In the leukemia panel, there were two objective responses with a complete response observed in a single xenograft.

Recently, acquired loss of mismatched human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was demonstrated in patients with AML undergoing haploidentical allogeneic HSCT and was suggested not to occur in HLA-matched HSCT. We hypothesized that this mechanism applies to extramedullary AML relapse which occurs frequently after allogeneic HSCT and might also not be restricted to haploidentical HSCT. METHODS: DNA from extramedullary AML relapse after HSCT was compared with bone marrow at diagnosis with array comparative genomic hybridization to investigate relapse-specific genomic aberrations in relapsing AML after allogeneic HSCT. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from the same points of time were assessed for HLA, major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A, and TAP2 immunohistochemistry staining to assess cell surface expression of deleted loci encoded on chromosome 6p. RESULTS: Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed a partial loss of chromosome 6p in extramedullary myeloid sarcoma relapse of AML after sustained complete remission was achieved through matched related allogeneic HSCT. Among others, a deleted region 6p21.32-p21.33, which included several HLA class I genes, was detected. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the loss of HLA class I haplotype also occurs in AML relapse after HLA-matched related HSCT.

These leukemic patterns can then be monitored once patients achieve a morphologic remission. The role of various methodologies to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in AML is reviewed, as well as the emerging role of MRD detection in prognostication and treatment decisions. RECENT FINDINGS: Assessment of MRD in AML is now possible using updated methods including real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) for abnormal fusion transcripts, RQ-PCR for proteins known to be overexpressed in AML such as Wilms' tumor gene, and multiparameter flow cytometry to detect leukemia-associated phenotypes. Using these techniques, MRD analysis has shown value in terms of risk assessment, continued patient monitoring, and for therapeutic decision-making. SUMMARY: MRD assessment can detect residual leukemia burden after treatment with improved sensitivity compared to morphology alone. There are now extensive data to support the prognostic value of MRD detection both after chemotherapy and in the pre and posttransplant setting, and emerging evidence to suggest there is a clinically relevant value to treatment decisions based on MRD results. The need for standardization of MRD technologies and interpretation is, thus, of critical importance.","['DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Luger, Selina M']","['DiNardo CD', 'Luger SM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2012/02/09 06:00'],"['2012/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283501325 [doi]', '00062752-201203000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Mar;19(2):82-8. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283501325.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Recurrence']",,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to generate effective strategies to circumvent intrinsic chemoresistance in this tumour indication. In this study, three pancreatic cancer cell lines, MIA PaCa-2, MDAPanc-3 and AsPC-1, were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 together with camptothecin, doxorubicin or paclitaxel, and cytotoxicity was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The combination of MG-132 and camptothecin at a ratio of 5 : 1 gave the most promising results and enhanced cytotoxicity compared with the single compounds in MIA PaCa-2 cells. The increase was shown to be due to enhanced caspase-3 activity resulting in apoptosis. Moreover, this combination upregulated the levels of the proapoptotic protein Noxa and reduced the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, as demonstrated by western blotting. In contrast, the combination of MG-132 with doxorubicin also induced increased cytotoxicity, but apoptosis was decreased. The lack of an enhanced apoptosis induction could be correlated with high levels of Mcl-1 in response to the combined treatment with MG-132 and doxorubicin. Thus, the results indicate that regulation of the antiapoptotic and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Noxa and Mcl-1 is predicative of the effectiveness of the combination of MG-132 with different anticancer agents on apoptosis induction in pancreatic cancer cells.","['Naumann, Katrin', 'Schmich, Kathrin', 'Jaeger, Christoph', 'Kratz, Felix', 'Merfort, Irmgard']","['Naumann K', 'Schmich K', 'Jaeger C', 'Kratz F', 'Merfort I']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Biotechnology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/02/09 06:00'],"['2012/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283504e53 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2012 Jul;23(6):614-26. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283504e53.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study targeted a large cohort of CML (n=171) comprising 80 naive CML cases without prior TKI exposure as well as 91 cases undergoing 1st generation (imatinib) and/or 2nd generation (nilotinib/dasatinib) TKI therapy. KD mutations were analyzed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography followed by direct sequencing. Twenty-one types of mutations were found in 37 patients including 13 known mutations and 8 previously unidentified mutations. Thirty cases had a single mutation while 7 cases had multiple mutations. Twenty-three percent of patients receiving first-line imatinib, 69% of imatinib-resistant patients receiving 2nd generation TKI, and 75% of advanced phase patients treated with front-line 2nd generation TKI had KD mutations. Interestingly, 9% of TKI-naive CML cases were also discovered to carry the KD mutations including 5 novel variants. Patients who received hydroxyurea had a 2-fold increase in KD mutations as compared to newly diagnosed patients but they still had a lower mutation frequency than TKI-exposed cases. Mutations in the naive cases were mainly localized in the C-helix domain and SH3 contact site whereas in exposed cases predominantly in the drug contact site, P-loop, and catalytic domain. T315I resistant mutation was identified only in TKI-exposed cases. In conclusion, several known and novel BCR-ABL KD mutations were discovered in the TKI-naive and -exposed Southeast Asian CML patients, supporting the concept that naturally occurring KD mutations were present in leukemic cells prior to drug exposure. T315I resistant mutation was completely undetectable in this naive Southeast Asian cohort; its incidence, however, increases with drug exposure.","['Wongboonma, Wanwisa', 'Thongnoppakhun, Wanna', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Wongboonma W', 'Thongnoppakhun W', 'Auewarakul CU']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2012/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(12)00014-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2012.01.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2012 Apr;92(2):259-65. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2012.01.007.

Moreover, the expression of this gene and the role that it plays in the biology of blood cells remains unclear. In addition to determining the expression of the WNT7A gene in blood cells, in leukemia-derived cell lines, and in samples of patients with leukemia, the aim of this study was to seek the effect of this gene in proliferation. METHODS: We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells, sorted CD3 and CD19 cells, four leukemia-derived cell lines, and blood samples from 14 patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 19 clinically healthy subjects. Reverse transcription followed by quantitative Real-time Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis were performed to determine relative WNT7A expression. Restoration of WNT7a was done employing a lentiviral system and by using a recombinant human protein. Cell proliferation was measured by addition of WST-1 to cell cultures. RESULTS: WNT7a is mainly produced by CD3 T-lymphocytes, its expression decreases upon activation, and it is severely reduced in leukemia-derived cell lines, as well as in the blood samples of patients with ALL when compared with healthy controls (p </=0.001). By restoring WNT7A expression in leukemia-derived cells, we were able to demonstrate that WNT7a inhibits cell growth. A similar effect was observed when a recombinant human WNT7a protein was used. Interestingly, restoration of WNT7A expression in Jurkat cells did not activate the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report evidencing quantitatively decreased WNT7A levels in leukemia-derived cells and that WNT7A restoration in T-lymphocytes inhibits cell proliferation. In addition, our results also support the possible function of WNT7A as a tumor suppressor gene as well as a therapeutic tool.","['Ochoa-Hernandez, Alejandra B', 'Ramos-Solano, Moises', 'Meza-Canales, Ivan D', 'Garcia-Castro, Beatriz', 'Rosales-Reynoso, Monica A', 'Rosales-Avina, Judith A', 'Barrera-Chairez, Esperanza', 'Ortiz-Lazareno, Pablo C', 'Hernandez-Flores, Georgina', 'Bravo-Cuellar, Alejandro', 'Jave-Suarez, Luis F', 'Barros-Nunez, Patricio', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy, Adriana']","['Ochoa-Hernandez AB', 'Ramos-Solano M', 'Meza-Canales ID', 'Garcia-Castro B', 'Rosales-Reynoso MA', 'Rosales-Avina JA', 'Barrera-Chairez E', 'Ortiz-Lazareno PC', 'Hernandez-Flores G', 'Bravo-Cuellar A', 'Jave-Suarez LF', 'Barros-Nunez P', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy A']","['Division de Genetica, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-60 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-60 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Feb 7;12:60. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-60.,,20120207,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (WNT7A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology']",,,,PMC3299642,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that motorcycle exhaust particles (MEP) induced adhesion between cells of the human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a time-and dose-dependent manner. In addition, MEP treatment induced both mRNA and protein expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in HUVECs. The IkappaB degradation and p65 nuclear translocation was found in MEP-treated HUVECs, suggested the involvement of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). MEP-induced VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein expression was inhibited by NF-kappaB inhibitor BAY 11-7085. Oxidative stress was also involved in the signaling of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression. MEP treatment caused hydrogen peroxide and superoxide formation. Pretreatment with alpha-tocopherol could inhibit MEP-induced reactive oxygen intermediates generation and suppressed MEP-induced IkappaB degradation and adhesion molecules expression. Furthermore, the carbon black (CB) nanoparticles with different diameters could induce VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein expression; however, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) only increased the expression of ICAM-1 but not that of VCAM-1 in HUVECs. In this study, we found that MEPs could induce ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression through oxidative stress and NF-kappaB activation in HUVECs.","['Lee, Chen-Chen', 'Huang, Shih-Hsuan', 'Yang, Ya-Ting', 'Cheng, Yu-Wen', 'Li, Ching-Hao', 'Kang, Jaw-Jou']","['Lee CC', 'Huang SH', 'Yang YT', 'Cheng YW', 'Li CH', 'Kang JJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/09/08 06:00,['2012/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(12)00039-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2012.01.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2012 Jun;26(4):552-60. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2012.01.021.

AREAS COVERED: Three leukemias with special Asian perspectives, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia and NK-cell leukemia. EXPERT OPINION: In APL, China has made contributions in discovering the efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide. Some APL patients are potentially curable after treatment with ATRA or arsenic trioxide as a single agent. Combined treatment of APL with ATRA and arsenic trioxide induces remission with deeper molecular response. An oral formulation of arsenic trioxide is available, making outpatient treatment feasible. Future regimens for APL should examine how ATRA and arsenic trioxide can be optimally combined with other synergistic drugs. Asian patients with T-LGL leukemia present more frequently with pure red cell aplasia, but less frequently with neutropenia, recurrent infection, splenomegaly and rheumatoid arthritis as compared with Western patients. These differences have potential effects on treatment and disease pathogenesis. NK-cell leukemia is rapidly fatal and occurs almost exclusively in Asian and South American patients. Conventional anthracycline-based chemotherapy designed for B-cell lymphomas do not work in NK-cell leukemias. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting cellular signaling pathways or preferentially upregulated genes are needed to improve outcome.","['Kwong, Yok-Lam']",['Kwong YL'],"['Queen Mary Hospital, Department of Medicine, Professorial Block, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/06/21 06:00,['2012/02/09 06:00'],"['2012/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2011.621418 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2012 Mar;16 Suppl 1:S37-43. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2011.621418.

Although the formulation demonstrated enhanced cisplatin tumor accumulation in preclinical models it did not enhance clinical efficacy, possibly due to limited cisplatin release from the formulation localized within the tumor. We have examined a series of liposomal formulations to address the in vivo relationship between cisplatin release rate and formulation efficacy in the P388 murine leukemia model. The base formulation of phosphatidylcholine: phosphatidylglycerol: cholesterol was altered in the C18 and C16 phospholipid content to influence membrane fluidity and thereby impacting drug circulation lifetime and drug retention. Phase transition temperatures (T(m)) ranged from 42-55 degrees C. The high T(m) formulations demonstrated enhanced drug retention properties accompanied by low antitumor activity while the lowest T(m) formulations released the drug too rapidly in the plasma, limiting drug delivery to the tumor which also resulted in low antitumor activity. A formulation composed of DSPC : DPPC : DSPG : Chol; (35 : 35 : 20 : 10) with an intermediate drug release rate and a cisplatin plasma half-life of 8.3 hours showed the greatest antitumor activity.

However, we and others could not confirm these results, using a nested PCR assay. An alternative to this highly sensitive, but contamination-prone, technique is to measure the serological response to XMRV. Thus, we tested the plasma samples from our cohorts of CFS patients and healthy controls for the presence of XMRV-specific antibodies.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the effects of pentoxifylline (PTX) on P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) in mouse leukemia L1210/VCR cells. Parental sensitive mouse leukemia cells L1210, and multidrug-resistant cells, L1210/VCR, which are characterized by the overexpression of P-gp, were used as experimental models. The cells were exposed to 100 mumol/L PTX in the presence or absence of 1.2 mumol/L vincristine (VCR). Western blot analysis indicated a downregulation of P-gp protein expression when multidrug-resistant L1210/VCR cells were exposed to PTX. The effects of PTX on the sensitization of L1210/VCR cells to VCR correlate with the stimulation of apoptosis detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide apoptosis necrosis kit and proteolytic activation of both caspase-3 and caspase-9 monitored by Western blot analysis. Higher release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2, which could be attenuated by PTX, was found in L1210/VCR than in L1210 cells by gelatin zymography in electrophoretic gel. Exposure of resistant cells to PTX increased the content of phosphorylated Akt kinase. In contrast, the presence of VCR eliminated the effects of PTX on Akt kinase phosphorylation. Taken together, we conclude that PTX induces the sensitization of multidrug-resistant cells to VCR via downregulation of P-gp, stimulation of apoptosis and reduction of MMPs released from drug-resistant L1210/VCR cells. These facts bring new insights into the mechanisms of PTX action on cancer cells.","['Barancik, Miroslav', 'Bohacova, Viera', 'Gibalova, Lenka', 'Sedlak, Jan', 'Sulova, Zdena', 'Breier, Albert']","['Barancik M', 'Bohacova V', 'Gibalova L', 'Sedlak J', 'Sulova Z', 'Breier A']","['Institute for Heart Research, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, Bratislava 840 05, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/02/09 06:01,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijms13010369 [doi]', 'ijms-13-00369 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2012;13(1):369-82. doi: 10.3390/ijms13010369.

Because CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is expressed on tumor cells from most patients with ATL, KW-0761, a humanized anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody, which markedly enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, was evaluated in the treatment of patients with relapsed ATL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter phase II study of KW-0761 for patients with relapsed, aggressive CCR4-positive ATL was conducted to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetic profile, and safety. The primary end point was overall response rate, and secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival from the first dose of KW-0761. Patients received intravenous infusions of KW-0761 once per week for 8 weeks at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. RESULTS: Of 28 patients enrolled onto the study, 27 received at least one infusion of KW-0761. Objective responses were noted in 13 of 26 evaluable patients, including eight complete responses, with an overall response rate of 50% (95% CI, 30% to 70%). Median progression-free and overall survival were 5.2 and 13.7 months, respectively. The mean half-life period after the eighth infusion was 422 +/- 147 hours (+/- standard deviation). The most common adverse events were infusion reactions (89%) and skin rashes (63%), which were manageable and reversible in all cases. CONCLUSION: KW-0761 demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor activity in patients with relapsed ATL, with an acceptable toxicity profile. Further investigation of KW-0761 for treatment of ATL and other T-cell neoplasms is warranted.","['Ishida, Takashi', 'Joh, Tatsuro', 'Uike, Naokuni', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Yoshida, Shinichiro', 'Saburi, Yoshio', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Takemoto, Shigeki', 'Suzushima, Hitoshi', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Ogura, Michinori', 'Akinaga, Shiro', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Ishida T', 'Joh T', 'Uike N', 'Yamamoto K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Yoshida S', 'Saburi Y', 'Miyamoto T', 'Takemoto S', 'Suzushima H', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Nosaka K', 'Fujiwara H', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Inagaki H', 'Ogura M', 'Akinaga S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Tobinai K', 'Ueda R']","['Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 1 Kawasumi, Mizuho-chou, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 467-8601, Japan. itakashi@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.37.3472 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.37.3472 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Mar 10;30(8):837-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.37.3472.

Accordingly, compounds that specifically target Mcl-1 may overcome this resistance. In this study, we identified and characterized the natural product marinopyrrole A as a novel Mcl-1-specific inhibitor and named it maritoclax. We found that maritoclax binds to Mcl-1, but not Bcl-X(L), and is able to disrupt the interaction between Bim and Mcl-1. Moreover, maritoclax induces Mcl-1 degradation via the proteasome system, which is associated with the pro-apoptotic activity of maritoclax. Importantly, maritoclax selectively kills Mcl-1-dependent, but not Bcl-2- or Bcl-X(L)-dependent, leukemia cells and markedly enhances the efficacy of ABT-737 against hematologic malignancies, including K562, Raji, and multidrug-resistant HL60/VCR, by approximately 60- to 2000-fold at 1-2 muM. Taken together, these results suggest that maritoclax represents a new class of Mcl-1 inhibitors, which antagonizes Mcl-1 and overcomes ABT-737 resistance by targeting Mcl-1 for degradation.","['Doi, Kenichiro', 'Li, Rongshi', 'Sung, Shen-Shu', 'Wu, Hongwei', 'Liu, Yan', 'Manieri, Wanda', 'Krishnegowda, Gowdahalli', 'Awwad, Andy', 'Dewey, Alden', 'Liu, Xin', 'Amin, Shantu', 'Cheng, Chunwei', 'Qin, Yong', 'Schonbrunn, Ernst', 'Daughdrill, Gary', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Sebti, Said', 'Wang, Hong-Gang']","['Doi K', 'Li R', 'Sung SS', 'Wu H', 'Liu Y', 'Manieri W', 'Krishnegowda G', 'Awwad A', 'Dewey A', 'Liu X', 'Amin S', 'Cheng C', 'Qin Y', 'Schonbrunn E', 'Daughdrill G', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Sebti S', 'Wang HG']","['Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033.', 'Drug Discovery Department, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida 33612.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida 33612, and.', 'Drug Discovery Department, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida 33612.', 'Drug Discovery Department, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida 33612.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033; Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033.', 'West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, P.

METHODS: We utilized a clinical case description and brief discussion. RESULTS: A 17-year-old girl presented with acute bilateral anterior uveitis, a hypopyon in the left eye, and moderate bilateral vitritis. She had a history of acute myeloid leukemia status post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 5 years earlier. She was receiving rifabutin for a biopsy-proven Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary infection. Work up for infectious and neoplastic etiologies was negative. The uveitis initially responded to topical corticosteroids, but recurred when the drops were tapered. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated diffuse vasculitis of small retinal vessels and cystoid macular edema. After rifabutin was discontinued, the uveitis and vasculitis slowly resolved. CONCLUSION: Fluorescein angiography demonstrated widespread retinal vasculitis which is a rare manifestation of rifabutin-associated uveitis.","['Smith, Wendy M', 'Reddy, Madhu G', 'Hutcheson, Kelly A', 'Bishop, Rachel J', 'Sen, H Nida']","['Smith WM', 'Reddy MG', 'Hutcheson KA', 'Bishop RJ', 'Sen HN']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Dr., Building 10, Rm. 10N112, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect,Journal of ophthalmic inflammation and infection,101553216,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/02/09 06:01,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12348-012-0059-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect. 2012 Sep;2(3):149-52. doi: 10.1007/s12348-012-0059-9.

METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data of 15 CML patients in which Ph(-)CAs occurred after tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 15 cases with Ph(-)CAs, 12 patients were treated with imatinib, 2 were treated with dasatinib and 1 was treated with bosutinib. + 8 was the most common abnormality in Ph(-)CAs, which accounted for 46.7% of all. Ph(-)CAs usually occurred when Ph(+)cells decreased or disappeared due to tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy. The average time for the appearance of Ph(-)CAs was 11.1 months (1-28 months). In 7 patients, the Ph(-)CAs have disappeared in 10.9 months (3-24 months). In such patients, no myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia was observed. One patient has progressed to acute monocytic leukemia with Ph(+)cells. All remaining patients have achieved bone morrow remission, among which 11 patients achieved complete cytogenic response and 4 patients even achieved complete molecular response. CONCLUSION: The majority of Ph(-)CAs developed in CML patients are transient in nature. They may develop following imatinib, dasatinib or bosutinib therapy but do not interfere with the therapeutic effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Mu, Qi-tian', 'Chen, Zhi-mei', 'Lou, Ji-yu', 'Cheng, Yi-zhi', 'Wang, Yun-gui', 'Jin, Jie']","['Mu QT', 'Chen ZM', 'Lou JY', 'Cheng YZ', 'Wang YG', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology & Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Key Laboratory of Hematological Malignancies of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, P.

METHODS: K562 cells were cultured in vitro. The rate of proliferation inhibition of cells treated with various concentrations of DHA were determined by using [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) method. Expression of BCR/ABL fusion gene was analyzed by reverse transcription(RT-PCR) before and after DHA treatment. Apoptosis of K562 cells was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The growth of K562 cells was inhibited when the concentrations of DHA were 10-160 umol/L. With the added dose of DHA, the growth inhibition was remarkable, with the rate of inhibition risen from 52.76% to 94.65%. The expression of BCR/ABL fusion gene, as detected by RT-PCR after incubating the K562 cells with 20 umol/L DHA, measured as DeltaCt = 4.45 +/- 0.25 after 12 h and DeltaCt = 5.23 +/- 0.21 after 24 h, which was significantly lower compared with that of the control ( DeltaCt = 4.23 +/- 0.21, P < 0.05).

This study focused on the expression of Pinch-1 in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from leukemia patients and its possible effect. BMSC was isolated and cultured from bone marrow in leukemia patients and normal healthy donors. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to determine Pinch-1 mRNA and protein level in BMSC, respectively.

The proliferation, apoptosis and motility of leukemia BMSC subjected to Pinch-1 knockdown using siRNA were tested by flow cytometry, TUNEL assay and Transwell system, respectively. Pinch-1 mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated in ALL and AML BMSC compared to normal BMSC (p<0.01).

Here, we investigated the consequences of ectopic expression of IL-15 in human NK cells. IL-2 and IL-15 belong to the common gamma chain family of cytokines and have overlapping activities. Transduction of clinically applicable NK-92 cells with lentiviral vectors encoding human IL-15 resulted in predominantly intracellular expression of the cytokine, and STAT5 activation, proliferation and cytotoxicity of the producer cells in the absence of IL-2. Growth of non-transduced bystander cells was not supported, allowing rapid enrichment of gene-modified cells solely by IL-2 withdrawal. This was also the case upon transduction of NK-92 and NKL cells with a bicistronic lentiviral vector encoding IL-15 and a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting the pancarcinoma antigen EpCAM. Effector cells co-expressing CAR and IL-15 continued to proliferate in the absence of exogenous cytokines and displayed high and selective cell-killing activity against EpCAM-expressing breast carcinoma cells that were resistant to the natural cytotoxicity of unmodified NK cells.

This fact has prompted concern and highlighted the association between multiple myeloma and second malignancies. Furthermore, an excess of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after multiple myeloma has been known for over 4 decades. Most prior studies have been restricted because of small numbers of patients, inadequate follow-up, and limitations of ascertainment of second malignancies. Although the underlying biologic mechanisms of AML/MDS after multiple myeloma are unknown, treatment-related factors are presumed to be responsible. Recently, an excess risk of AML/MDS was found among 5652 patients with IgG/IgA (but not IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, supporting a role for disease-related factors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that polymorphisms in germline genes may contribute to a person's susceptibility to subsequent cancers, whereas the potential influence of environmental and behavioral factors remains poorly understood. This review discusses current knowledge regarding second malignancies after multiple myeloma and gives future directions for efforts designed to characterize underlying biologic mechanisms, with the goal to maximize survival and minimize the risk for second malignancies for individual patients.","['Thomas, Anish', 'Mailankody, Sham', 'Korde, Neha', 'Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Turesson, Ingemar', 'Landgren, Ola']","['Thomas A', 'Mailankody S', 'Korde N', 'Kristinsson SY', 'Turesson I', 'Landgren O']","['Multiple Myeloma Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49204-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-381426 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 22;119(12):2731-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-381426.

Exposure of the public to ionizing radiation includes exposure to background radiation, as well as medical and occupational exposures. A large fraction of the exposure from diagnostic procedures comes from medical imaging. Computed tomography (CT) is the major single contributor of diagnostic radiation exposure. An increase in the use of CTs has been reported over the last decades in many countries. Children have smaller bodies and lower shielding capacities, factors that affect the individual organ doses due to medical imaging. Several risk models have been applied to estimate the cancer burden caused by ionizing radiation from CT. All models predict higher risks for cancer among children exposed to CT as compared to adults. However, the cancer risk associated with CT has not been assessed directly in epidemiological studies. Here, plans are described to conduct an historical cohort study to investigate the cancer incidence in paediatric patients exposed to CT before the age of 15 in Germany. Patients will be recruited from radiology departments of several hospitals. Their individual exposure will be recorded, and time-dependent cumulative organ doses will be calculated. Follow-up for cancer incidence via the German Childhood Cancer Registry will allow computation of standardized incidence ratios using population-based incidence rates for childhood cancer. Dose-response modelling and analyses for subgroups of children based on the indication for and the result of the CT will be performed.","['Krille, Lucian', 'Zeeb, Hajo', 'Jahnen, Andreas', 'Mildenberger, Peter', 'Seidenbusch, Michael', 'Schneider, Karl', 'Weisser, Gerald', 'Hammer, Gael', 'Scholz, Peter', 'Blettner, Maria']","['Krille L', 'Zeeb H', 'Jahnen A', 'Mildenberger P', 'Seidenbusch M', 'Schneider K', 'Weisser G', 'Hammer G', 'Scholz P', 'Blettner M']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biometrie, Epidemiologie und Informatik (IMBEI), Universitatsmedizin der Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat Mainz, Mainz, Germany. krille1@imbei.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2011/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-012-0405-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2012 May;51(2):103-11. doi: 10.1007/s00411-012-0405-1.

Although there have been a few reports of such cases, it is unclear HTLV-1 carrier if patients on the modern immunosuppressants would develop HTLV-1-associated myelopathy or adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of RTx in nine HTLV-1 carriers to assess a risk of developing leukemia from 2002 to 2011 using immunosuppression with a calcineurin inhibitor, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and steroid. The anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody basiliximab was used for induction. In two cases of ABO-incompatible RTx, the rituximab was also administered before RTx. RESULTS: The ratio of male to female subjects was 2 to 7 with an overall mean recipient age of 54.3 +/- 8.1 years. We prescribed cyclosporine (n = 5) or tacrolimus (n = 4). There was only one graft loss due to the death caused by aspiration pneumonia with a functioning graft. No one developed overt leukemia with combined treatment with MMF, basiliximab and rituximab. CONCLUSION: We concluded that RTx in HTLV-1 carriers could be performed using a modern immunosuppressive regimen, without the risk of developing leukemia.","['Shirai, H', 'Suzuki, M', 'Tomita, Y', 'Iwadoh, K', 'Kai, K', 'Sannomiya, A', 'Koyama, I', 'Nakajima, I', 'Fuchinoue, S']","['Shirai H', 'Suzuki M', 'Tomita Y', 'Iwadoh K', 'Kai K', 'Sannomiya A', 'Koyama I', 'Nakajima I', 'Fuchinoue S']","[""Department of Surgery III, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-1345(11)01617-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.11.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2012 Jan;44(1):83-6. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.11.021.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TRAIL is relatively specific for tumour cells but primary chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells are resistant. Herein, we show that cellular metabolism influences cell death and that MCL cells (Z138 cell line) can survive/proliferate in glucose-free media by switching from aerobic glycolysis to 'coupled' oxidative phosphorylation. Extracellular flux analysis and mitochondrial inhibitors reveal that in the absence of glycolysis, Z138 cells have enhanced respiratory capacity coupled to ATP synthesis, similar to 'classical' state 3 mitochondria. Conversely, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) blocked glycolysis and partially inhibited glycolytic-dependent oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in a 50% reduction in cellular ATP levels. Also, 2DG sensitised Z138 cells to TRAIL and induced a marked decrease in caspase-8, -3, cFLIP(S), Bid and Mcl-1 expression but Bak remained unchanged, altering the Mcl-1/Bak ratio, facilitating cytochrome c release and cell death. Conversely, under glucose-free conditions, Z138 cells were less sensitive to TRAIL with reduced TRAIL-R1/R2 surface receptor expression and impaired DISC formation. Anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and XIAP were up-regulated while pro-apoptotic BAX was down-regulated. Additionally, mitochondria had higher levels of cytochrome c and ultrastucturally exhibited a condensed configuration with enhanced intracristal spaces. Thus, metabolic switching was accompanied by mitochondrial proteome and ultrastructural remodelling enabling enhanced respiration activity. Cytochrome c release was decreased in glucose-free cells, suggesting that either pore formation was inhibited or that cytochrome c was more tightly bound. Glucose-free Z138 cells were also resistant to intrinsic cell death stimuli (ABT-737 and ionising radiation). In summary, in MCL cells, the anti-glycolytic effects of 2DG and glucose restriction produced opposite effects on TRAIL-induced cell death, demonstrating that mitochondrial metabolism directly modulates sensitivity of tumour cells to apoptosis.","['Robinson, G L', 'Dinsdale, D', 'Macfarlane, M', 'Cain, K']","['Robinson GL', 'Dinsdale D', 'Macfarlane M', 'Cain K']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2012/02/09 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201213 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.13 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Nov 29;31(48):4996-5006. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.13.

Dysregulation of TAL1 activity has been associated with T-cell leukemogenesis. However, it remains unclear how the interactions between TAL1 and corepressors versus co-activators are properly regulated. Here, we reported that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation regulates TAL1 interaction with the lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) that removes methyl group from methylated Lys 4 on histone H3 tails. Phosphorylation of serine 172 in TAL1 specifically destabilizes the TAL1-LSD1 interaction leading to promoter H3K4 hypermethylation and activation of target genes that have been suppressed in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Knockdown of TAL1 or LSD1 led to a derepression of the TAL1 target genes in T-cell acute lymphoblast leukemia (T-ALL) Jurkat cells, which is accompanied by elevating promoter H3K4 methylation. Similarly, treatment of PKA activator forskolin resulted in derepression of target genes by reducing its interaction with LSD1 while PKA inhibitor H89 represses them by suppressing H3K4 methylation levels. Consistent with the dual roles of TAL1 in transcription, TAL1-associated LSD1 is decreased while recruitment of hSET1 is increased at the TAL1 targets during erythroid differentiation. This process is accompanied by a dramatic increase in H3K4 methylation. Thus, our data revealed a novel interplay between PKA phosphorylation and TAL1-mediated epigenetic regulation that regulates hematopoietic transcription and differentiation programs during hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.","['Li, Y', 'Deng, C', 'Hu, X', 'Patel, B', 'Fu, X', 'Qiu, Y', 'Brand, M', 'Zhao, K', 'Huang, S']","['Li Y', 'Deng C', 'Hu X', 'Patel B', 'Fu X', 'Qiu Y', 'Brand M', 'Zhao K', 'Huang S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2012/02/09 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['onc20128 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.8 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Nov 29;31(48):5007-18. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.8.

Correlation analysis revealed that there was a negative correlation between the day of neutrophil engraftment and the amount of soluble fiber, iron, breast milk, bazlama (a traditional yeast bread), and bulgur consumption. A negative correlation was detected between the number of febrile neutropenia episodes and the amount of yogurt and onion intake. Increased intake of parsley and onion was associated with reduced duration of total parenteral nutrition. The amount of parsley consumption was found to be lower in patients who experienced transplant-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: The nutrient contents and nutritional habits of the patients may affect the course of transplant. It might be recommended that ""let them eat yogurt, bazlama, bulgur, onion, and parsley.""","['Tavil, Betul', 'Koksal, Eda', 'Yalcin, S Songul', 'Uckan, Duygu']","['Tavil B', 'Koksal E', 'Yalcin SS', 'Uckan D']","[""Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital, 06100 Sihhiye, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.6002/ect.2011.0082 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Transplant. 2012 Feb;10(1):55-61. doi: 10.6002/ect.2011.0082.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia/therapy', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diet Records', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/epidemiology', '*Nutrition Assessment', '*Nutritional Status', '*Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Preoperative Period', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,['Exp Clin Transplant. 2013 Oct;11(5):469-70.

Typically, vesicles are modified with distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) at a high PEG grafting density. However, long circulation time and slow drug release rate might induce severe hand-foot syndrome in clinical practice. In this study, a liposomal topotecan formulation with a low PEG grafting density was prepared and its pharmacokinetics, acute toxicity and antitumour effect were investigated. METHODS: Topotecan was loaded into liposomes using an ammonium sulfate gradient. The resulting formulation was injected to healthy Wistar rats at different dose levels to investigate whether its clearance followed linear kinetics. Biodistribution was performed in Lewis lung cancer-bearing mice. The acute toxicity was evaluated in healthy mice and beagle dogs. To compare the antitumour effects of different formulations and dose schedule, RM-1 prostate, Lewis lung, H446 and L1210 cancer models were used. KEY FINDINGS: Topotecan could be encapsulated into low DSPE-PEG liposomes with approximately 100% loading efficiency. The clearance of the liposomal formulation followed linear kinetics at a dose level ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/kg despite the fact that the vesicles were coated at a low PEG density. Compared with free topotecan the liposomal formulation preferentially accumulated into tumour zones instead of normal tissues. Both formulations could rapidly accumulate into liver and tumour, but the liposomal formulation was cleared from tissues at a slow rate relative to the conventional formulation. In rats and beagle dogs, liposomal formulations could not induce skin toxicity. In all the tumour models, smaller split doses were more therapeutically active than larger doses when the overall dose intensity was equivalent. CONCLUSIONS: This has been the first report that plasma kinetics of a liposomal formulation with a low PEG density followed linear kinetics. Moreover, due to its short circulation half-life, the formulation did not induce skin toxicity. Our data revealed that the dose schedule of liposomal drugs should be adjusted in accordance with the biophysical and biological properties of the formulations to achieve the optimal therapeutic efficacy.","['Li, Chunlei', 'Wang, Caixia', 'Yang, Hanyu', 'Zhao, Xi', 'Wei, Na', 'Cui, Jingxia']","['Li C', 'Wang C', 'Yang H', 'Zhao X', 'Wei N', 'Cui J']","['State Key Lab of Novel Pharmaceutical Preparations and Excipients, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China. lcllib@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.2042-7158.2011.01422.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2012 Mar;64(3):372-82. doi: 10.1111/j.2042-7158.2011.01422.x.

Feeder cell activity in promoting ESC establishment from the blastocysts and in supporting ESC maintenance did not differ significantly between BMSC and MEF feeders. However, the highest efficiency of colony formation after culturing of inner cell mass cells of blastocysts was observed with the BMSC line that secreted the largest amount of LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor). Exogenous LIF was essential for the ESC establishment on BMSC feeder, but not for ESC maintenance. Neither change in stem cell-specific gene expression nor increase in stem cell aneuploidy was detected after the use of BMSC feeder.

OBJECTIVE: We examined six patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with chemotherapy alone, with suspicious central hypothyroidism (CH).

Auxological data were recorded, and thyroid function, autoimmunity and ultrasonography (US) were evaluated. Three individuals underwent a thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) test and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the hypothalamic-pituitary region. RESULTS: All study participants showed negative thyroid autoimmunity, normal thyroid ultrasound, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the normal range; free T4 (fT4) was abnormally low in two patients. After TRH infusion all patients showed TSH increase and slow TSH decline. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that CH could arise at any time after childhood leukemia following only chemotherapy treatment. Although overt hypothyroidism was detected in only two patients, a careful follow-up of thyroid function is also recommended for ALL survivors not treated by irradiation.","['Baronio, Federico', 'Battisti, Laura', 'Radetti, Giorgio']","['Baronio F', 'Battisti L', 'Radetti G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Regional Hospital of Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1515/jpem.2011.407 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2011;24(11-12):903-6. doi: 10.1515/jpem.2011.407.,,,"['9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/blood/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Thyrotropin/blood', 'Thyroxine/blood']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: The cell proliferation was determined by MTT. The differentiation of the cells was detected by NBT reduction test. Cellular morphology was observed by Wright's staining. Cell cycle distribution and the distribution of CD11b, CD14 were detected by flow cytometry. Then RT-PCR and Western blot assay were employed to detect the expressions of c-myc, p27, CDK2 and cyclinE1 in HL-60 cells after exposure to TMP. RESULT: TMP inhibited the proliferation in a dose and time dependent manner. TMP at the concentration of 200 mg x L(-1) to 300 mg x L(-1) induced unterminal differentiation of HL-60 cell and synergistically blocked the cell cycle progression of HL-60 cells in G0/G1 phase. The expression of c-myc was down-regulated as well as the protein expression of cyclin E and CDK2, while the mRNA and protein expression of P27 were remarkably up-regulated. CONCLUSION: Small doses of TMP induces differentiation of HL-60 cells throughout the cell cyde, as detected by a slower rate of accumulation in G0/G1, possibly by regulating the expression and activity of G1/S phase-related molecules.","['Wu, Yuni', 'Xu, Youhua', 'Gu, Xiaoyan', 'Hu, Yanni', 'Wang, Cuicui']","['Wu Y', 'Xu Y', 'Gu X', 'Hu Y', 'Wang C']","['Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases in Childhood, Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China. 198371lc@163.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,8913656,2012/02/09 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2012/02/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2011 Nov;36(21):3007-11.,,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazines)', 'V80F4IA5XG (tetramethylpyrazine)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulation of the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 oncogene (TCL1) in mouse B cells causes a CD5(+) leukemia similar to aggressive human CLL. To examine the mechanisms by which Tcl1 protein exerts its oncogenic activity in B cells, we performed proteomics experiments to identify its interacting partners. We found that Tcl1 physically interacts with de novo DNA methylthansferases Dnmt3A and Dnmt3B. We further investigated the effects of Tcl1 up-regulation on the enzymatic activity of Dnmt3A and found that Tcl1 overexpression drastically inhibits Dnmt3A function. In addition, B cells from TCL1 transgenic mice showed a significant decrease in DNA methylation compared with WT controls. Similarly, CLL samples with high Tcl1 expression showed a decrease in DNA methylation compared with CLL samples with low Tcl1 expression.

However, recent studies suggest that bortezomib may have more complex mechanisms of action in treating cancer. We report here that the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the receptor tyrosine kinase C-KIT are required for bortezomib- but not tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib-caused apoptosis of t(8;21) leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells, suggesting that C-KIT may recruit an apoptosis initiator. We show that C-KIT binds and phosphorylates heat shock protein 90beta (Hsp90beta), which sequestrates apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1). Bortezomib dephosphorylates pHsp90beta and releases Apaf-1. Although the activated caspase-3 is not sufficient to cause marked apoptosis, it cleaves the t(8;21) generated acute myeloid leukemia 1-eight twenty one (AML1-ETO) and AML1-ETO9a fusion proteins, with production of cleavage fragments that perturb the functions of the parental oncoproteins and further contribute to apoptosis. Notably, bortezomib exerts potent therapeutic efficacy in mice bearing AML1-ETO9a-driven leukemia. These data show that C-KIT-pHsp90beta-Apaf-1 cascade is critical for some malignant cells to evade apoptosis, and the clinical therapeutic potentials of bortezomib in C-KIT-driven neoplasms should be further explored.","['Fang, Hai-Tong', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Pan, Xiao-Fen', 'Gao, Li', 'Zhen, Tao', 'Zhao, Hong-Xia', 'Ma, Liang', 'Xie, Jun', 'Liu, Zi', 'Yu, Xian-Jun', 'Cheng, Xin', 'Feng, Ting-Ting', 'Zhang, Feng-Xiang', 'Yang, Yong', 'Hu, Zhong-Guo', 'Sheng, Guo-Qing', 'Chen, Yong-Long', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Zhou, Guang-Biao']","['Fang HT', 'Zhang B', 'Pan XF', 'Gao L', 'Zhen T', 'Zhao HX', 'Ma L', 'Xie J', 'Liu Z', 'Yu XJ', 'Cheng X', 'Feng TT', 'Zhang FX', 'Yang Y', 'Hu ZG', 'Sheng GQ', 'Chen YL', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z', 'Zhou GB']","['Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis and Targeted Therapy for Cancer, State Key Laboratory of Biomembrane and Membrane Biotechnology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1121341109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1121341109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 14;109(7):2521-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1121341109.

Despite the discovery of EVI1 in 1988 and its emerging role as a dominant oncogene in various types of cancer, few EVI1 target genes are known. This lack of knowledge has precluded a clear understanding of exactly how EVI1 contributes to cancer. Using a combination of ChIP-Seq and microarray studies in human ovarian carcinoma cells, we show that the two zinc finger domains of EVI1 bind to DNA independently and regulate different sets of target genes. Strikingly, an enriched fraction of EVI1 target genes are cancer genes or genes associated with cancer. We also show that more than 25% of EVI1-occupied genes contain linked EVI1 and activator protein (AP)1 DNA binding sites, and this finding provides evidence for a synergistic cooperative interaction between EVI1 and the AP1 family member FOS in the regulation of cell adhesion, proliferation, and colony formation. An increased number of dual EVI1/AP1 target genes are also differentially regulated in late-stage ovarian carcinomas, further confirming the importance of the functional cooperation between EVI1 and FOS. Collectively, our data indicate that EVI1 is a multipurpose transcription factor that synergizes with FOS in invasive tumors.","['Bard-Chapeau, Emilie A', 'Jeyakani, Justin', 'Kok, Chung H', 'Muller, Julius', 'Chua, Belinda Q', 'Gunaratne, Jayantha', 'Batagov, Arsen', 'Jenjaroenpun, Piroon', 'Kuznetsov, Vladimir A', 'Wei, Chia-Lin', ""D'Andrea, Richard J"", 'Bourque, Guillaume', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Copeland, Neal G']","['Bard-Chapeau EA', 'Jeyakani J', 'Kok CH', 'Muller J', 'Chua BQ', 'Gunaratne J', 'Batagov A', 'Jenjaroenpun P', 'Kuznetsov VA', 'Wei CL', ""D'Andrea RJ"", 'Bourque G', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore 138673.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1119229109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1119229109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 7;109(6):2168-73. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1119229109.

The crystal structure of the unliganded form of the interleukin-7 alpha receptor (IL-7Ralpha) extracellular domain (ECD) at 2.15 A resolution reveals a homodimer forming an ""X"" geometry looking down onto the cell surface with the C termini of the two chains separated by 110 A and the dimer interface comprising residues critical for IL-7 binding. Further biophysical studies indicate a weak association of the IL-7Ralpha ECDs but a stronger association between the gamma(c)/IL-7Ralpha ECDs, similar to previous studies of the full-length receptors on CD4(+) T cells. Based on these and previous results, we propose a molecular mechanism detailing the progression from the inactive IL-7Ralpha homodimer and IL-7Ralpha-gamma(c) heterodimer to the active IL-7-IL-7Ralpha-gamma(c) ternary complex whereby the two receptors undergo at least a 90 degrees rotation away from the cell surface, moving the C termini of IL-7Ralpha and gamma(c) from a distance of 110 A to less than 30 A at the cell surface. This molecular mechanism can be used to explain recently discovered IL-7- and gamma(c)-independent gain-of-function mutations in IL-7Ralpha from B- and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. The mechanism may also be applicable to other gamma(c) receptors that form inactive homodimers and heterodimers independent of their cytokines.","['McElroy, Craig A', 'Holland, Paul J', 'Zhao, Peng', 'Lim, Jae-Min', 'Wells, Lance', 'Eisenstein, Edward', 'Walsh, Scott T R']","['McElroy CA', 'Holland PJ', 'Zhao P', 'Lim JM', 'Wells L', 'Eisenstein E', 'Walsh ST']","['Battelle Biomedical Research Center, Columbus, OH 43201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1116582109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1116582109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 14;109(7):2503-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1116582109.

Virus-encoded miRNAs have garnered much interest, although the functions of most remain to be deciphered. To date, readily detectable, evolutionarily conserved natural miRNAs have only been identified from viruses with DNA genomes. Combined with the fact that most miRNAs are generated from endonucleolytic cleavage of longer transcripts, this finding has led to a common conception that naturally occurring RNA viruses will not encode miRNAs to avoid unproductive cleavage of their genomes or mRNAs. Here we demonstrate that the bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a retrovirus with an RNA genome, encodes a conserved cluster of miRNAs that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). Thus, the BLV miRNAs avoid the conundrum of genome/mRNA cleavage because only the subgenomic pol III transcripts are efficiently processed into miRNAs. BLV infection is strongly associated with B-cell tumors in cattle. Because most cells in BLV-associated tumors express little viral mRNAs or proteins, exactly how BLV contributes to tumorigenesis has remained a decades-long unsolved mystery. One BLV miRNA, BLV-miR-B4, shares partial sequence identity and shared common targets with the host miRNA, miR-29. As miR-29 overexpression is associated with B-cell neoplasms that resemble BLV-associated tumors, our findings suggest a possible mechanism contributing to BLV-induced tumorigenesis.","['Kincaid, Rodney P', 'Burke, James M', 'Sullivan, Christopher S']","['Kincaid RP', 'Burke JM', 'Sullivan CS']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712-0162, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/04/13 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1116107109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1116107109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 21;109(8):3077-82. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1116107109.

Here we show that LRF negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation by repressing nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) induction in the early phase of osteoclast development, while positively regulating osteoclast-specific genes by functioning as a coactivator of NFATc1 in the bone resorption phase. The stage-specific distinct functions of LRF were demonstrated in two lines of conditional knockout mice in which LRF was deleted in the early or late phase of osteoclast development. Thus, this study shows that LRF plays stage-specific distinct roles in osteoclast differentiation, exemplifying the delicate transcriptional regulation at work in lineage commitment.","['Tsuji-Takechi, Kaori', 'Negishi-Koga, Takako', 'Sumiya, Eriko', 'Kukita, Akiko', 'Kato, Shigeaki', 'Maeda, Takahiro', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Moriyama, Keiji', 'Takayanagi, Hiroshi']","['Tsuji-Takechi K', 'Negishi-Koga T', 'Sumiya E', 'Kukita A', 'Kato S', 'Maeda T', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Moriyama K', 'Takayanagi H']","['Department of Cell Signaling, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8549, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1116042109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1116042109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 14;109(7):2561-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1116042109.

In this phase 1/2 study, 52 patients with relapsed or refractory AML were treated with plerixafor in combination with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine. In phase 1, plerixafor was escalated to a maximum of 0.24 mg/kg/d without any dose-limiting toxicities.

In the present study, BIRC3, a negative regulator of noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling, was investigated in different CLL clinical phases. BIRC3 lesions were absent in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (0 of 63) and were rare in CLL at diagnosis (13 of 306, 4%). Conversely, BIRC3 disruption selectively affected 12 of 49 (24%) fludarabine-refractory CLL cases by inactivating mutations and/or gene deletions that distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion with TP53 abnormalities. In contrast to fludarabine-refractory CLL, progressive but fludarabine-sensitive patients were consistently devoid of BIRC3 abnormalities, suggesting that BIRC3 genetic lesions associate specifically with a chemorefractory phenotype. By actuarial analysis in newly diagnosed CLL (n = 306), BIRC3 disruption identified patients with a poor outcome similar to that associated with TP53 abnormalities and exerted a prognostic role that was independent of widely accepted clinical and genetic risk factors. Consistent with the role of BIRC3 as a negative regulator of NF-kappaB, biochemical studies revealed the presence of constitutive noncanonical NF-kappaB activation in fludarabine-refractory CLL patients harboring molecular lesions of BIRC3. These data identify BIRC3 disruption as a recurrent genetic lesion of high-risk CLL devoid of TP53 abnormalities.","['Rossi, Davide', 'Fangazio, Marco', 'Rasi, Silvia', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Monti, Sara', 'Cresta, Stefania', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Fabbri, Giulia', 'Bruscaggin, Alessio', 'Spina, Valeria', 'Deambrogi, Clara', 'Marinelli, Marilisa', 'Fama, Rosella', 'Greco, Mariangela', 'Daniele, Giulia', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Pasqualucci, Laura', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Dalla-Favera, Riccardo', 'Foa, Robin', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Rossi D', 'Fangazio M', 'Rasi S', 'Vaisitti T', 'Monti S', 'Cresta S', 'Chiaretti S', 'Del Giudice I', 'Fabbri G', 'Bruscaggin A', 'Spina V', 'Deambrogi C', 'Marinelli M', 'Fama R', 'Greco M', 'Daniele G', 'Forconi F', 'Gattei V', 'Bertoni F', 'Deaglio S', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Guarini A', 'Dalla-Favera R', 'Foa R', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy. rossidav@med.unipmn.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49218-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-395673 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 22;119(12):2854-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-395673.

MSK examination, however, is often not included as part of the routine paediatric examination. The authors aimed to evaluate how often and how thoroughly MSK examination was performed during admissions to the paediatric ward and to compare it with the examination of other symptoms in relation to the presenting complaint and eventual diagnosis. RESULTS: Medical records for 100 consecutive patients were reviewed. A poster campaign to increase awareness was then commenced along with oral and written presentations to staff regarding MSK examination. A further 100 consecutive patients were then reviewed. Only 9% of children in the initial group had routine MSK examination, rising to 32% in the second group. Where performed, MSK examination was often incomplete. Frequent errors included only examining the reported site of injury and only examining a single limb or single joint when limpness/stiffness was the presenting complaint. Non-limb joints were very rarely examined. CONCLUSIONS: MSK examination is not performed routinely during paediatric admissions in contrast to the examination of other symptoms regardless of the presenting complaint. This may need to be addressed by local audit and increased undergraduate teaching.","['Gill, Irwin', 'Sharif, Farhana']","['Gill I', 'Sharif F']","['Department of Paediatrics, Midlands Regional Hospital, Mullingar, Co.

In particular, the peels of immature citrus fruits are frequently prescribed in concert with other support herbs for many types of disease including cancer. We investigated the anti-proliferative activity of the peels of Citrus aurantium L. along with their effects on apoptosis. We prepared crude methanol extracts of the peels of Citrus aurantium L. (CMEs) and performed experiments using U937 human leukemia cells. The growth of U937 cells was inhibited by CME treatment in a dose-dependent manner, and CME induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. CME inhibited the expression of XIAP and Bcl-xL which are anti-apoptotic proteins. CME inhibited Akt activity in a dose-dependent manner. The apoptotic activity of CME was significantly attenuated by Akt augmentation. In conclusion, this study suggested that CME should induce caspase-dependent apoptosis at least in part through Akt inhibition, providing evidence that CMEs have anticancer activity on human leukemia cells.","['Han, Min Ho', 'Lee, Won Sup', 'Lu, Jing Nan', 'Kim, Gonsup', 'Jung, Jin Myung', 'Ryu, Chung Ho', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Hwang, Hye Jin', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Han MH', 'Lee WS', 'Lu JN', 'Kim G', 'Jung JM', 'Ryu CH', 'Kim GY', 'Hwang HJ', 'Kwon TK', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine and Department of Biomaterial Control (BK21 Program), Dongeui University Graduate School, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2011/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2012.1350 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Jun;40(6):2090-6. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1350.

Here, we analyzed the therapeutic effect of LBH589, a class I-II HDAC inhibitor, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In vitro, LBH589 induced dose-dependent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects, which were associated with increased H3 and H4 histone acetylation. Intravenous administration of LBH589 in immunodeficient BALB/c-RAG2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice in which human-derived T and B-ALL cell lines were injected induced a significant reduction in tumor growth. Using primary ALL cells, a xenograft model of human leukemia in BALB/c-RAG2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice was established, allowing continuous passages of transplanted cells to several mouse generations. Treatment of mice engrafted with T or B-ALL cells with LBH589 induced an in vivo increase in the acetylation of H3 and H4, which was accompanied with prolonged survival of LBH589-treated mice in comparison with those receiving vincristine and dexamethasone. Notably, the therapeutic efficacy of LBH589 was significantly enhanced in combination with vincristine and dexamethasone. Our results show the therapeutic activity of LBH589 in combination with standard chemotherapy in pre-clinical models of ALL and suggest that this combination may be of clinical value in the treatment of patients with ALL.","['Vilas-Zornoza, A', 'Agirre, X', 'Abizanda, G', 'Moreno, C', 'Segura, V', 'De Martino Rodriguez, A', 'Jose-Eneriz, E S', 'Miranda, E', 'Martin-Subero, J I', 'Garate, L', 'Blanco-Prieto, M J', 'Garcia de Jalon, J A', 'Rio, P', 'Rifon, J', 'Cigudosa, J C', 'Martinez-Climent, J A', 'Roman-Gomez, J', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Ribera, J M', 'Prosper, F']","['Vilas-Zornoza A', 'Agirre X', 'Abizanda G', 'Moreno C', 'Segura V', 'De Martino Rodriguez A', 'Jose-Eneriz ES', 'Miranda E', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Garate L', 'Blanco-Prieto MJ', 'Garcia de Jalon JA', 'Rio P', 'Rifon J', 'Cigudosa JC', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Ribera JM', 'Prosper F']","['Oncology Division, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201231 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.31 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jul;26(7):1517-26. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.31.

However, validation of current assays and agreement upon the techniques are prerequisites for its widespread acceptance and application in clinical practice. Therefore, a working group was initiated (Amsterdam, 2008) to discuss and propose standards for FC in MDS. In 2009 and 2010, representatives from 23, mainly European, institutes participated in the second and third European LeukemiaNet (ELN) MDS workshops. In the present report, minimal requirements to analyze dysplasia are refined. The proposed core markers should enable a categorization of FC results in cytopenic patients as 'normal', 'suggestive of', or 'diagnostic of' MDS. An FC report should include a description of validated FC abnormalities such as aberrant marker expression on myeloid progenitors and, furthermore, dysgranulopoiesis and/or dysmonocytopoiesis, if at least two abnormalities are evidenced.

Clinical and epidemiological data suggest that chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may have an etiological role in a subset of cases.We performed a large-scale microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling analysis of 381 miRNAs by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (Q-RT-PCR) of 26 microdissected splenic tissue samples (7 HCV(+) SMZL; 8 HCV(-) SMZL and 11 non-neoplastic splenic controls). Single assay Q-RT-PCR and miRNA in situ hybridization (miRNA-ISH) were used to confirm the results in an independent cohort. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of miRNA expression profiles demonstrated a distinct signature of SMZL compared with the normal splenic marginal zone. Supervised analysis revealed differentially expressed miRNAs, including miRNAs with previously recognized tumor suppressive or oncogenic potential. Five miRNAs were found significantly overexpressed in SMZL, including miR-21, miR-155 and miR-146a, whereas seven miRNAs showed significantly reduced expression, including miR-139, miR-345, miR-125a and miR-126. Furthermore, we identified miR-26b, a miRNA known to have tumor suppressive properties, as significantly downregulated in SMZL arising in HCV-positive patients (P=0.0016). In conclusion, there is a characteristic dysregulation of miRNA expression in SMZL with a possible implication in its molecular tumorigenesis.","['Peveling-Oberhag, J', 'Crisman, G', 'Schmidt, A', 'Doring, C', 'Lucioni, M', 'Arcaini, L', 'Rattotti, S', 'Hartmann, S', 'Piiper, A', 'Hofmann, W-P', 'Paulli, M', 'Kuppers, R', 'Zeuzem, S', 'Hansmann, M-L']","['Peveling-Oberhag J', 'Crisman G', 'Schmidt A', 'Doring C', 'Lucioni M', 'Arcaini L', 'Rattotti S', 'Hartmann S', 'Piiper A', 'Hofmann WP', 'Paulli M', 'Kuppers R', 'Zeuzem S', 'Hansmann ML']","['Department of Internal Medicine 1, J.W.

Therefore, we increased the dose of r-ATG to 5 mg/kg. In this report, we analyzed 87 patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allo-SCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor from 2000 to 2010. RIC consisted of fludarabine, BU and r-ATG 2.5 mg/kg on 1 day (r-ATG1; n=53) or 2.5 mg/kg per day over 2 days (r-ATG2; n=22). Grade 2-4 acute GVHD incidence at day 100 was 30.2% and 8.8% in the r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups, respectively (P=0.038). Extensive chronic GVHD incidence was 60.4% and 12% in the r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups, respectively (P<0.001). The relapse incidences (RI) at 24 months were 18.9% and 28.5% in r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups, respectively (P=0.640). Overall and PFS were not different between the r-ATG1 and r-ATG2 groups. r-ATG dose at 5 mg/kg in the setting of RIC seems a good balance allowing GVHD prevention and antitumor effect with a remarkable reduction of GVHD incidence without an identical level of increased relapse rate.","['Devillier, R', 'Crocchiolo, R', 'Castagna, L', 'Furst, S', 'El Cheikh, J', 'Faucher, C', 'Prebet, T', 'Etienne, A', 'Chabannon, C', 'Vey, N', 'Esterni, B', 'Blaise, D']","['Devillier R', 'Crocchiolo R', 'Castagna L', 'Furst S', 'El Cheikh J', 'Faucher C', 'Prebet T', 'Etienne A', 'Chabannon C', 'Vey N', 'Esterni B', 'Blaise D']","['Department of Hematology, Transplantation Program, Gene and Cell Therapy program, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt20123 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2012.3 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 May;47(5):639-45. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2012.3.

Using in vivo targeting of bisphosphonate-reactive gammadelta T cells by adding low-dose interleukin-2 to zoledronic acid, we evaluated the safety, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of this immunotherapy approach in 21 adults with advanced malignancies (renal cell carcinoma [RCC], malignant melanoma, and acute myeloid leukemia). A total of 58 treatment cycles were administered and the median number of treatment cycles was 2.7 (range, 1 to 6). The regimen was well tolerated, with no grade 3 to 4 drug-related adverse events, except for fever. No objective responses were observed in both cohorts of solid tumors (RCC and malignant melanoma), whereas 2 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (25%) achieved objective tumor responses (partial remission). Pharmacodynamic analyses showed significant in vivo activation (interferon-gamma production) and expansion of gammadelta T cells in all evaluable patients. High pretreatment serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and an unexpected increase in VEGF induced by zoledronic acid plus low-dose interleukin-2 were correlated with the lack of a clinical response. In conclusion, this study indicates that immunotherapy-induced VEGF can limit clinical innate tumor immune responses, especially for angiogenesis-dependent solid tumors.

In comparison with healthy controls, we found not only a mild blood lymphopenia but also impairment of phytohemagglutinin activation in CD4Fas and CD8Fas lymphocytes of imatinib-treated patients. Moreover, these lymphocyte populations were more sensitive to FasL-induced cell death in relation to an increase in Fas expression at the cell surface.

Here we found that TCR-induced transcription factors Egr2 and Egr1 had higher and more-prolonged expression in precursors of the natural killer T (NKT) than in cells of conventional lineages. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing showed that Egr2 directly bound and activated the promoter of Zbtb16, which encodes the NKT lineage-specific transcription factor PLZF. Egr2 also bound the promoter of Il2rb, which encodes the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor beta-chain, and controlled the responsiveness to IL-15, which signals the terminal differentiation of the NKT lineage. Thus, we propose that persistent higher expression of Egr2 specifies the early and late stages of NKT lineage differentiation, providing a discriminating mechanism that enables TCR signaling to 'instruct' a thymic lineage.","['Seiler, Michael P', 'Mathew, Rebecca', 'Liszewski, Megan K', 'Spooner, Chauncey J', 'Barr, Kenneth', 'Meng, Fanyong', 'Singh, Harinder', 'Bendelac, Albert']","['Seiler MP', 'Mathew R', 'Liszewski MK', 'Spooner CJ', 'Barr K', 'Meng F', 'Singh H', 'Bendelac A']","['Committee on Immunology and The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Immunol,Nature immunology,100941354,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/04/05 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ni.2230 [pii]', '10.1038/ni.2230 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Immunol. 2012 Feb 5;13(3):264-71. doi: 10.1038/ni.2230.,,20120205,"['0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Egr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,['GEO/GSE34254'],"['AI053725/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK042086/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AI038339/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI038339-15/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'P01 AI053725/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI038339/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK42086/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32AI0709030/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3288314,,,['NIHMS349329'],,,,,,"['Nat Immunol. 2013 Apr;14(4):413.

The T315I mutation is the most common mutation found in the kinase domain and leads to complete resistance to existing TKIs. Sensitive and specific approaches for detecting this mutation in patient specimens can provide valuable information to guide treatment decisions and monitor their effectiveness. Here, we describe an allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction method to distinguish and quantify wild type or T315I mutant ABL transcripts. This approach has high specificity in identifying mutant transcripts and shows minimal interference from wild-type transcripts. As few as 5 copies of the T315I mutant transcript or 0.025% (2.5x10(-4)) T315I mutant transcripts could be detected by this method. This approach requires no additional specialized reagents other than those used in standard real-time polymerase chain reaction and therefore may be easily incorporated as an effective strategy for the early detection and monitoring of TKI resistance in patients with CML.","['Yin, Lihui', 'Dittman, David', 'Chenn, Anjen']","['Yin L', 'Dittman D', 'Chenn A']","['Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/06/06 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PDM.0b013e31823465fd [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2012 Mar;21(1):34-9. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0b013e31823465fd.,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', '*Point Mutation', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the network of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) fibers that innervates the bone marrow to regulate normal (non-leukemic) hematopoietic progenitor cells, we tested the possibility that stress-induced SNS signaling might also affect ALL progression. In an orthotopic mouse model, Nalm-6 human pre-B ALL cells were transduced with the luciferase gene for longitudinal bioluminescent imaging and injected i.v. into male SCID mice for bone marrow engraftment. Two weeks of daily restraint stress significantly enhanced ALL tumor burden and dissemination in comparison to controls, and this effect was blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. Although Nalm-6 ALL cells expressed mRNA for beta1- and beta3-adrenergic receptors, they showed no evidence of cAMP signaling in response to norepinephrine, and norepinephrine failed to enhance Nalm-6 proliferation in vitro. These results show that chronic stress can accelerate the progression of human pre-B ALL tumor load via a beta-adrenergic signaling pathway that likely involves indirect regulation of ALL biology via alterations in the function of other host cell types such as immune cells or the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Lamkin, Donald M', 'Sloan, Erica K', 'Patel, Ami J', 'Chiang, Beverley S', 'Pimentel, Matthew A', 'Ma, Jeffrey C Y', 'Arevalo, Jesusa M', 'Morizono, Kouki', 'Cole, Steve W']","['Lamkin DM', 'Sloan EK', 'Patel AJ', 'Chiang BS', 'Pimentel MA', 'Ma JC', 'Arevalo JM', 'Morizono K', 'Cole SW']","['Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. dlamkin@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Behav Immun,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",8800478,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0889-1591(12)00015-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbi.2012.01.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Behav Immun. 2012 May;26(4):635-41. doi: 10.1016/j.bbi.2012.01.013.

X-ray crystal analysis of the complex structure of Pim-1 with the inhibitor indicated that the inhibitor actually binds to the ATP-binding site and also forms direct interactions with residues (Asp128 and Glu171) that bind the substrate peptide. These interactions, which cause small side-chain movements, seem to affect the binding ability of the fluorescently labeled substrate. The compound inhibited Pim-1 kinase in vitro, with an IC(50) value of 150 nM. Treatment of cultured leukemia cells with the compound reduced the amount of p21 and increased the amount of p27, due to Pim-1 inhibition, and then triggered apoptosis after cell-cycle arrest at the G(1)/S phase.

Herein, we show that ceramide did not increase in caspase-8 and -10-doubly deficient Jurkat cells in response to CD95L, indicating that apical caspases are essential for CD95L-triggered ceramide formation. Jurkat cells are typically defined as type 2 cells, which require the activation of the mitochondrial pathway for efficient apoptosis induction in response to CD95L. Caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells significantly resisted CD95L-induced apoptosis, despite ceramide accumulation. Knock-down of sphingomyelin synthase 1, which metabolizes ceramide to sphingomyelin, enhanced (i) CD95L-triggered ceramide production, (ii) cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and (iii) caspase-9 activation. Exogenous ceramide-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were impaired in caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells. Conversely, caspase-9 re-expression in caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells restored caspase-3 activation and apoptosis upon exogenous ceramide treatment. Collectively, our data provide genetic evidence that CD95L-triggered endogenous ceramide increase in Jurkat leukemia T cells (i) is not a mere consequence of cell death and occurs mainly in a caspase-9-independent manner, (ii) is likely involved in the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial pathway leading to caspase-9 activation.","['Lafont, Elodie', 'Dupont, Romain', 'Andrieu-Abadie, Nathalie', 'Okazaki, Toshiro', 'Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus', 'Levade, Thierry', 'Benoist, Herve', 'Segui, Bruno']","['Lafont E', 'Dupont R', 'Andrieu-Abadie N', 'Okazaki T', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Levade T', 'Benoist H', 'Segui B']","['INSERM UMR1037, Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Equipe 4, BP84225, 31432 Toulouse Cedex 4, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,2012/02/07 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2011/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1388-1981(12)00017-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.01.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2012 Apr;1821(4):684-93. doi: 10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.01.012.

LIF signals through a receptor consisting of gp130 and the low affinity LIF receptor (LIFR), while the CNTF receptor consists of gp130, LIFR, and the low affinity CNTF receptor (CNTFR). Ser1044 of the LIFR is phosphorylated by Erk1/2 MAP kinase. Stimulation of neural cells with growth factors which strongly activate Erk1/2 decreases LIF-mediated signal transduction due to increased degradation of the LIFR as a consequence of Erk1/2-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor at Ser1044. The gp130 receptor subunit is phosphorylated, at least in part by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, at Ser782, which is adjacent to a dileucine internalization motif. Ser782 appears to negatively regulate cytokine receptor expression, as mutagenesis of Ser782 results in increased gp130 expression and cytokine-induced neuropeptide gene transcription. The LIFR and gp130 are transmembrane proteins, while CNTFR is a peripheral membrane protein attached to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail. In unstimulated cells, CNTFR but not LIFR and gp130 is localized to detergent-resistant lipid rafts. Stimulation of cells with CNTFR causes translocation of LIFR and gp130 into the lipid rafts, while stimulation with LIF does not induce receptor translocation, raising the possibility that CNTF could induce different patterns of signaling and/or receptor trafficking than caused by LIF. We used a compartmentalized culture system to examine the mechanisms for retrograde signaling by LIF and CNTF from distal neurites to the cell bodies of mouse sympathetic neurons. Stimulation with neurokines of the distal neurites of sympathetic neurons grown in a compartmentalized culture system resulted in the activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Stat3. Retrograde signaling required Jak kinase activity in the cell body but not the distal neurites, and could be blocked by inhibitors of microtubule but not microfilament function. The results are consistent with a signaling endosomes model in which the ctyokine/receptor complex is transported back to the cell body where Stat3 is activated. While both LIF and CNTF mediate retrograde activation of Stat3, the kinetics for retrograde signaling differ for the two neurokines.","['Nathanson, Neil M']",['Nathanson NM'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Box 357750, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7750, United States. nathanso@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Neurochem Int,Neurochemistry international,8006959,2012/02/07 06:00,2014/04/16 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0197-0186(12)00030-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuint.2012.01.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurochem Int. 2012 Nov;61(6):874-8. doi: 10.1016/j.neuint.2012.01.018.

However, the function of UTX in hematopoiesis is not well understood. To study the role of UTX in the mammalian hematopoietic system, we used lentiviral short hairpin RNA constructs to knockdown UTX in the murine hematopoietic progenitor cell line EML, in primary murine bone marrow cells and in leukemic cell lines. We report that Utx is highly expressed in the hematopoietic compartment and that it plays an important role in cell proliferation and homeostasis of hematopoietic cells in vitro. Knockdown of UTX in EML and primary murine bone marrow cells impairs their colony-forming ability. Moreover, knockdown of UTX affects expression of key genes that regulate hematopoietic differentiation such as Mll1, Runx1, and Scl in primary murine bone marrow cells. And we further demonstrate that UTX directly associates with the promoters of the Mll1, Runx1, and Scl genes and modulate their transcription by controlling H3K27me3 marks on respective promoter regions. In addition, UTX depletion severely impaired proliferation of several human leukemia cell lines. Together, these data demonstrate a functional role for UTX in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Liu, Jianing', 'Mercher, Thomas', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Brumme, Kristina', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Zhu, Nan']","['Liu J', 'Mercher T', 'Scholl C', 'Brumme K', 'Gilliland DG', 'Zhu N']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the molecular mechanisms of imiquimod-induced apoptosis and autophagy in skin cancer cell lines. METHODS: The Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins were determined by immunoblotting. The Mcl-1 mRNA level was examined by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. The mechanisms of imiquimod-induced decrease in Mcl-1 protein were evaluated by addition of cycloheximide, MG132 proteasome inhibitor or pan-caspase inhibitor. The phosphorylation of eIF4E, 4E-BP1 and eEF2 in imiquimod treated cells were examined by immunoblotting. The imiquimod-induced apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated in Mcl-1-overexpressing cells by XTT test, mitochondrial membrane potential measurement, DNA content assay, LC3 immunoblotting, EGFP-LC3 puncta formation and quantification of acidic vesicular organelle with acridine orange staining. RESULTS: The decrease in the Mcl-1 protein level was faster and stronger than the decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in imiquimod-treated skin cancer cells. The imiquimod-induced decrease in Mcl-1 protein was not caused by blocked transcription or the promotion of degradation but was associated with inactivation of translation factors in BCC cells. The Mcl-1-overexpressing BCC cells were more resistant to intrinsic cellular apoptosis than control BCC cells during imiquimod treatment. Mcl-1 overexpression in BCC cells resulted in the basal activation of autophagy but did not modulate imiquimod-induced autophagy or rescue imiquimod-induced autophagic cell death in BCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Imiquimod may rapidly downregulate Mcl-1 protein levels by inhibiting translation in skin cancer cells. Mcl-1 may act to protect against apoptosis but not autophagy and autophagic cell death during imiquimod treatment in skin cancer cells.","['Huang, Shi-Wei', 'Chang, Chia-Che', 'Lin, Chi-Chen', 'Tsai, Jaw-Ji', 'Chen, Yi-Ju', 'Wu, Chun-Ying', 'Liu, Kuang-Ting', 'Shieh, Jeng-Jer']","['Huang SW', 'Chang CC', 'Lin CC', 'Tsai JJ', 'Chen YJ', 'Wu CY', 'Liu KT', 'Shieh JJ']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Dermatol Sci,Journal of dermatological science,9011485,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2011/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-1811(11)00317-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jdermsci.2011.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dermatol Sci. 2012 Mar;65(3):170-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2011.11.001.

In a HoxA9-Meis1 (H9M) model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we found that tumor-initiating activity existed in three, immunophenotypically distinct compartments, corresponding to disparate lineages on the normal hematopoietic hierarchy--stem/progenitor cells (Lin(-)kit(+)) and committed progenitors of the myeloid (Gr1(+)kit(+)) and lymphoid lineages (Lym(+)kit(+)). These distinct tumor-initiating cells (TICs) clonally recapitulated the immunophenotypic spectrum of the original tumor in vivo (including cells with a less-differentiated immunophenotype) and shared signaling networks, such that in vivo pharmacologic targeting of conserved TIC survival pathways (DNA methyltransferase and MEK phosphorylation) significantly increased survival. Collectively, H9M AML is organized as an atypical hierarchy that defies the strict lineage marker boundaries and unidirectional differentiation of normal hematopoiesis. Moreover, this suggests that in certain malignancies tumor-initiation activity (or ""cancer stemness"") can represent a cellular state that exists independently of distinct immunophenotypic definition.","['Gibbs, Kenneth D Jr', 'Jager, Astraea', 'Crespo, Oliver', 'Goltsev, Yury', 'Trejo, Angelica', 'Richard, Chase E', 'Nolan, Garry P']","['Gibbs KD Jr', 'Jager A', 'Crespo O', 'Goltsev Y', 'Trejo A', 'Richard CE', 'Nolan GP']","['Baxter Laboratory in Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(12)00006-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2012.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2012 Feb 3;10(2):210-7. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2012.01.004.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, how the extrinsic signals restrain appropriate ERK activity remains elusive. Here, we show that, whereas LIF sustains relatively high ERK activity, BMP4 can steadily attenuate ERK activity by upregulating ERK-specific dual-specificity phosphatase 9 (DUSP9). This upregulation requires Smad1/5 and Smad4 and specifically occurs to DUSP9, but not other DUSPs, and only in ESCs. Through DUSP9-mediated inhibition of ERK activity, BMP signaling reinforces the self-renewal status of mouse ESCs together with LIF. Upon LIF withdrawal, ESCs spontaneously undergo neural differentiation, during which process DUSP9 can partially mediate BMP inhibition on neural commitment. Collectively, our findings identify DUSP9 as a critical mediator of BMP signaling to control appropriate ERK activity critical for ESC fate determination.","['Li, Zhongwei', 'Fei, Teng', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Zhu, Gaoyang', 'Wang, Lu', 'Lu, Danyu', 'Chi, Xiaochun', 'Teng, Yan', 'Hou, Ning', 'Yang, Xiao', 'Zhang, Hongquan', 'Han, Jing-Dong J', 'Chen, Ye-Guang']","['Li Z', 'Fei T', 'Zhang J', 'Zhu G', 'Wang L', 'Lu D', 'Chi X', 'Teng Y', 'Hou N', 'Yang X', 'Zhang H', 'Han JD', 'Chen YG']","['The State Key Laboratory of Biomembrane and Membrane Biotechnology, Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(11)00597-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2011.12.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2012 Feb 3;10(2):171-82. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2011.12.016.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Our previous study indicates that DOX-induced p65 is able to bind the p21 promoter to activate its transactivation in the cells. METHODS: Over-expression and knock-down experiments were performed in Human Pancreatic Carcinoma (PANC1) cells. Cell cycle and cell death related proteins were assessed by Western Blotting. Cytotoxicity assay was checked by CCK-8 kit. Cell growth was analyzed by flow cytometers. RESULTS: Here we showed that over-expression of p65 decreased the cytotoxic effect of DOX on PANC1 cells, correlating with increased induction of cytoplasmic p21. We observed that pro-caspase-3 physically associated with cytoplasmic p21, which may be contribution to prevent p21 translocation into the nucleus. Our data also suggested that no clear elevation of nuclear p21 by p65 provides a survival advantage by progression cell cycle after treatment of DOX. Likewise, down-regulation of p65 expression enhanced the cytotoxic effect of DOX, due to a significant decrease of mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic genes, such as the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1 (c-IAP1), and the long isoform of B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), leading to efficient induction of caspase-3 cleavage in the cells. More, we present evidence that over-expression of p53 or p53/p65 in the PANC1 cells were more sensitive to DOX treatment, correlated with activation of caspase-3 and clear elevation of nuclear p21 level. Our previous data suggested that expression of p21 increases Gefitinib-induced cell death by blocking the cell cycle at the G1 and G2 phases. The present findings here reinforced this idea by showing p21's ability of potentiality of DOX-induced cell death correlated with its inhibition of cell cycle progression after over-expression of p53 or p53/p65. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested p65 could increase p53-mediated cell death in response to DOX in PANC1 cells. Thus, it is worth noting that in p53 null or defective tumors, targeting in down-regulation of p65 may well be useful, leading to the potentiality of chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Zhou, YingQi', 'Li, Gang', 'Ji, Yuan', 'Liu, Chen', 'Zhu, JingPing', 'Lu, YanJun']","['Zhou Y', 'Li G', 'Ji Y', 'Liu C', 'Zhu J', 'Lu Y']","['Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-19-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-19-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2012 Feb 4;19:15. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-19-15.,,20120204,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,,,PMC3298465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most tumour cells, however, do not stimulate effective anti-tumour immune responses, in vivo or in vitro. To enhance tumour cell immunogenicity, we fused human tumour cells from haematological malignancies with the B-lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL), HMy2, to generate a panel of long-lived, self replicating LCL/tumour hybrid cell lines. The LCL/tumour hybrid cell lines expressed HLA class I and class II molecules, CD80 and CD86, and a range of known tumour associated antigens (TAAs). In vitro stimulation of PBLs from healthy, HLA-A2+ individuals by hybrid cell lines induced tumour antigen-specific CTLs to TAAs, including survivin, MAGE-A1, NY-ESO-1 and WT-1. Individual hybrid cell lines simultaneously induced CTL to multiple TAAs. In vitro stimulation of PBL from 2 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia by autologous LCL/tumour hybrid cell lines induced CTL capable of killing the patient's own tumour cells. Our data show, for the first time, that hybrid cell lines formed by fusion of HMy2 cells and haematological tumour cells induce tumour- and tumour antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses in vitro.

However, the effect of histamine on NKG2D ligands on tumour cells is unclear. Here we showed that human monocytic leukaemia THP-1 cells constitutively express MHC class I-related chain A (MICA) and UL16-binding protein 1 on their surface, and incubation with histamine reduced the expression in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner as assessed by flow cytometry. Interferon-gamma augmented the surface expression of the NKG2D ligands, and this augmentation was significantly attenuated by histamine. The histamine H1 receptor (H1R) agonist 2-pyridylethylamine and H2R agonist dimaprit down-regulated the expression of NKG2D ligands, and activation of H1R and H2R signalling by A23187 and forskolin, respectively, had the same effect, indicating that the histamine-induced down-regulation of NKG2D ligands is mediated by H1R and H2R. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that mRNA levels of the NKG2D ligands and relevant microRNAs were not significantly changed by histamine. Histamine down-regulated the surface expression of endoplasmic reticulum protein 5, and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases did not impair this down-regulation, indicating that proteolytic shedding was not involved. Instead, pharmacological inhibition of protein transport and proteasome abrogated it, and histamine enhanced ubiquitination of MICA. Furthermore, histamine treatment significantly reduced susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. These results suggest that histamine down-regulates NKG2D ligands through the activation of an H1R- and H2R-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and consequently reduces susceptibility to NK cells.","['Nagai, Yasuhiro', 'Tanaka, Yukinori', 'Kuroishi, Toshinobu', 'Sato, Ryutaro', 'Endo, Yasuo', 'Sugawara, Shunji']","['Nagai Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Kuroishi T', 'Sato R', 'Endo Y', 'Sugawara S']","['Division of Oral Immunology, Department of Oral Biology Division of Oral Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2567.2012.03565.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 2012 May;136(1):103-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2012.03565.x.,['(c) 2012 The Authors.

TPMT gene promoter contains a variable number of GC-rich tandem repeats (VNTRs), namely A, B and C, ranging from three to nine repeats in length in an A(n)B(m)C architecture. We have previously shown that the VNTR architecture in the TPMT gene promoter affects TPMT gene transcription. MATERIALS, METHODS & RESULTS: Here we demonstrate, using reporter assays, that 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) treatment results in a VNTR architecture-dependent decrease of TPMT gene transcription, mediated by the binding of newly recruited protein complexes to the TPMT gene promoter, upon 6-MP treatment. We also show that acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients undergoing 6-MP treatment display a VNTR architecture-dependent response to 6-MP. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the TPMT gene promoter VNTR architecture can be potentially used as a pharmacogenomic marker to predict toxicity due to 6-MP treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.","['Kotur, Nikola', 'Stankovic, Biljana', 'Kassela, Katerina', 'Georgitsi, Marianthi', 'Vicha, Anna', 'Leontari, Iliana', 'Dokmanovic, Lidija', 'Janic, Dragana', 'Krstovski, Nada', 'Klaassen, Kristel', 'Radmilovic, Milena', 'Stojiljkovic, Maja', 'Nikcevic, Gordana', 'Simeonidis, Argiris', 'Sivolapenko, Gregory', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Patrinos, George P', 'Zukic, Branka']","['Kotur N', 'Stankovic B', 'Kassela K', 'Georgitsi M', 'Vicha A', 'Leontari I', 'Dokmanovic L', 'Janic D', 'Krstovski N', 'Klaassen K', 'Radmilovic M', 'Stojiljkovic M', 'Nikcevic G', 'Simeonidis A', 'Sivolapenko G', 'Pavlovic S', 'Patrinos GP', 'Zukic B']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics & Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Laboratory for Molecular Hematology, Belgrade 11010, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,100897350,2012/02/07 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/pgs.11.153 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenomics. 2012 Feb;13(3):283-95. doi: 10.2217/pgs.11.153.,,,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Minisatellite Repeats/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: CDA RNA expression as well as Ara-C IC(5)(0) showed wide variation in AML samples and normal controls. Fourteen sequence variants were identified, three of which (-33delC, intron 2 TCAT repeat and the 3 untranslated region 816delC variants) showed significant association with RNA expression and the nonsynonymous coding variant 79A>C was associated with Ara-C cytotoxicity.

Limited literature in adults heightened the awareness of possible increased vincristine (VCR) toxicity in patients receiving concomitant azole therapy. This is due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4, which may increase overall exposure to VCR, resulting in dose reductions or omissions. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the use of fluconazole prophylaxis increases vincristine toxicity in children with ALL. The authors retrospectively evaluated children with ALL between January 2004 and December 2009. Patients were subdivided into 2 groups based on whether or not they received fluconazole prophylaxis during induction therapy. Data were collected for up to 3 months following the completion of induction therapy. Thirty-one patients were included for analysis. There was no significant difference in gender, race, steroid use, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, VCR dose modification, and the rate of fungal or bacterial infections between these 2 groups. Only advanced age is an independent predictor of neuropathy.

No study to date has controlled for cognitive environment, an important variable influencing language achievement and outcome. This case-control study applies the deconfounding principle by using a sibling as a control to investigate language outcomes in a male child 11 years after administration of ITC for ALL at the age of 2 years 3 months. A comprehensive behavioral language test battery failed to differentiate the siblings on current language performance when descriptively compared, but neurophysiological assessment revealed that the ITC-treated child required more time and elicited a smaller N400 component compared to his sibling during picture-word matching. The findings suggest that in the absence of pretreatment performance indices, comparison with sibling achievement may supplement what is known on posttreatment language skill development drawn from comparative studies using children matched on age, sex, and educational level drawn from the community. The study's findings offer pilot data of language outcomes following ITC beyond the early stage of survivorship.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

Results from Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and a luciferase reporter assay consistently suggested that two HDACis, valproic acid (VPA) and suberoyl bishydroxamic acid (SBHA), augmented WNT/beta-catenin signaling in T-ALL cells. Meanwhile, VPA and SBHA dramatically inhibited cell growth, blocked G2/M cell cycle progression and increased p21(WAF1) expression. In addition, the levels of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were elevated, indicating induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, flow cytometry and Western blot for cleaved PARP showed that targeting beta-catenin with shRNA attenuated the apoptosis induced by VPA and SBHA. These data demonstrate that HDACis exert profound anti-leukemic effects partly by augmentation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Using HDACis to modulate WNT/beta-catenin signaling could be an attractive new strategy for the treatment of T-ALL.","['Shao, Na', 'Zou, Jie', 'Li, Jie', 'Chen, Feng', 'Dai, Jianjian', 'Qu, Xun', 'Sun, Xiulian', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Shao N', 'Zou J', 'Li J', 'Chen F', 'Dai J', 'Qu X', 'Sun X', 'Ma D', 'Ji C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, P R China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/02/07 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/02/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.663085 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Sep;53(9):1769-78. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.663085.

In addition, we examined the extent to which exercise dose and clinical characteristics of cancer survivors influence the relationship between exercise and reductions in depressive symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search identifying randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions among adult cancer survivors, examining depressive symptoms as an outcome. We calculated effect sizes for each study and performed weighted multiple regression moderator analysis. RESULTS: We identified 40 exercise interventions including 2,929 cancer survivors. Diverse groups of cancer survivors were examined in seven exercise interventions; breast cancer survivors were examined in 26; prostate cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma were examined in two; and colorectal cancer in one. Cancer survivors who completed an exercise intervention reduced depression more than controls, d(+) = -0.13 (95% CI: -0.26, -0.01). Increases in weekly volume of aerobic exercise reduced depressive symptoms in dose-response fashion (beta = -0.24, p = 0.03), a pattern evident only in higher quality trials. Exercise reduced depressive symptoms most when exercise sessions were supervised (beta = -0.26, p = 0.01) and when cancer survivors were between 47-62 yr (beta = 0.27, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Exercise training provides a small overall reduction in depressive symptoms among cancer survivors but one that increased in dose-response fashion with weekly volume of aerobic exercise in high quality trials. Depressive symptoms were reduced to the greatest degree among breast cancer survivors, among cancer survivors aged between 47-62 yr, or when exercise sessions were supervised.","['Brown, Justin C', 'Huedo-Medina, Tania B', 'Pescatello, Linda S', 'Ryan, Stacey M', 'Pescatello, Shannon M', 'Moker, Emily', 'LaCroix, Jessica M', 'Ferrer, Rebecca A', 'Johnson, Blair T']","['Brown JC', 'Huedo-Medina TB', 'Pescatello LS', 'Ryan SM', 'Pescatello SM', 'Moker E', 'LaCroix JM', 'Ferrer RA', 'Johnson BT']","['Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America. brownjus@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2011/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030955 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-17152 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30955. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030955.

A sensitive and early detection of tumor cells in these orthotopic models is a prerequisite for monitoring engraftment of leukemic cells and their dissemination in mice. Therefore, we developed a fluorescent antibody based strategy to detect leukemic foci in mice bearing patient-derived leukemic cells using fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI) to determine when to start treatments with novel antitumor agents. METHODS: Two mAbs against the CD44 human myeloid marker or the CD45 human leukocyte marker were labeled with Alexa Fluor 750 and administered to leukemia-bearing mice after having verified the immunoreactivity in vitro. Bioluminescent leukemic cells (HL60-Luc) were used to compare the colocalization of the fluorescent mAb with these cells. The impact of the labeled antibodies on disease progression was further determined. Finally, the fluorescent hCD45 mAb was tested in mice engrafted with human leukemic cells. RESULTS: The probe labeling did not modify the immunoreactivity of the mAbs. There was a satisfactory correlation between bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and FRI and low doses of mAb were sufficient to detect leukemic foci. However, anti-hCD44 mAb had a strong impact on the tumor proliferation contrary to anti-hCD45 mAb. The use of anti-hCD45 mAb allowed the detection of leukemic patient cells engrafted onto NOD/SCID mice. CONCLUSIONS: A mAb labeled with a near infrared fluorochrome is useful to detect leukemic foci in disseminated models provided that its potential impact on tumor proliferation has been thoroughly documented.","['Pesnel, Sabrina', 'Pillon, Arnaud', 'Creancier, Laurent', 'Lerondel, Stephanie', 'Le Pape, Alain', 'Recher, Christian', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Guilbaud, Nicolas', 'Kruczynski, Anna']","['Pesnel S', 'Pillon A', 'Creancier L', 'Lerondel S', 'Le Pape A', 'Recher C', 'Demur C', 'Guilbaud N', 'Kruczynski A']","['Centre de Recherche en Oncologie Experimentale, Institut de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Toulouse, France. spesnel@cnrs-orleans.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2011/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030690 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-16664 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30690. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030690.

Previously we showed that the accumulation in tumors of the new PET tracer 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-(18)F-fluoro-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine ((18)F-FAC) is predictive of responses to gemcitabine. (18)F-FAC retention in cells requires deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), a rate-limiting enzyme in the deoxyribonucleoside salvage metabolism and in gemcitabine conversion from an inactive prodrug to a cytotoxic compound. The objectives of the current study were to determine whether (18)F-FAC tumor uptake is also influenced by cytidine deaminase (CDA), a determinant of resistance to gemcitabine; to develop a new PET assay using (18)F-FAC and the related probe 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-(18)F-fluoro-beta-l-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methylcytosine (l-(18)F-FMAC) to profile tumor lesions for both dCK and CDA enzymatic activities; and to determine whether this PET assay can identify the most effective NA chemotherapy against tumors with differential expression of dCK and CDA. METHODS: Isogenic murine leukemic cell lines with defined dCK and CDA activities were generated by retroviral transduction. A cell viability assay was used to determine the sensitivity of the isogenic cell lines to the dCK-dependent NA prodrugs gemcitabine and clofarabine. In vitro enzymatic and cell-based tracer uptake assays and in vivo PET with (18)F-FAC and l-(18)F-FMAC were used to predict tumor responses to gemcitabine and clofarabine. RESULTS: dCK and CDA activities measured by kinase and tracer uptake assays correlated with the sensitivity of isogenic cell lines to gemcitabine and clofarabine. Coexpression of CDA decreased the sensitivity of dCK-positive cells to gemcitabine treatment in vitro by 15-fold but did not affect responses to clofarabine. Coexpression of CDA decreased (18)F-FAC but not l-(18)F-FMAC, phosphorylation, and uptake by dCK-positive cells. (18)F-FAC and l-(18)F-FMAC PET estimates of the enzymatic activities of dCK and CDA in tumor implants in mice were predictive of responses to gemcitabine and clofarabine treatment in vivo. CONCLUSION: These findings support the utility of PET-based phenotyping of tumor nucleoside metabolism for guiding the selection of NA prodrugs.","['Lee, Jason T', 'Campbell, Dean O', 'Satyamurthy, Nagichettiar', 'Czernin, Johannes', 'Radu, Caius G']","['Lee JT', 'Campbell DO', 'Satyamurthy N', 'Czernin J', 'Radu CG']","['Ahmanson Translational Imaging Division, Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['53/2/275 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.111.090407 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2012 Feb;53(2):275-80. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.111.090407.,,,"[""0 (1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine)"", '0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Fluorine Radioisotopes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', ""78636-53-0 (2'-fluoro-5-methylarabino-furanosylcytosine)"", '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Arabinonucleosides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', '*Cytosine', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', '*Fluorine Radioisotopes', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,"['P50 CA086306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA86306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3431619,,,['NIHMS400632'],,,,,,"['J Nucl Med. 2012 Mar;53(3):507', 'J Nucl Med. 2015 Feb;56(2):329']",,,,,

In this study, we aimed to characterize the cancer survival among children in Shanghai. PROCEDURE: Childhood cancer cases registered by the Shanghai Cancer Registry between 2002 and 2005 and enrolled in the Shanghai Childhood Survival Study were included in this study. We used Kaplan-Meier product-limit method for survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models for investigating the effects of various prognostic factors. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 5.4 years (range 0-8.9 years). The 5-year observed survival for all childhood cancers combined was 55.7% (95% CI: 51.7-59.6%). For leukemia, lymphoma, and central nervous system tumors, the three most common types of childhood cancer, 5-year survival rates were 52.2%, 58.8%, and 41.2%, respectively. Higher 5-year survival rates were observed for epithelial cancer (88.9%), malignant renal tumors (86.7%), germ cell and other gonadal tumors (78.4%), and retinoblastoma (75.0%). Cancers with poor prognosis included sympathetic nervous system tumors (57.9%), soft tissue sarcoma (54.1%), bone tumors (52.6%), and liver cancer (33.3%). There were no significant differences between survival rates by gender and age groups. Compared with those reported in the USA and Europe, the survival rates for all cancers combined and the three most common types in Shanghai were lower. CONCLUSIONS: The survival rate for children aged 0-14 diagnosed with cancer in Shanghai during 2002-2005 was at the medium level. There was a substantial survival difference from childhood cancers between Shanghai and specific developed countries.","['Bao, Ping-ping', 'Zheng, Ying', 'Wu, Chun-xiao', 'Peng, Peng', 'Gong, Yang-ming', 'Huang, Zhe-zhou', 'Fan, Wu']","['Bao PP', 'Zheng Y', 'Wu CX', 'Peng P', 'Gong YM', 'Huang ZZ', 'Fan W']","['Shanghai Cancer Registry, Department of Cancer Control & Prevention, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Prevention & Control, 1380 Zhongshan Road West, Shanghai 200336, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2011/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24043 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Oct;59(4):657-61. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24043.

There were 71 patients with a median age of 57 years (range: 50-63 years) who had acute leukemia (n = 53) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 18). Myeloablative conditioning was done in 35 patients and 36 patients had reduced-intensity conditioning. The 5-year overall survival rate (OS), cumulative relapse rate, and non-relapse mortality rate (NRM) were 45, 24, and 33%, respectively. According to multivariate analysis, high-risk disease (HR 3.50, 95% CI 1.43-8.56, P = 0.006), a hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) score >/= 3 (HR 4.41, 95% CI 1.31-14.77, P = 0.016), and an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (HR 4.03, 95% CI 1.46-11.10, P = 0.007) were significant predictors of worse OS. Highrisk disease was also significantly associated with a higher cumulative relapse rate (HR 4.59, 95% CI 0.94-6.92, P = 0.065). Furthermore, an HCT-CI score >/= 3 (HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.01-20.78, P = 0.048) and an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.04-8.74, P = 0.042) were risk factors for NRM. These results suggest that the disease risk, HCT-CI score, and donor type/histocompatibility are prognostic factors for elderly patients, while the conditioning regimen and age are not predictors.","['Takasaki, Hirotaka', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Tachibana, Takayoshi', 'Numata, Ayumi', 'Fujimaki, Katsumichi', 'Sakai, Rika', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Tomita, Naoto', 'Fujita, Hiroyuki', 'Maruta, Atsuo', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki', 'Kanamori, Heiwa']","['Takasaki H', 'Tanaka M', 'Tachibana T', 'Numata A', 'Fujimaki K', 'Sakai R', 'Fujisawa S', 'Tomita N', 'Fujita H', 'Maruta A', 'Ishigatsubo Y', 'Kanamori H']","['Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 1-1-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama 241-0815, Japan. takasakih@kcch.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2011/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1009-x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Mar;95(3):291-8. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1009-x.,,,,IM,"['Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At this time, the cytogenetic analysis of her bone marrow cells showed a reciprocal translocation between the short arm of chromosome 12 and the long arm of chromosome 13, t(12;13)(p13;q14). The immunophenotyping of bone marrow blast cells by flow cytometry revealed a population of cells positive for CD56, CD117, CD45, partial CD33, partial HLA-DR, CD13, CD7, CD2 and CD5. Therefore, a diagnosis of acute leukemia with a mixed T cell/myeloid phenotype was made. The patient had a poor response to classic T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma therapy; thus, her treatment was changed to a myeloid leukemia protocol, which produced a good response. She underwent a successful cord blood transplantation from an unrelated HLA partially matched donor. The coexistence of these two phenotypes prompts questions about the existence of clonal instability, which might influence the choice of therapy. The rarity of the t(12;13)(p13;q14) and the coexistence of T cell/myeloid markers suggest a nonrandom association. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which a cell clone bearing a t(12;13)(p13;q14) translocation in a mixed T cell/myeloid lesion was detected.","['Carneiro Borba, Claudio', 'de Lourdes Chauffaille, Maria', 'Saeed Sanabani, Sabri', 'Folloni Fernandes, Juliana', 'Aiko Kumeda, Cristina', 'Rodrigues Pereira Velloso, Elvira Deolinda', 'Jarandilha dos Santos, Katia', 'Puato Vieira Pupim, Marcia', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'Odone Filho, Vicente', 'Bendit, Israel']","['Carneiro Borba C', 'de Lourdes Chauffaille M', 'Saeed Sanabani S', 'Folloni Fernandes J', 'Aiko Kumeda C', 'Rodrigues Pereira Velloso ED', 'Jarandilha dos Santos K', 'Puato Vieira Pupim M', 'Hamerschlak N', 'Odone Filho V', 'Bendit I']","['Instituto de Tratamento do Cancer Infantil, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['000334881 [pii]', '10.1159/000334881 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2012;127(3):165-9. doi: 10.1159/000334881.

GvHD occurs as a consequence of multiple activating events in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells (Tcs). Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is an intracellular non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in multiple signaling events of immune cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that Syk may be a promising target to inhibit GvHD, which involves activation of different immune cell populations. In vivo expansion of luciferase(+) donor Tcs in mice developing GvHD was reduced by treatment with the Syk inhibitor Fostamatinib, which led to increased survival and reduced histologically confirmed GvHD severity. Importantly, in vivo and in vitro cytotoxicity against leukemia target cells and anti-murine cytomegalovirus immune responses were not impacted by Fostamatinib. In APCs Syk inhibition reduced the expression of costimulatory molecules and disrupted cytoskeletal organization with consecutive APC migratory defects in vitro and in vivo while phagocytic activity remained intact. On the basis of these immunomodulatory effects on different cell populations, we conclude that Syk targeting in alloantigen-activated Tcs and APCs with pharmacologic inhibitors, already applied successfully in anti-lymphoma therapy, has clinical potential to reduce GvHD, especially as anti-leukemia and anti-viral immunity were preserved.","['Leonhardt, F', 'Zirlik, K', 'Buchner, M', 'Prinz, G', 'Hechinger, A-K', 'Gerlach, U V', 'Fisch, P', 'Schmitt-Graff, A', 'Reichardt, W', 'Zeiser, R']","['Leonhardt F', 'Zirlik K', 'Buchner M', 'Prinz G', 'Hechinger AK', 'Gerlach UV', 'Fisch P', 'Schmitt-Graff A', 'Reichardt W', 'Zeiser R']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201210 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.10 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jul;26(7):1617-29. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.10.

Timely diagnosis of IPA improves survival but is difficult to make. We examined the analytical and clinical validity of galactomannan (GM) testing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in diagnosing IPA in a mixed population by retrospectively reviewing records of 251 consecutive at-risk patients for whom BAL fluid GM testing was ordered. The performance of the enzyme immunoassay was evaluated by using a range of index cutoffs to define positivity. Three samples were associated with proven IPA, 56 were associated with probable IPA, 63 were associated with possible invasive fungal disease (IFD), and 129 were associated with no IFD. Using a BAL fluid GM index of >/=0.8 (optimal optical density [OD] index cutoff identified by a receiver operating characteristic curve), the sensitivity in diagnosing proven and probable IPA was 86.4%, and the specificity was 90.7%. At this cutoff, positive and negative predictive values were 81% and 93.6%, respectively. However, an OD index value of >/=3.0 corresponded to a 100% specificity, thus ruling the disease in, irrespective of the pretest probability. Conversely, an OD index cutoff of <0.5 corresponded to a high sensitivity, virtually always ruling the disease out. For all values in between, the posttest probability of IPA depends largely on the prevalence of disease in the at-risk population and the likelihood ratio of the OD index value. Detection of GM in BAL fluid samples of patients at risk of IPA has an excellent diagnostic accuracy provided results are interpreted in parallel with clinico-radiological findings and pretest probabilities.","[""D'Haese, Jorien"", 'Theunissen, Koen', 'Vermeulen, Edith', 'Schoemans, Helene', 'De Vlieger, Greet', 'Lammertijn, Liesbet', 'Meersseman, Philippe', 'Meersseman, Wouter', 'Lagrou, Katrien', 'Maertens, Johan']","[""D'Haese J"", 'Theunissen K', 'Vermeulen E', 'Schoemans H', 'De Vlieger G', 'Lammertijn L', 'Meersseman P', 'Meersseman W', 'Lagrou K', 'Maertens J']","['Department of Hematology, Acute Leukemia and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, Campus Gasthuisberg, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/07/11 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JCM.06423-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JCM.06423-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2012 Apr;50(4):1258-63. doi: 10.1128/JCM.06423-11.

We examined them alone or in combination, on sister chromatid exchange rates and on human lymphocyte proliferation kinetics. The antitumor activity of these compounds, alone or in combination, was also tested on Leukemia P388-bearing mice. A pronounced cytogenetic and antineoplastic action was demonstrated by the compounds that contain either PHE or CHL as alkylators and are esterified with a steroidal nucleus having added a cholestene group in the 17 position of the D-ring. The exocyclical insertion of an -NHCO- group in the D-ring of the steroidal nucleus esterified with PHE (amide ester of PHE) yielded a compound demonstrating a distinct cytogenetic and antineoplastic effect. In contrast, the ketone group in the D-ring being inserted endocyclically in the steroidal nucleus (androstene) esterified with either CHL or with PHE gave negative cytogenetic and antineoplastic effects.

Treatment has been moving away from conventional chemotherapy and towards targeted therapy. The success of new classes of agents such as monoclonal antibodies, proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory derivatives has sparked further searches for novel pathways to inhibit. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) pathway is a downstream mediator of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway, which is crucial in B-cell production and maintenance, and a potential therapeutic target. AREAS COVERED: This review will summarize the current knowledge of the Btk pathway and its role in lymphoid malignancies. It will also discuss the present data about PCI-32765 in both the preclinical and clinical setting. EXPERT OPINION: PCI-32765 is an oral irreversible Btk inhibitor with high potency and both preclinical and clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Phase I studies have demonstrated that it is well tolerated and has an excellent safety profile. Further studies are ongoing as a single agent and in combination with other targeted and conventional therapies. PCI-32765 is a very promising targeted therapy, and the data from these trials will ultimately decide its future role and success.","['Winer, Eric S', 'Ingham, Randall R', 'Castillo, Jorge J']","['Winer ES', 'Ingham RR', 'Castillo JJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, 593 Eddy Street, Providence, RI 02903, USA. ewiner@lifespan.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/06/02 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.656199 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Mar;21(3):355-61. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.656199.

However, the role of the RIZ1 gene has not been well examined in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analyzed the expression and promoter methylation status of the RIZ1 gene in patients with newly diagnosed ALL by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. RIZ1 expression in 67 cases of ALL (mean 1.043) was decreased compared with that in normal bone marrow (mean 1.471) (p = 0.030). Methylation was detected in 11 of 71 patients (15.5%) but not in healthy controls. Methylation was associated with decreased RIZ1 expression in many ALL cases examined, but this was not statistically significant. In T-ALL, RIZ1 methylation was more frequent (63.6%) than in B-ALL (6.7%) (p < 0.0001) and the decrease of RIZ1 expression was more significant than in B-ALL (p = 0.045). 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of MOLT-4 cells with RIZ1 methylation induced demethylation of RIZ1 and restoration of expression. Forced RIZ1 expression in T-ALL cell lines suppressed cell growth accompanied by G2/M arrest and apoptosis. No mutations were found by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis in hotspots of the gene. These results suggest that RIZ1 is inactivated in adult ALL, and this inactivation is associated with methylation in T-ALL.","['Shimura, Hanae', 'Mori, Naoki', 'Wang, Yan-Hua', 'Okada, Michiko', 'Motoji, Toshiko']","['Shimura H', 'Mori N', 'Wang YH', 'Okada M', 'Motoji T']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.663086 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Aug;53(8):1599-609. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.663086.

Although the majority of HTLV-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic during their lifetime, approximately one percent of this population develops a myelopathy consisting of a chronic inflammation of the white and gray matter of the spinal cord. Glucocorticoids are widely used for treatment because of their anti-inflammatory properties, improving symptoms mainly in those patients with only a few years from onset of the disease, when inflammation is more prominent. Interferon-alpha and vitamin C are other therapies presenting some benefits in clinical practice, probably due to their anti-viral and immunomodulatory activities observed ex vivo.

This review is intended to bridge the gap between clinical and basic science by presenting recent findings on HAM/TSP disease, mechanisms of drug action, and benefits of these therapies in HAM/TSP patients.","['Pillat, Micheli Mainardi', 'Bauer, Moises Evandro', 'de Oliveira, Augusto Cesar Penalva', 'Ulrich, Henning', 'Casseb, Jorge']","['Pillat MM', 'Bauer ME', 'de Oliveira AC', 'Ulrich H', 'Casseb J']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of Sao Paulo, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Cent Nerv Syst Agents Med Chem,Central nervous system agents in medicinal chemistry,101269163,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['CNSAMC-EPUP-20120131-002 [pii]', '10.2174/1871524911106040239 [doi]']",ppublish,Cent Nerv Syst Agents Med Chem. 2011 Dec 1;11(4):239-45. doi: 10.2174/1871524911106040239.,,,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/therapy/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/epidemiology/therapy/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/epidemiology/*therapy/*virology', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/epidemiology/*therapy/*virology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to these three, there is a variety of fusion transcripts whose origin may depend either on diverse genetic rearrangement or on alternative/atypical splicing of the main mRNAs or on the occurrence of single-point mutations. Although the therapy of Ph+ leukaemias based on Imatinib represents a triumph of medicine, not all patients benefit from such drug and may show resistance and intolerance. Furthermore, interruption of Imatinib administration is often followed by clinical relapse, suggesting a failure in the eradication of residual leukaemic stem cells. Therefore, while the targeted therapy is searching for new and implemented pharmacological inhibitors covering all the possible mutations in the kinase domain, there is urge to identify alternative molecular targets to develop other specific and effective therapeutic approaches. In this review we discuss the importance of recent advances based on the discovery of novel BCR/ABL1 variants and their potential role as new targets/biomarkers of Ph+ leukaemias in the light of the current therapeutic trends. The limits of the pharmacological inhibitors used for treating the disease can be overcome by considering other targets than the kinase enzyme. Our evaluations highlight the potential of alternative perspectives in the therapy of Ph+ leukaemias.","['Chiarella, P', 'Summa, V', 'De Santis, S', 'Signori, E', 'Picardi, E', 'Pesole, G', 'Saglio, G', 'Fazio, V M']","['Chiarella P', 'Summa V', 'De Santis S', 'Signori E', 'Picardi E', 'Pesole G', 'Saglio G', 'Fazio VM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, CIR, University Campus Bio- Medico of Rome, Via A. del Portillo 21, 00128 Rome, Italy. p.chiarella@unicampus.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,2012/02/04 06:00,2012/10/18 06:00,['2012/02/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['CMM-EPub-20120201-001 [pii]', '10.2174/156652412800619996 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2012 Jun;12(5):547-65. doi: 10.2174/156652412800619996.,,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/prevention & control/therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 1887 adult patients with acute leukaemia who received bone marrow from human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings and were treated with myeloablative conditioning, 459 (24%) were treated with growth factor. Growth factor hastened engraftment of neutrophils (P < 0.0001), but reduced platelet counts (P = 0.0002). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free survival (no acute GVHD grade II-IV or chronic GVHD) at 10 years was 12 +/- 2% (+/-SE) in the growth factor group, as opposed to 17 +/- 2% in the controls [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, P = 0.001].

We examined the effects of the dual PI3-kinase/mTOR blocker NVP-BEZ235 on growth of normal and neoplastic BA and MC as well as immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent cell activation. Growth of MC and BA were determined by measuring (3)H-thymidine uptake and apoptosis. Cell activation was determined in histamine release experiments and by measuring upregulation of CD63 and CD203c after challenging with IgE plus anti-IgE or allergen. We found that NVP-BEZ235 exerts profound inhibitory effects on growth of primary and cloned neoplastic MC. In the MC leukemia cell line HMC-1, NVP-BEZ235 showed similar IC(50) values in the HMC-1.1 subclone lacking KIT D816V (0.025 microM) and the HMC-1.2 subclone expressing KIT D816V (0.005 microM). Moreover, NVP-BEZ235 was found to exert strong growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic MC in a xenotransplant-mouse model employing NMR1-Foxn1(nu) mice. NVP-BEZ235 also exerted inhibitory effects on cytokine-dependent differentiation of normal BA and MC, but did not induce growth inhibition or apoptosis in mature MC or normal bone marrow cells. Finally, NVP-BEZ235 was found to inhibit IgE-dependent histamine release in BA and MC (IC(50) 0.5-1 microM) as well as anti-IgE-induced upregulation of CD203c in BA and IgE-dependent upregulation of CD63 in MC. In summary, NVP-BEZ235 produces growth-inhibitory effects in immature neoplastic MC and inhibits IgE-dependent activation of mature BA and MC. Whether these potentially beneficial drug effects have clinical implications is currently under investigation.","['Blatt, Katharina', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Mirkina, Irina', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir', 'Peter, Barbara', 'Strommer, Sabine', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Hoetzenecker, Konrad', 'Klepetko, Walter', 'Ghanim, Viviane', 'Marth, Katharina', 'Fureder, Thorsten', 'Wacheck, Volker', 'Valenta, Rudolf', 'Valent, Peter']","['Blatt K', 'Herrmann H', 'Mirkina I', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Peter B', 'Strommer S', 'Hoermann G', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Hoetzenecker K', 'Klepetko W', 'Ghanim V', 'Marth K', 'Fureder T', 'Wacheck V', 'Valenta R', 'Valent P']","['Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/03 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2012/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0029925 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-12882 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e29925. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0029925.

The time- and dose-dependent effects of isolancifolide on apoptosis were determined by DNA fragmentation and propidium iodide staining, and the involvement of caspases and the Bcl-2 family in isolancifolide-induced apoptosis was assessed by Western blotting. During exposure to isolancifolide, the pro-forms or full length of caspases-8, -3, and Bid were decreased, as assessed by Western blotting, while the levels of cleaved forms of caspases-8, -3, and PARP were increased. We observed that the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria to the cytosol was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The caspase specific inhibitors, z-IETD-fmk and z-LEHD-fmk, blocked the accumulation of sub-G1 cells and the release of cytochrome c, but not that of Smac/DIABLO. These results indicate that isolancifolide induces apoptosis of HL-60 cells through both death receptor and mitochondria pathways, in caspase-8-dependent and -independent manners, suggesting that isolancifolide may be useful in anticancer strategies.","['Choi, Jeong June', 'Kwon, Ok-Kyoung', 'Oh, Sei-Ryang', 'Lee, Hyeong-Kyu', 'Ahn, Kyung-Seop']","['Choi JJ', 'Kwon OK', 'Oh SR', 'Lee HK', 'Ahn KS']","['Natural Medicine Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Cheongwon 363-883, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,2012/02/03 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12272-012-0115-x [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2012 Jan;35(1):137-43. doi: 10.1007/s12272-012-0115-x.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether grape seeds procyanidins affect the proliferation and redifferentiation in K562 cells. The sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay and trypan blue staining were used to measure cell proliferation and survival. Morphological changes, NBT reductive activity, and surface antigens were used to detect redifferentiation of K562 cells. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) were detected by a fluorescent probe. Grape seeds procyanidins inhibited cell proliferation but the treatment did not appreciably increase lethality. After treatment with grape seeds procyanidins, a typical differentiated morphology was observed. The positive rate of CD11b and CD14 cells and NBT reductive activities increased significantly. As antioxidants, grape seeds procyanidins can induce arrest in the phase G1 and decrease iROS formation. All results indicate that the antioxidant grape seeds procyanidins are likely to induce monocytic differentiation in leukemia cells, mostly through decreasing iROS formation and inducing phase G1 arrest.","['Wang, Min', 'Wang, Li', 'Pan, Xiao-Jing', 'Zhang, Hong']","['Wang M', 'Wang L', 'Pan XJ', 'Zhang H']","['State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,2012/02/03 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12272-012-0114-y [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2012 Jan;35(1):129-35. doi: 10.1007/s12272-012-0114-y.

Here, we show that oncogenic KITD814V-induced MPD occurs in the absence of ligand stimulation. The intracellular tyrosine residues are important for KITD814V-induced MPD, albeit to varying degrees. Among the seven intracellular tyrosines examined, tyrosine 719 alone has a unique role in regulating KITD814V-induced proliferation and survival in vitro, and MPD in vivo. Importantly, the extent to which AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Stat5 signaling pathways are activated via the seven intracellular tyrosines in KITD814V impacts the latency of MPD and severity of the disease. Our results identify critical signaling molecules involved in regulating KITD814V-induced MPD, which might be useful for developing novel therapeutic targets for hematologic malignancies involving this mutation.","['Ma, Peilin', 'Mali, Raghuveer Singh', 'Martin, Holly', 'Ramdas, Baskar', 'Sims, Emily', 'Kapur, Reuben']","['Ma P', 'Mali RS', 'Martin H', 'Ramdas B', 'Sims E', 'Kapur R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/03 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/02/03 06:00'],"['2012/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2012.22 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jul;26(7):1499-1506. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.22.

Data from retrospective analyses and prospective clinical trials show that approximately 5% of untreated CLL patients with treatment indication have a TP53 mutation in the absence of 17p deletion. These patients have a poor response and reduced progression-free survival and overall survival with standard treatment approaches. These data suggest that TP53 mutation testing warrants integration into current diagnostic work up of patients with CLL. There are a number of assays to detect TP53 mutations, which have respective advantages and shortcomings. Direct Sanger sequencing of exons 4-9 can be recommended as a suitable test to identify TP53 mutations for centers with limited experience with alternative screening methods. Recommendations are provided on standard operating procedures, quality control, reporting and interpretation. Patients with treatment indications should be investigated for TP53 mutations in addition to the work-up recommended by the International workshop on CLL guidelines. Patients with TP53 mutation may be considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission. Alemtuzumab-based regimens can yield a substantial proportion of complete responses, although of short duration.

The etiology of AML is not well understood. A case-control study was conducted at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center to investigate associations between lifestyle characteristics and the risk of AML in Texas. METHODS: This study included 638 adult patients with de novo AML (cases) and a group of 636 matched controls. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect demographic and occupational data. The distribution of cases by World Health Organization (WHO) subtype was 71 patients (11%) with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities (AML-RCA), 134 patients (21%) with multilineage dysplasia (AML-MD), and 389 patients (61%) with AML not otherwise categorized (AML-NOC). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed among all AML cases and among both sexes and each WHO subgroup. RESULTS: Among men, heavy smoking (>/=30 pack-years; odds ratio [OR], 1.86) and occupational solvent exposure at low levels (OR, 2.87) or moderate/high levels (OR, 4.13) statistically significantly increased the risk of AML. Among women, obesity (OR, 1.62) and solvent exposure to low levels (OR, 2.73) or moderate/high levels (OR, 3.90) increased the risk of AML. Across WHO subtypes, obesity was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of AML-RCA (OR, 3.15), whereas solvent exposure increased the risk in all subtypes at low levels (AML-RCA: OR, 4.11; AML-MD: OR, 2.54) and moderate/high levels (AML-RCA: OR, 5.13; AML-MD: OR, 3.02). A joint effect between smoking and solvent exposure was observed, and the highest risk was observed among smokers who had solvent exposure (OR, 4.51). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that several factors play a role in AML predisposition with possible joint effects. Risk profiles for AML differed by sex and WHO subtype.","['Strom, Sara S', 'Oum, Robert', 'Elhor Gbito, Kplola Y', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Yamamura, Yuko']","['Strom SS', 'Oum R', 'Elhor Gbito KY', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Yamamura Y']","['Department of Epidemiology, The University of Texas M.

The aim of this nationwide study was to examine whether there is an association between cancer and first hospitalisation for haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke. METHODS: All 820,491 individuals in Sweden with a diagnosis of cancer between 1st January 1987 and 31st December 2008 were followed for first hospitalisation for haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke. The reference population was the total population of Sweden without cancer. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for haemorrhagic and ischaemic strokes were calculated. RESULTS: Overall risk of haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke during the first 6 months after diagnosis of cancer was 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI)= 2.0-2.3) and 1.6 (CI = 1.5-1.6), respectively. For 18 and 20 of the 34 cancers studied, respectively, risk of haemorrhagic and ischaemic strokes was increased.

The risk of stroke was highest during the first 6 months after diagnosis of cancer of the nervous system (29 (CI = 25-34) for haemorrhagic stroke and 4.1 (CI = 3.4-4.8) for ischaemic stroke)) or leukaemia (13 (CI = 10-16) for haemorrhagic stroke and 3.0 (CI = 2.5-3.7) for ischaemic stroke)). Metastasis was associated with an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke 2.2 (CI = 1.8-2.7) and ischaemic stroke 1.5 (CI = 1.3-1.7). INTERPRETATION: Several cancer sites/types are associated with an increased risk of haemorrhagic and ischaemic strokes.","['Zoller, Bengt', 'Ji, Jianguang', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Sundquist, Kristina']","['Zoller B', 'Ji J', 'Sundquist J', 'Sundquist K']","['Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University/Region Skane, Clinical Research Centre, Floor 11, Building 28, Entrance 72, Skane University Hospital, 205 02 Malmo, Sweden. bengt.zoller@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,2012/02/03 06:00,2012/10/09 06:00,['2012/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(12)00010-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2012.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2012 Aug;48(12):1875-83. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2012.01.005.

However, many genes are highly correlated in gene expression data, and hence, many possible sets of genes are potential classifiers. Because treatment outcomes are poor in advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we hypothesized that expression of classifiers of advanced phase CML when detected in early CML [chronic phase (CP) CML], correlates with subsequent poorer therapeutic outcome. RESULTS: We developed a method that integrates gene expression data with expert knowledge and predicted functional relationships using iterative Bayesian model averaging. Applying our integrated method to CML, we identified small sets of signature genes that are highly predictive of disease phases and that are more robust and stable than using expression data alone. The accuracy of our algorithm was evaluated using cross-validation on the gene expression data. We then tested the hypothesis that gene sets associated with advanced phase CML would predict relapse after allogeneic transplantation in 176 independent CP CML cases. Our gene signatures of advanced phase CML are predictive of relapse even after adjustment for known risk factors associated with transplant outcomes.","['Yeung, K Y', 'Gooley, T A', 'Zhang, A', 'Raftery, A E', 'Radich, J P', 'Oehler, V G']","['Yeung KY', 'Gooley TA', 'Zhang A', 'Raftery AE', 'Radich JP', 'Oehler VG']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. kayee@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,2012/02/03 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/02/03 06:00'],"['2012/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['bts059 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/bts059 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2012 Mar 15;28(6):823-30. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts059.

Chromosome 21 gene dosage effects and truncating mutations of the X-chromosomal transcription factor GATA1 synergize to trigger TMD and AMKL in most patients. Here, we report the occurrence of TMD, which spontaneously remitted and later progressed to AMKL in a patient without DS but with a distinct dysmorphic syndrome. Genetic analysis of the leukaemic clone revealed somatic trisomy 21 and a truncating GATA1 mutation. The analysis of the patient's normal blood cell DNA on a genomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array revealed a de novo germ line 2.58 Mb 15q24 microdeletion including 41 known genes encompassing the tumour suppressor PML. Genomic context analysis of proteins encoded by genes that are included in the microdeletion, chromosome 21-encoded proteins and GATA1 suggests that the microdeletion may trigger leukaemogenesis by disturbing the balance of a hypothetical regulatory network of normal megakaryopoiesis involving PML, SUMO3 and GATA1. The 15q24 microdeletion may thus represent the first genetic hit to initiate leukaemogenesis and implicates PML and SUMO3 as novel components of the leukaemogenic network in TMD/AMKL.","['Haemmerling, Susanne', 'Behnisch, Wolfgang', 'Doerks, Tobias', 'Korbel, Jan O', 'Bork, Peer', 'Moog, Ute', 'Hentze, Sabine', 'Grasshoff, Ute', 'Bonin, Michael', 'Riess, Olaf', 'Janssen, Johannes W G', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Koch, Karin A', 'Bandapalli, Obul R', 'Kulozik, Andreas E']","['Haemmerling S', 'Behnisch W', 'Doerks T', 'Korbel JO', 'Bork P', 'Moog U', 'Hentze S', 'Grasshoff U', 'Bonin M', 'Riess O', 'Janssen JW', 'Jauch A', 'Bartram CR', 'Reinhardt D', 'Koch KA', 'Bandapalli OR', 'Kulozik AE']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Haematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,2012/02/03 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09028.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Apr;157(2):180-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09028.x.

In addition, survival of childhood cancer patients is often described in specialized hospitals and/or institutions, but not in the general population. METHODS: All children aged 0-15 years who were newly diagnosed as having cancer were registered from 18 treatment centers during 2003-5 and classified into 12 diagnostic groups according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. Incidences were calculated by a standard method and survival was investigated using the ThaiPOG (Thai Pediatric Oncology Group) population-based registration data. Overall survival was calculated by the Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: In the study period (2003-5) 2,792 newly diagnosed cases of childhood cancer were registered, with mean and median ages of 6.5 (SD=0.13) and 5.0 (0-14) years, respectively. The age-peak was between 1 and 4 years and the age-standardized rate (ASR) was 74.9 per million. Leukemia was the most common cancer (N=1421, ASR 38.1) followed by lymphoma (N=266, ASR 6.4) and neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS, N=246, ASR 6.3). The follow-up duration totaled 101,250 months. The death rate was 1.11 per 100 person-months (95%CI: 1.02 -1.20). The 5-year overall survival was 54.9% (95%CI: 53.0%-56.9%) for all cancers. The respective, 5-year overall survival for (1) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), (2) acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), (3) lymphoma, (4) retinoblastoma, (5) renal tumors, (6) liver tumors, (7) germ cell tumors, (8) CNS tumors, (9) neuroblastoma, (10) soft tissue tumors and (11) bone tumors were (1) 64.5%, (2) 35.1%, (3) 59.5%, (4) 73.1%, (5) 70.4%, (6) 44.5%, (7) 70.6%, (8) 41.7%, (9) 33.6%, (10) 50.1%, and (11) 33.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood cancer is lower than in western countries. Respective overall survival for ALL, lymphoma, renal tumors, liver tumors, retinoblastoma, soft tissue tumors is lower than those reported in developed countries while for CNS tumors, neuroblastoma and germ cell tumors the figures are comparable.","['Wiangnon, Surapon', 'Veerakul, Gavivann', 'Nuchprayoon, Issarang', 'Seksarn, Panya', 'Hongeng, Suradej', 'Krutvecho, Triroj', 'Sripaiboonkij, Nintita']","['Wiangnon S', 'Veerakul G', 'Nuchprayoon I', 'Seksarn P', 'Hongeng S', 'Krutvecho T', 'Sripaiboonkij N']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand. suraponwiangnon@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,2012/02/03 06:00,2012/09/19 06:00,['2012/02/03 06:00'],"['2012/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2011;12(9):2215-20.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Survival', 'Survival Rate', 'Thailand/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic silencing through promoter methylation of a number of genes is present in poor-risk subtypes of MDS and often predicts transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Azacitidine and decitabine, two FDA-approved DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, are able to improve overall response although their oral bioavailability complicates their clinical use. This study evaluated 2', 3', 5'-triacetyl-5-azacitidine (TAC) as a potential prodrug for azacitidine. The prodrug demonstrated significant pharmacokinetic improvements in bioavailability, solubility, and stability over the parent compound. In vivo analyses indicated a lack of general toxicity coupled with significantly improved survival. Pharmacodynamic analyses confirmed its ability to suppress global methylation in vivo. These data indicate that esterified nucleoside derivatives may be effective prodrugs for azacitidine and encourages further investigation of TAC into its metabolism, activity, and possible clinical evaluation.","['Ziemba, Amy', 'Hayes, Eugene', 'Freeman, Burgess B 3rd', 'Ye, Tao', 'Pizzorno, Giuseppe']","['Ziemba A', 'Hayes E', 'Freeman BB 3rd', 'Ye T', 'Pizzorno G']","['Nevada Cancer Institute, One Breakthough Way, Las Vegas, NV 89135, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Chemother Res Pract,Chemotherapy research and practice,101566606,2012/02/02 06:00,2012/02/02 06:01,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/965826 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemother Res Pract. 2011;2011:965826. doi: 10.1155/2011/965826.

An abnormally protease-resistant and insoluble form (PrP(Sc)) of the normally soluble protease-sensitive host prion protein (PrP(C)) is the major component of the infectious prion. During the course of prion disease, PrP(Sc) accumulates primarily in the lymphoreticular and central nervous systems. Recent studies have shown that co-infection of prion-infected fibroblast cells with the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) strongly enhanced the release and spread of scrapie infectivity in cell culture, suggesting that retroviral coinfection might significantly influence prion spread and disease incubation times in vivo. We now show that another retrovirus, the murine leukemia virus Friend (F-MuLV), also enhanced the release and spread of scrapie infectivity in cell culture. However, peripheral co-infection of mice with both Friend virus and the mouse scrapie strain 22L did not alter scrapie disease incubation times, the levels of PrP(Sc) in the brain or spleen, or the distribution of pathological lesions in the brain. Thus, retroviral co-infection does not necessarily alter prion disease pathogenesis in vivo, most likely because of different cell-specific sites of replication for scrapie and F-MuLV.","['Leblanc, Pascal', 'Hasenkrug, Kim', 'Ward, Anne', 'Myers, Lara', 'Messer, Ronald J', 'Alais, Sandrine', 'Timmes, Andrew', 'Priola, Suzette A']","['Leblanc P', 'Hasenkrug K', 'Ward A', 'Myers L', 'Messer RJ', 'Alais S', 'Timmes A', 'Priola SA']","['Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/02 06:00,2012/06/09 06:00,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030872 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-23820 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30872. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030872.

High EVI1 expression (EVI1(high)) is a risk factor for AML with poor outcome. Using DNA microarray analysis, we previously identified that integrin alpha6 (ITGA6) was upregulated over 10-fold in EVI1(high) leukemia cells. In this study, we determined whether the increased expression of ITGA6 is associated with drug-resistance and increased cell adhesion, resulting in poor prognosis. To this end, we first confirmed the expression pattern of a series of integrin genes using semi-quantitative PCR and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis and determined the cell adhesion ability in EVI1(high) leukemia cells. We found that the adhesion ability of EVI1(high) leukemia cells to laminin increased with the increased expression of ITGA6 and integrin beta4 (ITGB4). The introduction of small-hairpin RNA against EVI1 (shEVI1) into EVI1(high) leukemia cells reduced the cell adhesion ability and downregulated the expression of ITGA6 and ITGB4. In addition, the overexpression of EVI1 in EVI1(low) leukemia cells enhanced their cell adhesion ability and increased the expression of ITGA6 and ITGB4. In a subsequent experiment, the introduction of shRNA against ITGA6 or ITGB4 into EVI1(high) AML cells downregulated their cell adhesion ability; however, the EVI1(high) AML cells transfected with shRNA against ITGA6 could not be maintained in culture. Moreover, treating EVI1(high) leukemia cells with neutralizing antibodies against ITGA6 or ITGB4 resulted in an enhanced responsiveness to anti-cancer drugs and a reduction of their cell adhesion ability. The expression of ITGA6 is significantly elevated in cells from relapsed and EVI1(high) AML cases; therefore, ITGA6 might represent an important therapeutic target for both refractory and EVI1(high) AML.","['Yamakawa, Norio', 'Kaneda, Kazuko', 'Saito, Yusuke', 'Ichihara, Emi', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Yamakawa N', 'Kaneda K', 'Saito Y', 'Ichihara E', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/02 06:00,2012/06/09 06:00,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030706 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-14771 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30706. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030706.

This R107L mutation remained in leukocytes of the remission stage in which GATA1 mutation disappeared, suggesting the TRIB1 mutation is an earlier genetic event in leukemogenesis. The bone marrow transfer experiment showed that acute myeloid leukemia development was accelerated by transducing murine bone marrow cells with the R107L mutant in which enhancement of ERK phosphorylation and C/EBPalpha degradation by Trib1 expression was even greater than in those expressing wild-type.

PROCEDURE: Two types of subjects were included: ALL patients 5 plus years old in a multi-center clinical trial and general population control groups. Patients were assessed during all four major phases of active treatment and approximately 2 years after treatment. Health status and HRQL were measured using HEALTH UTILITIES INDEX(R) (HUI(R)) Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3). HRQL scores were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Excess disability rates identified attributes for remediation. RESULTS: HUI assessments (n = 749) were collected during the five phases. Mean HRQL increased from induction through the post-treatment phase (P < 0.001). There were no significant demographic or treatment effects on HRQL, except for type of asparaginase during continuation therapy (P = 0.005 for HUI2 and P = 0.007 for HUI3). Differences in mean HRQL scores between patients and controls were important (P < 0.001) during the active treatment phases but not during the post-treatment phase. Relative to controls, patients lost approximately 0.2 QALYs during active treatment. Disability was evident in mobility/ambulation, emotion, self-care and pain, and declined over time. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALL experienced important but declining deficits in HRQL during active treatment phases: Equivalent to losing approximately 2 months of life in perfect health. HRQL within the 2-years post-treatment phase was similar to controls. The policy challenge is to develop new treatment protocols producing fewer disabilities in mobility/ambulation, emotion, self-care, and pain without compromising survival.","['Furlong, William', 'Rae, Charlene', 'Feeny, David', 'Gelber, Richard D', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Silverman, Lewis', 'Sallan, Stephen', 'Barr, Ronald']","['Furlong W', 'Rae C', 'Feeny D', 'Gelber RD', 'Laverdiere C', 'Michon B', 'Silverman L', 'Sallan S', 'Barr R']","['Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, and Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. furlongb@mcmaster.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,2012/02/02 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24096 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Oct;59(4):717-24. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24096.

Midostaurin is active in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and systemic mastocytosis. Although no substantive risk for cardiac abnormalities has been observed with midostaurin in clinical studies thus far, some TKIs have been shown to affect cardiac repolarization. Here we evaluated midostaurin's effect on cardiac repolarization. METHODS: This phase I study evaluated the effect of midostaurin (75 mg twice daily for 2 days; 75 mg once on day 3) on the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval in a parallel design with active (moxifloxacin) and placebo control arms in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The maximum mean QTc change from baseline corrected using Fridericia's correction (QTcF) for midostaurin compared with placebo was 0.7 ms at 24 h post dose on day 3. The highest upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI was 4.7 ms, which excluded 10 ms, demonstrating a lack of QTcF prolongation effect. Assay sensitivity was demonstrated by modeling the moxifloxacin plasma concentration versus QTcF change from baseline, which showed a clear positive increase in QTcF with increasing moxifloxacin plasma concentrations, as expected based on previous studies. In the 4-day evaluation period, a minority of participants (34.6%) experienced an adverse event; 97.0% were grade 1. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported.

In the present study, we found that Ni(2)(+) exposure led to a time- and dose-dependent proliferation arrest and death in human leukemia HL-60 cells. In the presence of 1 mM Ni(2)(+), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (indicated by the level of malondialdehyde) increased to 323% and histone acetylation decreased to 32%. Interestingly, quercetin (QU) dose dependently prevented Ni(2)(+)-induced cell proliferation arrest and death from 0 to 80 muM but showed similar activity of scavenging ROS at the concentrations of 20, 40 and 80 microM. When the effect of QU on histone acetylation was studied, QU significantly prevented Ni(2)(+)-induced histone hypoacetylation at 40 or 80 microM. Moreover, increase in histone acetylation by trichostatin A could also significantly enhance the protection effect of QU at 10 or 20 microM but not at higher concentrations. Thus, our results further confirmed the critical role of ROS and histone hypoacetylation in the cytotoxicity of Ni(2)(+) exposure and proved that QU is a potentially useful native dietary compound to efficiently prevent Ni(2)(+)-caused cytotoxicity through both diminishing ROS generation and increasing histone acetylation.","['Chen, Jie', 'Han, Jia', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Chen J', 'Han J', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,2012/02/02 06:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0748233711433940 [pii]', '10.1177/0748233711433940 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 2013 May;29(4):360-6. doi: 10.1177/0748233711433940.

With the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, the all-cause annual mortality rate was reduced to 2%. Therefore, the prevalence of CML is increasing over time. Estimating the CML prevalence and plateau prevalence is important in the implementation of health care strategies and future therapeutic trials. The objective of this report was to estimate the increasing prevalence and plateau prevalence of CML in future years. METHODS: The prevalence of CML was estimated based on several parameters: the annual mortality rate on TKI therapy compared with a age-matched, normal population; the incidence of CML; the anticipated population growth in the United States; and aging of the population. RESULTS: On the basis of these calculations, the mortality ratio of patients with CML compared with an age-matched normal population was approximately 1.53. The estimated prevalence of CML is approximately 70,000 in 2010, 112,000 in 2020, 144,000 in 2030, 167,000 in 2040, and 181,000 in 2050, when it will reach a near plateau prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the prevalence of CML will continue to increase to reach a near plateau prevalence 35 times the annual incidence. These estimates should be considered in health care policies and in the design of future studies in CML.","['Huang, Xuelin', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Huang X', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. xlhuang@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2012/02/02 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26679 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jun 15;118(12):3123-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26679.

Interindividual susceptibility has been mainly addressed by evaluating the role of genetic polymorphism in metabolic enzymes in inorganic arsenic (iAs) metabolism. Glutathione S-transferase omega 1-1 (GSTO1-1), which had been associated with iAs metabolism, is also known to participate in inflammatory and apoptotic cellular responses. The polymorphism A140D of GSTO1-1 has been not only associated with distinct urinary profile of arsenic metabolites in populations chronically exposed to iAs in drinking water, but also with higher risk of childhood leukemia and lung disease in non-exposed populations, suggesting that GSTO1-1 involvement in other physiologic processes different from toxics metabolism could be more relevant than is thought. We evaluated the association of the presence of A140D and E208K polymorphisms of GSTO1-1 gene with the expression of genes codifying for proteins involved in the inflammatory and apoptotic response in a human population chronically exposed to iAs through drinking water. A140D polymorphism was associated with higher expression of genes codifying for IL-8 and Apaf-1 mainly in heterozygous individuals, while E208K was associated with higher expression of IL-8 and TGF- gene, in both cases, the association was independently of iAs exposure level; however, the exposure to iAs increased slightly but significantly the influence of A140D and E208K polymorphisms on such genes expression. These results suggest an important role of GSTO1-1 in the inflammatory response and the apoptotic process and indicate that A140D and E208K polymorphisms could increase the risk of developing inflammatory and apoptosis-related diseases in As-exposed populations.","['Escobar-Garcia, D M', 'Del Razo, L M', 'Sanchez-Pena, L C', 'Mandeville, P B', 'Lopez-Campos, C', 'Escudero-Lourdes, Claudia']","['Escobar-Garcia DM', 'Del Razo LM', 'Sanchez-Pena LC', 'Mandeville PB', 'Lopez-Campos C', 'Escudero-Lourdes C']","['Laboratorio de Inmunologia y Biologia Celular y Molecular, Centro de Investigacion y Estudios de Posgrado (CIEP), Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi (UASLP), Av.

The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis involves regulation of apoptotic events caused by the Bcl-2 family proteins, including the anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members. However, little has been reported on the role of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in rat late-stage erythroblasts that are no longer erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent. In the present study, to investigate this we analyzed changes in apoptosis-related factors that occurred in vitro. EPO stimulation resulted in reduced apoptotic cell death of the late-stage erythroblasts accompanied by decreased caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities, which is indicative of the induction of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Analysis of mRNA expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins demonstrated that EPO stimulation up-regulated the Bcl-xL mRNA, resulting in decreases in the mRNA ratios of Bak, Bax, and Bad to Bcl-xL. Also, the mRNA ratios of Bak and Noxa to Mcl-1 were decreased, mainly due to up-regulation of Mcl-1 mRNA. These results showed a close association between reduced apoptotic cell death and increased mRNA levels of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 in the presence of EPO. Thus, the present study suggests that Bcl-xL may be an important anti-apoptotic factor of rat late-stage erythroblasts as has been reported in murine erythroblasts. Moreover, the results also indicate the possibility that Mcl-1 may act on the rat late-stage erythroblasts as an anti-apoptotic factor.","['Asano, Hiroyuki', 'Fukunaga, Satoki', 'Deguchi, Yoshihito', 'Kawamura, Satoshi', 'Inaba, Mutsumi']","['Asano H', 'Fukunaga S', 'Deguchi Y', 'Kawamura S', 'Inaba M']","['Environmental Health Science Laboratory, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., 3-1-98 Kasugade-Naka, Komohana-ku, Osaka, 554-8558, Japan. asanot2@sc.sumitomo-chem.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Toxicol Sci,The Journal of toxicological sciences,7805798,2012/02/02 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jts/37.23 [pii]', '10.2131/jts.37.23 [doi]']",ppublish,J Toxicol Sci. 2012 Feb;37(1):23-31. doi: 10.2131/jts.37.23.,,,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was carried out for the first time to examine the potential role and the underlying mechanisms of A. cinnamomea in the differentiation of human leukemia HL60 cells. We found that the methanol extract of liquid cultured mycelia of A. cinnamomea (MEMAC) inhibited proliferation and induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest in HL60 cells. MEMAC could induce differentiation of HL60 cells into the monocytic lineage, as evaluated by the morphological change, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay, non-specific esterase assay, and expression of CD14 and CD11b surface antigens. In addition, MEMAC activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and increased CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) expression. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that MEMAC upregulated the expression of C/EBPbeta and CD14 mRNA in HL60 cells. DNA affinity precipitation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that MEMAC enhanced the direct binding of C/EBPbeta to its response element located at upstream of the CD14 promoter. Furthermore, inhibiting ERK pathway activation with PD98059 markedly blocked MEMAC-induced HL60 monocytic differentiation. Consistently, the MEMAC-mediated upregulation of C/EBPbeta and CD14 was also suppressed by PD98059. These findings demonstrate that MEMAC-induced HL60 cell monocytic differentiation is via the activating ERK signaling pathway, and downstream upregulating the transcription factor C/EBPbeta and differentiation marker CD14 gene, suggesting that MEMAC might be a potential differentiation-inducing agent for treatment of leukemia.","['Wen, Chi-Luan', 'Teng, Chieh-Lin', 'Chiang, Chih-Hung', 'Chang, Chia-Chuan', 'Hwang, Wen-Lee', 'Kuo, Chao-Lin', 'Hsu, Shih-Lan']","['Wen CL', 'Teng CL', 'Chiang CH', 'Chang CC', 'Hwang WL', 'Kuo CL', 'Hsu SL']","['Taiwan Seed Improvement and Propagation Station, Council of Agriculture, Propagation Technology Section, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,2012/02/02 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0944-7113(11)00528-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2011.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2012 Mar 15;19(5):424-35. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2011.11.003.

Here we present the evidence that TGIF (TG-interacting factor) is an additional TALE superfamily member involved in the regulation of human SOX3 gene expression in NT2/D1 cells by direct interaction with the consensus binding site that is conserved in primate orthologue promoters. Functional analysis demonstrated that mutation of the TGIF binding site resulted in the activation of SOX3 promoter. TGIF overexpression downregulates SOX3 promoter activity and decreases endogenous SOX3 protein expression in both uninduced and retinoic acid (RA)-induced NT2/D1 cells. Up to now, this is the first transcription factor identified as a negative regulator of SOX3 gene expression.

They can ""hijack"" membrane components from their parental cells and exert pleiotropic effects on tumor progression. Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG1) K(+) channels are highly expressed in cancer cells and appear of exceptional importance in favoring cancer development. Given the attributes of MVs and hERG1 K(+) channels in disease progression, we investigated the putative relationship between hERG1 K(+) channels and MVs in leukemia. The protein content of MVs isolated from K562 cell supernatants was significantly higher than that from HL-60 cells. The molecular profile of these MVs showed that in addition to the myeloid lineage antigen (CD11b), MVs contained hERG1 K(+) channels. Interestingly, inhibition of hERG1 K(+) channels rapidly reduced MV fractions in supernatants. Furthermore, MVs created positive feedback loops to facilitate leukemogenesis. Upon exposure to MVs, the plasma membrane expression of hERG1 protein was in turn up-regulated, the migration of leukemia cells was significantly increased, and the adhesion of leukemia cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was markedly enhanced. Importantly, hERG1 K(+) channel inhibitor E-4031 impaired these effects. We conclude that leukemia cell-derived MVs can ""hijack"" the plasma membrane hERG1 K(+) channels, which regulate the release of MVs and their biological effects upon leukemia cells.","['Zheng, Fang', 'Li, Juanjuan', 'Du, Wen', 'Wang, Ningfang', 'Li, Huiyu', 'Huang, Shiang']","['Zheng F', 'Li J', 'Du W', 'Wang N', 'Li H', 'Huang S']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/02/02 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.661855 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Aug;53(8):1592-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.661855.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between duration of breastfeeding and risk of childhood leukemia in Oman. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a case control study all recently diagnosed and registered cases of childhood leukemia at the National Registry during (1999-2009), a total of 70 cases, were recruited. For each case, a gender and age matched control was selected either from the family relatives or from the neighbors of family siblings. RESULTS: Breastfeeding is culturally favored for longer periods of time (up to 24 months) in Oman. Data of this study revealed that 21% of cases and 12 % of their gender and age matched controls were breastfed for an average duration of 6-12 months. In 75% of the cases and 81% of controls the period of breastfeeding was between 12-24 months. Only 4% of the cases and 7% of controls were breastfed for a period more than 24 months. No significant (P>0.05) differences were observed between the cases and controls with respect to breastfeeding and the risk of childhood leukemia in Oman. Similarly the duration of breast feeding did not have any significant (P>0.05) effect on the risk. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that duration of breastfeeding was not associated with risk of childhood leukemia in Oman and there may be some other environmental and genetic factors that might be responsible for the occurrence of this disease that must be explored further.","['Waly, Mostafa I', 'Ali, Amanat', 'Al-Saadoon, Muna', 'Al-Mukhaini, Yahya K', 'Wali, Yasser A']","['Waly MI', 'Ali A', 'Al-Saadoon M', 'Al-Mukhaini YK', 'Wali YA']","['Department of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman. waly.mostafa@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,2012/02/02 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2012/02/02 06:00'],"['2012/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2011;12(8):2087-91.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Eating', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Oman/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even new strategies that target RAS/RAF signaling and display unprecedented efficacy are characterized by resistance mechanisms. The targeting of survival pathways would be an attractive alternative strategy, if tumor-specific cell death can be achieved. Bcl-2 proteins play a central role in regulating survival of tumor cells. In this study, we systematically investigated the relevance of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, i.e., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1, in melanoma cell lines and non-malignant cells using RNAi. We found that melanoma cells required the presence of specific antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins: Inhibition of Mcl-1 and A1 strongly induced cell death in some melanoma cell lines, whereas non-malignant cells, i.e., primary human fibroblasts or keratinocytes were not affected. This specific sensitivity of melanoma cells was further enhanced by the combined inhibition of Mcl-1 and A1 and resulted in 60% to 80% cell death in all melanoma cell lines tested. This treatment was successfully combined with chemotherapy, which killed a substantial proportion of cells that survived Mcl-1 and A1 inhibition. Together, these results identify antiapoptotic proteins on which specifically melanoma cells rely on and, thus, provide a basis for the development of new Bcl-2 protein-targeting therapies.","['Senft, Daniela', 'Berking, Carola', 'Graf, Saskia A', 'Kammerbauer, Claudia', 'Ruzicka, Thomas', 'Besch, Robert']","['Senft D', 'Berking C', 'Graf SA', 'Kammerbauer C', 'Ruzicka T', 'Besch R']","['Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Ludwig-Maximilian University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030821 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-16553 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30821. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030821.

The non-thermal effect of FIR was recently found to play a role in the long-term protective effect on vascular function, but its molecular mechanism is still unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the biological effect of FIR on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that FIR ranging 3 approximately 10 microm significantly inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation in HUVECs. According to intensity and time course analyses, the inhibitory effect of FIR peaked at an effective intensity of 0.13 mW/cm(2) at 30 min. On the other hand, a thermal effect did not inhibit VEGF-induced proliferation in HUVECs. FIR exposure also inhibited the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases in HUVECs. FIR exposure further induced the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and NO generation in VEGF-treated HUVECs. Both VEGF-induced NO and reactive oxygen species generation was involved in the inhibitory effect of FIR. Nitrotyrosine formation significantly increased in HUVECs treated with VEGF and FIR together. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by wortmannin abolished the FIR-induced phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in HUVECs. FIR exposure upregulated the expression of PI3K p85 at the transcriptional level. We further found that FIR exposure induced the nuclear translocation of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) in HUVECs. This induction was independent of a thermal effect. The small interfering RNA transfection of PLZF blocked FIR-increased PI3K levels and the inhibitory effect of FIR. These data suggest that FIR induces the nuclear translocation of PLZF which inhibits VEGF-induced proliferation in HUVECs.","['Hsu, Yung-Ho', 'Chen, Yen-Cheng', 'Chen, Tso-Hsiao', 'Sue, Yuh-Mou', 'Cheng, Tzu-Hurng', 'Chen, Jia-Rung', 'Chen, Cheng-Hsien']","['Hsu YH', 'Chen YC', 'Chen TH', 'Sue YM', 'Cheng TH', 'Chen JR', 'Chen CH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030674 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-18934 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30674. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030674.

These cytokines share gp130 as a common signal transducer, which explains why they show some functional redundancy. Recently, it was demonstrated that IL-6 promotes fetal lung branching. Additionally, LIF has been implicated in developmental processes of some branching organs. Thus, in this study LIF expression pattern and its effects on fetal rat lung morphogenesis were assessed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: LIF and its subunit receptor LIFRalpha expression levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot in fetal rat lungs of different gestational ages, ranging from 13.5 to 21.5 days post-conception. Throughout all gestational ages studied, LIF was constitutively expressed in pulmonary epithelium, whereas LIFRalpha was first mainly expressed in the mesenchyme, but after pseudoglandular stage it was also observed in epithelial cells. These results point to a LIF epithelium-mesenchyme cross-talk, which is known to be important for lung branching process. Regarding functional studies, fetal lung explants were cultured with increasing doses of LIF or LIF neutralizing antibodies during 4 days. MAPK, AKT, and STAT3 phosphorylation in the treated lung explants was analyzed. LIF supplementation significantly inhibited lung growth in spite of an increase in p44/42 phosphorylation. On the other hand, LIF inhibition significantly stimulated lung growth via p38 and Akt pathways. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present study describes that LIF and its subunit receptor LIFRalpha are constitutively expressed during fetal lung development and that they have an inhibitory physiological role on fetal lung branching.","['Nogueira-Silva, Cristina', 'Piairo, Paulina', 'Carvalho-Dias, Emanuel', 'Peixoto, Francisca O', 'Moura, Rute S', 'Correia-Pinto, Jorge']","['Nogueira-Silva C', 'Piairo P', 'Carvalho-Dias E', 'Peixoto FO', 'Moura RS', 'Correia-Pinto J']","['Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030517 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-16326 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30517. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030517.

Despite this widespread interest, our knowledge of the molecular signaling pathways that are active in iPSCs and that play a role in controlling their fate have not been studied in detail. To address this shortfall, we have characterized the influence of different signals on the behavior of a model mouse iPSC line. We demonstrate significant responses of this iPSC line to the presence of serum, which leads to profoundly enhanced proliferation and, depending on the medium used, a reduction in the capacity of the iPSCs to self-renew. Surprisingly, this iPSC line was less sensitive to withdrawal of LIF compared to ESCs, exemplified by maintenance of expression of a Nanog-GFP reporter and enhanced self-renewal in the absence of LIF. While inhibition of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling decreased iPSC self-renewal, inhibition of Gsk-3 promoted it, even in the absence of LIF. High passages of this iPSC line displayed altered characteristics, including genetic instability and a reduced ability to self-renew. However, this second feature could be restored upon inhibition of Gsk-3. Collectively, our data suggest modulation of Gsk-3 activity plays a key role in the control of iPSC fate. We propose that more careful consideration should be given to characterization of the molecular pathways that control the fate of different iPSC lines, since perturbations from those observed in naive pluripotent ESCs could render iPSCs and their derivatives susceptible to aberrant and potentially undesirable behaviors.","['Orlando, Luca', 'Sanchez-Ripoll, Yolanda', 'Foster, James', 'Bone, Heather', 'Giachino, Claudia', 'Welham, Melanie J']","['Orlando L', 'Sanchez-Ripoll Y', 'Foster J', 'Bone H', 'Giachino C', 'Welham MJ']","['Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom. luca.orlando@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030234 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-19105 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30234. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030234.

Whether this alteration also affects outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) remains uncertain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 206 patients who underwent HLA-identical sibling and matched unrelated HSCTs reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation with a diagnosis of AML with normal cytogenetics and data on FLT3/ITD (present: n = 120, 58%; absent: n = 86, 42%). Transplantations were performed in first complete remission (CR) after myeloablative conditioning. RESULTS: Compared with FLT3/ITD-negative patients, FLT3/ITD-positive patients had higher median leukocyte count at diagnosis (59 v 21 x 10(9)/L; P < .001) and shorter interval from CR to transplantation (87 v 99 days; P = .04). Other characteristics were similar in the two groups. At 2 years, relapse incidence (RI; +/- standard deviation) was higher (30% +/- 5% v 16% +/- 5%; P = .006) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) lower (58% +/- 5% v 71% +/- 6%; P = .04) in FLT3/ITD-positive compared with FLT3/ITD-negative patients. In multivariate analyses, FLT3/ITD led to increased RI (hazard ratio [HR], 3.4; 95% CI, 1.46 to 7.94; P = .005), as did older age, female sex, shorter interval between CR and transplantation, and higher number of chemotherapy courses before achieving CR. FLT3/ITD positivity was associated with decreased LFS (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.73; P = .002), along with older age and higher number of chemotherapy courses before achieving CR. CONCLUSION: FLT3/ITD adversely affected the outcome of HSCT in the same direction it does after chemotherapy; despite this, more than half of the patients harboring this mutation who received transplants were alive and leukemia free at 2 years. To further improve the results, use of FLT3 inhibitors before or after HSCT deserves investigation.","['Brunet, Salut', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Cornelissen, Jan', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Iori, Anna P', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Brunet S', 'Labopin M', 'Esteve J', 'Cornelissen J', 'Socie G', 'Iori AP', 'Verdonck LF', 'Volin L', 'Gratwohl A', 'Sierra J', 'Mohty M', 'Rocha V']","['Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain. sbrunet@santpau.cat']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/06/09 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.36.9868 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.36.9868 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Mar 1;30(7):735-41. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.36.9868.

We sought to determine the contribution of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to racial disparities in ALL susceptibility and treatment outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the association between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL susceptibility in whites (> 95% European genetic ancestry; 978 cases and 1,046 controls) versus in Hispanics (> 10% Native American ancestry; 330 cases and 541 controls). We determined the relationships between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL relapse risk in 1,605 children treated on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) P9904/9905 clinical trials. RESULTS: Among 49 ARID5B SNPs interrogated, 10 were significantly associated with ALL susceptibility in both whites and Hispanics (P < .05), with risk alleles consistently more frequent in Hispanics than in whites. rs10821936 exhibited the most significant association in both races (P = 8.4 x 10(-20) in whites; P = 1 x 10(-6) in Hispanics), and genotype at this SNP was highly correlated with local Native American genetic ancestry (P = 1.8 x 10(-8)). Multivariate analyses in Hispanics identified an additional SNP associated with ALL susceptibility independent of rs10821936. Eight ARID5B SNPs were associated with both ALL susceptibility and relapse hazard; the alleles related to higher ALL incidence were always linked to poorer treatment outcome and were more frequent in Hispanics. CONCLUSION: ARID5B polymorphisms are important determinants of childhood ALL susceptibility and treatment outcome, and they contribute to racial disparities in this disease.","['Xu, Heng', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Neale, Geoff', 'Scheet, Paul', 'Burchard, Esteban G', 'Torgerson, Dara G', 'Eng, Celeste', 'Dean, Michael', 'Antillon, Frederico', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Martin, Paul L', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Camitta, Bruce M', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Carroll, William L', 'Loh, Mignon', 'Evans, William E', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Yang, Jun J']","['Xu H', 'Cheng C', 'Devidas M', 'Pei D', 'Fan Y', 'Yang W', 'Neale G', 'Scheet P', 'Burchard EG', 'Torgerson DG', 'Eng C', 'Dean M', 'Antillon F', 'Winick NJ', 'Martin PL', 'Willman CL', 'Camitta BM', 'Reaman GH', 'Carroll WL', 'Loh M', 'Evans WE', 'Pui CH', 'Hunger SP', 'Relling MV', 'Yang JJ']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/06/09 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.38.0345 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.38.0345 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Mar 1;30(7):751-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.38.0345.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred fifteen previously untreated adults were analyzed for DNMT3A mutations and established prognostic gene mutations and expression markers. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles were derived using microarrays. RESULTS: Younger (< 60 years; n = 181) and older (>/= 60 years; n = 234) patients had similar frequencies of DNMT3A mutations (35.3% v 33.3%). Missense mutations affecting arginine codon 882 (R882-DNMT3A) were more common (n = 92; 62%) than those affecting other codons (non-R882-DNMT3A). DNMT3A-mutated patients did not differ regarding complete remission rate, but had shorter disease-free survival (DFS; P = .03) and, by trend, overall survival (OS; P = .07) than DNMT3A-wild-type patients. In multivariable analyses, DNMT3A mutations remained associated with shorter DFS (P = .01), but not with shorter OS. When analyzed separately, the two DNMT3A mutation types had different significance by age group. Younger patients with non-R882-DNMT3A mutations had shorter DFS (P = .002) and OS (P = .02), whereas older patients with R882-DNMT3A mutations had shorter DFS (P = .005) and OS (P = .002) after adjustment for other clinical and molecular prognosticators. Gene- and microRNA-expression signatures did not accurately predict DNMT3A mutational status. CONCLUSION: DNMT3A mutations are frequent in CN-AML, and their clinical significance seems to be age dependent. DNMT3A-R882 mutations are associated with adverse prognosis in older patients, and non-R882-DNMT3A mutations are associated with adverse prognosis in younger patients. Low accuracy of gene- and microRNA-expression signatures in predicting DNMT3A mutation status suggested that the role of these mutations in AML remains to be elucidated.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Carter, Thomas H', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Marcucci G', 'Metzeler KH', 'Schwind S', 'Becker H', 'Maharry K', 'Mrozek K', 'Radmacher MD', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Nicolet D', 'Whitman SP', 'Wu YZ', 'Powell BL', 'Carter TH', 'Kolitz JE', 'Wetzler M', 'Carroll AJ', 'Baer MR', 'Moore JO', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. guido.marcucci@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/06/09 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.39.2092 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.39.2092 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Mar 1;30(7):742-50. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.39.2092.

The cumulative radiation exposure (RE) of patients undergoing TEVAR-including pre-operative workup, the procedure and subsequent follow-up computed tomography (CT) imaging-has not previously been investigated. METHODS: From August 2003 to February 2011, 48 patients underwent TEVAR at our institution. Mean age was 66 +/- 11 years, with 10 patients (21%) aged <60 years. Forty-one (85%) patients were male; 7 (15%) had urgent/emergent operation; 21 (44%) had undergone previous aortic surgery. Mean aortic diameter was 7.3 +/- 2.1 cm. Intra-operative screening time and RE were reviewed, and typical institutional thoracic CT scan RE was calculated (17.8 mSv). Life expectancy of an age- and sex-matched population was estimated to assess the cumulative RE from recurrent CT follow-up. RESULTS: The average screening time was 15.7 +/- 11.4 min, with an RE of 11.3 +/- 9 mSv. Obese patients had significantly higher RE during TEVAR (Pearson's coefficient = 0.388, P = 0.019). The RE dropped from 14.9 +/- 9.4 mSv to 8.6 +/- 7.9 mSv (P = 0.033) after a hybrid suite was established. Our institutional TEVAR protocol involves one pre-operative thoracoabdominal CT scan and three follow-up thoracic CT scans for the first year, with a yearly evaluation thereafter. The life expectancy of an age- and sex-matched population was 17 years. A patient adhering to our surveillance protocol would be subjected to an overall exposure of 89 mSv at 1 year and 161 mSv at 5 years, with a projected lifetime RE >350 mSv. CONCLUSIONS: A 2-year RE exceeding the threshold of 100 mSv with a life expectancy >15 years can be estimated to lead to a lifetime risk increase in radiation-induced leukaemia and solid-tumour cancer >2.7%. The risks of cumulative RE especially in younger and/or obese patients must be balanced with the expected morbidity and mortality reduction in TEVAR versus traditional open repair, and the anticipated benefits of recurrent radiographic imaging.","['Zoli, Stefano', 'Trabattoni, Piero', 'Dainese, Luca', 'Annoni, Andrea', 'Saccu, Claudio', 'Fumagalli, Miriam', 'Spirito, Rita', 'Biglioli, Paolo']","['Zoli S', 'Trabattoni P', 'Dainese L', 'Annoni A', 'Saccu C', 'Fumagalli M', 'Spirito R', 'Biglioli P']","['Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Centro Cardiologico Monzino IRCCS, Milan, Italy. stefano.zoli@ccfm.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,8804069,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ezr301 [pii]', '10.1093/ejcts/ezr301 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Aug;42(2):254-59; discussion 259-60. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezr301.

This phenomenon is mainly associated with mechanisms that include drug extrusion by P-glycoprotein (Pgp) overexpression and resistance to apoptosis derived by members of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as XIAP. Studies have proposed the use of compounds that are able to inhibit or modulate Pgp function, with no changes in the physiological expression of this protein. Based on that, the present study aimed to evaluate the reversal of MDR phenotype through modulation of Pgp efflux pump activity in leukemia multidrug-resistant cells, using a low dose of cyclosporine A (CsA). We showed that modulation of Pgp activity by using CsA did not induce cytotoxic effects in leukemia cells, independently of Pgp expression. However, during the modulation condition, we could observe that vincristine-induced apoptosis was significant in resistant cells, which was also coupled with decreasing expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP. In summary, our data suggest that CsA is able to reversing MDR phenotype in vitro, inducing sensibility in multidrug-resistant cells with no alterations in Pgp expression. These findings contribute to our knowledge for the circumvention of MDR in cancer cells and could be helpful for new treatment approaches.","['de Souza, Paloma Silva', 'da Cunha Vasconcelos, Flavia', 'Silva, Luis Felipe R', 'Maia, Raquel Ciuvalschi']","['de Souza PS', 'da Cunha Vasconcelos F', 'Silva LF', 'Maia RC']","['Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Programa de Pesquisa em Hemato-Oncologia Molecular, Coordenacao Geral Tecnico-Cientifica, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Praca da Cruz Vermelha 23, 6 masculine andar, Centro, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro CEP 20230-130, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/10/20 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-012-0323-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2012 Aug;33(4):943-56. doi: 10.1007/s13277-012-0323-5.

Salvage treatments were: supportive care (13%), cytoreductive therapy (43%), donor lymphocyte infusion without or with prior chemotherapy (23%) and second HCT (20%). Median time from HCT to relapse was 6.9 months, median follow-up was 46 months and median survival after relapse was 5.5 months. Estimated 1-, 2- and 5-year post-relapse survival was 30 +/- 2%, 16 +/- 2% and 8 +/- 1%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, adverse factors for survival were: late CR (CR2/3) at transplant (P<0.012), early relapse after transplant (<6.9 months, P <0.0001) and peripheral blast percent at relapse (P <0.0001). On the basis of multivariate model for survival, three groups of patients were identified with estimated 2 year survival of 6 +/- 2, 17 +/- 3 and 30 +/- 7%. Outcome of ALL patients relapsing after HCT is dismal and there is a need for new therapies.

Kinase mutations of BCR-ABL and cytokine-mediated modulation of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are key mechanisms governing clinical response to imatinib and second generation TKIs. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate is effective in imatinib-resistant CML with reported stem cell activity. We specifically thought to explore omacetaxine in the context of the pan-resistant mutant T315I, and in its potential to modify cytokine-dependent resistance. Omacetaxine was investigated in cell lines and primary CD34+ enriched progenitor cells from patients with CML. Addition of cytokines, shown to revert the efficacy of TKIs in BCR-ABL-positive cells, does not affect omacetaxine mediated antiproliferative activity, neither in cell lines nor in primary CML CD34+ progenitor cells. Looking at potential mechanisms, we found marked downregulation of the common beta-subunit c of the cytokine-receptors (cCRbetac) for IL3, IL5 and GM-CSF by omacetaxine in cell lines and primary progenitor cultures. The observed cytokine-independent in-vitro cytotoxicity of omacetaxine may be explained by downregulation of cCRbetac. Whether this can be used clinically as a means to optimize the stem cell activity of TKIs merits further evaluation.","['Klag, T', 'Hartel, N', 'Erben, P', 'Schwaab, J', 'Schnetzke, U', 'Schenk, T', 'Hochhaus, A', 'La Rosee, P']","['Klag T', 'Hartel N', 'Erben P', 'Schwaab J', 'Schnetzke U', 'Schenk T', 'Hochhaus A', 'La Rosee P']","['Abteilung Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011380 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.380 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1321-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.380.

In order to address the issue of the propensity of those patients to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), data on 381 untreated patients with MDS and del(5q) characterized by low or intermediate I International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk score were collected from nine centers and registries. Median survival of the entire group was 74 months. Transfusion-dependent patients had a median survival of 44 months vs 97 months for transfusion-independent patients (P<0.0001). Transfusion need at diagnosis was the most important patient characteristic for survival. Of the 381 patients, 48 (12.6%) progressed to AML. The cumulative progression rate calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method was 4.9% at 2 years and 17.6% at 5 years. Factors associated with the risk of AML transformation were high-risk World Health Organization adapted Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) score, marrow blast count >5% and red-cell transfusion dependency at diagnosis. In conclusion, patients with MDS and del(5q) are facing a considerable risk of AML transformation.

We hypothesized that AML cells are addicted to molecular pathways in the context of chemotherapy and used complementary approaches to identify these addictions. Using novel molecular and computational approaches, we performed genome-wide short-hairpin RNA screens to identify proteins that mediate AML cell fate after cytarabine exposure; gene expression profiling of AML cells exposed to cytarabine to identify genes with induced expression in this context; and examination of existing gene expression data from primary patient samples. Integration of these independent analyses strongly implicates cell-cycle checkpoint proteins, particularly WEE1, as critical mediators of AML cell survival after cytarabine exposure. Knockdown of WEE1 in a secondary screen confirmed its role in AML cell survival. Pharmacologic inhibition of WEE1 in AML cell lines and primary cells is synergistic with cytarabine. Further experiments demonstrate that inhibition of WEE1 prevents S-phase arrest induced by cytarabine, broadening the functions of WEE1 that may be exploited therapeutically. These data highlight the power of integrating functional and descriptive genomics, and identify WEE1 as a potential therapeutic target in AML.","['Porter, C C', 'Kim, J', 'Fosmire, S', 'Gearheart, C M', 'van Linden, A', 'Baturin, D', 'Zaberezhnyy, V', 'Patel, P R', 'Gao, D', 'Tan, A C', 'DeGregori, J']","['Porter CC', 'Kim J', 'Fosmire S', 'Gearheart CM', 'van Linden A', 'Baturin D', 'Zaberezhnyy V', 'Patel PR', 'Gao D', 'Tan AC', 'DeGregori J']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA. chris.porter@ucdenver.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011392 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.392 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1266-76. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.392.

In this study, diagnostic samples from 123 adults younger than 60 years with primary CN-AML homogeneously treated in the Acute Leukemia French Association-9801 and -9802 trials were screened for mutations in DNMT3A-conserved domains by direct sequencing. Patients were also assessed for the presence of FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3), NPM1 (nucleophosmin), CEBPA, WT1 (Wilms tumor 1), IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) and IDH2 mutations. Thirty-eight mutations were detected in 36 patients (29%): 36 nucleotide substitutions, mostly affecting amino-acid residue R882 and two frameshift deletions. DNMT3A mutations were significantly associated with the French-American-British subtypes M4/M5 and the presence of NPM1 mutations. In the whole cohort, DNMT3A mutated patients had a shorter event-free survival (5-year EFS: 13% vs 32%, P = 0.02) and overall survival (5-year OS: 23% vs 45%, P = 0.02) compared with DNMT3A wild-type patients. In multivariate analysis including age, white blood cell count, NPM1/FLT3-internal tandem duplication/CEBPA risk group and DNMT3A mutational status, the presence of a DNMT3A mutation remained an independent adverse prognostic factor for EFS and OS, suggesting that testing for DNMT3A mutations could help further improve risk stratification in CN-AML.","['Renneville, A', 'Boissel, N', 'Nibourel, O', 'Berthon, C', 'Helevaut, N', 'Gardin, C', 'Cayuela, J-M', 'Hayette, S', 'Reman, O', 'Contentin, N', 'Bordessoule, D', 'Pautas, C', 'Botton, S de', 'Revel, T de', 'Terre, C', 'Fenaux, P', 'Thomas, X', 'Castaigne, S', 'Dombret, H', 'Preudhomme, C']","['Renneville A', 'Boissel N', 'Nibourel O', 'Berthon C', 'Helevaut N', 'Gardin C', 'Cayuela JM', 'Hayette S', 'Reman O', 'Contentin N', 'Bordessoule D', 'Pautas C', 'Botton Sd', 'Revel Td', 'Terre C', 'Fenaux P', 'Thomas X', 'Castaigne S', 'Dombret H', 'Preudhomme C']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Biology and Pathology Center, CHRU of Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011382 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.382 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1247-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.382.

A prevailing task for this kinase rests on counteracting programmed cell death triggered by multiple stimuli. CK2 is overexpressed in many solid tumors and in vivo mouse models have proven its tumorigenic potential. Recent data have suggested that CK2 may also have a significant role in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic tumors, such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. CK2 regulates hematopoiesis-associated signaling pathways and seems to reinforce biochemical cascades indispensable for tumor growth, proliferation and resistance to conventional and novel cytotoxic agents. Although its activity is multifold, recent evidence supports the rationale of CK2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in solid and hematological tumors and phase-I clinical trials are in progress to test the efficacy of this innovative therapeutic approach.

ChIP-chip analysis of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced with the AML1-ETO fusion gene enabled us to identify 1168 AML1-ETO target genes, 103 of which were co-occupied by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and had lost the hyperacetylation mark at histone H4, and 264 showed a K9 trimethylation at histone H3. Enrichment of genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation and in specific signaling pathways was observed in the presence of these epigenetic modifications associated with an 'inactive' chromatin status. Furthermore, AML1-ETO target genes had a significant correlation between the chromatin marks studied and transcriptional silencing. Interestingly, AML1 binding sites were absent on a large number of selected AML1-ETO promoters and an Sp1 binding site was found in over 50% of them. Reversible silencing induced by the fusion protein in the presence of AML1 and/or Sp1 transcription factor binding site was confirmed. Therefore, this study provides a global analysis of AML1-ETO functional chromatin modifications and identifies the important role of Sp1 in the DNA binding pattern of AML1-ETO, suggesting a role for Sp1-targeted therapy in this leukemia subtype.","['Maiques-Diaz, A', 'Chou, F S', 'Wunderlich, M', 'Gomez-Lopez, G', 'Jacinto, F V', 'Rodriguez-Perales, S', 'Larrayoz, M J', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Mulloy, J C', 'Cigudosa, J C', 'Alvarez, S']","['Maiques-Diaz A', 'Chou FS', 'Wunderlich M', 'Gomez-Lopez G', 'Jacinto FV', 'Rodriguez-Perales S', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Mulloy JC', 'Cigudosa JC', 'Alvarez S']","['Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics programme, Centro Nacional Investigaciones Oncologicas, Centro de Investigaciones de Enfermedades Raras, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011376 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.376 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1329-37. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.376.

However, 30-40% of patients relapse and display a dismal outcome. Recently we described a frequent instability of type I/II mutations between diagnosis and relapse. Here, we explored the hypothesis that these mutational shifts originate from clonal selection during treatment/disease progression. Subfractions of blasts from initial diagnosis samples were cell sorted and their mutational profiles were compared with those of the corresponding relapse samples of 7 CD34(+) AML patients. At diagnosis, subfractions of the CD45(dim)CD34(+)CD38(dim/-) compartment were heterogeneous in the distribution of mutations, when compared to the whole CD45(dim)CD34(+) blast compartment in 6 out of 7 patients. Moreover, within CD45(dim)CD34(+)CD38(dim/-) fraction of initial samples of 5 of these 6 AML patients, we found evidence for the presence of a minor, initially undetected subpopulation with a specific mutational profile that dominated the bulk of leukemic blasts at relapse. In conclusion, our findings lend support to the AML oligoclonality concept and provide molecular evidence for selection and expansion of a chemo-resistant subpopulation towards development of relapse. These results imply that early detection of pre-existing drug-resistant leukemic subpopulations is crucial for relapse prevention by proper timing of targeted treatment.","['Bachas, C', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'Assaraf, Y G', 'Kwidama, Z J', 'Kelder, A', 'Wouters, F', 'Snel, A N', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'Cloos, J']","['Bachas C', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Assaraf YG', 'Kwidama ZJ', 'Kelder A', 'Wouters F', 'Snel AN', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011383 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.383 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1313-20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.383.

The first antibodies of this kind, currently evaluated in early clinical trials, are directed against lymphoma-associated antigens. Fc-engineered antibodies targeting myeloid leukemia are not yet available. We here report on the generation and preclinical characterization of an Fc-optimized antibody directed to the FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), an antigen expressed on the leukemic blasts of all investigated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This antibody, termed 4G8SDIEM, mediated markedly enhanced cellular cytotoxicity against FLT3-expressing cell lines as well as blasts of AML patients. FLT3 expression levels on AML cells varied between 300 and 4600 molecules/cell and, in most cases, were substantially higher than those detected on normal hematopoietic precursor cells and dendritic cells (approximately 300 molecules/cell). Antibody-mediated cytotoxicity against these normal cells was not detectable. 4G8SDIEM has been produced in pharmaceutical quality in a university-owned production unit and is currently used for the treatment of leukemia patients.","['Hofmann, M', 'Grosse-Hovest, L', 'Nubling, T', 'Pyz, E', 'Bamberg, M L', 'Aulwurm, S', 'Buhring, H-J', 'Schwartz, K', 'Haen, S P', 'Schilbach, K', 'Rammensee, H-G', 'Salih, H R', 'Jung, G']","['Hofmann M', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Nubling T', 'Pyz E', 'Bamberg ML', 'Aulwurm S', 'Buhring HJ', 'Schwartz K', 'Haen SP', 'Schilbach K', 'Rammensee HG', 'Salih HR', 'Jung G']","['Department of Immunology, Eberhard-Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011372 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.372 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1228-37. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.372.

In this study, we developed various antibodies as diagnostic tools to identify CADM1-positive ATLL leukemia cells. In flow cytometric analysis, the percentages of CD4(+)CADM1(+) double-positive cells correlated well with both the percentages of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells and with abnormal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with various types of ATLL. Moreover, the degree of CD4(+)CADM1(+) cells over 1% significantly correlated with the copy number of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) provirus in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients. We also identified a soluble form of CADM1 in the peripheral blood of ATLL patients, and the expression levels of this form were correlated with the levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor alpha. Moreover, lymphomas derived from ATLL were strongly and specifically stained with a CADM1 antibody. Thus, detection of CD4(+)CADM1(+) cells in the peripheral blood, measurement of serum levels of soluble CADM1 and immunohistochemical detection of CADM1 in lymphomas would be a useful set of markers for disease progression in ATLL and may aid in both the early diagnosis and measurement of treatment efficacy for ATLL.","['Nakahata, S', 'Saito, Y', 'Marutsuka, K', 'Hidaka, T', 'Maeda, K', 'Hatakeyama, K', 'Shiraga, T', 'Goto, A', 'Takamatsu, N', 'Asada, Y', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Okayama, A', 'Kubuki, Y', 'Shimoda, K', 'Ukai, Y', 'Kurosawa, G', 'Morishita, K']","['Nakahata S', 'Saito Y', 'Marutsuka K', 'Hidaka T', 'Maeda K', 'Hatakeyama K', 'Shiraga T', 'Goto A', 'Takamatsu N', 'Asada Y', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Okayama A', 'Kubuki Y', 'Shimoda K', 'Ukai Y', 'Kurosawa G', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011379 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.379 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1238-46. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.379.

Osteocytes regulate bone remodelling at least partially, as a result of their cell death triggering OCL recruitment. In this study, we found that the number of viable osteocytes was significantly smaller in MM patients than in healthy controls, and negatively correlated with the number of OCLs. Moreover, the MM patients with bone lesions had a significantly smaller number of viable osteocytes than those without, partly because of increased apoptosis. These findings were further confirmed by ultrastructural in vitro analyses of human preosteocyte cells cocultured with MM cells, which showed that MM cells increased preosteocyte death and apoptosis. A micro-array analysis showed that MM cells affect the transcriptional profiles of preosteocytes by upregulating the production of osteoclastogenic cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-11, and increasing their pro-osteoclastogenic properties.

We generated five MAbs against the Ig (n = 1), cysteine-rich (CRD) (n = 2) and kringle (KNG) (n = 2) domains, respectively, of the extracellular part of ROR1. All CLL patients (n = 20) expressed ROR1 on the surface of the leukemic cells. A significantly higher frequency of ROR1 expression was found in patients with progressive versus non-progressive disease, and in those with unmutated versus mutated IgVH genes. All five MAbs alone induced apoptosis in the absence of complement or added effector cells (Annexin-V and MTT, as well as cleavage of poly-(ADP ribose)-polymerase, caspase-8 and caspase-9) of CLL cells but not of normal B cells. Most effective were MAbs against CRD and KNG, significantly superior to rituximab (P < 0.005). Cross-linking of anti-ROR1 MAbs using the F(ab')(2) fragments of anti-Fc antibodies significantly augmented apoptosis. Two of the MAbs induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) similar to that of rituximab and one anti-ROR1 MAb (KNG) (IgG1) showed killing activity by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

Their associated expression marks a disease subset with a highly aggressive clinical course. Here, we demonstrate a constitutive physical association between the CD49d/CD29 integrin complex and CD38 in primary CLL cells and B-cell lines by (i) cocapping, (ii) coimmunoprecipitation and (iii) cell adhesion experiments using CD49d-specific substrates (vascular-cell adhesion molecule-1 or CS-1/H89 fibronectin fragments). The role of CD38 in CD49d-mediated cell adhesion was studied in CD49d(+)CD38(+) and CD49d(+)CD38(-) primary CLL cells, and confirmed using CD38 transfectants of the originally CD49d(+)CD38(-) CLL-derived cell line Mec-1. Results indicate that CD49d(+)CD38(+) cells adhered more efficiently onto CD49d-specific substrates than CD49d(+)CD38(-) cells (P < 0.001). Upon adhesion, CD49d(+)CD38(+) cells underwent distinctive changes in cell shape and morphology, with higher levels of phosphorylated Vav-1 than CD49d(+)CD38(-) cells (P = 0.0006) and a more complex distribution of F-actin to the adhesion sites. Lastly, adherent CD49d(+)CD38(+) cells were more resistant to serum-deprivation-induced (P < 0.001) and spontaneous (P = 0.03) apoptosis than the CD49d(+)CD38(-) counterpart. Altogether, our results point to a direct role for CD38 in enhancing CD49d-mediated adhesion processes in CLL, thus providing an explanation for the negative clinical impact exerted by these molecules when coexpressed in neoplastic cells.","['Zucchetto, A', 'Vaisitti, T', 'Benedetti, D', 'Tissino, E', 'Bertagnolo, V', 'Rossi, D', 'Bomben, R', 'Dal Bo, M', 'Del Principe, M I', 'Gorgone, A', 'Pozzato, G', 'Gaidano, G', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Malavasi, F', 'Deaglio, S', 'Gattei, V']","['Zucchetto A', 'Vaisitti T', 'Benedetti D', 'Tissino E', 'Bertagnolo V', 'Rossi D', 'Bomben R', 'Dal Bo M', 'Del Principe MI', 'Gorgone A', 'Pozzato G', 'Gaidano G', 'Del Poeta G', 'Malavasi F', 'Deaglio S', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011369 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.369 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1301-12. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.369.

The overexpression of Hsp72, in particular, results in increased incidence of cell transformation, and correlates with poor prognosis in a wide range of cancers. We have shown that Hsp72 assists folding of oncogenic NPM-ALK kinase in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs), but its role in the maintenance of the malignant phenotype remains uncertain. Therefore, we assessed Hsp72 expression in ALCLs, investigating more in detail the mechanisms that regulate its status and activity. We found that Hsp72 is unique among the HSPs involved in tumourigenesis to be overexpressed in ALK(+) tumours and cell lines and to be induced by stress. Different from other HSPs, Hsp72 prevents cell injury, Bax activation and death by apoptosis in ALK(+) cells, acting both upstream and downstream of mitochondria. Conversely, Hsp72 is underexpressed in ALK(-) ALCL cells, and it is unable to protect cells from apoptosis under stress. Moreover, when Hsp72 expression is reduced following NPM-ALK inhibition, lymphoma cells undergo apoptosis, demonstrating the importance of Hsp72 in regulating ALCL stress response and drug sensitivity.","['Bonvini, P', 'Zorzi, E', 'Mussolin, L', 'Pillon, M', 'Romualdi, C', 'Peron, M', ""d'Amore, E S G"", 'Lamant, L', 'Rosolen, A']","['Bonvini P', 'Zorzi E', 'Mussolin L', 'Pillon M', 'Romualdi C', 'Peron M', ""d'Amore ES"", 'Lamant L', 'Rosolen A']","['Pediatric Onco-Hematology Clinic, University Hospital Padova, Padova, Italy. paolo.bonvini@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011367 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.367 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1375-82. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.367.

However, the effect of unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (UBMT) and UCBT on the outcome of patients with acute leukemia has not been systematically reviewed. In the present meta-analysis, we systematically searched Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CNKI up to May 2011. Two reviewers extracted data independently. Seven studies totaling 3389 patients have been assessed. Pooled results found that the incidence of engraftment failure and transplantation-related mortality were higher in UCBT than in UBMT, and relative risks (RRs) were 4.27 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.94-6.21) and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.01-1.59), respectively. The rates of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the UCBT group were significantly lower than that in the UBMT group, and RRs were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.65-0.79) and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.52-0.91), respectively. The relapse rate was similar between the UCBT and UBMT group. The leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly lower in the UCBT group than in the UBMT group; RRs were 1.14 (95% CI, 1.07-1.22) and hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.31 (95% CI, 1.16-1.48), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the survival was similar between UCBT and UBMT.","['Zhang, Haoran', 'Chen, Junmin', 'Que, Wenzhong']","['Zhang H', 'Chen J', 'Que W']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 20 Chazhong Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,2012/02/01 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(12)00054-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.01.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Aug;18(8):1164-73. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.01.015.

METHODS: The clinical data of 55 children with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and 51 children with chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received IST from January 2007 to December 2010. RESULTS: In children with CAA, the effective rate of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) plus cyclosporine A(CsA) combination therapy was significantly higher than that of CsA alone (80% vs 44%; P<0.05); in children with SAA, the effective rate of ATG plus CsA combination therapy was also significantly higher than that of CsA alone (75% vs 40%; P<0.05). No patients developed clonal disease such as myelodysplastic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturn hemoglobinuria or acute myelocytic leukemia. In patients treated with the ATG plus CsA combination therapy, the response rate was relatively high for children whose disease course was less than six months, bone marrow hematopoietic area was more than 40%, had no severe infections, and experienced granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) reaction during the early treatment; however, it was not related to AA subtypes and age. CONCLUSIONS: ATG plus CsA combination therapy is effective and safe in the treatment of childhood AA. The disease course, bone marrow hematopoietic area, severe infections and G-CSF reaction to early treatment are the main factors influencing the therapeutic effects.","['Wang, Ying-Chao', 'Yin, Chu-Yun', 'Feng, Lei', 'Wang, Chun-Mei', 'Ma, Li-Na', 'Wei, Yong-Wei', 'Sheng, Guang-Yao']","['Wang YC', 'Yin CY', 'Feng L', 'Wang CM', 'Ma LN', 'Wei YW', 'Sheng GY']","['Department of Pediatrics, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China. yingchaowang152@163.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2012)01-0033-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2012 Jan;14(1):33-7.,,,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*drug therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoter CpG methylation is correlated with silencing of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) in specific pathways that are also targets of mutation or other mechanisms of inactivation, and is thought to contribute to disease progression and poor prognosis. Epigenetic contributions to myeloid pathogenesis are more complex. Examples include TSG inactivation and oncogenic activation associated with formation of altered chromatin separate from CpG methylation. Epigenetic dysregulation occurs at multiple disease stages and at non-CpG island genomic sites, and also includes genomic hypomethylation and small RNA mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. Identification of recurrent mutations in potential epigenetic regulators, including TET2, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, UTX, and ASXL1, were recently described. Accordingly, therapeutics directed towards epigenetic mechanisms including methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have had some clinical success when applied to MDS and AML. However, identification of the underlying mechanisms associated with clinical responses and drug resistance remain enigmatic. Remarkably, in spite of significant molecular and translational progress, there are currently no epigenetic biomarkers in widespread clinical use. In this review, we explore the potential applications of epigenetic biomarker discovery, including epigenetic profiling for myeloid malignancy pathogenesis understanding, diagnostic classification, and development of effective treatment paradigms for these generally considered poor prognosis disorders.","['McDevitt, Michael A']",['McDevitt MA'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA. mmcdevi1@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(11)00292-2 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2012 Feb;39(1):109-22. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.11.003.,['Copyright (c) 2012.

One fundamental reason for treatment failure is that it is designed to activate apoptosis genes (eg, TP53) that may be unavailable because of mutation or deletion. Unlike deletion of apoptosis genes, genes that mediate cell cycle exit by differentiation are present in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML cells but are epigenetically repressed: MDS/AML cells express high levels of key lineage-specifying transcription factors. Mutations in these transcription factors (eg, CEBPA) or their cofactors (eg., RUNX1) affect transactivation function and produce epigenetic repression of late-differentiation genes that antagonize MYC. Importantly, this aberrant epigenetic repression can be redressed clinically by depleting DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1, a central component of the epigenetic network that mediates transcription repression) using the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine at non-cytotoxic concentrations. The DNMT1 depletion is sufficient to trigger upregulation of late-differentiation genes and irreversible cell cycle exit by p53-independent differentiation mechanisms. Fortuitously, the same treatment maintains or increases self-renewal of normal hematopoietic stem cells, which do not express high levels of lineage-specifying transcription factors. The biological rationale for this approach to therapy appears to apply to cancers other than MDS/AML also. Decitabine or 5-azacytidine dose and schedule can be rationalized to emphasize this mechanism of action, as an alternative or complement to conventional apoptosis-based oncotherapy.","['Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Triozzi, Pierre', 'Rini, Brian', 'Singh, Arun', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Sekeres, Mikkael', 'Advani, Anjali', 'Tiu, Ramon', 'Reu, Frederic', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Copelan, Ed', 'Hsi, Eric', 'Lichtin, Alan', 'Bolwell, Brian']","['Saunthararajah Y', 'Triozzi P', 'Rini B', 'Singh A', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Sekeres M', 'Advani A', 'Tiu R', 'Reu F', 'Kalaycio M', 'Copelan E', 'Hsi E', 'Lichtin A', 'Bolwell B']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. saunthy@ccf.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(11)00300-9 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.11.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2012 Feb;39(1):97-108. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.11.011.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, a minority of CML patients in chronic phase (CP) and a substantial proportion of patients in advanced phase are either initially refractory to TKIs or eventually develop resistance. Rates of resistance and relapse directly correlate with disease progression. The most frequently identified mechanism of acquired TKI resistance is BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) mutations that impair TKI binding by disrupting the drug contact sites or causing conformational changes that make the contact sites inaccessible. The underlying mechanisms of disease progression are heterogeneous and only poorly understood. So far the most frequent and best characterized include genomic instability, loss of tumor-suppressor functions, and differentiation arrest. Clinical data indicate that both development of a BCR-ABL1 KD mutation during TKI treatment and/or disease progression are associated with a poorer outcome. Thus, therapeutic strategies are needed for the treatment or prevention of resistance and disease progression. They include, for example, TKI dose escalation, treatment interruption to stop selection of resistant cells, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation in eligible patients, as well as the use of novel TKIs with activity against resistant mutations and/or inhibition of alternative pathways.","['Ernst, Thomas', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Ernst T', 'Hochhaus A']","['Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(11)00291-0 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2012 Feb;39(1):58-66. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.11.002.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Although many facets of this assay need to be taken into account, eg, the preparation of sequencing libraries with molecular barcodes, specific experimental design options when considering sequencing coverage to calculate diagnostic sensitivity, or the use of suitable software and data processing solutions to obtain accurate results, amplicon deep-sequencing has already demonstrated a promising technical performance that warrants the further development towards a routine application of this technology in diagnostic laboratories so that an impact on clinical practice can be achieved.","['Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Grossmann, Vera', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Kohlmann A', 'Grossmann V', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. alexander.kohlmann@mll.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(11)00297-1 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.11.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2012 Feb;39(1):26-36. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.11.008.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this gene expression profiling study was to evaluate to what extent suboptimal samples with low leukemic blast load (range, 2-59%) and/or poor quality control criteria could also be correctly identified. METHODS: Specific signatures were first defined so that all 71 acute promyelocytic leukemia, leukemia with t(8;21) or inv(16)-AML as well as cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia samples with at least 60% blasts and good quality control criteria were correctly classified (training set). The classifiers were then evaluated for their ability to assign to the expected class 111 samples considered as suboptimal because of a low leukemic blast load (n = 101) and/or poor quality control criteria (n = 10) (test set). RESULTS: With 10-marker classifiers, all training set samples as well as 97 of the 101 test samples with a low blast load, and all 10 samples with poor quality control criteria were correctly classified. Regarding test set samples, the overall error rate of the class prediction was below 4 percent, even though the leukemic blast load was as low as 2%. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of the class assignments ranged from 91% to 100%. Of note, for acute promyelocytic leukemia and leukemias with t(8;21) or inv(16), the confidence level of the class assignment was influenced by the leukemic blast load. CONCLUSION: Gene expression profiling and a supervised method requiring 10-marker classifiers enable the identification of favorable cytogenetic risk acute myeloid leukemia even when samples contain low leukemic blast loads or display poor quality control criterion.","['de la Bletiere, Diane Raingeard', 'Blanchet, Odile', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Coutolleau, Anne', 'Baranger, Laurence', 'Genevieve, Franck', 'Luquet, Isabelle', 'Hunault-Berger, Mathilde', 'Beucher, Annaelle', 'Schmidt-Tanguy, Aline', 'Zandecki, Marc', 'Delneste, Yves', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Guardiola, Philippe']","['de la Bletiere DR', 'Blanchet O', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Coutolleau A', 'Baranger L', 'Genevieve F', 'Luquet I', 'Hunault-Berger M', 'Beucher A', 'Schmidt-Tanguy A', 'Zandecki M', 'Delneste Y', 'Ifrah N', 'Guardiola P']","['Plateforme SNP, Transcriptome & Epigenomique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Angers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-5-6 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-5-6 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2012 Jan 30;5:6. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-5-6.,,20120130,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods/standards', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods/standards', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/standards', 'Quality Control', 'Young Adult']",,,,PMC3284426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to test in a large retrospective cohort of CLL patients the prognostic power of biological and clinical-demographic variable in a comprehensive multivariate model. A new prognostic index was proposed. METHODS: Overall survival and time to treatment in 620 untreated CLL patients were analyzed retrospectively to evaluate the multivariate independence and predictive power of mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene segments (IGHV), high-risk chromosomal aberration such as 17p or 11q deletions, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, age, gender, Binet stage, beta2-microglobulin levels, absolute lymphocyte count and number of lymph node regions. RESULTS: IGHV mutational status and 17p deletion were the sole biological variables with independent prognostic relevance in a multivariate model for overall survival, which included easily measurable clinical parameters (Binet staging, beta2-microglobulin levels) and demographics (age and gender). Analysis of time to treatment in Binet A patients below 70 years of age showed that IGHV was the most important predictor. A novel 6-variable clinical-biological prognostic index was developed and internally validated, which assigned 3 points for Binet C stage, 2 points/each for Binet B stage and for age > 65 years, 1 point/each for male gender, high beta2-microglobulin levels, presence of an unmutated IGHV gene status or 17p deletion. Patients were classified at low-risk (score = 0-1; 21%), intermediate-risk (score 2-5; 63% of cases), high-risk (score 6-9; 16% of cases). Projected 5-year overall survival was 98%, 90% and 58% in low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively. A nomogram for individual patient survival estimation was also proposed. CONCLUSIONS: Data indicate that IGHV mutational status and 17p deletion may be integrated with clinical-demographic variables in new prognostic tools to estimate overall survival.","['Bulian, Pietro', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Zucca, Emanuele', 'Montillo, Marco', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Laurenti, Luca']","['Bulian P', 'Rossi D', 'Forconi F', 'Del Poeta G', 'Bertoni F', 'Zucca E', 'Montillo M', 'Pozzato G', ""D'Arena G"", 'Efremov DG', 'Marasca R', 'Lauria F', 'Gaidano G', 'Gattei V', 'Laurenti L']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, IRCCS Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, via Franco Gallini 2, 33170 Aviano (PN), Italy. pbulian@cro.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/05/19 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-10-18 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-10-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2012 Jan 30;10:18. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-10-18.,,20120130,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nomograms', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,,PMC3297493,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When used individually, all gold-bearing compounds display cytostatic effects against leukemia and adherent cancer cell lines. However, two gold-bearing indoles show unique behavior by increasing the cytotoxic effects of clinically relevant levels of ionizing radiation. Quantifying the amount of DNA damage demonstrates that each gold-indole enhances apoptosis by inhibiting DNA repair. Both Au(I)-indoles were tested for inhibitory effects against various cellular targets including thioredoxin reductase, a known target of several gold compounds, and various ATP-dependent kinases. While neither compound significantly inhibits the activity of thioreoxin reductase, both showed inhibitory effects against several kinases associated with cancer initiation and progression. The inhibition of these kinases provides a possible mechanism for the ability of these Au(I)-indoles to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation. Clinical applications of combining Au(I)-indoles with ionizing radiation are discussed as a new strategy to achieve chemosensitization of cancer cells.","['Craig, Sandra', 'Gao, Lei', 'Lee, Irene', 'Gray, Thomas', 'Berdis, Anthony J']","['Craig S', 'Gao L', 'Lee I', 'Gray T', 'Berdis AJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm2005942 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2012 Mar 8;55(5):2437-51. doi: 10.1021/jm2005942.

However, the distinction between diploid and tetraploid cells in development has not been well explained. To examine pluripotency of polyploid ES cells, a polyploid embryonic stem (ES)-cell system was prepared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diploid, tetraploid, pentaploid, hexaploid, octaploid and decaploid H1 (ES) cells (2H1, 4H1, 5H1, 6H1, 8H1 and 10H1 cells, respectively) were cultured for about 460 days in L15F10 medium without leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The cells cultured under LIF-free conditions were denoted as 2H1(-), 4H1(-), 5H1(-), 6H1(-), 8H1(-) and 10H1(-) cells, respectively. Pluripotency and gene expression were examined. RESULTS: Ploidy alteration of H1(-) cells was similar to that of H1 cells. The polyploid H1(-) cells showed positive activity of alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that they maintained pluripotency in vitro without LIF. The polyploid H1(-) cells formed teratocarcinomas in mouse abdomen, suggesting they could differentiate in mouse abdomen in vivo. 2H1, 4H1 and polyploid H1(-) cells expressed nanog, oct3/4 and sox2 genes, suggesting that they fulfilled the criteria of ES cells. Nanog gene was significantly over-expressed in 4H1 and polyploid H1(-) cells, suggesting that overexpression of nanog gene was a characteristic of polyploid H1 cells. CONCLUSION: Polyploid H1 (ES) cells retained pluripotency in vitro, without LIF with nanog over-expression.","['Fujikawa-Yamamoto, K', 'Ota, T', 'Miyagoshi, M', 'Yamagishi, H']","['Fujikawa-Yamamoto K', 'Ota T', 'Miyagoshi M', 'Yamagishi H']","['Divisions of Cell MedicineTumor Biology, Research Institute of Medical Science, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00805.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2012 Apr;45(2):140-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2011.00805.x.

IREM-1 exerts its inhibitory effect through its intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). In order to generate immunomodulatory molecules that can regulate the inflammatory activation of macrophages, decapeptides representing each of the five ITIM-like sequences in the cytoplasmic tail of IREM-1 were synthesized in conjugation with human immunodeficiency virus-transactivator of transcription (HIV-TAT(48-57)), which was added to promote internalization of the peptides. Interestingly, all these TAT-ITIM fusion peptides inhibited Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated production of proinflammatory molecules, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin (IL)-8. When various TLR ligands were used to stimulate the human macrophage-like cell line human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP)-1, the TAT-ITIM peptides blocked both myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF)-mediated TLR signalling pathways. Utilization of specific inhibitors and detection of the active form of signalling adaptors by Western blot analysis further demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of these TAT-ITIM peptides require activation of Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP) and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). These data indicate that these synthetic peptides may be used to regulate immune responses that involve TLR-mediated inflammatory activation of macrophages.","['Lee, S-M', 'Suk, K', 'Lee, W-H']","['Lee SM', 'Suk K', 'Lee WH']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2012/02/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.2011.04528.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2012 Mar;167(3):438-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2011.04528.x.,"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Preclinical data showed improved complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity compared with rituximab. Clinical studies have shown single-agent activity for ofatumumab in CLL and in other low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six newly diagnosed patients with AML underwent remission induction therapy consisted of behenoyl Ara-C, mitoxantrone, etoposide, and 6-mercaptopurine. Post-remission therapy included four courses of consolidation and four courses of intensification. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) were randomly assigned to mIDAC or HDAC for the second course of consolidation. The third course of intensification was the same as the second course of consolidation. Other post-remission therapies were the same in each group. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (84.6%) achieved CR and 21 patients were randomly assigned to receive either mIDAC (n=11) or HDAC (n=10). The predicted 4-year relapse-free survival for the mIDAC group and for the HDAC group were 49% and 56%, respectively (p=0.86). Although HDAC developed severe leukocytopenia compared to mIDAC, there were no significant differences between HDAC and mIDAC in the incidence of >/=grade 3 and >/=grade 4 documented infections. The mean lowest white blood cell count (WBC) after HDAC was significantly lower than that after mIDAC (0.208+/-0.120x10(3)/mm(3) and 0.459+/-0.333x10(3)/mm(3), respectively, p<0.05). The time to WBC recovery to 2.0x10(3)/mm(3) after HDAC was significantly longer than that after mIDAC (34.3+/-12.1 days and 27.1+/-9.5 days, respectively, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that mIDAC may have an equivalent post-remission antileukemic efficacy to HDAC with less myelosuppression for AML patients.","['Fukushima, Toshihiro', 'Urasaki, Yoshimasa', 'Yamaguchi, Masaki', 'Ueda, Mikio', 'Morinaga, Koji', 'Haba, Toshihiro', 'Sugiyama, Toshiro', 'Nakao, Shinji', 'Origasa, Hideki', 'Umehara, Hisanori', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Fukushima T', 'Urasaki Y', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Ueda M', 'Morinaga K', 'Haba T', 'Sugiyama T', 'Nakao S', 'Origasa H', 'Umehara H', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Immunology, Kanazawa Medical University, 1-1 Daigaku, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan. tfukus@kanazawa-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['32/2/643 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Feb;32(2):643-7.,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9YVR68W306 (enocitabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ex vivo drug resistance in 107 children, divided into study and validation groups, was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) drug resistance assay. The gene expression profile was identified by microarray analysis and validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A set of five genes involved in signal transduction, present in each resistance profile, was identified. The expression of four genes was up-regulated: Gardner-Rasheed feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, v-Fgr (FGR), S100 calcium binding protein A11 (S100A11), formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), ArfGAP with RhoGAP domain, ankyrin repeat and PH1 domain (ARAP1), while the expression of growth hormone 1 (GH1) was found to be down-regulated in resistant leukemia blasts. CONCLUSION: Ex vivo exposure of leukemia cells to anticancer drugs induces changes in the expression of genes involved in cell signaling pathways. These genes play an important role in the mechanism of cellular drug resistance.","['Szczepanek, Joanna', 'Pogorzala, Monika', 'Jarzab, Michal', 'Oczko-Wojciechowska, Malgorzata', 'Kowalska, Malgorzata', 'Tretyn, Andrzej', 'Wysocki, Mariusz', 'Jarzab, Barbara', 'Styczynski, Jan']","['Szczepanek J', 'Pogorzala M', 'Jarzab M', 'Oczko-Wojciechowska M', 'Kowalska M', 'Tretyn A', 'Wysocki M', 'Jarzab B', 'Styczynski J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, ul.

A critical review of the literature.,241-9,10.1002/pon.3026 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Haematological cancers differ from other cancers mainly with regard to treatment strategies: surgery is used for diagnostic purposes but rarely for treatment, whereas chemotherapy is of central importance and, in some cases, cures patients. This article reviews studies that examine the relationships between psychosocial factors and quality of life (QoL) in haematological cancer patients. METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted from the databases 'PsycInfo', 'Medline' and 'Science Direct' using the keywords 'lymphoma', 'leukaemia', 'myeloma', 'quality of life', 'psychosocial factors', 'coping', 'social support', 'personality', 'anxiety,' 'depression', 'locus of control' and 'alexithymia'. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were analysed. One study found positive relationships between sense of coherence and health-related QoL, whereas another showed a positive link between self-esteem and QoL. Another study suggested that a high external health locus of control was related to a better QoL. Fighting spirit had a positive impact on QoL for two studies, and helplessness-hopelessness was positively related to emotional distress in one study. Two studies indicated the relationships between emotional distress and QoL. Satisfaction with information about disease determined emotional distress in another study. Social support, general health perceptions, global meaning or spirituality were found to improve QoL in four other reports. CONCLUSION: Literature about the relationships between psychosocial factors and QoL is lacking. Sense of coherence, self-esteem and health locus of control, coping strategies, social support, global meaning or emotional distress are associated with QoL. Results concerning coping and social support should be interpreted with caution because of level II evidence in studies.","['Allart, Priscilla', 'Soubeyran, Pierre', 'Cousson-Gelie, Florence']","['Allart P', 'Soubeyran P', 'Cousson-Gelie F']","['Laboratory of Psychology Health and Quality of Life, University Bordeaux Segalen, Bordeaux, France. priscilla.allart@u-bordeaux2.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,2012/01/31 06:00,2013/08/01 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3026 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2013 Feb;22(2):241-9. doi: 10.1002/pon.3026.

Yet, its use has continued over 40 years in the absence of data. Consensus protocols exist only for testis and meningeal tumors, relying on local therapy. To constitute a body of knowledge about tumors at one site, the breast was chosen and all published cases were analyzed, with follow-up obtained, to document the behavior of acute leukemia tumors and survival after presentation. Among 235 cases (52% published since 2000), overall survival was poor, particularly for the 43% with concurrent morphologic marrow relapse, with 66-73% one-year mortality. Only 4 of 106 patients treated with chemotherapy alone survived 4 years. The majority of AML and ALL tumors were only transiently responsive to anti-leukemia treatments, including transplant, and next relapses were as, or more, common in further tumors than in marrow. A pattern of tumors similar to the metastases of invasive lobular breast cancer was revealed. When relapse occurred in marrow, durable remission was only rarely obtained. These data suggest a potential benefit of incorporating extent of disease workup at diagnosis and relapse into prospective trials. This could yield an accurate incidence of extramedullary tumors and a means to identify occult residual disease which could lead to marrow relapse. This approach could potentially result in greater success in curing acute leukemias.","['Cunningham, Isabel']",['Cunningham I'],"['Division of Hematology Oncology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, USA. isaheme@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.22256 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Mar;87(3):251-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.22256.

The prevalence of behavioral problems was assessed in a longitudinal study in pediatric patients with an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Multilevel modeling was used to identify associated predictive factors. PROCEDURE: ALL patients and their parents (n = 138) took part to this study. Patients were treated according to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) consortium protocols 91-01 or 95-01. Mothers filled out questionnaires providing a measure of behavioral problems for their child at diagnosis and during the subsequent 4 years, and of their perceived familial stress at diagnosis and post-induction. RESULTS: Prevalence of internalized behavioral problems at diagnosis was increased [42% above 1 standard deviation (SD); P < 0.001], but it normalized over time. Internalized problems resolved more slowly in the presence of medical variables associated with increased stress related to the disease (hospitalization duration, P < 0.001; relapse risk at diagnosis, P < 0.001). Externalized behavioral problems were within the expected normal range, but more sustained over time with the 95-01 than with the 91-01 treatment protocols (P < 0.05), likely due to the type of corticosteroid (CS) used (dexamethasone vs. prednisone). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of both internalized and externalized problems is required in this population. The impact of pharmacological variables on externalized behavioral problems is likely related to CS use.","['Marcoux, Sophie', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Laverdiere, Caroline']","['Marcoux S', 'Robaey P', 'Krajinovic M', 'Moghrabi A', 'Laverdiere C']","['Department of Psychiatry, Sainte-Justine Hospital Research Center, Montreal University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24079 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jun;58(6):971-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24079.

PURPOSE: To determine its prevalence and radiological appearances in a patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All forms of lymphoproliferative disease (ICD: C81-C96) were considered. From January 2005 to January 2010, 668 consecutive patients with lymphoproliferative disease were identified with the help of the radiological database and patient records. Inclusion criteria were complete staging including appropriate CT scan and/or MRI. All stored images (initial staging and follow-up examinations) were reviewed. RESULTS: Review of all stored images revealed renal infiltration in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (11 of 364 = 3.0%; median age = 65 years, m:f = 6:5) but also multiple myeloma (2 of 162 = 1.2%; median age = 72 years; m:f = 1:1) and leukemia (5 of 101 = 4.9%; median age = 12 years; m:f = 2:3). There were no cases of renal infiltration in 41 patients with Hodgkin's disease. In total there were six patients with solitary lesions, five patients with diffuse renal enlargement, four patients with perirenal lesions, and two patients with direct invasion of the kidney. CONCLUSION: In leukemia the most common imaging pattern is diffuse enlargement. In the other subtypes of lymphoproliferative disease no specific correlation between typical CT patterns and subtype of lymphoproliferative disease can be found. The prevalence of renal involvement is in line with earlier studies. Contrary to earlier reports, multiple lesions were not found to be a common pattern.","['Bach, Andreas Gunter', 'Behrmann, Curd', 'Holzhausen, Hans Jurgen', 'Katzer, Michaela', 'Arnold, Dirk', 'Spielmann, Rolf Peter', 'Surov, Alexey']","['Bach AG', 'Behrmann C', 'Holzhausen HJ', 'Katzer M', 'Arnold D', 'Spielmann RP', 'Surov A']","['Department of Radiology, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany. andreas.bach@medizin.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Radiol,"Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)",8706123,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ar.2011.110523 [pii]', '10.1258/ar.2011.110523 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Radiol. 2012 Apr 1;53(3):343-8. doi: 10.1258/ar.2011.110523.

This study was designed to examine whether the class I and class IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, sodium butyrate and sodium valproate alter the expression of human NCOR1 and/or NCOR2 genes coding for N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors), respectively. METHODS: Human leukemia HL-60 cells were treated for 24 h with 0.5 and 1 mM sodium butyrate, 1 to 3 mM sodium valproate, 1 mcM all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or cotreated with 1 mcM ATRA and 0.5 mM sodium butyrate. The acetylation of histones H3 and H4 was analysed by western blotting. The levels of NCOR1 and NCOR2 mRNA were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of NCF2 gene coding for the NADPH oxidase subunit p67phox was evaluated as a marker of myeloid differentiation. Results. Both butyrate and valproate increased the acetylation of histone H3 at Lys9 and/or Lys14 as well as histone H4 at Lys12. Both HDAC inhibitors caused a significant increase in NCF2 mRNA levels without affecting NCOR1 or NCOR2 mRNA levels. Similarly, ATRA alone or in combination with butyrate induced NCF2 gene expression without any significant influence on the expression of NCOR1 or NCOR2 genes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that inhibitors of class I and class IIa HDACs do not alter the expression of human NCOR1 or NCOR2 genes and that the onset of myeloid differentiation is not accompanied by induction or repression of these genes in HL-60 cells.","['Vrba, Jiri', 'Trtkova, Katerina', 'Ulrichova, Jitka']","['Vrba J', 'Trtkova K', 'Ulrichova J']","['Department of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic. vrbambv@seznam.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/05/24 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2011.033 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2011 Sep;155(3):259-62. doi: 10.5507/bp.2011.033.,,,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (NCF2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1/*genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulated TK activity has been observed in solid cancers and hematologic malignancies. Advances in the understanding of the oncogenic activation of TKs led to the identification of new kinase inhibitors with improved potency, specificity, and efficacy. With the advent of imatinib mesylate, a new era in the management of patients with BCR-ABL+ chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and myeloproliferative neoplasms including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with PDGFRB gene rearrangements and hypereosinophilic syndrome has begun. CML represents a model for the rational design of TK inhibitors based on the insights into signal transduction pathways. In CML, treatment with imatinib led to an outstanding clinical efficacy with limited toxicity. In BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferation, the finding of activating point mutations in JAK2 prompted the development of JAK inhibitors to target this activated pathway. Aberrations of epigenetically active genes are the latest finding in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders and will serve as another target for innovative therapies.","['Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'La Rosee, Paul']","['Hochhaus A', 'Reiter A', 'Ernst T', 'La Rosee P']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Germany. andreas.hochhaus@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['000334824 [pii]', '10.1159/000334824 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2012;35 Suppl 1:34-41. doi: 10.1159/000334824.

On the diagnostic side, the characterization of key mutations and molecular pathways responsible for tumor development and progression has led to the identification of a large number of potential targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. On the treatment and prevention side, molecular analysis will be of even greater importance for guiding individualized therapy. Diagnostics of molecular lesions present in each tumor will become a key feature of future clinical care. This will allow prediction of response with substantially increased accuracy, stratification of particular patient groups, and eventually personalization of therapy. Striking examples of molecular targeted therapies that have already been established in clinical practice include tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition in EGFR-mutated lung cancer, HER2/neu blockade in HER2/neu-positive breast cancer, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors in lung cancer with EML4-ALK fusion. The scientific development along this line will change the approach to tumor diseases in the future. Patients will be treated according to the specific molecular profiles found in the individual tumor tissue and preferentially with targeted substances, if available.","['Grullich, Carsten', 'von Kalle, Christof']","['Grullich C', 'von Kalle C']","['Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,2012/02/01 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['000334825 [pii]', '10.1159/000334825 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2012;35 Suppl 1:4-7. doi: 10.1159/000334825.

METHODS: Posaconazole concentrations in patients with AML/MDS receiving prophylactic posaconazole were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. A population PK model with nonlinear mixed effect modeling was developed. The list of tested covariates included age, weight, height, gender, posaconazole dose, ethnicity, co-administration of antineoplastic chemotherapy, ranitidine or pantoprazole, coincident fever, diarrhea, leukocyte counts, and gamma-glutamyltransterase plasma activity. RESULTS: A total of 643 serum concentrations of posaconazole from 84 patients were obtained. A one-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination as the basic structural model appropriately described the data, with an apparent clearance of 56.8 L/h [95% confidence interval (CI) 52.8-60.8 L/h] and an apparent volume of distribution of 2,130 L (95% CI 1,646-2,614 L). Significant effects on apparent clearance (CL/F) were found for presence of diarrhea and for co-medication with proton-pump inhibitors (1.5- and 1.6-fold increase in CL/F, respectively), weight (33.4 L larger apparent volume of distribution per kilogram), and co-administration of chemotherapy (0.6-fold lower apparent volume of distribution). CONCLUSION: We developed a prediction basis for mean posaconazole concentrations in AML/MDS patients. Patient weight, presence of diarrhea, and concomitant medication (chemotherapy and pantoprazole) showed significant effects on posaconazole exposure. Corresponding adjustments of the starting dose according to the presence of diarrhea and during the co-administration of chemotherapy or proton-pump inhibitors appear justified before therapeutic drug monitoring results are available. Further investigation of the interaction between different chemotherapeutic regimens and posaconazole is warranted.","['Vehreschild, J J', 'Muller, C', 'Farowski, F', 'Vehreschild, M J G T', 'Cornely, O A', 'Fuhr, U', 'Kreuzer, K-A', 'Hallek, M', 'Kohl, V']","['Vehreschild JJ', 'Muller C', 'Farowski F', 'Vehreschild MJ', 'Cornely OA', 'Fuhr U', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Hallek M', 'Kohl V']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/09/15 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-012-1212-y [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2012 Jun;68(6):987-95. doi: 10.1007/s00228-012-1212-y.,,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Suspensions)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Mycoses/prevention & control', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Suspensions/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the STAT5-activating kinase JAK2 have been discussed as a treatment option for CML patients. Using murine leukemia models combined with inducible ablation of JAK2, we show JAK2 dependence for initial lymphoid transformation, which is lost once leukemia is established. In contrast, initial myeloid transformation and leukemia maintenance were independent of JAK2. Nevertheless, several JAK2 TKIs induced apoptosis in BCR-ABL(+) cells irrespective of the presence of JAK2. This is caused by the previously unknown direct 'off-target' inhibition of BCR-ABL. Cellular and enzymatic analyses suggest that BCR-ABL phosphorylates STAT5 directly. Our findings suggest uncoupling of the canonical JAK2-STAT5 module upon BCR-ABL expression, thereby making JAK2 targeting dispensable. Thus, attempts to pharmacologically target STAT5 in BCR-ABL(+) diseases need to focus on STAT5 itself.","['Hantschel, Oliver', 'Warsch, Wolfgang', 'Eckelhart, Eva', 'Kaupe, Ines', 'Grebien, Florian', 'Wagner, Kay-Uwe', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Hantschel O', 'Warsch W', 'Eckelhart E', 'Kaupe I', 'Grebien F', 'Wagner KU', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Sexl V']","['CeMM-Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Chem Biol,Nature chemical biology,101231976,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['nchembio.775 [pii]', '10.1038/nchembio.775 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Chem Biol. 2012 Jan 29;8(3):285-93. doi: 10.1038/nchembio.775.,,20120129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,['Nat Chem Biol. 2012 Mar;8(3):228-9.

The leukemogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins is critically dependent on their direct interaction with menin, a product of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1) gene. Here we present what are to our knowledge the first small-molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL fusion protein interaction that specifically bind menin with nanomolar affinities. These compounds effectively reverse MLL fusion protein-mediated leukemic transformation by downregulating the expression of target genes required for MLL fusion protein oncogenic activity.

Identification of these compounds provides a new tool for better understanding MLL-mediated leukemogenesis and represents a new approach for studying the role of menin as an oncogenic cofactor of MLL fusion proteins.

In human cells, ectopic expression of Gfi-1 inhibits and RNA interference-mediated Gfi-1 downregulation enhances proliferation and colony formation of p210BCR/ABL expressing cells. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that may explain the effects of perturbing Gfi-1 expression in human cells, Gfi-1-regulated genes were identified by microarray analysis in K562 cells expressing the tamoxifen-regulated Gfi-1-ER protein. STAT 5B and Mcl-1, two genes important for the proliferation and survival of hematopoietic stem cells, were identified as direct and functionally relevant Gfi-1 targets in p210BCR/ABL-transformed cells because: (i) their expression and promoter activity was repressed by Gfi-1 and (ii) when constitutively expressed blocked the proliferation and colony formation inhibitory effects of Gfi-1. Consistent with these findings, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of STAT 5 and/or Mcl-1 markedly suppressed proliferation and colony formation of K562 and CD34+ chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. Together, these studies suggest that the Gfi-1STAT 5B/Mcl-1 regulatory pathway identified here can be modulated to suppress the proliferation and survival of p210BCR/ABL-transformed cells including CD34+ CML cells.","['Soliera, A R', 'Mariani, S A', 'Audia, A', 'Lidonnici, M R', 'Addya, S', 'Ferrari-Amorotti, G', 'Cattelani, S', 'Manzotti, G', 'Fragliasso, V', 'Peterson, L', 'Perini, G', 'Holyoake, T L', 'Calabretta, B']","['Soliera AR', 'Mariani SA', 'Audia A', 'Lidonnici MR', 'Addya S', 'Ferrari-Amorotti G', 'Cattelani S', 'Manzotti G', 'Fragliasso V', 'Peterson L', 'Perini G', 'Holyoake TL', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201219 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.19 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jul;26(7):1555-63. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.19.

The purpose of this study was to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying growth inhibition as well as apoptosis in vinca alkaloid-treated lung adenocarcinoma cells. Consistent with nocodazole, treatment with vinorelbine (VNR) caused mitotic prometaphase arrest in a time-dependent manner, accompanied by cell apoptosis, dependent on both dose and time. VNR sequentially induced mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) loss and caspase-dependent apoptosis following myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl) 1 downregulation. Prolonged activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was required for vinca alkaloid- and nocodazole-induced apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest. Vinca alkaloids and nocodazole caused glutathione/reactive oxygen species (ROS) imbalance, and inhibiting ROS prevented prolonged JNK activation, decreased Mcl-1 levels, MTP loss, and apoptosis. Notably, cell size and granularity were enlarged in stimulated cells; unexpectedly, many ROS-producing mitochondria were accumulated followed by aberrant JNK-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Unlike cisplatin, which causes DNA damage in each phase of the cell cycle, VNR and nocodazole induced aberrant JNK-regulated DNA damage in prometaphase; however, inhibiting ATM (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) did not reverse mitotic arrest or apoptosis. These results demonstrate an essential role of ROS in vinca alkaloid-induced aberrant JNK-mediated Mcl-1 downregulation and DNA damage followed by mitochondrial dysfunction-related apoptosis but not mitotic arrest.","['Chiu, Wei-Hsin', 'Luo, Sheng-Jei', 'Chen, Chia-Ling', 'Cheng, Jai-Hong', 'Hsieh, Chia-Yuan', 'Wang, Chi-Yun', 'Huang, Wei-Ching', 'Su, Wu-Chou', 'Lin, Chiou-Feng']","['Chiu WH', 'Luo SJ', 'Chen CL', 'Cheng JH', 'Hsieh CY', 'Wang CY', 'Huang WC', 'Su WC', 'Lin CF']","['Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. wei_hsin2005@yahoo.com.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(12)00063-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2012.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 May 1;83(9):1159-71. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2012.01.016.

Long-term cultivation and maintenance of normal iPS cells in an undifferentiated self-renewing state is a major challenge. Our previous studies have shown that human amniotic epithelial cells (HuAECs) could provide a good source of feeder cells for mouse and human embryonic stem cells, or spermatogonial stem cells, as they express endogenous leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) at high levels. Here, we examined the effect of exogenous microRNA-199a regulation on endogenous LIF expression in HuAECs, and in turn on human iPS cell pluripotency. We found that HuAECs feeder cells transfected with microRNA-199a mutant expressed LIF at high levels, allowing iPS to maintain a high level of alkaline phosphatase activity in long-term culture and form teratomas in severe combined immunodeficient mice. The expression of stem cell markers was increased in iPS cultured on HuAECs feeder cells transfected with the microRNA-199a mutant, compared with iPS cultured on HuAECs transfected with microRNA-199a or mouse embryo fibroblasts. Taken together, these results suggested that LIF expression might be regulated by microRNA-199a, and LIF was a crucial component in feeder cells, and also was required for maintenance of human iPS cells in an undifferentiated, proliferative state capable of self-renewal.","['Liu, Te', 'Chen, Qing', 'Huang, Yongyi', 'Huang, Qin', 'Jiang, Lizhen', 'Guo, Lihe']","['Liu T', 'Chen Q', 'Huang Y', 'Huang Q', 'Jiang L', 'Guo L']","['School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai, China. liute79@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/07/11 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr127 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmr127 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2012 Mar;44(3):197-206. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmr127.

MicroRNA microarray and stem-loop reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of miR-181a. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay was performed to quantify the effect of miR-181a on K562 cells growth and viability. Apoptotic cells were quantitatively detected using Annexin V/FITC and PI apoptosis detection kit. BCL-2 protein expression was measured by western blot. Luciferase reporter vector with the putative BCL-2 3' untranslated region was constructed to explore whether BCL-2 was a direct target gene of miR-181a. BCL-2 siRNA was transfected into the cell to explore the relationship between BCL-2 and DNR resistance. The miR-181a expression level was lower in the K562/A02 cells than in the K562 cells (P< 0.05). K562 cells that were transfected with miR-181a inhibitor had a significantly higher survival than K562 cells, and K562/A02 cells that were transfected with the miR-181a mimic had a significantly lower survival than K562/A02 cells (P< 0.05). miR-181a could enhance DNR-induced apoptosis in K562/A02 cells. BCL-2 siRNA transfected K562/A02 cells had decreased survival compared with the K562/A02 control group. In conclusion, miR-181a could play a role in the development of DNR resistance in K562/A02 cells and the over-expression of miR-181a could sensitize K562/A02 cells to DNR by targeting BCL-2.","['Li, Hao', 'Hui, Lulu', 'Xu, Wenlin']","['Li H', 'Hui L', 'Xu W']","[""Department of Central Laboratory, The Affiliated People's Hospital, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/07/11 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr128 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmr128 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2012 Mar;44(3):269-77. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmr128.

Johne's disease presents as a chronic enteritis with severe inflammation of intestinal tissues, characterized by widespread infiltration of macrophages, the target cell of MAP. Clinical signs of Johne's disease are typically accompanied by a loss of peripheral CD4+ T cell responses to MAP antigens and an increase in anti-MAP serum IgG levels. Recently, it was proposed that regulatory T cells might develop over the lengthy course of subclinical MAP infection. In the past five years, significant progress in defining bovine regulatory T cells has been made. These studies grew out of observations that IL-10 is produced by PBMCs in response to MAP antigen stimulation and that neutralization of this IL-10 could enhance IFN-gamma production from MAP-antigen reactive effector T cells. Depletion studies revealed that MAP responsive cell populations producing IL-10 were largely CD4+ and CD25+, although monocytes have also been shown to produce IL-10 in response to MAP. In addition, evidence for a regulatory population of gammadelta T cells has also begun to accumulate. We summarize current thinking regarding regulatory T cells in MAP infection and provide data suggesting a potential link between regulatory T cells, bovine leukemia virus, and MAP.","['Coussens, Paul M', 'Sipkovsky, Sue', 'Murphy, Brooke', 'Roussey, Jon', 'Colvin, Christopher J']","['Coussens PM', 'Sipkovsky S', 'Murphy B', 'Roussey J', 'Colvin CJ']","['Molecular Pathogenesis Laboratory, Department of Animal Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. coussens@msu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",7808924,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0147-9571(12)00005-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cimid.2012.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis. 2012 May;35(3):233-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cimid.2012.01.004.

Limited clinical information exists for patients with CLL who have a poor-risk cytogenetic profile and a mutated or good-risk IGHV status. We retrospectively screened all patients with CLL seen at our institution from 2006 onward who harbored a del(11q) or del(17p) CLL detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for whom an IGHV analysis was requested. In 66 evaluable patients, 50 (76%) had an unmutated IGHV sequence. Thirty-nine patients (59%) had del(11q) and 27 patients (41%) had del(17p); no patient in this series had both del(11q) and del(17p). The patients' initial clinical presentations were similar in both mutational groups. Patients with an unmutated IGHV sequence were more likely to receive treatment and to have a shorter survival, with an estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) of 81% compared with 100% in the group with a mutated IGHV sequence (log rank, P = .06). These data suggest that IGHV mutational status has prognostic relevance even in patients with CLL who are defined as poor risk by genomic FISH analysis.","['Gladstone, Douglas E', 'Blackford, Amanda', 'Cho, Eunpi', 'Swinnen, Lode', 'Kasamon, Yvette', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Griffin, Constance A', 'Bolanos-Meade, Javier', 'Jones, Richard J']","['Gladstone DE', 'Blackford A', 'Cho E', 'Swinnen L', 'Kasamon Y', 'Gocke CD', 'Griffin CA', 'Bolanos-Meade J', 'Jones RJ']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA. dgladst1@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00612-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Apr;12(2):132-7. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.12.005.

Early identification of treatment failure may increase the probability that alternative therapy will be effective. This review discusses the use of molecular monitoring in the timely detection of failure of imatinib treatment. Changes in the levels of BCR-ABL transcripts are predictive of response or relapse. Patients achieving a major molecular response (MMR) within 12 months of treatment may experience longer cytogenetic remission. Accumulating evidence also suggests that lower transcript levels observed </= 6 months after the start of treatment are associated with improved patient outcomes.

Because of their high reactivity some epoxides are also produced in the chemical industry for the synthesis of other compounds. Therefore, human exposure to VOCs epoxides does occur and may be an important human health concern. In this study, the in vitro genotoxic potential of epoxides originating from 1,3-butadiene (3,4-epoxy-1-butene: EB; 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane: DEB), isoprene (3,4-epoxy-2-methyl-1-butene: IO), styrene (styrene-7,8-oxide: SO), propylene (propylene oxide: PO) and 1-butene (1,2-epoxy-butane: BO) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and promyelocytic leukaemia cells (HL60) was measured with the comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis, SCGE). The effect of inclusion of foetal calf serum (FCS, 5%) in the cell-culture medium and different durations of exposure (2h, 24h) were also investigated. All epoxides tested produced DNA damage in a concentration range that did not reduce cell viability. HL60 cells were more resistant than PBMCs to the DNA damage induced by the different epoxides. With the exception of IO, the treatment for 24h resulted in an increase of DNA damage. FCS slightly protected PBMCs from the genotoxic effects induced by IO and BO, whilst no such effect was noted for the other compounds. Overall, the dose-dependent effects that were seen allowed us to define a genotoxicity scale for the different epoxides as follows: SO>EB>DEB>IO>PO>BO, which is in partial agreement with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classification of the carcinogenic hazards.","['Fabiani, Roberto', 'Rosignoli, Patrizia', 'De Bartolomeo, Angelo', 'Fuccelli, Raffaela', 'Morozzi, Guido']","['Fabiani R', 'Rosignoli P', 'De Bartolomeo A', 'Fuccelli R', 'Morozzi G']","['Dipartimento di Specialita Medico-Chirurgiche e Sanita Pubblica, Sezione di Epidemiologia Molecolare e Igiene Ambientale, Universita di Perugia, via del Giochetto, 06126 Perugia, Italy.

Our results showed that the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene and the mdr1 gene were 6.1 times and 1.7 times, respectively, as high as that of parental SUP-B15 cell line. We found no mutation in the Abl kinase domain of SUP-B15/RI. Furthermore, the detection of cell signaling pathway of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF, NF-kappaB, JNK and STAT showed the up-regulation of phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, P70S6K, and RAF, ERK, and MEK, down-regulation of PTEN and 4EBP-1, and no change in other cell signaling pathways in SUP-B15/RI. However, dasatinib and nilotinib showed partial resistance. Interestingly, bortezomib had no resistance. Imatinib combination with rapamycin had synergistic effect on overcoming the resistance. Altogether, over-expression of BCR-ABL1 and mdr1 gene were involved in the resistance mechanisms, and up-regulation of the cell signaling pathways of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF in SUP-B15/RI cell line may be correlated with them. The SUP-B15/RI cell line was also resistant to the second generation tyrosine kinase, dasatinib, and nilotinib, not bortezomib. The combination of imatinib with rapamycin can partially overcome the resistance and blockade of the ubiquitin-proteasome can be also a promising pathway to overcome imatinib resistance.","['Xing, Hongyun', 'Yang, Xi', 'Liu, Ting', 'Lin, Juan', 'Chen, Xiaoyi', 'Gong, Yuping']","['Xing H', 'Yang X', 'Liu T', 'Lin J', 'Chen X', 'Gong Y']","['Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/04/12 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00609-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.12.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Apr;36(4):509-13. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.12.018.

Here, we hypothesized that co-targeting of mTOR (by mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus) and the microtubule (by microtubule-destabilizing agent vinblastine) would be more efficacious than single targeting in HCC models. In vitro studies showed that effective inhibition of mTOR signaling with temsirolimus alone was able to suppress HCC cell growth in a dose-dependent manner.

We found that co-targeting of mTOR (by temsirolimus) and the microtubule (by vinblastine, at low nM) resulted in marked growth inhibition in Huh7 cells and synergistic growth inhibition in Hep3B cells (achieving maximal growth inhibition of 80-90%), demonstrating potent antitumor activity of this novel combination. In vivo studies showed that temsirolimus treatment alone for 1 week was able to inhibit the growth of Huh7 xenografts. Strikingly, the temsirolimus/vinblastine combination induced a significant and sustained antitumor activity (up to 27 days post-treatment), with effective reduction of tumor vessel density in both Huh7 and Hep3B xenograft models. Mechanistic investigation revealed that this marked antitumor effect was accompanied by specific and concerted down-regulation of several key anti-apoptotic/survival proteins (survivin, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1), which was not observed in single agent treatments. Our findings demonstrated that the potent anti-cancer activity of this co-targeting strategy was indeed mediated in parts by inhibition of these key survival/anti-apoptotic proteins.","['Zhou, Qian', 'Lui, Vivian Wai Yan', 'Lau, Cecilia Pik Yuk', 'Cheng, Suk Hang', 'Ng, Margaret Heung Ling', 'Cai, Yijun', 'Chan, Stephen Lam', 'Yeo, Winnie']","['Zhou Q', 'Lui VW', 'Lau CP', 'Cheng SH', 'Ng MH', 'Cai Y', 'Chan SL', 'Yeo W']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(12)00060-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2012.01.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 May 1;83(9):1146-58. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2012.01.013.

Second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors have shorter onset times and higher rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) than imatinib. Dasatinib has a half-maximal inhibitory concentration 325 times lower than imatinib for BCR-ABL substrate phosphorylation in vitro and is less susceptible to most known molecular mechanisms of BCR-ABL imatinib resistance. OBJECTIVES: This study summarized published data on the use of dasatinib in CML-CP, reviewed the importance of early response to therapy, and discussed additional therapies for patients with newly diagnosed disease. METHODS: PubMed was searched through June 2011 for English-language publications with the following search terms: imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, chronic myeloid/myelogenous leukemia or CML, and clinical trial. To identify follow-up data from published trials and data on trials in progress and products in development, similar searches were conducted for abstract and clinical trial databases. Relevant articles and abstracts were identified as those reporting results of Phase II and III clinical trials, predictors of treatment response, and treatment guidelines. No prespecified inclusion or exclusion criteria were used. RESULTS: Dasatinib was effective in patients resistant to imatinib and more effective than high-dose imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed CML who were resistant to standard dose imatinib. Compared with imatinib, dasatinib induced superior response rates and patient outcomes earlier in the disease. In a Phase III trial in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, dasatinib 100 mg once daily induced significantly higher and faster rates of confirmed CCyR and major molecular response by 12 months versus imatinib and was generally well tolerated. Early achievement of CCyR was associated with better long-term progression-free survival. Dasatinib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for initial treatment of CML-CP. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib was an effective treatment with the potential to improve long-term outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP.","['Abbott, Brian L']",['Abbott BL'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Sletten Cancer Institute, Great Falls, Montana 59405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/06/23 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(12)00010-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2012.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2012 Feb;34(2):272-81. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2012.01.009.

Monosomy 7 was predominantly found at diagnosis, but clones changed to CN-LOH of chromosome 7 with disease progression. Furthermore, subclones with genomic aberrations of 3q gain, 1p CN-LOH, and trisomy 12 newly appeared, suggesting that they were also involved in the transformation process.

The methods currently used for monitoring CLL and determining conditions for treatment are limited in their ability to predict disease progression, patient survival, and response to therapy. Although clonal diversity and the acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities during the disease course (clonal evolution) have been associated with disease progression, their prognostic potential has been underappreciated because cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies have a restricted ability to detect genomic abnormalities and clonal evolution. We hypothesized that whole genome analysis using high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays would be useful to detect diversity and infer clonal evolution to offer prognostic information. In this study, we used the Infinium Omni1 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) array for the analysis of genetic variation and percent mosaicism in 25 non-selected CLL patients to explore the prognostic value of the assessment of clonal diversity in patients with CLL. We calculated the percentage of mosaicism for each abnormality by applying a mathematical algorithm to the genotype frequency data and by manual determination using the Simulated DNA Copy Number (SiDCoN) tool, which was developed from a computer model of mosaicism. At least one genetic abnormality was identified in each case, and the SNP data was 98% concordant with FISH results. Clonal diversity, defined as the presence of two or more genetic abnormalities with differing percentages of mosaicism, was observed in 12 patients (48%), and the diversity correlated with the disease stage. Clonal diversity was present in most cases of advanced disease (Rai stages III and IV) or those with previous treatment, whereas 9 of 13 patients without detected clonal diversity were asymptomatic or clinically stable. In conclusion, SNP microarray studies with simultaneous evaluation of genomic alterations and mosaic distribution of clones can be used to assess apparent clonal evolution via analysis of clonal diversity. Since clonal evolution in CLL is strongly correlated with disease progression, whole genome SNP microarray analysis provides a new comprehensive and reliable prognostic tool for CLL patients.","['Zhang, Linsheng', 'Znoyko, Iya', 'Costa, Luciano J', 'Conlin, Laura K', 'Daber, Robert D', 'Self, Sally E', 'Wolff, Daynna J']","['Zhang L', 'Znoyko I', 'Costa LJ', 'Conlin LK', 'Daber RD', 'Self SE', 'Wolff DJ']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(11)00305-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2011 Dec;204(12):654-65. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2011.10.012.,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Real time PCR followed by amplicon sequencing successfully confirmed Leishmania infantum (syn Leishmania chagasi) infection.

However, its clinical use is severely limited by the development of a progressive dose-dependent cardiomyopathy that results in irreversible congestive heart failure. To provide a strategy for constraining or minimizing the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP, a pirarubicin liposome powder (L-THP) was appropriately prepared, and the cumulative cardiotoxicity of L-THP and free THP (F-THP) were investigated on Sprague-Dawley rats after 3 successive doses. Urinary samples for metabonomic study, serum samples for biochemical assay, and heart samples for histopathology test were collected. As a result, the metabonomics-based findings such as PLS-DA plotting showed minimal metabolic alterations in L-THP as compared to F-THP, and correlated with the changes of serum biochemical assay and cardiac histopathology as measurements of damage to heart tissue. Our results confirm that when encapsulated into liposomes, the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP can be greatly ameliorated. Lipophilic aglycone metabolites of THP associated with redox cycling are cardiotoxic for the possibility of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Also, metabonomic analysis shows that the successive doses of THP will lead to severe metabolic pathways disturbances in the cell energy production. Further, the preliminary efficacy study of L-THP on lung cancer was evaluated in the approach of in vitro cytotoxicity on A549 cells by high content screening (HCS) analysis, and L-THP was found to exhibit better therapeutic index against lung cancer than THP.","['Cong, Wenjuan', 'Liang, Qionglin', 'Li, Li', 'Shi, Jun', 'Liu, Qingfei', 'Feng, Yi', 'Wang, Yiming', 'Luo, Guoan']","['Cong W', 'Liang Q', 'Li L', 'Shi J', 'Liu Q', 'Feng Y', 'Wang Y', 'Luo G']","['Engineering Research Center of Modern Preparation Technology of TCM, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Talanta,Talanta,2984816R,2012/01/31 06:00,2012/06/23 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0039-9140(11)01053-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.talanta.2011.11.071 [doi]']",ppublish,Talanta. 2012 Jan 30;89:91-8. doi: 10.1016/j.talanta.2011.11.071.

However, its clinical course remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with pneumonia caused by S. maltophilia in Toranomon Hospital (890 beds, Tokyo, Japan) were reviewed retrospectively between April 2006 and March 2010. RESULTS: During the study period, 10 cases of S. maltophilia pneumonia were identified. Seven patients had acute myeloid leukemia, 2 had myelodysplastic syndrome, and 1 had malignant lymphoma. All patients developed symptoms after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Five patients received first cord blood transplantation (CBT), 4 patients received second CBT, and 1 patient received first peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The overall incidence of S. maltophilia pneumonia among 508 patients who received HSCT during the period was 2.0%. The incidence was 0% (0/95) in patients after bone marrow transplantation, 0.8% (1/133) after PBSCT, and 3.2% (9/279) after CBT. Pneumonia developed a median of 13.5 days (range, 6-40) after transplantation. At onset, the median white blood cell count was 10/muL (range, 10-1900), and the median neutrophil count was 0/muL (range, 0-1720). In all patients, S. maltophilia bacteremia developed with bloody sputum or hemoptysis. The 28-day mortality rate was 100%; the median survival after onset of pneumonia was 2 days (range, 1-10). CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic S. maltophilia pneumonia rapidly progresses and is fatal in patients with hematologic malignancy. Attention should be particularly paid to the neutropenic phase early after HSCT or prolonged neutropenia due to engraftment failure. A prompt trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-based multidrug combination regimen should be considered to rescue suspected cases of S. maltophilia pneumonia in these severely immunosuppressed patients.","['Araoka, H', 'Fujii, T', 'Izutsu, K', 'Kimura, M', 'Nishida, A', 'Ishiwata, K', 'Nakano, N', 'Tsuji, M', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Asano-Mori, Y', 'Uchida, N', 'Wake, A', 'Taniguchi, S', 'Yoneyama, A']","['Araoka H', 'Fujii T', 'Izutsu K', 'Kimura M', 'Nishida A', 'Ishiwata K', 'Nakano N', 'Tsuji M', 'Yamamoto H', 'Asano-Mori Y', 'Uchida N', 'Wake A', 'Taniguchi S', 'Yoneyama A']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. h-araoka@toranomon.gr.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,2012/01/31 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/01/31 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1399-3062.2011.00710.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2012 Aug;14(4):355-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3062.2011.00710.x.

However, the best results come from the combination of this agent with chemotherapy; a significant benefit has been seen with the use of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy boosted overall response rates, complete response rates and prolonged progression free survival. Recent data showed an overall survival benefit with FCR. Other combinations including bendamustine and rituximab appear more effective than bendamustine alone, while combining rituximab with other types of agents also appears to improve response rates.

Calcium electroporation elicited dramatic antitumor responses in which 89% of treated tumors were eliminated. Histologic analyses indicated complete tumor necrosis. Mechanistically, calcium electroporation caused acute ATP depletion likely due to a combination of increased cellular use of ATP, decreased production of ATP due to effects on the mitochondria, as well as loss of ATP through the permeabilized cell membrane. Taken together, our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for the use of electroporation to load cancer cells with calcium as an efficient anticancer treatment.

The authors have designed a combination of clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine followed by a prolonged consolidation alternating with decitabine. METHODS: Sixty patients with a median age of 70 years (range, 60-81 years) with newly diagnosed AML were included. They received clofarabine 20 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 5 days plus cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily for 10 days. Responding patients continued for up to 17 courses of consolidation therapy including decitabine. RESULTS: Forty of 59 evaluable patients responded (66%). Complete remission rate was 58%. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 14.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.9 to not estimable), and median overall survival (OS) was 12.7 months (95% CI, 8.8 to not estimable). Median OS of responding patients (complete response [CR]/CR with platelet count <100 x 109/L) was 24.2 months (95% CI, 17 to not estimable). Compared with a historical group of patients who received clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine with a shorter consolidation, RFS was not statistically different. Induction mortality was low (7% at 8 weeks) and toxicities manageable. CONCLUSIONS: Clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine alternating with decitabine in consolidation is active in older patients with newly diagnosed AML. The benefits of a prolonged consolidation remain unproven.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Burger, Jan', 'Feliu, Jennie', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Faderl S', 'Ravandi F', 'Huang X', 'Wang X', 'Jabbour E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kadia T', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Konopleva M', 'Borthakur G', 'Burger J', 'Feliu J', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. sfaderl@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2012/01/28 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/01/28 06:00'],"['2011/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27429 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Sep 15;118(18):4471-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27429.

As both the response to prednisolone in vitro and prednisone in vivo are predictive for clinical outcome, understanding and overcoming glucocorticoid resistance remains an essential step towards improving prognosis. Prednisolone-induced apoptosis depends on glucocorticoid-evoked Ca(2+) fluxes from the endoplasmic reticulum towards the mitochondria. Here, we demonstrate that in MLL-rearranged infant ALL, over-expression of S100A8 and S100A9 is associated with failure to induce free-cytosolic Ca(2+) and prednisolone resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that enforced expression of S100A8/S100A9 in prednisolone-sensitive MLL-rearranged ALL cells, rapidly leads to prednisolone resistance as a result of S100A8/S100A9 mediated suppression of prednisolone-induced free-cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. In addition, the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 markedly sensitized MLL-rearranged ALL cells otherwise resistant to prednisolone, via downregulation of S100A8 and S100A9, which allowed prednisolone-induced Ca(2+) fluxes to reach the mitochondria and trigger apoptosis. On the basis of this novel mechanism of prednisolone resistance, we propose that developing more specific S100A8/S100A9 inhibitors may well be beneficial for prednisolone-resistant MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients.","['Spijkers-Hagelstein, J A P', 'Schneider, P', 'Hulleman, E', 'de Boer, J', 'Williams, O', 'Pieters, R', 'Stam, R W']","['Spijkers-Hagelstein JA', 'Schneider P', 'Hulleman E', 'de Boer J', 'Williams O', 'Pieters R', 'Stam RW']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center / Sophia Children's Hospital, Zuid-Holland, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/01/28 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/01/28 06:00'],"['2012/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011388 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.388 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1255-65. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.388.

The overall survival at 10 years after diagnosis estimated by Kaplan-Meier was 77.6%. Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified risk factors affecting survival, including age >40 years, absolute neutrophil count<0.5 x 10(9) cells/L, development of thrombotic events, evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia, and recurrent infections. The cohort of patients were divided into subcategories of classic PNH, PNH/AA, and PNH-sc/AA based on the recent proposed PNH working clinical classification, hemoglobinuria as the initial symptomatic manifestation was high up to 82.0% in classic PNH subcategory, whereas only as low as 1.4% in PNH-sc/AA subcategory; the frequencies of infectious (26.0%) and bleeding symptoms (14.0%) in classic PNH subcategory were significantly less than those in PNH/AA (25.3% and 51.7%, respectively) and PNH-sc/AA (48.3% and 83.2%, respectively) subcategories. Our results revealed that large PNH clone was associated with increased risks for hemoglobinuria and thrombosis, whereas small PNH clone was associated with bone marrow failure.

METHODOLOGY: Differentially expressed genes between HCC and normal liver tissues were screened by using Gene Expression Profile Chip with 14,500 distinct genes. Some selected differentially expressed genes were validated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the gene level and using immunohistochemistry for the protein level. RESULTS: A total of 2757 (19.01%) differentially expressed genes were totally screened by Gene chip analysis, showing 1772 up-regulated and 984 down-regulated genes. These genes were initially classified into 16 groups according to their functions. The RT-PCR results strongly supported the Gene chip data. By immunohistochemistry, two proteins showed expression levels that corresponded to the Gene chip results, while expression levels found for one protein were different to the Gene chip results. CONCLUSIONS: Gene chip is a useful tool for screening tumor-associated genes and it contributes to the understanding of pathogenesis of HCC.

Infertility represents one of the main long-term consequences of combination chemotherapy given for lymphoma, leukaemia and other malignancies in young women. The gonadotoxic effect of various chemotherapeutic agents is diverse, may involve a variety of pathophysiologic mechanisms, and is not unequivocally understood. Proliferating cells, such as in tissues with high turnover (i.e. bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract and growing ovarian follicles) are more vulnerable to the toxic effect of alkylating agents. These agents may also be cytotoxic to cells at rest, as they are not cell-cycle specific. Alkylating agents, the most gonadotoxic chemotherapeutic medications, cause dose-dependent, direct destruction of oocytes and follicular depletion, and may bring about cortical fibrosis and ovarian blood-vessel damage. The reported rate of premature ovarian failure after various diseases and chemotherapeutic protocols differ enormously, and depend mainly on the chemotherapeutic protocol used and age range of the woman. Several options have been proposed for preserving female fertility, despite gonadotoxic chemotherapy: ovarian transposition, cryopreservation of embryos, unfertilised metaphase-II oocytes and ovarian tissue, and administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonistic analogs in an attempt to decrease the gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapy by simulating a prepubertal hormonal milieu. None of these methods is ideal and none guarantees future fertility in all survivors; therefore, a combination of methods is recommended for maximising women's chances of future fertility.","['Blumenfeld, Zeev']",['Blumenfeld Z'],"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, RAMBAM Health Care Campus, The Rappaport Institute, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa Israel. bzeev@techunix.technion.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol,Best practice & research.

Therefore, we investigated the potential application of FTY720 on MM using U266 cell line. We observed that FTY720 could induce caspase-3 dependent apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in U266 cells. FTY720 caused apoptosis by down-regulating antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1, bcl-2, survivin and cleavage of Bid. Interestingly, FTY720 induce autophagy which could promote the apoptosis in U266 cells. Furthermore, activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulates FTY720 induced apoptosis and autophagy in U266 cells. The study implicated that FTY720 could be a good candidate for MM treatment.","['Liao, Aijun', 'Hu, Rong', 'Zhao, Qihui', 'Li, Jia', 'Li, Yingchun', 'Yao, Kun', 'Zhang, Rong', 'Wang, Huihan', 'Yang, Wei', 'Liu, Zhuogang']","['Liao A', 'Hu R', 'Zhao Q', 'Li J', 'Li Y', 'Yao K', 'Zhang R', 'Wang H', 'Yang W', 'Liu Z']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, 36 Sanhao Street, Heping District, 110004 Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,2012/01/28 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/01/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0928-0987(11)00469-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2011.12.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2012 Apr 11;45(5):600-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2011.12.014.

During routine herd testing, Dairy Herd Improvement Association technicians collected milk samples from about 40 cows from each of 104 randomly selected Michigan dairy herds averaging >/=120 milking cows and 11,686 kg of milk/yr. Milk samples were analyzed for the presence of anti-BLV antibodies by ELISA, and herd- and lactation-specific estimates of BLV prevalence were computed to determine which were the most predictive of herd milk production, culling rate, and cow longevity (proportion of cows in their third or greater lactation). On this basis, the herd BLV index (an unweighted mean BLV prevalence rate for lactation number 1, 2, 3, and >/=4) was selected as the measure of BLV prevalence that was the most highly associated with BLV economic impact. Step-down multivariate analysis was used to determine the extent to which any of 19 herd-level management variables may have confounded the association of BLV index and measures of herd economic impact (milk production and cow longevity). The BLV index was not associated with the 12-mo culling rate, but was negatively associated in the final multivariable model with the proportion of cows that were >/=third lactation, and was negatively associated with herd milk production. In summary, increased prevalence of BLV within Michigan dairy herds was found to be associated with decreased herd milk production and decreased cow longevity. Our results provide evidence that BLV infection is associated with herd-level economic impacts in high-performing dairy herds.","['Erskine, R J', 'Bartlett, P C', 'Byrem, T M', 'Render, C L', 'Febvay, C', 'Houseman, J T']","['Erskine RJ', 'Bartlett PC', 'Byrem TM', 'Render CL', 'Febvay C', 'Houseman JT']","['Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824, USA. erskine@cvm.msu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Dairy Sci,Journal of dairy science,2985126R,2012/01/28 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2012/01/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-0302(12)00025-2 [pii]', '10.3168/jds.2011-4760 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dairy Sci. 2012 Feb;95(2):727-34. doi: 10.3168/jds.2011-4760.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 American Dairy Science Association.

The Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1) is reportedly overexpressed in >90% of patients with AML and thus can be useful for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of WT1 expression as a relapse predictor marker in patients with AML after SCT and compare it with flow cytometry (FC) and chimerism studies. WT1 expression was assessed retrospectively using quantitative RT-PCR in bone marrow and peripheral blood from 21 patients. Patients were classified according to WT1 dynamics posttransplantation. Eleven of the 21 patients had low and stable WT1 levels. All of these 11 patients showed complete chimerism and negative MRD by FC and remained in complete remission with a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 18-98 months). In contrast, 10 of 21 patients showed WT1 overexpression after SCT, and 9 of these 10 patients relapsed. The incidence of relapse differed significantly between the 2 groups of patients according to WT1 expression post-SCT (P = .00003). Relapse in the 9 patients occurred at a median of 314 days (range, 50-560 days). Interestingly, in these patients, relapse was first predicted by WT1 (with negative FC and complete chimerism) in 7 patients. WT1 overexpression was correlated with disease burden in patients with AML before and after allogeneic SCT. In patients who relapsed, both medullary and extramedullary relapse were better anticipated by WT1 overexpression compared with FC and chimerism.","['Kwon, Mi', 'Martinez-Laperche, Carolina', 'Infante, Maria', 'Carretero, Fernando', 'Balsalobre, Pascual', 'Serrano, David', 'Gayoso, Jorge', 'Perez-Corral, Ana', 'Anguita, Javier', 'Diez-Martin, Jose Luis', 'Buno, Ismael']","['Kwon M', 'Martinez-Laperche C', 'Infante M', 'Carretero F', 'Balsalobre P', 'Serrano D', 'Gayoso J', 'Perez-Corral A', 'Anguita J', 'Diez-Martin JL', 'Buno I']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain. mkwon.hgugm@salud.madrid.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,2012/01/28 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/01/28 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(12)00051-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.01.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Aug;18(8):1235-42. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.01.012.

Complete loss of ATM is another mechanism of failed DNA damage response and also associated with poorer prognosis in CLL. However, p53 dysfunction may arise through alternative mechanisms unrelated to structural aberrations (deletion and/or mutation) of TP53 or ATM, and thus be undetectable by traditional DNA-directed approaches (fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH], sequencing, karyotyping). In order to address the latter changes, and also to better understand the consequences of TP53/ATM aberrations, p53 functional assays have recently been developed. The purpose of dynamic assessment of p53 response in CLL is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of all mechanisms causing p53-deficient phenotype, including those unrelated to genomic aberrations of TP53 and ATM. The present review focuses on the current knowledge of p53 function assays in CLL, including important features such as technical issues, correlation with structural aberrations and clinical value.","['de Viron, Emeline', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Put, Natalie', 'Bontemps, Francoise', 'Van Den Neste, Eric']","['de Viron E', 'Michaux L', 'Put N', 'Bontemps F', 'Van Den Neste E']","['De Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/01/28 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/01/28 06:00'],"['2012/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.660630 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Aug;53(8):1445-51. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.660630.

However, it remains unknown whether AF and MS act directly on human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) to enhance nitric oxide (NO) synthesis through the stimulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression. To address this knowledge gap, this study investigated whether AF and MS directly regulate NO synthesis and attenuate adhesion factor expression induced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in HUVECs. The results revealed that both AF and MS (20 muM) treatments promoted increases in eNOS expression and decreases in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, and endothelin-1 mRNA and protein expression resulting from 12 h of TNF-alpha treatment. These effects are attributed to the ability of AF and MS to inhibit extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, thereby exerting antihypertensive activity.","['Hsu, Wei-Hsuan', 'Lee, Bao-Hong', 'Lu, I-Jen', 'Pan, Tzu-Ming']","['Hsu WH', 'Lee BH', 'Lu IJ', 'Pan TM']","['Department of Biochemical Science and Technology, College of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,2012/01/28 06:00,2012/06/20 06:00,['2012/01/28 06:00'],"['2012/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jf204327c [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2012 Feb 22;60(7):1666-72. doi: 10.1021/jf204327c.

We screened for molecules that might mediate the coupling of VEGF signal transduction with down-regulation of Notch signaling, and identified B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma6-associated zinc finger protein (BAZF). BAZF was induced by VEGF-A in ECs to bind to the Notch signaling factor C-promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1), and to promote the degradation of CBF1 through polyubiquitination in a CBF1-cullin3 (CUL3) E3 ligase complex. BAZF disruption in vivo decreased endothelial tip cell number and filopodia protrusion, and markedly abrogated vascular plexus formation in the mouse retina, overlapping the retinal phenotype seen in response to Notch activation. Further, impaired angiogenesis and capillary remodeling were observed in skin-wounded BAZF(-/-) mice.

The prevalence of this mechanism among essential chromosome instability (CIN) genes remains unclear. In a secondary screen for increased Rad52 foci in CIN mutants, representing approximately 25% of essential genes, we identified seven essential subunits of the mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation (mCP) machinery. Genome-wide analysis of fragile sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microarray (ChIP-chip) of phosphorylated H2A in these mutants supported a transcription-dependent mechanism of DNA damage characteristic of R loops. In parallel, we directly detected increased RNA:DNA hybrid formation in mCP mutants and demonstrated that CIN is suppressed by expression of the R-loop-degrading enzyme RNaseH. To investigate the conservation of CIN in mCP mutants, we focused on FIP1L1, the human ortholog of yeast FIP1, a conserved mCP component that is part of an oncogenic fusion in eosinophilic leukemia. We found that truncation fusions of yeast FIP1 analogous to those in cancer cause loss of function and that siRNA knockdown of FIP1L1 in human cells increases DNA damage and chromosome breakage. Our findings illuminate how mCP maintains genome integrity by suppressing R-loop formation and suggest that this function may be relevant to certain human cancers.","['Stirling, Peter C', 'Chan, Yujia A', 'Minaker, Sean W', 'Aristizabal, Maria J', 'Barrett, Irene', 'Sipahimalani, Payal', 'Kobor, Michael S', 'Hieter, Philip']","['Stirling PC', 'Chan YA', 'Minaker SW', 'Aristizabal MJ', 'Barrett I', 'Sipahimalani P', 'Kobor MS', 'Hieter P']","['Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,2012/01/27 06:00,2012/03/13 06:00,['2012/01/27 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['26/2/163 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.179721.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2012 Jan 15;26(2):163-75. doi: 10.1101/gad.179721.111.,,,"['0 (FIP1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)']",IM,"['Chromosome Fragile Sites', 'Genomic Instability/*genetics', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Replication Origin', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology/genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",,,"['R01 CA158162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']",PMC3273840,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, targeting of Mcl-1 or regulators of its expression may be a useful strategy for the treatment of AML.","['Glaser, Stefan P', 'Lee, Erinna F', 'Trounson, Evelyn', 'Bouillet, Philippe', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Fairlie, W Douglas', 'Izon, David J', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Rappaport, Amy R', 'Herold, Marco J', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Lowe, Scott W', 'Robb, Lorraine', 'Strasser, Andreas']","['Glaser SP', 'Lee EF', 'Trounson E', 'Bouillet P', 'Wei A', 'Fairlie WD', 'Izon DJ', 'Zuber J', 'Rappaport AR', 'Herold MJ', 'Alexander WS', 'Lowe SW', 'Robb L', 'Strasser A']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,2012/01/27 06:00,2012/03/13 06:00,['2012/01/27 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['26/2/120 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.182980.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2012 Jan 15;26(2):120-5. doi: 10.1101/gad.182980.111.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,"['R01 CA043540-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA043540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA080188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3273836,['Genes Dev. 2012 Feb 15;26(4):305-11.

METHODS: Psychological concerns were identified on measures according to predetermined criteria for 100 adolescent survivors. Referrals for psychological follow-up services were made for concerns previously unidentified in formal assessment or not adequately addressed by current services. RESULTS: Most survivors (82%) exhibited at least one concern across domains: behavioral (76%), cognitive (47%), and emotional (19%). Behavioral concerns emerged most often on scales associated with executive dysfunction, inattention, learning, and peer difficulties. Cranial radiation therapy was associated with cognitive concerns, chi(2) (1, N = 100) = 5.63, p < 0.05. Lower income was associated with more cognitive concerns for ALL survivors, t(47) = 3.28, p < 0.01, and more behavioral concerns for BT survivors, t(48) = 2.93, p < 0.01. Of the survivors with concerns, 38% were referred for psychological follow-up services. Lower-income ALL survivors received more referrals for follow-up, chi(2) (1, N = 41) = 8.05, p < 0.01. Referred survivors had more concerns across domains than non-referred survivors, ALL: t(39) = 2.96, p < 0.01; BT: t(39) = 3.52, p < 0.01. Trends suggest ALL survivors may be at risk for experiencing unaddressed cognitive needs. CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescent survivors of cancer experience psychological difficulties that are not adequately managed by current services, underscoring the need for long-term surveillance. In addition to prescribing regular psychological evaluations, clinicians should closely monitor whether current support services appropriately meet survivors' needs, particularly for lower-income survivors and those treated with cranial radiation therapy.","['Kahalley, Lisa S', 'Wilson, Stephanie J', 'Tyc, Vida L', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Stancel, Heather H', 'Hinds, Pamela S']","['Kahalley LS', 'Wilson SJ', 'Tyc VL', 'Conklin HM', 'Hudson MM', 'Wu S', 'Xiong X', 'Stancel HH', 'Hinds PS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. lskahall@texaschildrens.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,2012/01/27 06:00,2013/08/01 06:00,['2012/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3021 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2013 Feb;22(2):447-58. doi: 10.1002/pon.3021.

Interestingly, patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and LEOPARD syndrome frequently carry a second, somatically introduced subset of missense mutations in SHP-2. To determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which SHP-2 regulates heart development and, thus, understand how Noonan-associated mutations affect cardiogenesis, we introduced SHP-2 encoding the most prevalent Noonan syndrome and JMML mutations into Xenopus embryos. Resulting embryos show a direct relationship between a Noonan SHP-2 mutation and its ability to cause cardiac defects in Xenopus; embryos expressing Noonan SHP-2 mutations exhibit morphologically abnormal hearts, whereas those expressing an SHP-2 JMML-associated mutation do not. Our studies indicate that the cardiac defects associated with the introduction of the Noonan-associated SHP-2 mutations are coupled with a delay or arrest of the cardiac cell cycle in M-phase and a failure of cardiomyocyte progenitors to incorporate into the developing heart. We show that these defects are a result of an underlying malformation in the formation and polarity of cardiac actin fibers and F-actin deposition. We show that these defects can be rescued in culture and in embryos through the inhibition of the Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK), thus demonstrating a direct relationship between SHP-2(N308D) and ROCK activation in the developing heart.","['Langdon, Yvette', 'Tandon, Panna', 'Paden, Erika', 'Duddy, Jennifer', 'Taylor, Joan M', 'Conlon, Frank L']","['Langdon Y', 'Tandon P', 'Paden E', 'Duddy J', 'Taylor JM', 'Conlon FL']","['University of North Carolina McAllister Heart Institute, UNC-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3280, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,2012/01/27 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/01/27 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.067579 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.067579 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2012 Mar;139(5):948-57. doi: 10.1242/dev.067579.

In most of the classic Philadelphia-negative MPNs-polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and MPN-associated myelofibrosis (MPN-MF)-oncogenic mutations affecting JAK2 or MPL lead to constitutive activation of cytokine-regulated intracellular signalling pathways. The traditional therapy for PV and ET is the prevention of thrombotic events with antiproliferative agents in association with aspirin. New drugs such as pegylated interferon and anti-JAK agents are candidates for slowing the evolution to myelofibrosis or leukemia. Conventional therapy for MPN-MF is driven by clinical needs, primarily anemia and splenomegaly. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are new candidates for treating anemia. JAK2 ATP-competitive inhibitors or drugs that indirectly inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway, like RAD001, are the new candidates for splenomegaly in MPN-MF, but in spite of their strong rationale, they have shown only a palliative benefit.

In 22Rv1 cells, constitutively active STAT3 and ERK are targeted by sorafenib, contrasting with PC3 cells, in which these kinases are not active. Notably, overexpression of a constitutively active MEK construct in 22Rv1 cells stimulates the sustained phosphorylation of Bad and protects from sorafenib-induced cell death. In PC3 cells, Src and AKT are constitutively activated and targeted by sorafenib, leading to an increase in Bim protein levels. Overexpression of constitutively active AKT or knockdown of Bim protects PC3 cells from sorafenib-induced killing. In both PC3 and 22Rv1 cells, Mcl-1 depletion is required for the induction of cell death by sorafenib as transient overexpression of Mcl-1 is protective. Interestingly, co-culturing of primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with 22Rv1 or PC3 cells protected the cancer cells from sorafenib-induced cell death, and this protection was largely overcome by co-administration of the Bcl-2 antagonist, ABT737. In summary, the differential tyrosine kinase profile of prostate cancer cells defines the cytotoxic efficacy of sorafenib and this profile is modulated by CAFs to promote resistance. The combination of sorafenib with Bcl-2 antagonists, such as ABT737, may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy against prostate cancer.","['Kharaziha, P', 'Rodriguez, P', 'Li, Q', 'Rundqvist, H', 'Bjorklund, A-C', 'Augsten, M', 'Ullen, A', 'Egevad, L', 'Wiklund, P', 'Nilsson, S', 'Kroemer, G', 'Grander, D', 'Panaretakis, T']","['Kharaziha P', 'Rodriguez P', 'Li Q', 'Rundqvist H', 'Bjorklund AC', 'Augsten M', 'Ullen A', 'Egevad L', 'Wiklund P', 'Nilsson S', 'Kroemer G', 'Grander D', 'Panaretakis T']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Cancer Centrum Karolinska, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,2012/01/27 06:00,2012/07/25 06:00,['2012/01/27 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis20121 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.1 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Jan 26;3:e262. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.1.,,20120126,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Sorafenib']",,,,PMC3270278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 mainly causes adult T cell leukemia, while HTLV-2 is not associated with leukemia. In vitro, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 predominantly transform CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, respectively: the genetic determinant maps to the viral envelope. Herein, we investigate whether this transformation tropism occurs during initial infection or subsequently during the cellular transformation process. Since most individuals are chronically infected at the time of detection, we utilized an established rabbit model to longitudinally measure the early HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection and replication kinetics in purified CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 were detected in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells within 1 week postinoculation. In HTLV-1-infected rabbit CD4(+) T cells, proviral burden and tax/rex mRNA expression peaked early, and expression levels were directly proportional to each other. The late expression of the antisense transcript (Hbz or Aph-2) correlated directly with a late proviral burden peak in HTLV-1- or HTLV-2-infected rabbit CD8(+) T cells, respectively. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that these viruses do not exhibit cellular preference during initial infection. We further evaluated the transformation tropism of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 over a 9-week period using in vitro cell growth/immortalization assays. At the early weeks, both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 showed proportionate growth of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.

The present study demonstrated for the first time that Cav-1 regulates Mcl-1 through protein-protein interaction and inhibits its downregulation during cell anoikis in human lung cancer cells. Immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry studies showed that Cav-1 interacted with Mcl-1 and prevented it from degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Mcl-1 and Mcl-1-Cav-1 complex were highly elevated in Cav-1-overexpressing cells but were greatly reduced in Cav-1 knockdown cells. Consistent with this finding, we found that Mcl-1 ubiquitination was significantly attenuated by Cav-1 overexpression but increased by Cav-1 knockdown. Together, our results indicate a novel role of Cav-1 in anoikis regulation through Mcl-1 interaction and stabilization, which provides a new insight to the pathogenesis of metastatic lung cancer and its potential treatment.","['Chunhacha, Preedakorn', 'Pongrakhananon, Varisa', 'Rojanasakul, Yon', 'Chanvorachote, Pithi']","['Chunhacha P', 'Pongrakhananon V', 'Rojanasakul Y', 'Chanvorachote P']","['Pharmaceutical Technology (International) Program, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of self-reported household use of pesticides and potential differences in reliability by case-control status, and by socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS: Analyses are based on a subset of the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study population. Eligible households included those with children less than 8 years old who lived in the same residence since diagnosis (reference date for controls). The reliability was based on two repeated in-person interviews. Kappa, percent positive and negative agreements were used to assess reliability of responses to ever/never use of six pesticides categories. RESULTS: Kappa statistics ranged from 0.31 to 0.61 (fair to substantial agreement), with 9 out of the 12 tests indicating moderate agreement. The percent positive agreement ranged from 46 to 80% and the percent negative agreement from 54 to 95%. Reliability for all pesticide types as assessed by the three reliability measures did not differ significantly for cases and controls as confirmed by bootstrap analysis. For most pesticide types, Kappa and percent positive agreement were higher for non-Hispanics than Hispanics and for households with higher income vs. lower income. CONCLUSIONS: Reproducibility of maternal-reported pesticide use was moderate to high and was similar among cases and controls suggesting that differential recall is not likely to be a major source of bias.","['Slusky, Danna A', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Aldrich, Melinda C', 'Ward, Mary H', 'Lea, C Suzanne', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Slusky DA', 'Metayer C', 'Aldrich MC', 'Ward MH', 'Lea CS', 'Selvin S', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94704, USA. dannaaharon@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,2012/01/27 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(12)00002-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2011.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2012 Aug;36(4):375-80. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2011.12.009.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the significance of IgG(4) antibodies to ovalbumin (OVA) and ovomucoid (OVM) in egg-allergic children. METHODS: One hundred seven egg-allergic children (mean age 6.9 years; range 1.6-18.6 years) were challenged to baked egg. The outcomes of the challenges were related to the level of specific IgE and IgG(4) to OVM and OVA, component IgE/IgG(4) ratios, and mediator release in a functional assay based on the rat basophil leukemia cell line. RESULTS: Baked egg-reactive children had significantly higher OVA and OVM ratios of IgE/IgG(4) and mediator release in the rat basophil leukemia-based assay than did tolerant children (P < .05 for both). The OVA- and OVM-specific IgE/IgG(4) ratios and mediator release were correlated. In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the areas under the curve for a logistic regression model including specific IgE and IgG(4) to OVA and OVM were significantly greater compared with the areas under the curve for egg white-specific IgE and OVM-specific IgE. CONCLUSIONS: The balance between IgE and IgG(4) to OVA and OVM has functional consequences. A model that includes the interactions between IgE and IgG(4) to OVA and OVM accurately predicts reactivity to baked egg and warrants further investigation.","['Caubet, Jean Christoph', 'Bencharitiwong, Ramon', 'Moshier, Erin', 'Godbold, James H', 'Sampson, Hugh A', 'Nowak-Wegrzyn, Anna']","['Caubet JC', 'Bencharitiwong R', 'Moshier E', 'Godbold JH', 'Sampson HA', 'Nowak-Wegrzyn A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Allergy and Immunology, Jaffe Food Allergy Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10028, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,2012/01/27 06:00,2012/07/07 06:00,['2012/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0091-6749(11)02932-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2011.11.053 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2012 Mar;129(3):739-47. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2011.11.053.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: we performed a retrospective study on nonrandomized consecutive cases. The lot analysis included 1315 oncological patients admitted in the Emergency Department of the Clinical Emergency Hospital ""St. Spiridon"" Iasi, in the period June 1st, 2009 - May 31st, 2010. 23.12% of the patients had high suspicion of neoplasia at the first visit to the ED. RESULTS: 67.07% of patients were in metastatic stage disease located as follows: liver metastasis 37.59%, lung metastasis 18.36%, lymph node metastasis 13, 29%. After processing the data there were found statistically significant correlations between the age of patients and the documented/suspected diagnosis of neoplasia (p = 0.01) in the sense that a neoplasia diagnosis in emergency was more frequent in people of young age. It should be mentioned that other studies rarely mention first diagnosis of neoplasia in emergency department with presence of complications. CONCLUSION: 1315 oncological patients presented in ED, almost a quarter of which presented high suspicion of neoplasia (still without histopathological confirmation) when in ED (23.12%). Most of them were aged male patients (over 65 years old), with tumors of the digestive system. A significant proportion (almost 60%) of these patients ended up in emergency due to complications and the therapy intended life support and pain management. Some of these patients were directed to further exploring and emergency outpatient therapy while 75% of patients were hospitalized after stabilization. Although we expected that the frequency of complications to be higher in patients previously diagnosed with cancer, data analysis showed no statistically significant differences (p = NS) between the rate of complications in patients previously diagnosed with neoplasia and those with high-suspicion neoplasia first diagnosed in the ED.","['Cimpoesu, Diana', 'Dumea, Mihaela', 'Durchi, Simona', 'Apostoae, F', 'Olaru, G', 'Ciolan, Mioara', 'Popa, O', 'Corlade-Andrei, Mihaela']","['Cimpoesu D', 'Dumea M', 'Durchi S', 'Apostoae F', 'Olaru G', 'Ciolan M', 'Popa O', 'Corlade-Andrei M']","['Facultatea de Medicina, Disciplina Medicina de Urgenta, Universitatea de Medicina si Farmacie ""Gr.

However, its role in the regulation of PCa cell growth and survival has not been well characterized. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using experimental models that closely mimic clinical pathophysiology of PCa progression, we demonstrated that PDGF is a survival factor in PCa cells through upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). PDGF treatment induced rapid nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, presumably mediated by c-Abl and p68 signaling. Intriguingly, PDGF promoted formation of a nuclear transcriptional complex consisting of beta-catenin and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, and its binding to Mcl-1 promoter. Deletion of a putative hypoxia response element (HRE) within the Mcl-1 promoter attenuated PDGF effects on Mcl-1 expression. Blockade of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) signaling with a pharmacological inhibitor AG-17 abrogated PDGF induction of Mcl-1, and induced apoptosis in metastatic PCa cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study elucidated a crucial survival mechanism in PCa cells, indicating that interruption of the PDGF-Mcl-1 survival signal may provide a novel strategy for treating PCa metastasis.","['Iqbal, Shareen', 'Zhang, Shumin', 'Driss, Adel', 'Liu, Zhi-Ren', 'Kim, Hyeong-Reh Choi', 'Wang, Yanru', 'Ritenour, Chad', 'Zhau, Haiyen E', 'Kucuk, Omer', 'Chung, Leland W K', 'Wu, Daqing']","['Iqbal S', 'Zhang S', 'Driss A', 'Liu ZR', 'Kim HR', 'Wang Y', 'Ritenour C', 'Zhau HE', 'Kucuk O', 'Chung LW', 'Wu D']","['Department of Urology and Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030764 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-11411 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30764. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030764.

Recently, this notion was challenged by reports that showed a broader differentiation potential of neural stem cells, in vitro and in vivo, although the molecular mechanisms that regulate plasticity of neural stem cells are unknown. Here, we report that neural stem cells derived from mouse embryonic cortex respond to Lif and serum in vitro and undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated dedifferentiation process within 48 h, together with transient upregulation of pluripotency markers and, more notably, upregulation of mesendoderm genes, Brachyury (T) and Sox17. These induced putative mesendoderm cells were injected into early gastrulating chick embryos, which revealed that they integrated more efficiently into mesoderm and endoderm lineages compared to non-induced cells. We also found that TGFbeta and Jak/Stat pathways are necessary but not sufficient for the induction of mesendodermal phenotype in neural stem cells. These results provide insights into the regulation of plasticity of neural stem cells through EMT. Dissecting the regulatory pathways involved in these processes may help to gain control over cell fate decisions.","['Ber, Suzan', 'Lee, Caroline', 'Voiculescu, Octavian', 'Surani, M Azim']","['Ber S', 'Lee C', 'Voiculescu O', 'Surani MA']","['Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute of Cancer and Developmental Biology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom. sb681@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030759 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-07407 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30759. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030759.

However, they are also the shortest lived cell in the blood with a lifespan in the circulation of 5.4 days. The mechanisms underlying their short lifespan and spontaneous entry into apoptosis are poorly understood. Recently, the broad range cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor R-roscovitine was shown to increase neutrophil apoptosis, implicating CDKs in the regulation of neutrophil lifespan. To determine which CDKs were involved in regulating neutrophil lifespan we first examined CDK expression in human neutrophils and found that only three CDKs: CDK5, CDK7 and CDK9 were expressed in these cells. The use of CDK inhibitors with differing selectivity towards the various CDKs suggested that CDK9 activity regulates neutrophil lifespan. Furthermore CDK9 activity and the expression of its activating partner cyclin T1 both declined as neutrophils aged and entered apoptosis spontaneously. CDK9 is a component of the P-TEFb complex involved in transcriptional regulation and its inhibition will preferentially affect proteins with short half-lives. Treatment of neutrophils with flavopiridol, a potent CDK9 inhibitor, increased apoptosis and caused a rapid decline in the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, whilst Bcl2A was unaffected. We propose that CDK9 activity is a key regulator of neutrophil lifespan, preventing apoptosis by maintaining levels of short lived anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1. Furthermore, as inappropriate inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis contributes to chronic inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, CDK9 represents a novel therapeutic target in such diseases.","['Wang, Keqing', 'Hampson, Peter', 'Hazeldine, Jon', 'Krystof, Vladimir', 'Strnad, Miroslav', 'Pechan, Paul', 'M, Janet']","['Wang K', 'Hampson P', 'Hazeldine J', 'Krystof V', 'Strnad M', 'Pechan P', 'M J']","['MRC Centre for Immune Regulation, Institute of Biomedical Research, Birmingham University Medical School, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030128 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-15312 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30128. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030128.

The aim of this study was to explore a novel ""smart"" pH-responsive drug delivery system (DDS) based on titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) nanoparticles for its potential in enabling more intelligent controlled release and enhancing chemotherapeutic efficiency of DNR. DNR was loaded onto TiO(2) nanoparticles by forming complexes with transition metal titanium to construct DNR-TiO(2) nanocomposites as a DDS. DNR was released from the DDS much more rapidly at pH 5.0 and 6.0 than at pH 7.4, which is a desirable characteristic for tumor-targeted drug delivery. DNR-TiO(2) nanocomposites induced remarkable improvement in anticancer activity, as demonstrated by flow cytometry, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and nuclear 4',6-diamidino- 2-phenylindole staining. Furthermore, the possible signaling pathway was explored by western blot. For instance, in human leukemia K562 cells, it was demonstrated that DNR-TiO(2) nanocomposites increase intracellular concentration of DNR and enhance its anticancer efficiency by inducing apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner, indicating that DNR-TiO(2) nanocomposites could act as an efficient DDS importing DNR into target cancer cells. These findings suggest that ""smart"" DNR delivery strategy is a promising approach to cancer therapy.","['Zhang, Haijun', 'Wang, Cailian', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Wang, Xuemei']","['Zhang H', 'Wang C', 'Chen B', 'Wang X']","[""Department of Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S27722 [doi]', 'ijn-7-235 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2012;7:235-42. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S27722.

Because of the relative narrow therapeutic index of thiopurines serious or life threatening side effects can occur. A total of 28 variant alleles of the gene coding for the thiopurine s-methyltransferase enzyme are responsible for altered catalytic activity of the enzyme. Patients with one non-functional (heterozygous) allele have intermediate, while those with two non-functional (homozygous) alleles have low enzyme activity. Using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct DNA sequencing the authors determined the G238C, G460A and A719G polymorphisms of the thiopurine s-methyltransferase gene in a child with Crohn's disease who developed thiopurine-induced severe agranulocytosis. The presence of the G460A and A719G polymorphic alleles in homozygous forms were detected which corresponded to the *3A variant allele. This variant has been shown to be associated with lower enzyme activity and low amount of the enzyme resulting in thiopurine toxicity and agranulocytosis.

It is still unknown whether HIF1alpha has a role in survival regulation of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Using a mouse model of CML, here we report that HIF1alpha plays a crucial role in survival maintenance of LSCs. Deletion of HIF1alpha impairs the propagation of CML through impairing cell-cycle progression and inducing apoptosis of LSCs. Deletion of HIF1alpha results in elevated expression of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) in LSCs, and knockdown of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) rescues the defective colony-forming ability of HIF1alpha(-/-) LSCs. Compared with normal HSCs, LSCs appear to be more dependent on the HIF1alpha pathway. Together, these results demonstrate that HIF1alpha represents a critical pathway in LSCs and inhibition of the HIF1alpha pathway provides a therapeutic strategy for eradicating LSCs in CML.","['Zhang, Haojian', 'Li, Huawei', 'Xi, Hualin S', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Zhang H', 'Li H', 'Xi HS', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45944-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-387381 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 15;119(11):2595-607. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-387381.

The parsimony of the solutions obtained by variable selection is usually counterbalanced by a limited prediction capacity. On the other hand, methodologies that assure high prediction accuracy usually lead to models that are neither simple nor easily interpretable. Regularization methodologies have proven to be useful in addressing both prediction and variable selection problems. The Bayesian approach to regularization constitutes a particularly attractive alternative as it is suitable for high-dimensional modeling, offers valid standard errors, and enables simultaneous estimation of regression coefficients and complexity parameters via computationally efficient MCMC techniques. Bayesian regularization falls within the versatile framework of Bayesian hierarchical models, which encompasses a variety of other approaches suited for variable selection such as spike and slab models and the MC(3) approach. In this article, we review these Bayesian developments and evaluate their variable selection performance in a simulation study for the classical small p large n setting. The majority of the existing Bayesian methodology for variable selection deals only with classical linear regression. Here, we present two applications in the contexts of binary and survival regression, where the Bayesian approach was applied to select markers prognostically relevant for the development of rheumatoid arthritis and for overall survival in acute myeloid leukemia patients.","['Rockova, Veronika', 'Lesaffre, Emmanuel', 'Luime, Jolanda', 'Lowenberg, Bob']","['Rockova V', 'Lesaffre E', 'Luime J', 'Lowenberg B']","['Department of Biostatistics, Erasmus MC Rotterdam, The Netherlands. v.rockova@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/09/28 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.4439 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2012 May 20;31(11-12):1221-37. doi: 10.1002/sim.4439.

METHODS: Thirty patients (19 boys and 11 girls) with aplastic anemia received antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine. Twenty-two patients had severe and 8 had very severe aplastic anemia. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 9.19 +/- 2.56 y. Three patients died within 1 mo of therapy, two due to sepsis and one due to intracranial hemorrhage. Twenty-seven patients were analyzed for response to therapy. Eight patients (29.7%) responded at 3 mo: 3 complete response (CR) and 5 partial response (PR). Six mo after the therapy, overall response (OR) was seen in 9/27 (33.3%), with one more patient in no response group achieving partial response. At 1 year, patients in CR maintained their status and 1 patient in PR group relapsed. He again achieved partial response with repeat course of ATG. Responders had significantly shorter duration of illness and higher absolute neutrophil count as compared to non responders to IST. None of the patients developed acute leukemia in the follow up.

During his intense and unpredictable course, the caregiver's burden is complex and complicated by multiple competing priorities. Because caregivers are often faced with multiple concurrent stressful events and extended, unrelenting stress, they may experience negative health effects, mediated in part by immune and autonomic dysregulation.

This report describes a case that exemplifies caregiving burden and discusses the importance of identifying caregivers at risk of negative health outcomes and intervening to attenuate the stress associated with the caregiving experience.","['Bevans, Margaret', 'Sternberg, Esther M']","['Bevans M', 'Sternberg EM']","['US Public Health Service, Nursing Research & Translational Science, Nursing & Patient Care Services, Health Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. mbevans@cc.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Conference', 'Journal Article']",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['307/4/398 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2012.29 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2012 Jan 25;307(4):398-403. doi: 10.1001/jama.2012.29.,,,,IM,"['Caregivers/*psychology', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/nursing/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*nursing', 'Quality of Life', '*Stress, Psychological']",,,['Z01 CL001148-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3304539,,,['NIHMS355747'],,,,,,,,,,,

Recently the anticancer activity of GA became the focus of scientific interest and many GA derivatives were developed as anti-tumor lead compounds. We previously reported that AEGA, a GA derivative, has proliferation inhibition and apoptosis-inducing activity in various human tumor cells. The present study was undertaken to further investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in AEGA-induced apoptosis in human leukemia K562 cells. AEGA can inhibit the growth of K562 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners determined by the MTT assay. Induction of apoptosis was evidenced by morphological changes and biochemical markers such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and DNA ladder formation. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that AEGA induced apoptosis through the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, the accumulation of the cytosolic cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The apoptosis induction by AEGA was associated with the alteration in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein expression. These results suggest that AEGA may induce apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated pathway, and might have the therapeutic value against hematological malignancies.","['Gao, Zhenbei', 'Kang, Xiao', 'Hu, Jun', 'Ju, Yong', 'Xu, Chuanlian']","['Gao Z', 'Kang X', 'Hu J', 'Ju Y', 'Xu C']","['The Laboratory of Proteomics and Molecular Enzymology, College of Life Science, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Xiasha Higher Education Zone, Hangzhou, 310018, Zhejiang Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/01/26 06:01,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10616-011-9419-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 2012 Aug;64(4):421-8. doi: 10.1007/s10616-011-9419-9.

A cancer network involving PER2 raises the possibility that some tumour suppressors are directly involved in the mammalian clock. Here, we show that the tumour suppressor promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein is a circadian clock regulator and can physically interact with PER2. In the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), PML expression and PML-PER2 interaction are under clock control. Loss of PML disrupts and dampens the expression of clock regulators Per2, Per1, Cry1, Bmal1 and Npas2. In the presence of PML and PER2, BMAL1/CLOCK-mediated transcription is enhanced. In Pml(-/-) SCN and mouse embryo fibroblast cells, the cellular distribution of PER2 is primarily perinuclear/cytoplasmic. PML is acetylated at K487 and its deacetylation by SIRT1 promotes PML control of PER2 nuclear localization. The circadian period of Pml(-/-) mice displays reduced precision and stability consistent with PML having a role in the mammalian clock mechanism.","['Miki, Takao', 'Xu, Zhixiang', 'Chen-Goodspeed, Misty', 'Liu, Mingguang', 'Van Oort-Jansen, Anita', 'Rea, Michael A', 'Zhao, Zhaoyang', 'Lee, Cheng Chi', 'Chang, Kun-Sang']","['Miki T', 'Xu Z', 'Chen-Goodspeed M', 'Liu M', 'Van Oort-Jansen A', 'Rea MA', 'Zhao Z', 'Lee CC', 'Chang KS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center-Houston, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/07/20 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj20121 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2012.1 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2012 Mar 21;31(6):1427-39. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2012.1.

CD33 is an attractive immunotarget on the surface of tumor cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The PSCA is a potential target on prostate cancer cells. Flanking the reading frame encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) with a recently described novel helical linker element allowed us to establish novel single-chain bispecific fusion antibodies.

Since then, research has proven that it has utility on a number of tumors resistant to chemotherapy. Hematologic malignancy, however, often involves lesser differentiated cells, which have a high potential to modulate their intrinsic machinery and thereby activate alternative rescue pathways. A corresponding multiplicity of therapies is not always practical. One approach to conditions with heterogeneous physiology is to identify key biochemical mediators, thereby reducing the number of treatment targets. Results from several ongoing studies indicate convergence of genomically diverse signal pathways to a limited number of key downstream regulators of apoptosis. Convergence of pathways can be exploited to address the problem of genetic heterogeneity in acute leukemia: this would mean treating multiple molecular aberrations with fewer drugs and enhanced therapeutic benefit.","['Lambrou, George I', 'Papadimitriou, Lina', 'Chrousos, George P', 'Vlahopoulos, Spiros A']","['Lambrou GI', 'Papadimitriou L', 'Chrousos GP', 'Vlahopoulos SA']","['Horemio Research Institute, First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens Medical School, ""Aghia Sophia"" Children\'s Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0303-7207(12)00007-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2012 Apr 4;351(2):142-51. doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.003.

CFC Gene Therapy (CFCGT) offers the possibility of establishing control over gene-modified cells (GMCs) with regards to their proliferation, differentiation, or function. However, enzymes commonly employed in these approaches often possess poor kinetics and high immunogenicity. We describe a novel CFCGT system based on engineered variants of human deoxyCytidine Kinase (dCK) that overcomes limitations of current modalities. Mutants of dCK with rationally designed active sites that make them thymidine-activating were stably introduced into cells by recombinant lentiviral vectors (LVs). Transduced cells maintained growth kinetics and function. These dCK mutants efficiently activate bromovinyl-deoxyuridine (BVdU), L-deoxythymidine (LdT), and L-deoxyuridine (LdU), which are otherwise not toxic to wild-type cells. We show that mutant dCK-expressing Jurkat, Molt-4, and U87mg cells could be efficiently eliminated in vitro and in xenogeneic leukemia and tumor models in vivo. We also describe a fusion construct of the thymidine-activating dCK to the cytoplasmic tail-truncated LNGFR molecule and applications to in vivo eradication of primary human T cells. This novel CFCGT system offers unique plasticity with respect to the wide range of prodrugs it can potentiate, and can be used as a reliable safety switch in cell and gene therapy.","['Neschadim, Anton', 'Wang, James C M', 'Sato, Takeya', 'Fowler, Daniel H', 'Lavie, Arnon', 'Medin, Jeffrey A']","['Neschadim A', 'Wang JC', 'Sato T', 'Fowler DH', 'Lavie A', 'Medin JA']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,2012/01/26 06:00,2013/02/21 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)31940-2 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2011.298 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2012 May;20(5):1002-13. doi: 10.1038/mt.2011.298.

The management of CML has undergone major changes over the past decade. Novel treatment approaches have had a dramatic impact on patient outcomes and survival. Nevertheless, these outcomes can only be achieved in the context of expert management, careful monitoring of disease response, appropriate management of adverse events and timeous adjustments to therapy when responses are not achieved within stated time-frames. AIM: With the advent of novel treatments providing molecular responses, both the monitoring and management of CML have become more complicated. The aim of these recommendations was to provide a pragmatic yet comprehensive roadmap to negotiate these complexities. METHODS: Recommendations were developed based on local expert opinion from both the academic and private medical care arenas after careful review of the relevant literature and taking into account the most widely used international guidelines.

Careful attention was given to circumstances unique to South Africa, funding constraints, availability and access to laboratory resources, as well as the effects of concurrent HIV infection. CONCLUSION: Most patients with CML can live a reasonably normal life if their disease is appropriately managed. These recommendations should be of value to all specialists involved in the treatment of haematological disorders.","['Louw, V J', 'Dreosti, L', 'Ruff, P', 'Jogessar, V', 'Moodley, D', 'Novitzky, N', 'Patel, M', 'Schmidt, A', 'Willem, P']","['Louw VJ', 'Dreosti L', 'Ruff P', 'Jogessar V', 'Moodley D', 'Novitzky N', 'Patel M', 'Schmidt A', 'Willem P']","['Division of Clinical Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein. louwvj@ufs.ac.za']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,S Afr Med J. 2011 Nov 1;101(11):840-6.,,20111101,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Comorbidity', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease Management', 'HIV Infections/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'South Africa', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,"['S Afr Med J. 2012 Feb;102(2):97', 'S Afr Med J. 2012 Jan;102(1 Pt 1):10']",,,,,

However, speciation of arsenicals in bone marrow (BM) has not yet been performed. Profiles of arsenic speciation in plasma of BM were thus investigated and compared with those of PB plasma from a relapsed APL patient. The total arsenic concentrations in high molecular weight fraction (HMW-F) of BM and PB plasma were also determined. METHODS: Response assessment was evaluated by BM aspirate examination and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The analyses of total arsenic concentrations and speciation were preformed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/ICP-MS, respectively. RESULTS: Response assessment showed that the patient achieved complete remission. The total arsenic concentrations in BM plasma increased with time during the consecutive administration. The PB plasma concentrations of methylated arsenic metabolites substantially increased after the start of administration, while those of inorganic arsenic were still kept at a low level, followed by substantially increase from day-14 after administration. The arsenic speciation profiles of PB plasma were very similar to those of BM plasma. Furthermore, the total arsenic concentrations of HMW-F in BM plasma were much higher than those in PB plasma. CONCLUSIONS: The behaviors of arsenic speciation suggested for the first time that arsenic speciation analysis of PB plasma could be predicative for BM speciation, and showed relatively higher efficiency of drug metabolism in the patient. These results may further provide not only significance of clinical application of ATO, but also a new insight into host defense mechanisms in APL patients undergoing ATO treatment, since HMW proteins-bound arsenic complex could be thought to protect BM from the attack of free arsenic species.","['Iriyama, Noriyoshi', 'Yoshino, Yuta', 'Yuan, Bo', 'Horikoshi, Akira', 'Hirabayashi, Yukio', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Toyoda, Hiroo', 'Takeuchi, Jin']","['Iriyama N', 'Yoshino Y', 'Yuan B', 'Horikoshi A', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Hatta Y', 'Toyoda H', 'Takeuchi J']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/07/20 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-5-1 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-5-1 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2012 Jan 24;5:1. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-5-1.,,20120124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oxides/*blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Tissue Distribution']",,,,PMC3293031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there are a number of clinical and molecular markers known to be predictive of prognosis in CLL that can be applied to discriminate patients that are more likely to develop a progressive disease. Gene-expression profiling studies have identified genes with differential expression between prognostic subgroups in CLL, and research on these RNA-based prognostic markers has expanded during recent years. For example, high lipoprotein lipase and CLLU1 mRNA expression have recently been shown to be strong markers of poor clinical outcome. In this review we will provide a summary of the most significant prognostic markers in CLL, focusing on the recent category of RNA-based markers in particular.","['Sevov, Marie', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Mansouri, Larry']","['Sevov M', 'Rosenquist R', 'Mansouri L']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Rudbeck Laboratory, 75185 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/ehm.11.80 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2012 Feb;5(1):69-79. doi: 10.1586/ehm.11.80.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the improved results with purine analogs +/- cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) the disease remains incurable, and patients with CLL are destined to relapse after primary treatment. The prior therapy administered and the response, and duration of response to that therapy, are among the most important factors in determining the next therapy. Bendamustine, a bifunctional alkylating agent, combined with rituximab (BR) has been tested in patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL in order to investigate the safety and efficacy of this combination. In conclusion, chemoimmunotherapy with BR showed interesting results, with the exception of patients carrying del(17p).

To this end, the expression of CD10 was evaluated in the kidney of two human fetus and in three newborns. In both fetuses, immunostaining for CD10 was compartmentalized and mainly concentrated in the mid-deep cortex. Reactivity for CD10 was stronger in the glomerular epithelium, in proximal tubules and in metanephric mesenchymal cells. At 25 weeks of gestation, CD10 was also detected in the subcapsular regions, including some pretubular aggregates of cap mesenchymal cells and renal vesicles. At 34 weeks of gestation, we observed an increased immunoreactivity for CD10 in visceral and parietal glomerular epithelium. At 39 weeks of gestation, CD10 was also expressed in the collecting tubules and in the Henle loops. Our data show a strong expression of CD10 in all stage of human kidney development, characterized by dynamic changes and support the hypothesis that CD10 plays a relevant role in renal embryogenesis.","['Faa, G', 'Gerosa, C', 'Fanni, D', 'Nemolato, S', 'Marinelli, V', 'Locci, A', 'Senes, G', 'Mais, V', 'Van Eyken, P', 'Iacovidou, N', 'Monga, G', 'Fanos, V']","['Faa G', 'Gerosa C', 'Fanni D', 'Nemolato S', 'Marinelli V', 'Locci A', 'Senes G', 'Mais V', 'Van Eyken P', 'Iacovidou N', 'Monga G', 'Fanos V']","['Department of Pathology, Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",101136916,2012/01/26 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/01/26 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/14767058.2011.599457 [doi]'],ppublish,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2012 Jul;25(7):904-11. doi: 10.3109/14767058.2011.599457.

Malignant lymphoma (lymphosarcoma) is thought to be uncommon in F344 rats. The authors encountered malignant lymphomas of the non-LGL leukemia type with characteristic pathologic features in WBN/Kob rats. The mean age at onset of the disease in all 13 affected rats (8 males and 5 females) was about 60 weeks. Common and characteristic clinical signs were abnormal gait with hind limb paralysis. Macroscopically, the enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen and liver was slight to moderate. Scattered multiple white-to-gray nodules encompassed the aorta and assumed a bead-like appearance near the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Histopathologically, neoplastic proliferative changes were predominant in the bone marrow tissue of the entire body, and many tumor cells infiltrated the spleen and several lymph nodes. The most striking histological features were constant and severe infiltration of tumor cells in the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle adjacent the thoracic and lumber vertebrae. Immunohistochemically, all tumor cells were positive for B-cell markers (PAX-5, CD79a and CD45) and negative for CD3. From the results of immunohistochemistry and morphological examination, these tumors were diagnosed as malignant B-cell lymphomas.","['Sano, Tomoya', 'Ozaki, Kiyokazu', 'Kodama, Yasushi', 'Matsuura, Tetsuro', 'Narama, Isao']","['Sano T', 'Ozaki K', 'Kodama Y', 'Matsuura T', 'Narama I']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Toxicol Pathol,Journal of toxicologic pathology,9306408,2009/09/01 00:00,2009/09/01 00:01,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2009/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1293/tox.22.173 [doi]', '0529 [pii]']",ppublish,J Toxicol Pathol. 2009 Sep;22(3):173-8. doi: 10.1293/tox.22.173.

Despite preclinical evidence indicating a risk of prolongation of the QT interval, which was confirmed in clinical trials, detailed information on nilotinib's cardiac safety profile is lacking. DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, we retrospectively assessed cardiovascular risk factors in 81 patients who were being or had previously been treated with nilotinib therapy and evaluated cardiovascular parameters by longitudinal monitoring of the QT interval and left ventricular ejection fraction. Detailed information on the occurrence and management of defined cardiac adverse events was extracted. RESULTS: The median duration of nilotinib therapy was 26 months (range, 1-72). The median QT interval at baseline was 413 msec (range, 368-499 msec). During follow-up, the median QT was not significantly different from the baseline value at any time-point. Sixteen of 81 patients (20%) had new electrocardiographic changes. Cardiac function, as assessed by measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction, did not change significantly from baseline at any time-point. During a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 2-73), seven patients (9%), all of whom had received prior imatinib therapy, developed 11 clinical cardiac adverse events requiring treatment. The median time from the start of nilotinib therapy to an event was 14.5 months (range, 2-68). Five of seven patients were able to continue nilotinib therapy with only one brief interruption. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas new electrocardiographic abnormalities were recorded in 20% of all patients and some of them developed severe or even life-threatening coronary artery disease, QT prolongation, changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, and clinical cardiac adverse events were uncommon in patients treated with nilotinib.","['Kim, Theo D', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Schwarz, Michaela', 'Grille, Peggy', 'Levitin, Michal', 'Fateh-Moghadam, Suzanne', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Haverkamp, Wilhelm', 'Kohncke, Clemens']","['Kim TD', 'le Coutre P', 'Schwarz M', 'Grille P', 'Levitin M', 'Fateh-Moghadam S', 'Giles FJ', 'Dorken B', 'Haverkamp W', 'Kohncke C']","['Medizinische Klinik mS Hamatologie und Onkologie, Charite -Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2012/01/25 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.058776 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.058776 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jun;97(6):883-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.058776.

The most clearly defined familial cases result from inherited mutations in RUNX1 or CEBPA. Recently, novel germline mutations in GATA2 have been reported. We, therefore, investigated individuals from families with one or more first-degree relatives with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia with wild-type RUNX1 and CEBPA, for GATA2 mutations. Screening for other recurrent mutations was also performed. A GATA2 p.Thr354Met mutation was observed in a pedigree in which 2 first-degree cousins developed high-risk myelodys-plastic syndrome with monosomy 7. They were also observed to have acquired identical somatic ASXL1 mutations and both died despite stem cell transplantation. These findings confirm that germline GATA2 mutations predispose to familial myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, and that monosomy 7 and ASXL1 mutations may be recurrent secondary genetic abnormalities triggering overt malignancy in these families.","['Bodor, Csaba', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Smith, Matthew', 'Charazac, Aurelie', 'Iqbal, Sameena', 'Etancelin, Pascaline', 'Cavenagh, Jamie', 'Barnett, Michael J', 'Kramarzova, Karolina', 'Krishnan, Biju', 'Matolcsy, Andras', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Fitzgibbon, Jude', 'Owen, Carolyn']","['Bodor C', 'Renneville A', 'Smith M', 'Charazac A', 'Iqbal S', 'Etancelin P', 'Cavenagh J', 'Barnett MJ', 'Kramarzova K', 'Krishnan B', 'Matolcsy A', 'Preudhomme C', 'Fitzgibbon J', 'Owen C']","['Centre of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2012/01/25 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.054361 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.054361 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jun;97(6):890-4. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.054361.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Cytomorphological marrow response was prospectively assessed on Day 15 during induction, and its prognostic value was analyzed in 1,431 patients treated on ALL-BFM 95. RESULTS: The 8-year probabilities of event-free survival were 86.1%, 74.5%, and 46.4% for patients with M1, M2, and M3 Day 15 marrows, respectively. Compared to prednisone response, Day 15 marrow response was superior in outcome prediction in precursor B-cell and T-cell leukemia with, however, a differential effect depending on blast lineage. Outcome was poor in T-cell leukemia patients with prednisone poor-response independent of Day 15 marrow response, whereas among patients with prednisone good-response different risk groups could be identified by Day 15 marrow response. In contrast, prednisone response lost prognostic significance in precursor B-cell leukemia when stratified by Day 15 marrow response. Age and white blood cell count retained their independent prognostic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Selective addition of Day 15 marrow response to conventional stratification criteria applied on ALL-BFM 95 (currently in use in several countries as regular chemotherapy protocol for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia) may significantly improve risk-adapted treatment delivery. Even though cutting-edge trial risk stratification is meanwhile dominated by minimal residual disease evaluation, an improved conventional risk assessment, as presented here, could be of great importance to countries that lack the technical and/or financial resources associated with the application of minimal residual disease analysis.","['Lauten, Melchior', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Beier, Rita', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Meissner, Barbara', 'Odenwald, Edelgard', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Riehm, Hansjorg', 'Schrappe, Martin']","['Lauten M', 'Moricke A', 'Beier R', 'Zimmermann M', 'Stanulla M', 'Meissner B', 'Odenwald E', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Niemeyer C', 'Niggli F', 'Riehm H', 'Schrappe M']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck Campus, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2012/01/25 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.047613 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.047613 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jul;97(7):1048-56. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.047613.

No significant difference between older and younger patients was observed in response rates (43 vs. 47%) or progression-free survival (median 8.7 vs. 9.9 months, P>0.80). Although overall survival was worse in older patients (median 2.1 vs. 2.4 years, P=0.02); when adjusted for other factors this difference was no longer significant (P>/=0.10). With the exception of infections (older 29% vs. younger 62%) no significant association with toxicity was observed.

However, little is known about outcomes of chronic myeloid leukemia in adolescent and young adult patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed all 468 chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated at our institution with tyrosine kinase inhibitors as initial therapy: imatinib (n=281), nilotinib (n=98) or dasatinib (n=89). RESULTS: Median age was 47 years, median follow up 71 months and median treatment time with initial tyrosine kinase inhibitors 48 months. Adolescent and young adult was defined as aged 15-29 years. Sixty-one adolescent and young adult patients were identified. The only significant differences between adolescent and young adult and older patients were incidence of splenomegaly and distribution in Sokal risk groups. Only 3 adolescent and young adult patients have died. Rates of complete cytogenetic, major molecular and complete molecular response were significantly higher in older patients compared to adolescent and young adult patients, with a favorable trend in event-free survival for older patients. Transformation-free and overall survival were similar for the two groups.

The aim of this work was to gain insight into the mechanisms whereby fusion genes affect human hematopoietic cells and in particular the eosinophil lineage. DESIGN AND METHODS: We introduced ETV6-PDGFRB and FIP1L1-PDGFRA into human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells isolated from umbilical cord blood. RESULTS: Cells transduced with these oncogenes formed hematopoietic colonies even in the absence of cytokines. Both oncogenes also stimulated the proliferation of cells in liquid culture and their differentiation into eosinophils. This model thus recapitulated key features of the myeloid neoplasms induced by ETV6-PDGFRB and FIP1L1-PDGFRA. We next showed that both fusion genes activated the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, STAT5 and nuclear factor-kappaB. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibition blocked nuclear factor-kappaB activation in transduced progenitor cells and patients' cells. Nuclear factor-kappaB was also activated in the human FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive leukemia cell line EOL1, the proliferation of which was blocked by bortezomib and the IkappaB kinase inhibitor BMS-345541. A mutant IkappaB that prevents nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB inhibited cell growth and the expression of eosinophil markers, such as the interleukin-5 receptor and eosinophil peroxidase, in progenitors transduced with ETV6-PDGFRB. In addition, several potential regulators of this process, including HES6, MYC and FOXO3 were identified using expression microarrays. CONCLUSIONS: We show that human CD34(+) cells expressing PDGFR fusion oncogenes proliferate autonomously and differentiate towards the eosinophil lineage in a process that requires nuclear factor-kappaB. These results suggest new treatment possibilities for imatinib-resistant myeloid neoplasms associated with PDGFR mutations.","['Montano-Almendras, Carmen P', 'Essaghir, Ahmed', 'Schoemans, Helene', 'Varis, Inci', 'Noel, Laura A', 'Velghe, Amelie I', 'Latinne, Dominique', 'Knoops, Laurent', 'Demoulin, Jean-Baptiste']","['Montano-Almendras CP', 'Essaghir A', 'Schoemans H', 'Varis I', 'Noel LA', 'Velghe AI', 'Latinne D', 'Knoops L', 'Demoulin JB']","['Universite catholique de Louvain, de Duve Institute, avenue Hippocrate 75, BE-1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2012/01/25 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.047530 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.047530 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jul;97(7):1064-72. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.047530.

It has been proposed that non-human leukocyte antigen gene polymorphisms influence outcome after hematopoietic cell transplantation and could be used alongside traditional patient-donor and transplant characteristics to create a recipient risk profile associated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. DESIGN AND METHODS: A previous study from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation showed that the absence of recipient tumor necrosis factor receptor II, absence of donor interleukin 10 ATA/ACC and presence of donor interleukin 1 receptor antagonist allele 2 genotypes were associated with decreased survival and increased non-relapse mortality in adult patients with chronic myeloid leukemia undergoing myeloablative human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling transplantation. To explore these associations in unrelated donor transplantation, these polymorphisms were genotyped in 383 adult patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors matched for 10/10 human leukocyte antigens. RESULTS: The polymorphisms were not associated with overall survival, non-relapse mortality, relapse or acute graft-versus-host disease in the unrelated donor cohort. Comparison of the unrelated donor and human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling cohorts showed differences in survival and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: We did not confirm that non-human leukocyte antigen polymorphisms were associated with outcomes in myeloablative unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia, possibly because of the strong association between clinical variables and outcome which masked more subtle genetic effects.","['Pearce, Kim F', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Haagenson, Michael', 'Petersdorf, Effie W', 'Norden, Jean', 'Collin, Matthew P', 'Klein, John P', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Lowerson, Shelagh A', 'Davies, Stella', 'Dickinson, Anne M']","['Pearce KF', 'Lee SJ', 'Haagenson M', 'Petersdorf EW', 'Norden J', 'Collin MP', 'Klein JP', 'Spellman SR', 'Lowerson SA', 'Davies S', 'Dickinson AM']","['Haematological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, William Leech Building, Medical School, Newcastle University, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK. k.f.pearce@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,2012/01/25 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.053611 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.053611 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jul;97(7):1014-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.053611.

Recently, novel particulate cytoplasmic structures, rich in ubiquitinated and proteasomal proteins, have been detected in epithelial cells and neutrophils from patients with Helicobacter pylori gastritis and several epithelial neoplasms. DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood neutrophils from 13 cases of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome - ten with and three without SBDS gene mutation - and ten controls were investigated by confocal microscopy and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry using antibodies against ubiquitinated proteins, proteasomes, p62 protein, and Helicobacter pylori VacA, urease and outer membrane proteins. RESULTS: Many extensively disseminated particulate cytoplasmic structures, accounting for 22.78 +/- 5.57% (mean +/- standard deviation) of the total cytoplasm, were found in blood neutrophils from mutated Shwachman-Diamond syndrome patients. The particulate cytoplasmic structures showed immunoreactivity for polyubiquitinated proteins and proteasomes, but no reactivity for Helicobacter pylori products, which are present in particulate cytoplasmic structures of Helicobacter pylori-positive gastritis. Neutrophils from patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome frequently showed p62-positive autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic changes in 5% of cells. No particulate cytoplasmic structures were observed in most control neutrophils; however, in a few cells from two cases we noted focal development of minute particulate cytoplasmic structures, accounting for 0.74 +/- 0.56% of the total cytoplasm (P<0.001 versus particulate cytoplasmic structures from mutated Shwachman-Diamond syndrome patients). Neutrophils from non-mutated Shwachman-Diamond-syndrome-like patients resembled controls in two cases, and a third case showed particulate cytoplasmic structure patterns intermediate between those in controls and those in mutated Shwachman-Diamond syndrome patients. CONCLUSIONS: Particulate cytoplasmic structures are a prominent feature of neutrophils from patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. They may help us to understand the mechanism of granulocyte dysfunction and the neoplastic risk of the disease.","['Necchi, Vittorio', 'Minelli, Antonella', 'Sommi, Patrizia', 'Vitali, Agostina', 'Caruso, Roberta', 'Longoni, Daniela', 'Frau, Maria Rita', 'Nasi, Cristina', 'De Gregorio, Fabiola', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Ricci, Vittorio', 'Danesino, Cesare', 'Solcia, Enrico']","['Necchi V', 'Minelli A', 'Sommi P', 'Vitali A', 'Caruso R', 'Longoni D', 'Frau MR', 'Nasi C', 'De Gregorio F', 'Zecca M', 'Ricci V', 'Danesino C', 'Solcia E']","['Department of Human Pathology and Genetics, University of Pavia and Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S.

Our previous studies demonstrated that two clinically approved drugs, decitabine and gemcitabine, potently inhibited HIV-1 replication in cell culture through a mechanism that is distinct from the mechanisms for the drugs currently used to treat HIV-1 infection. We further demonstrated that gemcitabine inhibited replication of a related retrovirus, murine leukemia virus (MuLV), in vivo using the MuLV-based LP-BM5/murine AIDS (MAIDS) mouse model at doses that were not toxic. Since decitabine and gemcitabine inhibited MuLV and HIV-1 replication with similar potency in cell culture, the current study examined the efficacy and toxicity of the drug combination using the MAIDS model. The data demonstrate that the drug combination inhibited disease progression, as detected by histopathology, viral loads, and spleen weights, at doses lower than those that would be required if the drugs were used individually. The combination of decitabine and gemcitabine exerted antiviral activity at doses that were not toxic. These findings indicate that the combination of decitabine and gemcitabine shows potent antiretroviral activity at nontoxic doses and should be further investigated for clinical relevance.","['Clouser, Christine L', 'Holtz, Colleen M', 'Mullett, Mary', 'Crankshaw, Daune L', 'Briggs, Jacquie E', ""O'Sullivan, M Gerard"", 'Patterson, Steven E', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Clouser CL', 'Holtz CM', 'Mullett M', 'Crankshaw DL', 'Briggs JE', ""O'Sullivan MG"", 'Patterson SE', 'Mansky LM']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,2012/01/25 06:00,2012/06/29 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.06161-11 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.06161-11 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Apr;56(4):1942-8. doi: 10.1128/AAC.06161-11.

Administration of HDMTX needs meticulous monitoring. Limitations in the availability of trained staff and adequate infrastructure often pose problems in the developing world. The aim of this study was (1) to treat childhood ALL with a protocol that would have reduced use of cranial irradiation and containing infusions of high-dose methotrexate HDMTX (5 g/m(2)) without compromising on survival, and (2) evaluate the experience with HDMTX in a tertiary care cancer centre in a developing country. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was done of 41 consecutive children with a confirmed diagnosis of ALL who had received at least one cycle of HDMTX as part of their consolidation treatment with regard to the patient demographic profile, details of HDMTX infusion and leucovorin rescue, toxicity, additional hospitalization, delay in next cycle of chemotherapy and survival. RESULTS: The clinically most significant toxicities observed were mucositis 39% (58/149) and fever 28% (42/149) together leading to additional hospital stay in 7% (11/149) cycles and neutropenia grade 3 or more in 24.8% (34/137) contributing to delay in next cycle of chemotherapy in 15% (23/149) cycles. CONCLUSION: With this strategy, it was possible to omit or reduce the dose of cranial irradiation while maintaining survival outcomes.

One of these signaling intermediates is protein kinase C (PKC). Ten differentially regulated PKC isoforms are integral to receptor-triggered responses in different cells. So far, eight PKC isoforms are reported to be expressed in macrophages. Whether a single receptor differentially uses PKC isoforms to regulate counteractive effector functions has never been addressed. As CD40 is the only receptor characterized to trigger counteractive functions, we examined the relative role of PKC isoforms in the CD40-induced macrophage functions. We report that in BALB/c mouse macrophages, higher doses of CD40 stimulation induce optimum phosphorylation and translocation of PKCalpha, betaI, betaII, and epsilon whereas lower doses of CD40 stimulation activates PKCdelta, zeta, and lambda. Infection of macrophages with the protozoan parasite Leishmania major impairs PKCalpha, betaI, betaII, and epsilon isoforms but enhances PKCdelta, zeta, and lambda isoforms, suggesting a reciprocity among these PKC isoforms. Indeed, PKCalpha, betaI, betaII, and epsilon isoforms mediate CD40-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation, IL-12 expression, and Leishmania killing; PKCdelta and zeta/lambda mediate ERK1/2 phosphorylation, IL-10 production, and parasite growth. Treatment of the susceptible BALB/c mice with the lentivirally expressed PKCdelta- or zeta-specific short hairpin RNA significantly reduces the infection and reinstates host-protective IFN-gamma-dominated T cell response, defining the differential roles for PKC isoforms in immune homeostasis and novel PKC-targeted immunotherapeutic and parasite-derived immune evasion strategies.","['Sudan, Raki', 'Srivastava, Neetu', 'Pandey, Surya Prakash', 'Majumdar, Subrata', 'Saha, Bhaskar']","['Sudan R', 'Srivastava N', 'Pandey SP', 'Majumdar S', 'Saha B']","['National Centre for Cell Science, Ganeshkhind, Pune 411 007, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,2012/01/25 06:00,2012/06/01 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1101678 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1101678 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Mar 1;188(5):2328-37. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1101678.

In this study, we identify G935R, Y931C, and E864K mutations within the JAK2 kinase domain that confer resistance across a panel of JAK inhibitors, whether present in cis with JAK2 V617F (observed in MPNs) or JAK2 R683G (observed in B-ALL). G935R, Y931C, and E864K do not reduce the sensitivity of JAK2-dependent cells to inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which promote the degradation of both wild-type and mutant JAK2. HSP90 inhibitors were 100-1,000-fold more potent against CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL cells, which correlated with JAK2 degradation and more extensive blockade of JAK2/STAT5, MAP kinase, and AKT signaling. In addition, the HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 prolonged survival of mice xenografted with primary human CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL further than an enzymatic JAK2 inhibitor. Thus, HSP90 is a promising therapeutic target in JAK2-driven cancers, including those with genetic resistance to JAK enzymatic inhibitors.","['Weigert, Oliver', 'Lane, Andrew A', 'Bird, Liat', 'Kopp, Nadja', 'Chapuy, Bjoern', 'van Bodegom, Diederik', 'Toms, Angela V', 'Marubayashi, Sachie', 'Christie, Amanda L', 'McKeown, Michael', 'Paranal, Ronald M', 'Bradner, James E', 'Yoda, Akinori', 'Gaul, Christoph', 'Vangrevelinghe, Eric', 'Romanet, Vincent', 'Murakami, Masato', 'Tiedt, Ralph', 'Ebel, Nicolas', 'Evrot, Emeline', 'De Pover, Alain', 'Regnier, Catherine H', 'Erdmann, Dirk', 'Hofmann, Francesco', 'Eck, Michael J', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Baffert, Fabienne', 'Radimerski, Thomas', 'Weinstock, David M']","['Weigert O', 'Lane AA', 'Bird L', 'Kopp N', 'Chapuy B', 'van Bodegom D', 'Toms AV', 'Marubayashi S', 'Christie AL', 'McKeown M', 'Paranal RM', 'Bradner JE', 'Yoda A', 'Gaul C', 'Vangrevelinghe E', 'Romanet V', 'Murakami M', 'Tiedt R', 'Ebel N', 'Evrot E', 'De Pover A', 'Regnier CH', 'Erdmann D', 'Hofmann F', 'Eck MJ', 'Sallan SE', 'Levine RL', 'Kung AL', 'Baffert F', 'Radimerski T', 'Weinstock DM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,2012/01/25 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20111694 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20111694 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2012 Feb 13;209(2):259-73. doi: 10.1084/jem.20111694.

They also displayed different potencies in depleting lymphoma cells and normal B cells from whole blood ex vivo and significantly extended the survival of nude mice bearing MCL xenografts in a dose-dependent manner, thus indicating stability and antitumor activity in vivo.

Prion diseases are transmissible within and between species. In a subset of prion diseases, peripheral prion uptake and subsequent transport to the central nervous system are key to disease initiation. The involvement of retroviruses in this process has been postulated based on the findings that retroviral infections enhance the spread of prion infectivity and PrP(Sc) from cell to cell in vitro. To study whether retroviral infection influences the phenotype of prion disease or the spread of prion infectivity and PrP(Sc) in vivo, we developed a murine model with persistent Moloney murine leukemia retrovirus (MoMuLV) infection with and without additional prion infection. We investigated the pathophysiology of prion disease in MoMuLV and prion-infected mice, monitoring temporal kinetics of PrP(Sc) spread and prion infectivity, as well as clinical presentation. Unexpectedly, infection of MoMuLV challenged mice with prions did not change incubation time to clinical prion disease. However, clinical presentation of prion disease was altered in mice infected with both pathogens. This was paralleled by remarkably enhanced astrogliosis and pathognomonic astrocyte morphology in the brain of these mice. Therefore, we conclude that persistent viral infection might act as a disease modifier in prion disease.","['Krasemann, Susanne', 'Neumann, Melanie', 'Luepke, Jan-Paul', 'Grashorn, Juliane', 'Wurr, Steffanie', 'Stocking, Carol', 'Glatzel, Markus']","['Krasemann S', 'Neumann M', 'Luepke JP', 'Grashorn J', 'Wurr S', 'Stocking C', 'Glatzel M']","['Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Acta Neuropathol,Acta neuropathologica,0412041,2012/01/25 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00401-012-0944-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Neuropathol. 2012 Jul;124(1):111-26. doi: 10.1007/s00401-012-0944-1.

In kidney, LIF regulates nephrogenesis, involves in tubular regeneration, responds to pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli, and so on. LIF also plays an essential role in protective mechanisms triggered by preconditioning-induced oxidative stress. Although LIF shows a wide range of biologic activities, effects of LIF on high glucose-induced oxidative stress in podocytes remain unclear. The aim of the study was to assess whether LIF can attenuate high glucose-induced apoptosis in podocytes. The result of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay indicated that LIF protected podocytes against high glucose-induced cytotoxicity. The flow cytometry assay showed that LIF attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis in podocytes. Meanwhile, the result of flow cytometric assay gave the clear indication that LIF decreased high glucose-induced elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The measurement of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and caspase-3 activity levels showed that LIF attenuated the high glucose-induced decreased level of SOD and elevated level of NADPH oxidase, MDA and caspase-3 activity.

However, the utility of these drugs is limited by resistance to ATRA and the side effects of ATO. It has been reported that Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a diterpene quinone isolated from Salvia Miltiorrhiza Bunge, induces apoptosis in the APL cell line, NB4. The effect of Tan IIA on the ATRA-resistant APL cell line (MR2) is unknown. METHODS: In this study, the effects of Tan IIA and ATO, alone and in combination, on MR2 cell apoptosis were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry and Western blot analyses. RESULTS: Nuclear changes typical of apoptosis were observed in Tan IIA-treated MR2 cells. Apoptosis was shown to be induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner with the activation of caspase-3 resulting in upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-a expression, activation of caspase-8 and alteration in mitochondrial transmembrane potential with release of cytochrome c (cyto-c). Tan IIA and ATO acted synergistically on the induction of MR2 cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that Tan IIA may be beneficial in the treatment of ATRA-resistant APL and in combination with ATO for APL therapy in the clinic.","['Li, Jian', 'Zhang, Kaiji', 'Meng, Wentong', 'Yang, Yiming']","['Li J', 'Zhang K', 'Meng W', 'Yang Y']","['Department of Hematology , West China Medical School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,2012/01/25 06:00,2013/04/16 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MAJ.0b013e318240bca6 [doi]', 'S0002-9629(15)30829-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2012 Oct;344(4):283-8. doi: 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e318240bca6.,,,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the mechanism by which such drug combinations induce enhanced cell death by applying time-lapse microscopy to track the fate of individual cells. MEK inhibitors did not affect the first mitosis after drug exposure, but most cells remained arrested in interphase without entering a second mitosis. Low concentrations of microtubule inhibitors induced prolonged mitotic arrest followed by exit of cells from mitosis without division, with most cells remaining viable. However, the combination of a MEK inhibitor and a microtubule inhibitor induced massive cell death during prolonged mitosis. Impairment of spindle assembly checkpoint function by RNAi-mediated depletion of Mad2 or BubR1 markedly suppressed such prolonged mitotic arrest and cell death. The cell death was accompanied by up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (to which MEK inhibitors contributed) and by down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 (to which microtubule and MEK inhibitors contributed synergistically). Whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of Bim suppressed cell death, stabilization of Mcl-1 by RNAi-mediated depletion of Mule slowed its onset. Depletion of Mcl-1 sensitized tumor cells to MEK inhibitor-induced cell death, an effect that was antagonized by knockdown of Bim. The combination of MEK and microtubule inhibitors thus targets Bim and Mcl-1 in a cooperative manner to induce massive cell death in tumor cells with aberrant ERK pathway activation.","['Kawabata, Takumi', 'Tanimura, Susumu', 'Asai, Kohei', 'Kawasaki, Ryohei', 'Matsumaru, Yumi', 'Kohno, Michiaki']","['Kawabata T', 'Tanimura S', 'Asai K', 'Kawasaki R', 'Matsumaru Y', 'Kohno M']","['Laboratory of Cell Regulation, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521.', 'Laboratory of Cell Regulation, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521,; Nagasaki University Research Center for Genomic Instability and Carcinogenesis (NRGIC), Nagasaki 852-8523, and.', 'Laboratory of Cell Regulation, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521.', 'Laboratory of Cell Regulation, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521.', 'Laboratory of Cell Regulation, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521.', 'Laboratory of Cell Regulation, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521,; Department of Genetic Biochemistry, Kyoto University Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.

To develop an efficient transfection method, we formulated a simple nanocomplex by incorporating poly beta-amino ester (PBAE) polymers with plasmid DNAs containing a GFP reporter gene. The formed PBAE-plasmid nanocomplexes are approximately 200nm in diameter and stable under physiological conditions, but become rapidly biodegradable when pH decreases <7.0. Cultured lymphoma/leukemia cells were used for transfection assays and resultant gene delivery rates were determined by quantifying GFP expression. Exposure of cells to the nanocomplexes composed of fractioned PBAE (>7kDa) resulted in GFP expression in 3% of cells, similar to that mediated by the standard Lipofectamine method. However, with polybrene pre-treatment, the nanocomplex could achieve GFP expression in up to 32% of lymphoma/leukemia cells, an 8-fold increase over that mediated by Lipofectamine. These findings demonstrated a simple, efficient method for in vitro gene delivery into hard-to-transfect cells.

R and T cell resistance to CisPt-induced apoptosis could not be reversed by verapamil (a well-known P-gp inhibitor), which excludes P-gp transport activity as a cause of CisPt resistance. CisPt induced a more pronounced entry into apoptosis in S than R and T cells, which was measured using the annexin-V/propidium iodide apoptosis kit. CisPt induced more pronounced caspase-3 activation in S than R and T cells. CisPt did not induce changes in the P-gp protein level for R and T cells. While similar levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins were observed in P-gp-negative and P-gp-positive cells, CisPt induced a more significant decrease in Bcl-2 levels for S cells than P-gp-positive cells. Expression of p53 and its molecular chaperone Hsp90 were more pronounced in R and T than S cells. Moreover, CisPt enhanced the upregulation of p53 and Hsp90 in R and T cells to a higher degree than S cells. Apoptosis was shown to be the prevalent mode of cell death in S, R and T cells by the typical DNA fragmentation and cell ultrastructure changes. All of the above findings indicate that P-gp, independent of its drug efflux activity, induced changes in cell regulatory pathways that confer a partial loss of cisplatin sensitivity.","['Gibalova, Lenka', 'Seres, Mario', 'Rusnak, Andrej', 'Ditte, Peter', 'Labudova, Martina', 'Uhrik, Branislav', 'Pastorek, Jaromir', 'Sedlak, Jan', 'Breier, Albert', 'Sulova, Zdenka']","['Gibalova L', 'Seres M', 'Rusnak A', 'Ditte P', 'Labudova M', 'Uhrik B', 'Pastorek J', 'Sedlak J', 'Breier A', 'Sulova Z']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Excellence of the Slovak Research and Development Agency BIOMEMBRANES2008, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 83334 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,2012/01/25 06:00,2012/06/27 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(12)00015-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2012.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2012 Apr;26(3):435-44. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2012.01.014.

Non-T-cell activation linker (NTAL) is a nonenzymatic transmembrane adaptor molecule that is involved in the proximal signaling of lymphocytes. In our previous work, we found an association between high NTAL expression in T-cell ALL blasts and a favorable response to initial glucocorticoid treatment. In the present study, we confirm our previous observation in an experimental model. In addition, the molecular mechanism of the contribution of NTAL to malignant T-cell ALL blast signaling and to methylprednisolone-induced cell death is analyzed. In the in vitro experiments, we used the T-cell ALL Jurkat cell line (Jurkat/wt) and derived Jurkat cell line with stable NTAL expression (Jurkat/NTAL(+)). Cell signaling and cell death after methylprednisolone treatment and after TCR stimulation were analyzed using flow cytometry, Western blot, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Jurkat/NTAL(+) cells are significantly more sensitive to both methylprednisolone treatment and TCR-induced stimulation. In addition, after TCR stimulation, Jurkat/NTAL(+) cells show a higher level of intracellular extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) phosphorylation and increased expression of the CD69 activation marker on the cell surface than the Jurkat/wt cells. The ERK inhibitor U0126 almost completely abrogates TCR-induced cell death and, importantly, reverses the sensitizing effect of the NTAL protein on methylprednisolone-induced cell death. In conclusion, NTAL acts as a tumor suppressor that enhances the proximal signaling of leukemic blasts. The key downstream molecule responsible for the biological effect of TCR signaling is ERK. Higher ERK phosphorylation leads to enhanced cell death after TCR stimulation and increases cell sensitivity to methylprednisolone-induced cell death.","['Svojgr, Karel', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Kanderova, Veronika', 'Skopcova, Tereza', 'Brdicka, Tomas', 'Zuna, Jan']","['Svojgr K', 'Kalina T', 'Kanderova V', 'Skopcova T', 'Brdicka T', 'Zuna J']","['CLIP-Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic. karel.svojgr@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2012/01/25 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00013-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 May;40(5):379-85. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.01.011.

Our aim was to compare apoptosis scores and the expression of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), myelin basic protein (MBP), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)-1,matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1A, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, TIMP-1/MMP-1A ratio, nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), neurotrophin (NT)-3, NT-4, glial cell-derived neurotropic factor (GDNF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-alpha and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in anastomosed facial nerves that had been treated with or without MSC. METHODS: In seven rats, the buccal branch of the right facial nerve was transected, anastomosed and treated with MSC (anastomosed + MSC group). The left buccal branch was anastomosed only (anastomosed-only group). The left mandibular branch served as an intact nerve group. On days 18-20, the distal segments of the branches were examined in terms of expression of the mentioned proteins and apoptosis scores using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. RESULTS: MSC application significantly increased CNTF, PDGF-alpha, LIF, TGF-beta1, BDNF and NT-3 expression (P < 0.05). MAG expression slightly decreased whereas NCAM-1, MMP-1A and FGF-2 slightly increased(P > 0.05). Changes in other proteins and apoptosis scores were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MSC increases expression of CNTF, PDGF-alpha, LIF,TGF-beta1, BDNF and NT-3. MAG, NCAM-1, MMP-1A and FGF-2 expressions were slightly changed in this stage of nerve regeneration. The comparison of apoptotic activity was not conclusive. Overall, it appears that MSC might have differential effects on the mentioned tissue-related proteins and trophic/growth factors.","['Satar, Bulent', 'Hidir, Yusuf', 'Serdar, Muhittin A', 'Kucuktag, Zulkuf', 'Ural, Ali Ugur', 'Avcu, Ferit', 'Safali, Mukerrem', 'Oguztuzun, Serpil']","['Satar B', 'Hidir Y', 'Serdar MA', 'Kucuktag Z', 'Ural AU', 'Avcu F', 'Safali M', 'Oguztuzun S']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey. bulentsatar@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,2012/01/25 06:00,2012/09/26 06:00,['2012/01/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653249.2011.651530 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(12)70665-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2012 May;14(5):522-8. doi: 10.3109/14653249.2011.651530.

Here we show for the first time that LMP1 activates the Akt pathway and up-regulates Mcl-1 through miR-155 expression, which contributes to the survival of rituximab-treated B-cell lymphoma cells. Furthermore, Akt inhibition or knockdown of Mcl-1 and miR-155 was found to be an efficient strategy to overcome rituximab resistance caused by LMP1 expression.

Of 572 kinases individually silenced in combination with Ara-C, silencing of 10 (1.7%) and 8 (1.4%) kinases strongly increased Ara-C activity in TF-1 and THP-1 cells, respectively. The strongest molecular concepts emerged around kinases involved in cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA-damage repair. In confirmatory siRNA assays, inhibition of WEE1 resulted in more potent and universal sensitization across myeloid cell lines than siRNA inhibition of PKMYT1, CHEK1, or ATR. Treatment of 8 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines with commercial and the first-in-class clinical WEE1 kinase inhibitor MK1775 confirmed sensitization to Ara-C up to 97-fold. Ex vivo, adding MK1775 substantially reduced viability in 13 of 14 AML, CML, and myelodysplastic syndrome patient samples compared with Ara-C alone. Maximum sensitization occurred at lower to moderate concentrations of both drugs. Induction of apoptosis was increased using a combination of Ara-C and MK1775 compared with using either drug alone. WEE1 is expressed in primary AML, ALL, and CML specimens. Data from this first siRNA-kinome sensitizer screen suggests that inhibiting WEE1 in combination with Ara-C is a rational combination for the treatment of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias.","['Tibes, Raoul', 'Bogenberger, James M', 'Chaudhuri, Leena', 'Hagelstrom, R Tanner', 'Chow, Donald', 'Buechel, Megan E', 'Gonzales, Irma M', 'Demuth, Tim', 'Slack, James', 'Mesa, Ruben A', 'Braggio, Esteban', 'Yin, Hongwei H', 'Arora, Shilpi', 'Azorsa, David O']","['Tibes R', 'Bogenberger JM', 'Chaudhuri L', 'Hagelstrom RT', 'Chow D', 'Buechel ME', 'Gonzales IM', 'Demuth T', 'Slack J', 'Mesa RA', 'Braggio E', 'Yin HH', 'Arora S', 'Azorsa DO']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ 85259, USA. tibes.raoul@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49219-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-367557 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 22;119(12):2863-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-367557.

In osteoimmunology, macrophages were described as another critical cell population regulating bone formation by osteoblasts but the coupling factors were not identified. Using a high-throughput approach, we identified here Oncostatin M (OSM), a cytokine of the IL-6 family, as a major coupling factor produced by activated circulating CD14+ or bone marrow CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages that induce osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization from human mesenchymal stem cells while inhibiting adipogenesis. Upon activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) by lipopolysaccharide or endogenous ligands, OSM was produced in classically activated inflammatory M1 and not M2 macrophages, through a cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin-E2 regulatory loop. Stimulation of osteogenesis by activated monocytes/macrophages was prevented using neutralizing antibodies or siRNA to OSM, OSM receptor subunits gp130 and OSMR, or to the downstream transcription factor STAT3. The induced osteoblast differentiation program culminated with enhanced expression of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein delta, Cbfa1, and alkaline phosphatase. Overexpression of OSM in the tibia of mice has led to new bone apposition with no sign of bone resorption. Two other cytokines have also a potent role in bone formation induced by monocytes/macrophages and activation of TLRs: IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. We propose that during bone inflammation, infection, or injury, the IL-6 family signaling network activated by macrophages and TLR ligands stimulates bone formation that is largely uncoupled from bone resorption and is thus an important target for anabolic bone therapies.","['Guihard, Pierre', 'Danger, Yannic', 'Brounais, Benedicte', 'David, Emmanuelle', 'Brion, Regis', 'Delecrin, Joel', 'Richards, Carl D', 'Chevalier, Sylvie', 'Redini, Francoise', 'Heymann, Dominique', 'Gascan, Hugues', 'Blanchard, Frederic']","['Guihard P', 'Danger Y', 'Brounais B', 'David E', 'Brion R', 'Delecrin J', 'Richards CD', 'Chevalier S', 'Redini F', 'Heymann D', 'Gascan H', 'Blanchard F']","['INSERM, UMR 957, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2012, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1040 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Apr;30(4):762-72. doi: 10.1002/stem.1040.,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/drug effects/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Bone Matrix/drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcification, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', '*Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M/*metabolism', '*Osteogenesis/drug effects', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to evaluate the frequency of ALT in uterine sarcoma and carcinosarcoma and to assess its association with clinical parameters. METHODS: Retrospectively collected paraffin blocks from 41 patients with uterine sarcomas and carcinosarcomas were analyzed for ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APBs), which are a significant feature of ALT cells, using combined immunofluorescence and telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization. In addition, a C-circle assay and human telomerase reverse transcriptase immunohistochemistry were performed to support these results. RESULTS: The APB assay and C-circle assay indicated that 46.3% (19/41 cases) and 36.4% (8/22 cases) of sarcomas of the uterus, respectively, were positive for ALT. Alternative lengthening of telomerase positivity was correlated with high-grade uterine sarcoma and parameters indicative of an aggressive tumor, such as tumor size (P = 0.033) and mitotic index (P = 0.001); ALT positivity was negatively correlated with human telomerase reverse transcriptase reactivity (P = 0.036). In a survival analysis, the presence of APBs was found to be a poor prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P = 0.018) and overall survival (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Alternative lengthening of telomeres is a prevalent mechanism in uterine sarcomas and carcinosarcomas and is associated with the aggressiveness of the tumor and tumor progression. Importantly, ALT positivity is an indicator of poor prognosis for patients with uterine sarcoma and carcinosarcoma.","['Lee, Yoo-Kyung', 'Park, Noh-Hyun', 'Lee, Hyunsook']","['Lee YK', 'Park NH', 'Lee H']","['Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, College of Natural Sciences, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Gynecol Cancer,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,9111626,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/IGC.0b013e31823ca017 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2012 Mar;22(3):434-41. doi: 10.1097/IGC.0b013e31823ca017.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Carcinosarcoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently emerged that G-CSF mediates HSC mobilization and inhibits bone formation via specific bone marrow (BM) macrophages. We compared the effect of these three mobilizing agents on BM macrophages, bone formation, osteoblasts, HSC niches and HSC reconstitution potential. Both G-CSF and CYP suppressed niche-supportive macrophages and osteoblasts, and inhibited expression of endosteal cytokines resulting in major impairment of HSC reconstitution potential remaining in the mobilized BM. In sharp contrast, although AMD3100 was effective at mobilizing HSC, it did not suppress osteoblasts, endosteal cytokine expression or reconstitution potential of HSC remaining in the mobilized BM. In conclusion, although G-CSF, CYP and AMD3100 efficiently mobilize HSC into the blood, their effects on HSC niches and bone formation are distinct with both G-CSF and CYP targeting HSC niche function and bone formation, whereas AMD3100 directly targets HSC without altering niche function or bone formation.","['Winkler, I G', 'Pettit, A R', 'Raggatt, L J', 'Jacobsen, R N', 'Forristal, C E', 'Barbier, V', 'Nowlan, B', 'Cisterne, A', 'Bendall, L J', 'Sims, N A', 'Levesque, J-P']","['Winkler IG', 'Pettit AR', 'Raggatt LJ', 'Jacobsen RN', 'Forristal CE', 'Barbier V', 'Nowlan B', 'Cisterne A', 'Bendall LJ', 'Sims NA', 'Levesque JP']","['Mater Medical Research Institute, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201217 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.17 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jul;26(7):1594-601. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.17.

Many of the transcription factors that recruit Mtg16 regulate haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell functions and are required to maintain stem cell self-renewal potential. Accordingly, we found that Mtg16-null bone marrow (BM) failed in BM transplant assays. Moreover, when removed from the animal, Mtg16-deficient stem cells continued to show defects in stem cell self-renewal assays, suggesting a requirement for Mtg16 in this process. Gene expression analysis indicated that Mtg16 was required to suppress the expression of several key cell-cycle regulators including E2F2, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays detected Mtg16 near an E2A binding site within the first intron of E2F2. BrdU incorporation assays indicated that in the absence of Mtg16 more long-term stem cells were in the S phase, even after competitive BM transplantation where normal stem and progenitor cells are present, suggesting that Mtg16 plays a role in the maintenance of stem cell quiescence.","['Fischer, Melissa A', 'Moreno-Miralles, Isabel', 'Hunt, Aubrey', 'Chyla, Brenda J', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Fischer MA', 'Moreno-Miralles I', 'Hunt A', 'Chyla BJ', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/07/20 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2011/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2011500 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2011.500 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2012 Mar 21;31(6):1494-505. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2011.500.

METHODS: The viability of cancer cells was investigated using the MTT assay. The cell cycle progression was evaluated using both flow cytometric and Western blotting analysis. Microtubule depolymerization was observed with immunocytochemistry in vivo and a tubulin depolymerization assay in vitro. Apoptosis was demonstrated using Annexin V/Propidium Iodide (PI) double-staining and sub-G(1) analysis. RESULTS: Among 36 analogues of coumarin, 6-chloro-4-(methoxyphenyl) coumarin showed the best anticancer activity (IC(50) value about 200 nmol/L) in HCT116 cells. The compound had a broad spectrum of anticancer activity against 9 cancer cell lines derived from colon cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, epidermoid cancer with IC(50) value of 75 nmol/L-1.57 mumol/L but with low cytotocitity against WI-38 human lung fibroblasts (IC(50) value of 12.128 mumol/L). The compound (0.04-10 mumol/L) induced G(2)-M phase arrest in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was reversible after the compound was removed. The compound (10-300 mumol/L) induced the depolymerization of purified porcine tubulin in vitro. Finally, the compound (0.04-2.5 mumol/L) induced apoptosis of HeLa cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. CONCLUSION: 6-Chloro-4-(methoxyphenyl) coumarin is a novel microtubule-targeting agent that induces G(2)-M arrest and apoptosis in HeLa cells.","['Ma, Yi-ming', 'Zhou, Yu-bo', 'Xie, Chuan-ming', 'Chen, Dong-mei', 'Li, Jia']","['Ma YM', 'Zhou YB', 'Xie CM', 'Chen DM', 'Li J']","['National Center for Drug Screening, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2011176 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2011.176 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2012 Mar;33(3):407-17. doi: 10.1038/aps.2011.176.

The combined effect of SG511 and cisplatin on HeLa and HT-29 cells was assessed by a crystal violet assay and an MTT assay, followed by combination index analysis. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by DAPI staining and visualized by fluorescein-mediated signal detection. Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by flow cytometric analysis of Rhodamine 123 accumulation. The activation of the caspase pathway and the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins were examined by western blotting. Results show that SG511 vector infected various human cancer cell lines and induced growth inhibition effectively. Of note, SG511 synergistically enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of cisplatin, a DNA-damaging agent, against HeLa and HT-29 cells in vitro, concomitantly with increased apoptosis and activation of the mitochondrial pathway. Furthermore, treatment with SG511 alone or in combination with cisplatin resulted in reduced expression the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 in HeLa and HT-29 cells. Importantly, this combination did not increase the growth inhibitory effects of cisplatin on human normal liver cells. Collectively, SG511, a novel fiber chimeric oncolytic adenovirus, sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis by reducing anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein levels.","['You, Liangshun', 'Wang, Ying', 'Jin, Yingming', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['You L', 'Wang Y', 'Jin Y', 'Qian W']","['Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/05/31 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2011/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.1636 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Apr;27(4):971-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.1636.

This new tool, developed in a LightCycler 2.0, combines four different fluorescence channels for the simultaneous detection, in a single close tube, of critical mutations within the ABL kinase domain.

JC virus was recently found to target promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), punctuate domains in the nuclei. Thus, the virus progenies cluster in dots as intranuclear inclusions (ie, as dot-shaped inclusions). In the present study, both the viral major and minor capsid proteins were expressed from polycistronic expression vectors with a powerful promoter, and formation into virus-like particles (VLPs) was examined by electron microscopy. When the upstream regulatory sequence including the agnogene (nt 275 to 490) was present, capsid protein expression was suppressed, but numerous VLPs were efficiently formed with restricted accumulation to PML-NBs. VLPs were uniform, and the cells were severely degraded. In contrast, when the 5' terminus of the agnogene (nt 275 to 409; 135 bp) was deleted, capsid protein expression was markedly enhanced, but VLPs were more randomly produced in the nucleus outside of PML-NBs. VLPs were pleomorphic, and cell degradation was minimal. JC virus association with PML-NBs was confirmed in human brain tissues by structured illumination microscopy.

III-10 is a newly synthesized flavonoid with a pyrrolidinyl and a benzyl group substitution. It shares a same carbon skeleton with flavonoid which indicates that it may also have potential anticancer activity. To investigate whether III-10 could express anticancer effect on human U937 leukemia cells through differentiation induction, a series of experiments were processed. MTT and trypan-blue excluding assays showed that III-10 possessed growth and viability inhibition effects on U937 cells. Giemsa staining was implemented to observe the morphologic changes of U937 cells after III-10 treatment. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay and cell surface antigen flow cytometry were carried out to figure out the way III-10 induced U937 cells to differentiate. These experiments revealed that III-10 could induce U937 cells to differentiate into monocyte-like cells. Western blots and immunofluorescence were performed to inspect the possible underlying mechanism. The results revealed that differentiation-related proteins phospholipids scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) were up-regulated after III-10 treatment. And III-10 stimulated PLSCR1 and PML probably through activation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta). All these results suggested that III-10 was a prospective anticancer compound and was requisite to be proceeded further investigation.","['Qin, Yansu', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'Chen, Yan', 'Hui, Hui', 'Sun, Yajing', 'Yang, Hao', 'Lu, Na', 'Guo, Qinglong']","['Qin Y', 'Li Z', 'Chen Y', 'Hui H', 'Sun Y', 'Yang H', 'Lu N', 'Guo Q']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China. qys0518@163.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0928-0987(12)00027-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2012.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2012 Apr 11;45(5):648-56. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2012.01.004.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a proprietary extract of Panax quinquefolius, CVT-E002, in reducing ARI. METHODS: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 293 subjects with early-stage, untreated CLL conducted January-March 2009. RESULTS: ARI was common, occurring on about 10% of days during the study period. There were no significant differences of the 2 a priori primary end points: ARI days (8.5 +/- 17.2 for CVT-E002 vs 6.8 +/- 13.3 for placebo) and severe ARI days (2.9 +/- 9.5 for CVT-E002 vs 2.6 +/- 9.8 for placebo). However, 51% of CVT-E002 vs 56% of placebo recipients experienced at least 1 ARI (difference, -5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -16% to 7%); more intense ARI occurred in 32% of CVT-E002 vs 39% of placebo recipients (difference, -7%; 95% CI, -18% to 4%), and symptom-specific evaluation showed reduced moderate to severe sore throat (P = .004) and a lower rate of grade >/=3 toxicities (P = .02) in CVT-E002 recipients. Greater seroconversion (4-fold increases in antibody titer) vs 9 common viral pathogens was documented in CVT-E002 recipients (16% vs 7%, P = .04). LIMITATIONS: Serologic evaluation of antibody titers was not tied to a specific illness, but covered the entire study period. CONCLUSION: CVT-E002 was well tolerated. It did not reduce the number of ARI days or antibiotic use; however, there was a trend toward reduced rates of moderate to severe ARI and significantly less sore throat, suggesting that the increased rate of seroconversion most likely reflects CVT-E002-enhanced antibody responses.","['High, Kevin P', 'Case, Doug', 'Hurd, David', 'Powell, Bayard', 'Lesser, Glenn', 'Falsey, Ann R', 'Siegel, Robert', 'Metzner-Sadurski, Joanna', 'Krauss, John C', 'Chinnasami, Bernard', 'Sanders, George', 'Rousey, Steven', 'Shaw, Edward G']","['High KP', 'Case D', 'Hurd D', 'Powell B', 'Lesser G', 'Falsey AR', 'Siegel R', 'Metzner-Sadurski J', 'Krauss JC', 'Chinnasami B', 'Sanders G', 'Rousey S', 'Shaw EG']","['Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157-1042, USA. khigh@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Support Oncol,The journal of supportive oncology,101181305,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2011/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1544-6794(11)00249-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.suponc.2011.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Support Oncol. 2012 Sep-Oct;10(5):195-201. doi: 10.1016/j.suponc.2011.10.005.

Allergic asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways associated with enhanced degranulation and cytokine generation. The LM-COS (<1 kDa), consisting of glucosamine (GlcN)(n), n=3-5, were capable of inhibiting both antigen-stimulated degranulation and cytokine generation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. The protective effect of LM-COS against ovalbumin (OVA)-induced lung inflammation in asthma model mice was also examined. Oral administration of LM-COS (16 mg/kg body weight/day) resulted in a significant reduction in both mRNA and protein levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); The protein levels of IL-4, IL-13 and TNF-alpha in BALF were decreased by 5.8-fold, 3.0-fold and 9.9-fold, respectively, compared to those in the OVA-sensitized/challenged asthma control group.

Our previous study showed that juglone inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells with an IC50 value approximately 8 muM. To further explore the proapoptotic mechanism of juglone, we investigated the role of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoptosis induced by juglone in HL-60 cells. The generation of ROS was about 2 to 8-fold as compared to control cell after treatment with juglone (2, 4 and 8 muM) for 24 h. The glutathione (GSH) depletion was consistent with ROS generation after treatment with juglone. Reversal of apoptosis in antioxidants (NAC and catalase) pretreated cells indicated the involvement of ROS in juglone-induced apoptosis. The cleavage of PARP and procaspase-3 and -9, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ( big up tri, openPsim), and release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and Smac induced by juglone were significantly blocked by NAC. NAC also prevented the inhibition the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR proteins by juglone.

Recent findings, however, suggest an alternative mechanism, involving massive chromosome rearrangements in a one-step catastrophic event termed chromothripsis. We report the whole-genome sequencing-based analysis of a Sonic-Hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) brain tumor from a patient with a germline TP53 mutation (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), uncovering massive, complex chromosome rearrangements. Integrating TP53 status with microarray and deep sequencing-based DNA rearrangement data in additional patients reveals a striking association between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis in SHH-MBs. Analysis of additional tumor entities substantiates a link between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis, and indicates a context-specific role for p53 in catastrophic DNA rearrangements. Among these, we observed a strong association between somatic TP53 mutations and chromothripsis in acute myeloid leukemia. These findings connect p53 status and chromothripsis in specific tumor types, providing a genetic basis for understanding particularly aggressive subtypes of cancer.","['Rausch, Tobias', 'Jones, David T W', 'Zapatka, Marc', 'Stutz, Adrian M', 'Zichner, Thomas', 'Weischenfeldt, Joachim', 'Jager, Natalie', 'Remke, Marc', 'Shih, David', 'Northcott, Paul A', 'Pfaff, Elke', 'Tica, Jelena', 'Wang, Qi', 'Massimi, Luca', 'Witt, Hendrik', 'Bender, Sebastian', 'Pleier, Sabrina', 'Cin, Huriye', 'Hawkins, Cynthia', 'Beck, Christian', 'von Deimling, Andreas', 'Hans, Volkmar', 'Brors, Benedikt', 'Eils, Roland', 'Scheurlen, Wolfram', 'Blake, Jonathon', 'Benes, Vladimir', 'Kulozik, Andreas E', 'Witt, Olaf', 'Martin, Dianna', 'Zhang, Cindy', 'Porat, Rinnat', 'Merino, Diana M', 'Wasserman, Jonathan', 'Jabado, Nada', 'Fontebasso, Adam', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Rucker, Frank G', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Koster, Jan', 'Molenaar, Jan J', 'Versteeg, Rogier', 'Kool, Marcel', 'Tabori, Uri', 'Malkin, David', 'Korshunov, Andrey', 'Taylor, Michael D', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Pfister, Stefan M', 'Korbel, Jan O']","['Rausch T', 'Jones DT', 'Zapatka M', 'Stutz AM', 'Zichner T', 'Weischenfeldt J', 'Jager N', 'Remke M', 'Shih D', 'Northcott PA', 'Pfaff E', 'Tica J', 'Wang Q', 'Massimi L', 'Witt H', 'Bender S', 'Pleier S', 'Cin H', 'Hawkins C', 'Beck C', 'von Deimling A', 'Hans V', 'Brors B', 'Eils R', 'Scheurlen W', 'Blake J', 'Benes V', 'Kulozik AE', 'Witt O', 'Martin D', 'Zhang C', 'Porat R', 'Merino DM', 'Wasserman J', 'Jabado N', 'Fontebasso A', 'Bullinger L', 'Rucker FG', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Koster J', 'Molenaar JJ', 'Versteeg R', 'Kool M', 'Tabori U', 'Malkin D', 'Korshunov A', 'Taylor MD', 'Lichter P', 'Pfister SM', 'Korbel JO']","['European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Meyerhofstr. 1, 69117 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2011/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0092-8674(11)01516-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2012 Jan 20;148(1-2):59-71. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.013.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: A systematic search resulting in 46 suitable articles. RESULTS: Due to lack of uniform criteria and adequate studies, the prevalence rates of malnutrition can only be estimated. Based on strengths and weaknesses of included references, prevalence rates are estimated to be 0-10% for leukemia, 20-50% for neuroblastoma, and 0-30% for other malignancies. Whether energy deficiency or inflammation contributed to malnutrition could not be confirmed because the occurrence of energy deficit (low energy intake, increased metabolic rate) or inflammation (related to cachexia) was not convincing. Also, a relationship between these factors and malnutrition was not studied. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal studies are needed to determine which children are at risk of malnutrition, and to investigate the impact of energy deficiency and inflammation on the nutritional status and body composition of childhood cancer patients.","['Brinksma, Aeltsje', 'Huizinga, Gea', 'Sulkers, Esther', 'Kamps, Willem', 'Roodbol, Petrie', 'Tissing, Wim']","['Brinksma A', 'Huizinga G', 'Sulkers E', 'Kamps W', 'Roodbol P', 'Tissing W']","['UMCG School of Nursing and Health, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands. a.brinksma@umcg.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1040-8428(11)00277-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2011.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2012 Aug;83(2):249-75. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2011.12.003.

MiR-31 negatively regulates the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway by targeting NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK). Loss of miR-31 therefore triggers oncogenic signaling. In ATL cells, miR-31 level is epigenetically regulated, and aberrant upregulation of Polycomb proteins contribute to miR-31 downregulation in an epigenetic fashion, leading to activation of NF-kappaB and apoptosis resistance. Furthermore, this emerging circuit operates in other cancers and receptor-initiated NF-kappaB cascade.

Furthermore, it exerted antimicrobial toxicity, vascular effects, downregulation of chaperone induction and plasmid curing in bacterial cells. Here, this drug was found to possess cytotoxic activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines that do not overexpress P-gp, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging between 1.75+/-0.38 muM for GLC14 small cell lung cancer and 34.00+/-4.75 muM for PC-3 prostate cancer cells. HL-60 leukemia and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells exhibited cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death in response to SILA 421. Assessment of global gene expression of SILA 421-treated HL-60 cells was employed to identify cellular pathways affected by the compound and revealed disturbance of DNA replication, transcription and production of apparently misfolded proteins. Endoplasmatic reticulum stress and downregulation of cell cycle, cellular repair mechanisms and growth factor-related signaling cascades eventually resulted in induction of apoptosis in this cell line. In addition to the well established P-gp inhibitory effect of SILA compounds, reversal of resistance to taxanes, which had been reported for SILA 421 and the related molecule SILA 409, may be linked to downregulation of gene expression of kinesins. Interference with DNA replication and transcription seems to be the common denominator of antimicrobial activity and plasmid curing, as well as anticancer toxicity in human cell lines. Thus, in consideration of the full range of putative cellular targets found in the present work, the application of these SILA compounds for treatment of tumors should be further evaluated.","['Olszewski, Ulrike', 'Zeillinger, Robert', 'Kars, Meltem Demirel', 'Zalatnai, Attila', 'Molnar, Jozsef', 'Hamilton, Gerhard']","['Olszewski U', 'Zeillinger R', 'Kars MD', 'Zalatnai A', 'Molnar J', 'Hamilton G']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Society, Cluster of Translational Oncology, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,2012/01/24 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2011/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-20120119-004 [pii]', '10.2174/187152012800617777 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2012 Jul;12(6):663-71. doi: 10.2174/187152012800617777.,,,"['0', '(1,3-dimethyl-1,3-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-bis(3-(1-(4-butypiperazinyl))propyl)dis', 'iloxane)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (SILA-409)', '0 (Siloxanes)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinesins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Piperazines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Folding', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Siloxanes/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carrots have been suggested as a potential treatment for leukaemia in traditional medicine and have previously been studied in other contexts as potential sources of anticancer agents. Indicating that carrots may contain bioactive compounds, which may show potential in leukaemia therapies. This study investigated the effects of five fractions from carrot juice extract (CJE) on human lymphoid leukaemia cell lines, together with five purified bioactive compounds found in Daucus carota L, including: three polyacetylenes (falcarinol, falcarindiol and falcarindiol-3-acetate) and two carotenoids (beta-carotene and lutein). Their effects on induction of apoptosis using Annexin V/PI and Caspase 3 activity assays analysed via flow cytometry and inhibition of cellular proliferation using Cell Titer Glo assay and cell cycle analysis were investigated. Treatment of all three lymphoid leukaemia cell lines with the fraction from carrot extracts which contained polyacetylenes and carotenoids was significantly more cytotoxic than the 4 other fractions. Treatments with purified polyacetylenes also induced apoptosis in a dose and time responsive manner. Moreover, falcarinol and falcarindiol-3-acetate isolated from Daucus carota L were more cytotoxic than falcarindiol. In contrast, the carotenoids showed no significant effect on either apoptosis or cell proliferation in any of the cells investigated. This suggests that polyacetylenes rather than beta-carotene or lutein are the bioactive components found in Daucus carota L and could be useful in the development of new leukemic therapies. Here, for the first time, the cytotoxic effects of polyacetylenes have been shown to be exerted via induction of apoptosis and arrest of cell cycle.","['Zaini, Rana G', 'Brandt, Kirsten', 'Clench, Malcolm R', 'Le Maitre, Christine L']","['Zaini RG', 'Brandt K', 'Clench MR', 'Le Maitre CL']","['Biomedical Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University, Faculty of Health and Well Being, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,2012/01/24 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-20120119-002 [pii]', '10.2174/187152012800617704 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2012 Jul;12(6):640-52. doi: 10.2174/187152012800617704.,,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '01YAE03M7J (beta Carotene)', '25067-58-7 (Polyynes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'X72A60C9MT (Lutein)']",IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Daucus carota/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lutein/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Polyynes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'beta Carotene/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A consensus diagnosis of NHL was reached in 195 of the 207 cases (94%). B-cell lymphomas constituted 88% of NHL, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 38.5%) and follicular lymphoma (25.1%) were the most common subtypes. There was a high frequency of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (10.3%), as well as of extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (2.6%) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (0.5%). Extranodal presentation was seen in 74 of the 195 cases (38%) and the most common extranodal presentation was in the stomach (37.6%). The most common gastric lymphoma was DLBCL (54.5%) followed by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (41%). Overall, the frequency of NHL subtypes in Chile is between that reported in Western and Eastern countries, which is probably a reflection of the admixture of ethnicities as well as the environment and socioeconomic status of its population.","['Cabrera, Maria Elena', 'Martinez, Virginia', 'Nathwani, Bharat N', 'Muller-Hermelink, H Konrad', 'Diebold, Jacques', 'Maclennan, Kenneth A', 'Armitage, James', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D']","['Cabrera ME', 'Martinez V', 'Nathwani BN', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Diebold J', 'Maclennan KA', 'Armitage J', 'Weisenburger DD']","['Seccion de Hematologia, Hospital del Salvador, and Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile. mecabrera@vtr.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.654471 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jul;53(7):1311-7. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.654471.

The spectrum of infectious complications during and after dasatinib therapy is not known. Retrospective analysis of records among 69 patients treated with dasatinib showed that 35 (51%) developed 57 episodes of infection. Twenty-nine (51%) episodes occurred during neutropenia, and 25 (44%) were microbiologically confirmed. Compared with patients who did not develop infection with dasatinib therapy, patients with infection were significantly more likely to have acute lymphocytic leukemia (51% vs. 18%; p </= 0.005) and to have received high-dose corticosteroids (51% vs. 26%; p </= 0.05). Patients with infection were also more likely to have received dasatinib with another antineoplastic agent (57% vs. 35% without infection; p = 0.09). On multivariate analysis, treatment with three or more cycles of dasatinib increased the risk of infection (odds ratio 11.7; 95% confidence interval 2.5-54.3; p = 0.002). The presence of comorbidities tended to increase the risk of infection (odds ratio 3.9; 95% confidence interval 0.9-17.9; p = 0.07). Interestingly, viral infections, including a single case of cytomegalovirus colitis, were uncommon (7%). The rate of death in 57 patients during follow-up was non-significantly higher in patients with infection versus those without infection (35% vs. 18%; p = 0.18). Infection-associated deaths were noted in only two patients (10%) who had an infection and died. The results of our analysis suggest that antibacterial prophylaxis is important in patients who develop neutropenia during dasatinib therapy, although routine antifungal and anti-cytomegalovirus prophylaxis may not be necessary.","['Rodriguez, Gilhen H', 'Ahmed, Saud I', 'Al-akhrass, Fadi', 'Rallapalli, Vijayashri', 'Safdar, Amar']","['Rodriguez GH', 'Ahmed SI', 'Al-akhrass F', 'Rallapalli V', 'Safdar A']","['The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/01/24 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/01/24 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.656626 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Aug;53(8):1530-5. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.656626.

In previous studies, we identified the gene encoding Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1; the PTPN13 gene) as an Icsbp target. In the current study, we determine that repression of PTPN13 by Icsbp requires cooperation with Tel and histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3). These factors form a multiprotein complex that requires pre-binding of Tel to the PTPN13 cis element with subsequent recruitment of Icsbp and Hdac3. We found that knockdown of Tel or Hdac3 in myeloid cells increases Fap1 expression and results in Fap1-dependent resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. The TEL gene was initially identified due to involvement in leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations. The first identified TEL translocation partner was the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PdgfRbeta). The resulting Tel-PdgfRbeta fusion protein exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and influences cellular proliferation. In the current studies, we find that Tel-PdgfRbeta influences apoptosis in a manner that is independent of tyrosine kinase activity. We found that Tel-PdgfRbeta expressing myeloid cells have increased Fap1 expression and Fap1-dependent Fas resistance. We determined that interaction between Tel and Tel-PdgfRbeta decreases Tel/Icsbp/Hdac3 binding to the PTPN13 cis element, resulting in increased transcription. Therefore, these studies identify a novel mechanism by which the Tel-PdgfRbeta oncoprotein may contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Huang, Weiqi', 'Hu, Liping', 'Bei, Ling', 'Hjort, Elizabeth', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Huang W', 'Hu L', 'Bei L', 'Hjort E', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine and the Robert H.

Activation of beta-catenin was linked to CML leukemogenesis and drug resistance through its BCR-ABL-dependent Y phosphorylation and impaired binding to GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3beta). Herein, we show that GSK3beta is constitutively Y(216) phospho-activated and predominantly relocated to the cytoplasm in primary CML stem/progenitor cells compared with its balanced active/inactive levels and cytosolic/nuclear distribution in normal cells. Under cytokine support, persistent GSK3beta activity and its altered subcellular localization were correlated with BCR-ABL-dependent and -independent activation of MAPK and p60-SRC/GSK3beta complex formation. Specifically, GSK3beta activity and nuclear import were increased by imatinib mesylate (IM), a selective ABL inhibitor, but prevented by dasatinib that targets both BCR-ABL- and cytokine-dependent MAPK/p60-SRC activity. SB216763, a specific GSK3 inhibitor, promoted an almost complete suppression of primary CML stem/progenitor cells when combined with IM, but not dasatinib, while sparing bcr-abl-negative cells. Our data indicate that GSK3 inhibition acts to prime a pro-differentiative/apoptotic transcription program in the nucleus of IM-treated CML cells by affecting the beta-catenin, cyclinD1, C-EBPalpha, ATF5, mTOR, and p27 levels.

Elevated extracellular ATP is known to exacerbate GVHD, and the pharmacologic activation of the adenosine A2A receptor is protective. However, the role of endogenous adenosine is unknown. We used gene-targeted mice and a pharmacologic inhibitor to test the role of adenosine generated by CD73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase in GVHD. In allogeneic transplants, both donor and recipient CD73 were protective, with recipient CD73 playing the dominant role. CD73 deficiency led to enhanced T-cell expansion and IFN-gamma and IL-6 production, and the migratory capacity of Cd73-/- T cells in vitro was increased. However, the number of regulatory T cells and expression of costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells were unchanged. A2A receptor deficiency led to increased numbers of allogeneic T cells, suggesting that signaling through the A2A receptor via CD73-generated adenosine is a significant part of the mechanism by which CD73 limits the severity of GVHD. Pharmacologic blockade of CD73 also enhanced graft-versus-tumor activity. These data have clinical implications, as both the severity of GVHD and the strength of an alloimmune antitumor response could be manipulated by enhancing or blocking CD73 activity or adenosine receptor signaling depending on the clinical indication.","['Tsukamoto, Hiroki', 'Chernogorova, Petya', 'Ayata, Korcan', 'Gerlach, Ulrike V', 'Rughani, Ankur', 'Ritchey, Jerry W', 'Ganesan, Jayanthi', 'Follo, Marie', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Thompson, Linda F', 'Idzko, Marco']","['Tsukamoto H', 'Chernogorova P', 'Ayata K', 'Gerlach UV', 'Rughani A', 'Ritchey JW', 'Ganesan J', 'Follo M', 'Zeiser R', 'Thompson LF', 'Idzko M']","['Immunobiology and Cancer Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/01/21 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/01/21 06:00'],"['2012/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47895-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-09-375899 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 10;119(19):4554-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-09-375899.

Mutations of thrombopoietin, the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), and the erythropoietin receptor and mutations of other genes involved in the pathogenesis of MPD were investigated in JAK2 wild-type patients. Based on our criteria for childhood MPD, we identified 34 patients with sporadic thrombocythemia (ST), 16 with hereditary thrombocytosis (HT), 11 with sporadic polycythemia (SP), and 3 with hereditary polycythemia (HP). JAK2(V617F) mutations were present in 47.5% of ST and in no HT. The MPL(S505A) mutation was detected in 15/16 HT patients and in no ST (P < .00001). The JAK2(V617F) mutation occurred in 27% of SP patients diagnosed according to the Polycythemia Vera Study Group or World Health Organization 2001 criteria. Children with ST received more cytoreductive drugs than those with HT (P = .0006). After a median follow-up of 124 months, no patient had developed leukemia or myelofibrosis and 5% had thrombosis; the miscarriage rate in thrombocythemic patients was 14%.

We developed a microscale cell culture platform that overcomes these limitations, especially for hematologic cancers. A key feature of the platform is the ability to compartmentalize small populations of adherent and nonadherent cells in controlled microenvironments that can better reflect physiological conditions and enable cell-cell interaction studies. Custom image analysis was developed to measure cell viability and protein subcellular localizations in single cells to provide insights into heterogeneity of cellular responses. We validated our platform by assessing viability and nuclear translocations of NF-kappaB and STAT3 in multiple myeloma cells exposed to different conditions, including cocultured bone marrow stromal cells. We further assessed its utility by analyzing NF-kappaB activation in a primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient sample.

Despite the considerable research on LSCs over the past 2 decades, the clinical significance of these cells remains uncertain. However, if clinically relevant, it is expected that LSCs would be enriched in minimal residual disease and predictive of relapse. CD34(+) subpopulations from AML patients were analyzed by flow cytometry throughout treatment. Sorted cell populations were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for leukemia-specific cytogenetic abnormalities (when present) and by transplantation into immunodeficient mice to determine self-renewal capacity. Intermediate (int) levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity reliably distinguished leukemic CD34(+)CD38(-) cells capable of engrafting immunodeficient mice from residual normal hematopoietic stem cells that exhibited relatively higher ALDH activity. Minimal residual disease detected during complete remission was enriched for the CD34(+)CD38(-)ALDH(int) leukemic cells, and the presence of these cells after therapy highly correlated with subsequent clinical relapse. ALDH activity appears to distinguish normal from leukemic CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and identifies those AML cells associated with relapse.","['Gerber, Jonathan M', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Ngwang, Brownhilda', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Vala, Milada S', 'Morsberger, Laura', 'Galkin, Steven', 'Collector, Michael I', 'Perkins, Brandy', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Griffin, Constance A', 'Sharkis, Saul J', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Jones, Richard J']","['Gerber JM', 'Smith BD', 'Ngwang B', 'Zhang H', 'Vala MS', 'Morsberger L', 'Galkin S', 'Collector MI', 'Perkins B', 'Levis MJ', 'Griffin CA', 'Sharkis SJ', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Karp JE', 'Jones RJ']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. jgerber2@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/01/21 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/01/21 06:00'],"['2012/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49146-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-364182 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Apr 12;119(15):3571-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-364182.

We previously showed that performing GT in utero overcomes this obstacle and results in significant levels of transduction within multiple fetal organs, with different tissues exhibiting optimal transduction at different developmental stages. We undertook the present study aiming to elucidate the mechanism for this age-dependent transduction, testing the two factors that we hypothesized could be responsible: (i) the proliferative status of the tissue at the time of GT and (ii) the expression level of the amphotropic PiT-2 receptor. METHODS: Immunofluorescence was performed on tissues from sheep of varying developmental stages to assess the proliferative status of the predominant cells within each organ as a function of age. After developing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a quantitative reverse transcription chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay, we then quantified PiT-2 expression at the protein and mRNA levels, respectively. RESULTS: The results obtained indicate that the proliferative status of organs at the time of fetal GT is not the major determinant governing transduction efficiency. By contrast, our ELISA and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that PiT-2 mRNA and protein levels vary with gestational age, correlating with the observed differences in transduction efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study explain the age-related differences that we previously observed in transduction efficiency after in utero GT. They also suggest it may be possible to achieve relatively selective GT to specific tissues by performing in utero GT when levels of PiT-2 are maximal in the desired target organ.","['Ozturk, Ferhat', 'Park, Paul J', 'Tellez, Joseph', 'Colletti, Evan', 'Eiden, Maribeth V', 'Almeida-Porada, Graca', 'Porada, Christopher D']","['Ozturk F', 'Park PJ', 'Tellez J', 'Colletti E', 'Eiden MV', 'Almeida-Porada G', 'Porada CD']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,2012/01/21 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/01/21 06:00'],"['2012/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jgm.2607 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2012 Mar;14(3):169-81. doi: 10.1002/jgm.2607.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fetus/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Gestational Age', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sheep', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",,,"['R01 HD043038/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA MH002592-21/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA MH002592-22/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'HD43038/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3934108,,,['NIHMS554512'],,,,,,,,,,,

This mutation confers resistance not only to imatinib, but also to second-generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinases, such as nilotinib and dasatinib. A number of strategies have been implemented to overcome this resistance, but allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only established therapeutic option for a cure. A 61-year-old male was diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic-phase CML in 2002. He was initially treated with imatinib and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was achieved 12 months later. However, after 18 months, a loss of CCyR was observed and a molecular study at 24 months revealed a T315I mutation of the BCR-ABL gene.

Concentration of HNE, main aldehydic product of plasma LDL peroxidation, elevates in atherosclerotic lesions as well as in cultured cells under oxidative stress. Although this reactive aldehyde has been shown to promote apoptosis with the involvement of p38 MAPK and JNK in various mammalian cell lines, roles of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins remain to be deciphered. We demonstrated that HNE-induced apoptosis was accompanied by concurrent downregulations of antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 as well as upregulation of proapoptotic Bak. Furthermore, phoshorylation of Bcl-2 at Thr56, Ser70, and probably more phosphorylation sites located on N-terminal loop domain associated with HNE-induced apoptosis in both U937 and HeLa cells while ectopic expression of a phospho-defective Bcl-2 mutant significantly attenuated apoptosis. In parallel to this, HNE treatment caused release of proapoptotic Bax from Bcl-2. Pharmacological inhbition of IKK inhibited HNE-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Similarly, silencing IKKalpha and -beta both ended up with abrogation of Bcl-2 phosphorylation along with attenuation of apoptosis. Moreover, both IKKalpha and -beta coimmunoprecipitated with Bcl-2 and in vitro kinase assay proved the ability of IKK to phosphorylate Bcl-2. In view of these findings and considering HNE inhibits DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) through prevention of IkappaB phosphorylation/ubiquitination/proteolysis, IKK appears to directly interfere with Bcl-2 activity through phosphorylation in HNE-mediated apoptosis independent of NF-kappaB signaling.","['Bodur, Cagri', 'Kutuk, Ozgur', 'Tezil, Tugsan', 'Basaga, Huveyda']","['Bodur C', 'Kutuk O', 'Tezil T', 'Basaga H']","['Biological Sciences and Bioengineering Program, Sabanci University, Orhanli, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,2012/01/21 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2012/01/21 06:00'],"['2012/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24057 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 Nov;227(11):3556-65. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24057.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)']",IM,"['*Aldehydes/administration & dosage/metabolism', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the results of flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis in 42 cases of T-ALL and T/myeloid acute leukemia also assessed for FLT3 mutation. CD117 was expressed in 21 (50%), and FLT3 was mutated in 8 cases (19%; 1 T-ALL and 7 T/myeloid). FLT3-mutated cases were terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)+/CD2+ (7/8), cytoplasmic CD3+/CD5+ (5/8), CD7+/CD13+/CD15+ (4/6), CD33+ (4/8), CD34+, and CD117+ (bright).

The main goal of this study was to identify the subgroup of patients who may benefit most from VPA treatment. We examined the significance of t(8;21) chromosomal aberration for VPA treatment response among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by direct comparison of AML1/ETO-negative vs. positive leukemic cell-lines as well as bone marrow blasts from AML patients. In t(8;21) AML, leukemogenesis is supposed to be induced via aberrant recruitment of histone deacetylases. AML cell lines of different genotypes (Kasumi-1, Kasumi-6, MV4;11, K562) and diagnostic bone marrow samples from patients were treated with VPA. VPA induced apoptosis in AML1/ETO-positive and MLL-AF4-positive cells in a dose-dependent manner. Differentiation, as indicated by changes in immunophenotype, was observed only in AML1/ETO-positive cells. VPA increased the expression of AML1 target genes - PU.1, C/EBPa, BPI and IGFBP7 only in AML1/ETO-positive cells. This AML1/ETO-specific effect was confirmed also using patient blasts isolated at the time of diagnosis. AML1/ETO-positive leukemia shows specific mechanism of VPA residing from differentiation followed by apoptosis that is accompanied by an increase in the expression of repressed AML1 target genes. Our data suggest that AML1/ETO-positive patients might derive the greatest benefit from VPA treatment.","['Zapotocky, Michal', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Smetana, Karel', 'Stary, Jan', 'Trka, Jan', 'Starkova, Julia']","['Zapotocky M', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Smetana K', 'Stary J', 'Trka J', 'Starkova J']","['CLIP, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University, 2nd Medical School, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University, 2nd Medical School, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Charles University, 1st Medical School, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University, 2nd Medical School, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University, 2nd Medical School, Prague, Czech Republic.

In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of riccardin D on growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) both in vitro and in vivo. Riccardin D effectively inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells as estimated by the MTT assay. Further examination showed that the ability of invasion and migration of NSCLC cells was suppressed on exposure to riccardin D as estimated by the assays of scratch and transwell chamber. The anticancer activity of riccardin D was verified in mice bearing human NSCLC H460 xenografts. Riccardin D injection produced a 44.5% inhibition of cancer growth without apparent signs of toxicity to animals. Further, riccardin D induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells as evidenced by the increases of cells with externalization of phosphatidylserine and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive in H460 xenografts. The analysis of apoptotic proteins showed that riccardin D activated the caspases cascade signaling pathway as demonstrated by the increases of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in NSCLC cells in vitro and in H460 xenografts in mice. The pBR322 DNA relaxation assay indicated that riccardin D inhibited the activity of DNA topo II in H460 and A549 cells, suggesting the mechanism of riccardin D in induction of NSCLC apoptosis. In addition, we studied the activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in NSCLC cells. The activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in supernatants of NSCLC cells were suppressed on exposure to riccardin D as estimated by gelatin zymography assay. The inhibitory effects of riccardin D on expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were verified in H460 xenografts in mice and the decreases of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Erk1/2 might associate with the inhibition of MMPs and NSCLC growth. Together, our results suggest that riccardin D has a high inhibitory effect on human NSCLC growth through induction of apoptosis.","['Xue, Xia', 'Sun, De-Fu', 'Sun, Cui-Cui', 'Liu, Hui-Ping', 'Yue, Bin', 'Zhao, Cui-Rong', 'Lou, Hong-Xiang', 'Qu, Xian-Jun']","['Xue X', 'Sun DF', 'Sun CC', 'Liu HP', 'Yue B', 'Zhao CR', 'Lou HX', 'Qu XJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8800805,2012/01/21 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2012/01/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0169-5002(11)00677-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.12.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Lung Cancer. 2012 Jun;76(3):300-8. doi: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.12.013.

New and novel therapeutic approaches include monoclonal antibody (anti-CD20) therapy, targeted cellular immune therapy and small molecule inhibitors.

In vitro drug resistance determined using an MTT [3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay was carried out in 16 children with newly diagnosed ALL between November 2009 and December 2010. The in vitro therapeutic effects of asparaginase, vincristine, prednisolone, dexamethasone, epirubicin and cytarabine were examined. Although there was no significant association between in vitro drug resistance of leukemic cells and ALL subtypes, ETV6-RUNX1 ALL tended to be more sensitive to asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone. Leukemic cells from girls were significantly more sensitive to epirubicin compared with boys (p = 0.008). Higher leukocyte count at diagnosis was correlated with in vitro resistance to asparaginase and prednisolone (p = 0.03 and 0.05, respectively). Relapse or death occurred in five patients. The leukemic cells from these five patients demonstrated increased in vitro resistance to asparaginase compared to those from the other 11 patients (p = 0.009).

A small discrete mass in the right atrium consisted of similar neoplastic cells, and the spleen was diffusely infiltrated. Tissue distribution was suggestive of intravascular lymphoma. Neoplastic cells in tissue sections were immunoreactive for vimentin, CD18, CD45, and granzyme B and lacked immunoreactivity for cytokeratin.

These patients often have comorbidities, and their treatment must be chosen with care. For those who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy, one of the available options for palliative treatment should be chosen on the basis of an individual risk-benefit assessment. METHODS: Selective literature review. RESULTS: An evaluation of the patient's general condition and comorbidities, a geriatric assessment, and specially designed risk scores are useful aids to the choice of an appropriate treatment. Some elderly patients with AML can benefit from intensive chemotherapy despite their age; for highly selected elderly patients, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is an increasingly feasible option. Hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine can be suitable for some patients. Further options include experimental treatment as part of a clinical trial, and supportive care alone. In the special case of acute promyelocytic leukemia, more than half of all patients can be cured with combination chemotherapy including all-trans retinoic acid. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of elderly AML patients remains poor despite recent therapeutic advances. The appropriate treatment for each patient can be chosen on the basis of a risk-benefit assessment. Clinical trials evaluating new treatments are urgently needed.","['Krug, Utz', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Krug U', 'Buchner T', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Medizinische Klinik A, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3238/arztebl.2011.0863 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2011 Dec;108(51-52):863-70. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2011.0863.

We explored whether the CXCR4 antagonists affected the survival and proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. METHODS: The effects of CXCR4 antagonists AMD3100 and T140 on the survival and proliferation of myeloid leukemia cell lines (U937, HL-60, MO7e, KG1a, and K562) as well as CD34(+) cells obtained from patients with AML and CML were analyzed by flow cytometry by using annexin V and a colorimetric cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: AMD3100, but not T140, stimulated the proliferation of leukemia cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner for up to 5 days (~2-fold increase at a concentration of 10(-5) M), which was not abrogated by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, but was attenuated by RNAi knockdown of CXCR7 transcripts. In contrast, AMD3100 induced a marked decrease in the cell numbers after 5-7 days. AMD3100, but not T140, induced phosphorylation of MAPK p44/p42. AMD3100 increased the number and size of leukemia cell colonies and reduced cell apoptosis during the first 5-7 days of incubation, but the phenomena were reversed during the later period of incubation. CONCLUSION: The effects of CXCR4 antagonists on the proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells are not uniform. AMD3100, but not T140, exerts dual effects, initially enhancing and subsequently inhibiting the survival and proliferation of the cells in vitro.","['Kim, Ha-Yon', 'Hwang, Ji-Young', 'Oh, Yoon-Suk', 'Kim, Seong-Woo', 'Lee, Hyo-Jin', 'Yun, Hwan-Jung', 'Kim, Samyong', 'Yang, Young-Jun', 'Jo, Deog-Yeon']","['Kim HY', 'Hwang JY', 'Oh YS', 'Kim SW', 'Lee HJ', 'Yun HJ', 'Kim S', 'Yang YJ', 'Jo DY']","['Department of Medical Science, School of Medicine, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/01/20 06:01,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2011.46.4.244 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2011 Dec;46(4):244-52. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2011.46.4.244.

Standard treatment usually includes rituximab and chemotherapy. High-dose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is an option for patients in advanced stages or for second-line therapy, leading to improved progression-free survival (PFS) rates. However, the impact of HDT and ASCT remains unclear, as there are hints of an increased risk of second cancers. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HDT plus ASCT with chemotherapy or immuno-chemotherapy in patients with FL with respect to overall survival (OS), PFS, treatment-related mortality (TRM), adverse events and secondary malignancies. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE as well as conference proceedings from January 1985 to September 2011 for RCTs. Two review authors independently screened search results. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy or immuno-chemotherapy with HDT followed by ASCT in adults with previously untreated or relapsed FL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used hazard ratios (HR) as effect measures used for OS and PFS as well as relative risks for response rates. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategies led to 3046 potentially relevant references. Of these, five RCTs involving 1093 patients were included; four trials in previously untreated patients and one trial in relapsed patients. Overall, the quality of the five trials is judged to be moderate. All trials were reported as randomised and judged to be open-label studies, because usually trials evaluating stem cell transplantation are not blinded. Due to the small number of studies in each analysis (four or less), the quantification of heterogeneity was not reliable and not evaluated in further detail. A potential source of bias are uncertainties in the HR calculation. For OS, the HR had to be calculated for three trials from survival curves, for PFS for two trials.We found a statistically significant increased PFS in previously untreated FL patients in the HDT + ASCT arm (HR = 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.54; P < 0.00001). However, this effect is not transferred into a statistically significant OS advantage (HR = 0.97; 95% 0.76 to 1.24; P = 0.81). The subgroup of trials adding rituximab to both intervention arms (one trial) confirms these results and the trial had to be stopped early after an interim analysis due to a statistically significant PFS advantage in the HDT + ASCT arm (PFS: HR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.55; OS: HR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.92). In the four trials in previously untreated patients there are no statistically significant differences between HDT + ASCT and the control-arm in terms of TRM (RR = 1.28; 95% CI 0.25 to 6.61; P = 0.77), secondary acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (RR = 2.87; 95% CI 0.7 to 11.75; P = 0.14) or solid cancers (RR = 1.20; 95% CI 0.25 to 5.77; P = 0.82). Adverse events were rarely reported and were observed more frequently in patients undergoing HDT + ASCT (mostly infections and haematological toxicity).For patients with relapsed FL, there is some evidence (one trial, N = 70) that HDT + ASCT is advantageous in terms of PFS and OS (PFS: HR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61; OS: HR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.89). For this trial, no results were reported for TRM, adverse events or secondary cancers. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the currently available evidence suggests a strong PFS benefit for HDT + ASCT compared with chemotherapy or immuno-chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with FL. No statistically significant differences in terms of OS, TRM and secondary cancers were detected. These effects are confirmed in a subgroup analysis (one trial) adding rituximab to both treatment arms. Further trials evaluating this approach are needed to determine this effect more precisely in the era of rituximab. Moreover, longer follow-up data are necessary to find out whether the PFS advantage will translate into an OS advantage in previously untreated patients with FL.There is evidence that HDT + ASCT is advantageous in patients with relapsed FL.","['Schaaf, Markus', 'Reiser, Marcel', 'Borchmann, Peter', 'Engert, Andreas', 'Skoetz, Nicole']","['Schaaf M', 'Reiser M', 'Borchmann P', 'Engert A', 'Skoetz N']","['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne,Germany. markus.schaaf@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/06/27 06:00,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Jan 18;1:CD007678. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD007678.pub2.,,20120118,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment options for FeLV are limited, associated with serious side effects, and can be cost-prohibitive. The development of drugs used to treat a related retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), has been rapid, leading to the approval of five drug classes. Although structural differences affect the susceptibility of gammaretroviruses to anti-HIV drugs, the similarities in mechanism of replication suggest that some anti-HIV-1 drugs may also inhibit FeLV. This study demonstrates the anti-FeLV activity of four drugs approved by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at non-toxic concentrations. Of these, tenofovir and raltegravir are anti-HIV-1 drugs, while decitabine and gemcitabine are approved to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and pancreatic cancer, respectively, but also have anti-HIV-1 activity in cell culture. Our results indicate that these drugs may be useful for FeLV treatment and should be investigated for mechanism of action and suitability for veterinary use.","['Greggs, Willie M', 'Clouser, Christine L', 'Patterson, Steven E', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Greggs WM', 'Clouser CL', 'Patterson SE', 'Mansky LM']","['Comparative Molecular Biosciences Graduate Program, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, Academic Health Center, University of Minnesota, MN 55455 USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic and Biological Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, Academic Health Center, University of Minnesota, MN 55455 USA.', 'Center for Drug Design, Academic Health Center, University of Minnesota, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, Academic Health Center, University of Minnesota, MN 55455 USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Medical School, University of Minnesota, MN 55455, USA.', 'Comparative Molecular Biosciences Graduate Program, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, MN 55455, USA.', 'Center for Drug Design, Academic Health Center, University of Minnesota, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, Academic Health Center, University of Minnesota, MN 55455 USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic and Biological Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.039909-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2012 Apr;93(Pt 4):900-905. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.039909-0.

The mechanisms of control and the role of BH3-only proteins, such as Bcl-2 like protein 11 extra large and Bad are well studied. By contrast, relatively little is known about the regulation and role of Bcl-2 modifying factor (Bmf). The B-RAF oncogene is mutated in approximately 8% of human tumors. We have previously shown that Bmf is upregulated at the transcript level and is required for apoptosis induced by targeting B-RAF signaling in tumor cells harboring mutant B-RAF. In this study, we show that Bmf is regulated at the post-translational level by mutant B-RAF-MEK-ERK2 signaling. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) directly phosphorylates Bmf on serine 74 and serine 77 residues with serine 77 being the predominant site. In addition, serine 77 phosphorylation reduces Bmf pro-apoptotic activity likely through a mechanism independent of altering Bmf localization to the mitochondria and/or interactions with dynein light chain 2 and the pro-survival proteins, B-cell lymphoma extra large, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. These data identify a novel mode of regulation in Bmf that modulates its pro-apoptotic activity in mutant B-RAF tumor cells.","['Shao, Y', 'Aplin, A E']","['Shao Y', 'Aplin AE']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, 233 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/07/25 06:00,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2011137 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2011.137 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Jan 19;3:e253. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2011.137.,,20120119,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BMF protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.2 (Cytoplasmic Dyneins)', 'EC 3.6.4.2 (DYNLL2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasmic Dyneins/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Serine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,"['R01 GM067893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM067893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA125103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P30CA56036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA056036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3270271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Posttranslational modifications of Tax such as ubiquitination regulate its subcellular localization and hence its function; however, the regulation of Tax trafficking and NF-kappaB activation by host factors is poorly understood. By screening a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme small interfering RNA (siRNA) library, we identified the metalloprotease STAM-binding protein-like 1 (STAMBPL1) as a positive regulator of Tax-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Overexpression of wild-type STAMBPL1, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, enhanced Tax-mediated NF-kappaB activation, whereas silencing of STAMBPL1 with siRNA impaired Tax activation of both the canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling pathways. STAMBPL1 regulated Tax-induced NF-kappaB signaling indirectly by controlling Tax nuclear/cytoplasmic transport and was required for DNA damage-induced Tax nuclear export. Together, these results reveal that the deubiquitinase STAMBPL1 is a key regulator of Tax trafficking and function.","['Lavorgna, Alfonso', 'Harhaj, Edward W']","['Lavorgna A', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06456-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06456-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(6):3357-69. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06456-11.

Furthermore, these data suggest that constitutive DNA-damage level might be useful markers to select AML patients susceptible to receive checkpoint inhibitor in combination with conventional chemotherapy. Moreover, this study demonstrates for the first time that AZD7762 inhibitor targets the CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) primitive leukemic progenitors, which are responsible for the majority of AML patients relapse.

In these patients, it is crucial to identify clinical and biologic parameters with potential prognostic significance. This study prospectively evaluated the usefulness of serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels as a predictor of complications (infectious or not) and outcome in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD: One hundred patients with hematological malignancy were admitted to the ICU from October 2004 until August 2009. In 59 of them serum PCT levels were daily measured from the ICU admission until a maximum period of 10 consecutive days. RESULTS: Hematological diseases were acute leukemia (n=30), lymphoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders (n=18), multiple myeloma (n=7) and other (n=4). Twenty-five patients (42%) had received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Thirty-seven patients (63%) presented neutropenia. Those patients who could not be discharged alive from the ICU presented higher PCT levels on days 1, 2 and 3. PCT levels were significantly higher in those patients with neutropenia or septic shock or other causes of hemodynamic instability. The presence of a microbiologically documented infection, respiratory failure or the need of mechanical ventilation support did not significantly affect PCT levels in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Early serum PCT levels measurement might be useful for predicting mortality in patients with hematological malignancy requiring advanced life support.","['Ferra, Christelle', 'Lacoma, Alicia', 'Garcia, Olga', 'Marcos, Pilar', 'Dominguez, Josep', 'Ribera, Josep Maria']","['Ferra C', 'Lacoma A', 'Garcia O', 'Marcos P', 'Dominguez J', 'Ribera JM']","[""Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Contra la Leucemia Josep Carreras, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Barcelona, Espana. cferra@iconcologia.net""]",['spa'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-7753(11)01168-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.medcli.2011.09.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2012 Apr 14;138(9):385-8. doi: 10.1016/j.medcli.2011.09.036.

The present scientific paper focuses on our previous experience in the field of chemoresistance testing in patients with oncological diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 2005, we sampled 71 patients with a leukaemia (AML, ALL and CML) and 92 patients with a solid tumour (lung and gastrointestinal tract cancer). Malignant cell in vitro drug resistance testing was carried out using cytotoxic methyl-thiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay. RESULTS: Based on the LC50 (lethal concentration of a drug killing 50% of cell population), we found that patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia exhibit a greater degree of resistance than patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In patients with bronchogenic carcinomas, primary resistance to cisplatin was identified in 28% of tested samples, paclitaxel 36%, vincristine 50%, etoposide 56%, vinorelbine 57%, topotecan 62%, gemcitabine 77% and dacarbazine 86%. CONCLUSION: In vitro tests with gastrointestinal tract cancers also suggested high effectiveness of cisplatin (with the exception of gastric carcinoma) that was comparable with 5-fluorouracil. Even though the MTT assay has some limitations (insufficient number of vital cells, possible contamination by non-malignant cells, etc.), this in vitro method proved very effective in testing malignant cell resistance to clinically used cytostatics.","['Hatok, J', 'Matakova, T', 'Jurecekova, J', 'Chudej, J', 'Chudy, P', ""Hul'o, E"", 'Dzian, A', 'Strelka, L', 'Dobrota, D', 'Racay, P']","['Hatok J', 'Matakova T', 'Jurecekova J', 'Chudej J', 'Chudy P', ""Hul'o E"", 'Dzian A', 'Strelka L', 'Dobrota D', 'Racay P']","['Ustav lekarskej biochemie, JLF UK Martin, Slovenska republika. hatok@jfmed.uniba.sk']",['slo'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/02/23 06:00,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['36643 [pii]'],ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2011;24(6):443-6.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nase pat'rocne vysledky in vitro testovania chemorezistencie u onkologickych pacientov.,,,,

CLINICAL FINDINGS: Physical examination revealed the cat was in good body condition but had pale mucous membranes and elevated heart and respiratory rates. Results of hematologic analysis indicated the cat had severe anemia (Hct, 0.07 L/L; reference range, 0.28 to 0.49 L/L) and marked rubricytosis (19.0 x 10(9) cells/L; reference value, 0 cells/L). Results of serologic and PCR assays for detection of FeLV and FIV and PCR assays for detection of Mycoplasma spp were negative. Cytologic evaluation of a bone marrow aspirate and histologic evaluation of a biopsy specimen revealed a predominance of rubriblasts and rubricytes with granulocytopenia. Cytologic evaluation of fine-needle aspirates of the spleen and liver also revealed numerous rubriblasts. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: The cat received transfusions of packed RBCs, and supportive treatment was administered. Analysis of test results yielded a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (erythroid subtype). Because of continued hemolysis and anemia in combination with the diagnosis of erythroleukemia (which has a poor prognosis), the cat was euthanized. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To the authors' knowledge, erythroleukemia has only been reported in cats infected with FeLV. However, results of all diagnostic assays for FeLV were negative in the cat reported here, which suggested that erythroleukemia can develop in cats in the absence of FeLV infection.","['Fischer, Catherine', 'Tan, Emmeline', 'Bienzle, Dorothee']","['Fischer C', 'Tan E', 'Bienzle D']","['Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,2012/01/20 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/01/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/javma.240.3.294 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2012 Feb 1;240(3):294-7. doi: 10.2460/javma.240.3.294.,,,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*pathology/therapy', 'Cats', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/veterinary', 'Euthanasia, Animal', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/therapy/*veterinary']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ubiquitous and advancing microarray technology can measure millions of DNA structural variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) and thousands of gene transcripts (RNA expression microarrays) in cells. Both of these information modalities can be brought to bear on disease etiology. This paper develops a Bayesian network-based approach to integrate SNP and expression microarray data. The network models SNP-gene interactions using a phenotype-centric network. Inferring the network consists of two steps: variable selection and network learning. The learned network illustrates how functionally dependent SNPs and genes influence each other, and also serves as a predictor of the phenotype. The application of the proposed method to a pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia dataset demonstrates the feasibility of our approach and its impact on biological investigation and clinical practice.","['Chang, Hsun-Hsien', 'McGeachie, Michael']","['Chang HH', 'McGeachie M']","[""Children's Hospital Informatics Program, Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. hsun-hsien.chang@childrens.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

A methodology has been proposed for estimating the radiation risk or detriment from a group of six exposed interventional radiologists of the Hospital Universitario La Fe (Valencia, Spain), which had developed general exposition symptoms attributable to deterministic effects of ionizing radiation. Equivalent doses have been periodically registered using termoluminiscence dosimeters (TLD's) and wrist dosimeters, H(p)(10) and H(p)(0.07), respectively, and estimated through the observation of translocations in lymphocytes of peripheral blood (biological methods), by extrapolating the yield of translocations to their respective dose-effect curves. The software RADRISK has been applied for estimating radiation risks in these occupational radiation exposures. The minimum and maximum average excess ratio for skin cancer has been, using wrist physical doses, of [1.03 x 10(-3), 5.06 x 10(-2)], concluding that there is not an increased risk of skin cancer incidence. The minimum and maximum average excess ratio for leukemia has been, using TLD physical doses, of [7.84 x 10(-2), 3.36 x 10(-1)], and using biological doses, of [1.40 x 10(-1), 1.51], which is considerably higher than incidence rates, showing an excess radio-induced risk of leukemia in the group under study. Finally, the maximum radiological detriment in the group, evaluated as the total number of radio-induced cancers using physical dosimetry, has been of 2.18 per 1000 person-year (skin and leukemia), and using biological dosimetry of 9.20 per 1000 PY (leukemia). As a conclusion, this study has provided an assessment of the non-deterministic effects (rate of radio-induced cancer incidence) attributable to the group under study due to their professional activity.","['Ramos, M', 'Montoro, A', 'Almonacid, M', 'Barquinero, S Ferrer J F', 'Tortosa, R', 'Miro, R', 'Verdu, G', 'Rodriguez, P', 'Barrios, L L', 'Villaescusa, J I']","['Ramos M', 'Montoro A', 'Almonacid M', 'Barquinero SF', 'Tortosa R', 'Miro R', 'Verdu G', 'Rodriguez P', 'Barrios LL', 'Villaescusa JI']","['Department of Chemical and Nuclear Engineering, Polytechnic University of Valencia, Camino de Vera 46022 Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Manihot leaves are also eaten in Latin America and some Asian countries. This work investigated the capacity of aqueous extracts prepared from those vegetables to inhibit the peroxidation of a linoleic acid emulsion. Short chain, volatile C-compounds as markers of advanced lipid peroxidation were measured by gas chromatography by following the ethylene production. The generation of lipid hydroperoxides, was monitored by spectroscopy using N-N'-dimethyl-p-phenylene-diamine (DMPD). The formation of intermediate peroxyl, and other free radicals, at the initiation of the lipid peroxidation was investigated by electron spin resonance, using alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone as spin trap agent. The ability of the extracts to decrease the cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ""inflammation like"" conditions was studied by fluorescence technique using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescine-diacetate as fluorogenic probe, in a cell model of human monocytes (HL-60 cells) activated with phorbol ester.

Like many other human and animal viruses, coronavirus infection of mammalian cells induces apoptosis. In this study, the global gene expression profiles are first determined in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 hours post-infection by Affymetrix array, using avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a model system. It reveals an up-regulation at the transcriptional level of both pro-apoptotic Bak and pro-survival myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). These results were further confirmed both in vivo and in vitro, in IBV-infected embryonated chicken eggs, chicken fibroblast cells and mammalian cells at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. Interestingly, the onset of apoptosis occurred earlier in IBV-infected mammalian cells silenced with short interfering RNA targeting Mcl-1 (siMcl-1), and was delayed in cells silenced with siBak. IBV progeny production and release were increased in infected Mcl-1 knockdown cells compared to similarly infected control cells, while the contrary was observed in infected Bak knockdown cells. Furthermore, IBV infection-induced up-regulation of GADD153 regulated the expression of Mcl-1. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathways by chemical inhibitors and knockdown of GADD153 by siRNA demonstrated the involvement of ER-stress response in regulation of IBV-induced Mcl-1 expression. These results illustrate the sophisticated regulatory strategies evolved by a coronavirus to modulate both virus-induced apoptosis and viral replication during its replication cycle.","['Zhong, Yanxin', 'Liao, Ying', 'Fang, Shouguo', 'Tam, James P', 'Liu, Ding Xiang']","['Zhong Y', 'Liao Y', 'Fang S', 'Tam JP', 'Liu DX']","['School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030191 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-14176 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e30191. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030191.

Bcr-Abl oncoprotein is aberrantly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). It has several distinct functional domains in addition to the Abl kinase domain. The SH3 and SH2 domains cooperatively play important roles in autoinhibiting its kinase activity. Adapter molecules such as Grb2 and CrkL interact with proline-rich region and activate multiple Bcr-Abl downstream signaling pathways that contribute to growth and survival. Therefore, the oncogenic effect of Bcr-Abl could be inhibited by the interaction of small molecules with these domains. Apoptin is a viral protein with well-documented cancer-selective cytotoxicity. Apoptin attributes such as SH2-like sequence similarity with CrkL SH2 domain, unique SH3 domain binding sequence, presence of proline-rich segments, and its nuclear affinity render the molecule capable of interaction with Bcr-Abl. Despite almost two decades of research, the mode of apoptin's action remains elusive because 3D structure of apoptin is unavailable. We performed in silico three-dimensional modeling of apoptin, molecular docking experiments between apoptin model and the known structure of Bcr-Abl, and the 3D structures of SH2 domains of CrkL and Bcr-Abl. We also biochemically validated some of the interactions that were first predicted in silico. This structure-property relationship of apoptin may help in unlocking its cancer-selective toxic properties. Moreover, such models will guide us in developing of a new class of potent apoptin-like molecules with greater selectivity and potency.","['Panigrahi, Soumya', 'Stetefeld, Jorg', 'Jangamreddy, Jaganmohan R', 'Mandal, Soma', 'Mandal, Sanat K', 'Los, Marek']","['Panigrahi S', 'Stetefeld J', 'Jangamreddy JR', 'Mandal S', 'Mandal SK', 'Los M']","['Department of Molecular Cardiology, Lerner Research Institute/NB-50, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028395 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-20104 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e28395. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028395.

We report the clinical significance and molecular characteristics of CTCs and CTC clusters, termed circulating tumor microemboli (CTM), detected in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) undergoing standard treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serial blood samples from 97 patients receiving chemotherapy were analyzed using EpCam-based immunomagnetic detection and a filtration-based technique. Proliferation status (Ki67) and apoptotic morphology were examined. Associations of CTC and CTM number with clinical factors and prognosis were determined. RESULTS: CTCs were present in 85% of patients (77 of 97 patients) and were abundant (mean +/- standard deviation = 1,589 +/- 5,565). CTM and apoptotic CTCs were correlated with total CTC number and were detected in 32% and 57% of patients, respectively. Pretreatment CTCs, change in CTC number after one cycle of chemotherapy, CTM, and apoptotic CTCs were independent prognostic factors. Overall survival was 5.4 months for patients with >/= 50 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood and 11.5 months (P < .0001) for patients with less than 50 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood before chemotherapy (hazard ratio = 2.45; 95% CI, 1.39 to 4.30; P = .002). Subpopulations of apoptotic and of proliferating solitary CTCs were detected, whereas neither were observed within cell clusters (CTM), implicating both protection from anoikis and relative resistance to cytotoxic drugs for cells within CTM. CONCLUSION: Both baseline CTC number and change in CTC number after one cycle of chemotherapy are independent prognostic factors for SCLC. Molecular comparison of CTCs to cells in CTM may provide novel insights into SCLC biology.","['Hou, Jian-Mei', 'Krebs, Matthew G', 'Lancashire, Lee', 'Sloane, Robert', 'Backen, Alison', 'Swain, Rajeeb K', 'Priest, Lynsey J C', 'Greystoke, Alastair', 'Zhou, Cong', 'Morris, Karen', 'Ward, Tim', 'Blackhall, Fiona H', 'Dive, Caroline']","['Hou JM', 'Krebs MG', 'Lancashire L', 'Sloane R', 'Backen A', 'Swain RK', 'Priest LJ', 'Greystoke A', 'Zhou C', 'Morris K', 'Ward T', 'Blackhall FH', 'Dive C']","['Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Wilmslow Rd, Manchester.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.33.3716 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.33.3716 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Feb 10;30(5):525-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.33.3716.

CSCs are thought to sustain cancer progression, invasion, metastasis, and recurrence after therapy. Reports suggest that CSCs are highly resistant to conventional therapy. Emerging evidences show that the chemoresistance of CSCs are in part due to the activation of B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1), a stem cell factor, and a polycomb group family member. BMI1 is reported to regulate the proliferation activity of normal, stem, and progenitor cells. BMI1 plays a role in cell cycle, cell immortalization, and senescence. Numerous studies demonstrate that BMI1, which is upregulated in a variety of cancers, has a positive correlation with clinical grade/stage and poor prognosis.

Infection with A. phagocytophilum leads to inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis and consequently contributes to the longevity of the host cells. Previous studies demonstrated that the infection inhibits the executionary apoptotic machinery in neutrophils. However, little attempt has been made to explore which survival signals are modulated by the pathogen. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, which are considered as important survival pathways in neutrophils, are involved in A. phagocytophilum-induced apoptosis delay. Our data show that infection of neutrophils with A. phagocytophilum activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and suggest that this pathway, which in turn maintains the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, contributes to the infection-induced apoptosis delay. In addition, the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in the activation of NF-kappaB in A. phagocytophilum-infected neutrophils. Activation of NF-kappaB leads to the release of interleukin-8 (IL-8) from infected neutrophils, which, in an autocrine manner, delays neutrophil apoptosis. In addition, enhanced expression of the antiapoptotic protein cIAP2 was observed in A. phagocytophilum-infected neutrophils. Taken together, the data indicate that upstream of the apoptotic cascade, signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a major role for apoptosis delay in A. phagocytophilum-infected neutrophils.","['Sarkar, Arup', 'Hellberg, Lars', 'Bhattacharyya, Asima', 'Behnen, Martina', 'Wang, Keqing', 'Lord, Janet M', 'Moller, Sonja', 'Kohler, Maja', 'Solbach, Werner', 'Laskay, Tamas']","['Sarkar A', 'Hellberg L', 'Bhattacharyya A', 'Behnen M', 'Wang K', 'Lord JM', 'Moller S', 'Kohler M', 'Solbach W', 'Laskay T']","['Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/05/11 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['IAI.05219-11 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.05219-11 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 2012 Apr;80(4):1615-23. doi: 10.1128/IAI.05219-11.

Using hydroxyl-radical footprinting assays, we demonstrated that the distance between the polymerase and RNase H domains in the MoMLV and XMRV RTs is longer than that in the HIV-1 RT by approximately 3.4 A. We identified one naphthyridinone and one hydroxyisoquinolinedione as potent inhibitors of HIV-1 and XMRV RT RNases H with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from approximately 0.8 to 0.02 muM. Two acylhydrazones effective against HIV-1 RT RNase H were less potent against the XMRV enzyme. We also solved the crystal structure of an XMRV RNase H fragment at high resolution (1.5 A) and determined the molecular details of the XMRV RNase H active site, thus providing a framework that would be useful for the design of antivirals that target RNase H.","['Kirby, Karen A', 'Marchand, Bruno', 'Ong, Yee Tsuey', 'Ndongwe, Tanyaradzwa P', 'Hachiya, Atsuko', 'Michailidis, Eleftherios', 'Leslie, Maxwell D', 'Sietsema, Daniel V', 'Fetterly, Tracy L', 'Dorst, Christopher A', 'Singh, Kamalendra', 'Wang, Zhengqiang', 'Parniak, Michael A', 'Sarafianos, Stefan G']","['Kirby KA', 'Marchand B', 'Ong YT', 'Ndongwe TP', 'Hachiya A', 'Michailidis E', 'Leslie MD', 'Sietsema DV', 'Fetterly TL', 'Dorst CA', 'Singh K', 'Wang Z', 'Parniak MA', 'Sarafianos SG']","['Christopher S.

The period of maximal endometrial receptivity is a poorly understood phenomenon. We decided to look at three possible markers of implantation: pinopodes, leukemia inhibitory factor, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 and their correlations. We included in the study 23 idiopathic infertility patients and 21 patients with recurrent spontaneous abortions of unknown etiology. Twenty one fertile patients were also recruited. A biopsy was used for endometrial dating according to the Noyes and Hertig criteria, and assessed for the presence of pinopodes via a scanning electron microscope. Endometria were examined in Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction cycles for the mRNA expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). No difference was found in the stage of pinopodes development, nor in the coverage of endometrial surface between the studied groups. The expression level for LIF mRNA was lower in control patients compared to idiopathic infertility and recurrent miscarriage patients. No difference was detected in the expression of MMP2 between all studied groups. No correlation was found between pinopodes development stage and LIF and MMP2 expressions in endometrium. Of the studied factors, LIF and pinopodes show the most promise as potential markers of endometrial receptivity.

JMJD3 is crucial for erasing histone-3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a modification associated with transcriptional repression and is responsible for the activation of a diverse set of genes. Here, we identify the genes in human leukaemia monocyte (THP-1) human monocytic cells that are significantly affected by the stable knockdown (kd) of JMJD3. Global gene expression levels were detected in stable JMJD3 knockdown THP-1 cells and in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-stimulated JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells by using a 12-plex NimbleGen human whole genome array. In addition, datasets were analysed by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Stable knockdown of JMJD3 in THP-1 cells affected particularly in expression levels and in downstream effects on inflammatory signalling pathways. JMJD3 attenuation down-regulates various key genes in NF-kappaB, chemokine and CD40 signalling, and mostly affects inflammatory disease response molecules. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that JMJD3-kd could inhibit several NF-kappaB-regulated inflammatory genes by recruiting repressive histone-3 lysine-27 trimethylation to their promoters. Moreover, this study significantly highlights the connexion of NF-kappaB with JMJD3, which suggests an epigenetic regulation in different signalling pathways. Finally, this study establishes novel JMJD3 targets through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.","['Das, Nando Dulal', 'Jung, Kyoung Hwa', 'Choi, Mi Ran', 'Yoon, Hyun Soo', 'Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Chai, Young Gyu']","['Das ND', 'Jung KH', 'Choi MR', 'Yoon HS', 'Kim SH', 'Chai YG']","['Division of Molecular and Life Science, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbf.1839 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 2012 Apr;30(3):224-32. doi: 10.1002/cbf.1839.

Specific factors associated with poor prognosis have not been investigated in patients with hypocellular MDS. METHODS: The authors studied a cohort of 253 patients with hypocellular MDS diagnosed at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1993 and 2007 and a cohort of 1725 patients with hyper-/normocellular MDS diagnosed during the same time period. RESULTS: Patients with hypocellular MDS presented more frequently with thrombocytopenia (P < .019), neutropenia (P < .001), low serum beta-2 microglobulin (P < .001), increased transfusion dependency (P < .001), and intermediate-2/high-risk disease (57% vs 42%, P = .02) compared with patients with hyper-/normocellular MDS. However, no difference in overall survival was observed between the 2 groups (P = .28). Multivariate analysis identified poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group >/=2), low hemoglobin (<10 g/dL), unfavorable cytogenetics (-7/7q or complex), increased bone marrow blasts (>/=5%), and high serum lactate dehydrogenase (>600 IU/L) as adverse independent factors for survival. CONCLUSIONS: A new prognostic model based on these factors was built that segregated patients into 3 distinct risk categories independent of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score. This model is independent from the IPSS, further refines IPSS-based prognostication, and may be used to develop of risk-adapted therapeutic approaches for patients with hypocellular MDS.","['Tong, Wei-Gang', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Wierda, William', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Tong WG', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kadia T', 'Borthakur G', 'Jabbour E', 'Ravandi F', 'Faderl S', 'Wierda W', 'Pierce S', 'Shan J', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27420 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Sep 15;118(18):4462-70. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27420.

The mechanisms underlying CPT-mediated responses in cancer cells are not fully understood. MicroRNA (miRNA) play important roles in tumorigenesis and drug sensitivity. However, the interaction between camptothecin and miRNA has not been previously explored. In this study, we verified that miR-125b was down-regulated in CPT-induced apoptosis in cancer cells and that ectopic expression of miR-125b partially restored cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis that was induced by CPT. In addition, we demonstrated that CPT induced apoptosis in cancer cells by miR-125b-mediated mitochondrial pathways via targeting to the 3'-untranslated (UTR) regions of Bak1, Mcl1, and p53. A significant increase in Bak1, Mcl1, and p53 protein levels was detected in response to the treatments of CPT. It is noteworthy that the expression levels of Bak1, Mcl1, and p53 increased in a time-dependent manner and negatively correlated with miR-125b expression. It is noteworthy that we revealed that miR-125b directly targeted the 3'UTR regions of multiple genes in a CPT-induced mitochondrial pathway. In addition, most targets of miR-125b were proapoptotic genes, whereas some of the targets were antiapoptotic genes. We hypothesized that miR-125b may mediate the activity of chemotherapeutic agents to induce apoptosis by regulating multiple targets. This is the first report to show that camptothecin induces cancer cell apoptosis via miRNA-mediated mitochondrial pathways. The results suggest that suppression of miR-125b may be a novel approach for the treatment of cancer.","['Zeng, Cheng-Wu', 'Zhang, Xing-Ju', 'Lin, Kang-Yu', 'Ye, Hua', 'Feng, Shu-Ying', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Chen, Yue-Qin']","['Zeng CW', 'Zhang XJ', 'Lin KY', 'Ye H', 'Feng SY', 'Zhang H', 'Chen YQ']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.111.076794 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.111.076794 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2012 Apr;81(4):578-86. doi: 10.1124/mol.111.076794.

With the prevalent use of imatinib worldwide, it was observed that up to one-third of patients are resistant to or intolerant of imatinib therapy, fueling the search for safer and more effective agents. The newer and more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib were first indicated for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/-intolerant patients, for whom these agents are both safe and efficacious. More recent clinical studies have examined nilotinib and dasatinib in the frontline setting in newly diagnosed patients. Data reported from the phase III ENESTnd (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients) study and the DASISION (Dasatinib versus Imatinib in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Chronic-phase CML) trial support the use of nilotinib and dasatinib as potential new standards for frontline care of newly diagnosed patients with CML in chronic phase. Furthermore, both agents have received regulatory approval for use as frontline agents. These agents have demonstrated significantly superior efficacy compared with imatinib, as measured by complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response rates. In addition, progression to advanced disease was significantly lower for nilotinib, and a trend toward lower progression was observed with dasatinib. Although both nilotinib and dasatinib are generally well tolerated in the frontline setting, they have different safety profiles that may affect their selection as treatment. Understanding the efficacy, safety profiles, and patterns of resistance to various BCR-ABL1 mutations of these newer agents, as well as implementing management strategies to treat adverse events, will help physicians to provide the best therapy options for their patients with CML.","['Erba, Harry P', 'Pham, Dat C', 'Zaiden, Robert', 'Vu, Ho', 'Tai, Shawn']","['Erba HP', 'Pham DC', 'Zaiden R', 'Vu H', 'Tai S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. hperba@med.umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,2012/01/19 06:00,2013/02/14 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2011 Oct;9(10):734-45.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Thiazoles/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances have identified the super elongation complex, containing the eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukaemia (ELL) protein, as a key regulator of transcriptional elongation. Here we show that ELL has a diverse and kinetically distinct role before its assembly into the super elongation complex by stabilizing Pol II recruitment/initiation and entry into the pause site. Loss of ELL destabilizes the pre-initiation complexes and results in disruption of early elongation and promoter proximal chromatin structure before recruitment of AFF4 and other super elongation complex components. These changes result in significantly reduced transcriptional activation of rapidly induced genes. Thus, ELL has an early and essential role during rapid high-amplitude gene expression that is required for both Pol II pause site entry and release.","['Byun, Jung S', 'Fufa, Temesgen D', 'Wakano, Clay', 'Fernandez, Alfonso', 'Haggerty, Cynthia M', 'Sung, Myong-Hee', 'Gardner, Kevin']","['Byun JS', 'Fufa TD', 'Wakano C', 'Fernandez A', 'Haggerty CM', 'Sung MH', 'Gardner K']","['Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/07/27 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms1652 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms1652 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2012 Jan 17;3:633. doi: 10.1038/ncomms1652.,,20120117,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Polymerase II/*chemistry', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism']",,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3272570,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) which was identified as a signalling molecule for survival pathway has been shown recently to be involved in apoptosis also. Recently we reported that ICB3E, a synthetic analogue of Piper betle leaf-derived apoptosis-inducing agent hydroxychavicol (HCH), possesses anti-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) acitivity in vitro and in vivo without insight on mechanism of action. Here we report that ICB3E is three to four times more potent than HCH in inducing apoptosis of leukemic cells without having appreciable effects on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 and monkey kidney epithelial cell line Vero. ICB3E causes early accumulation of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in K562 cells. Unlike HCH, ICB3E treatment caused ROS dependent activation of both JNK, ERK and induced the expression of iNOS leading to generation of nitric oxide (NO). This causes cleavage of caspase 9, 3 and PARP leading to apoptosis. Lack of cleavage of caspase 8 and inability of blocking chimera antibody to DR5 or neutralizing antibody to Fas to reverse ICB3E-mediated apoptosis suggest the involvement of only intrinsic pathway. Our data reveal a novel ROS-dependent JNK/ERK-mediated iNOS activation pathway which leads to NO mediated cell death by ICB3E.","['Biswas, Nabendu', 'Mahato, Sanjit K', 'Chowdhury, Avik Acharya', 'Chaudhuri, Jaydeep', 'Manna, Anirban', 'Vinayagam, Jayaraman', 'Chatterjee, Sourav', 'Jaisankar, Parasuraman', 'Chaudhuri, Utpal', 'Bandyopadhyay, Santu']","['Biswas N', 'Mahato SK', 'Chowdhury AA', 'Chaudhuri J', 'Manna A', 'Vinayagam J', 'Chatterjee S', 'Jaisankar P', 'Chaudhuri U', 'Bandyopadhyay S']","['Division of Cancer and Cell Biology, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

Despite its novel expression pattern, the significance of Rhox6 expression in the differentiation of these cell types remains unknown. To investigate the role that Rhox6 plays in PGCs, cDNA encoding Rhox6 and short-hairpin (sh) RNA directed against Rhox6 transcripts were introduced by unique expression vectors into a genetically engineered mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) line. This ESC line expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the Oct3/4 promoter, thereby allowing us to monitor the presence of undifferentiated ESCs and PGCs in culture in real time. This ESC line was used to isolate clones that stably expressed Rhox6 cDNA, shRNA against Rhox6 transcripts, or controls. Quantitative RT-PCR results validated that overexpression had been achieved, as well as knockdown of Rhox6 transcripts in these ESC clones. However, these clones exhibited a normal appearance of undifferentiated ESCs and expressed EGFP. Next, these ESC clones were induced to differentiate into PGCs by generating embryoid bodies (EBs) in culture medium without leukemia inhibitory factor. Detection of EGFP expression by fluorescence microscopy and germ cell markers by RT-PCR validated the differentiation of PGCs in EBs. The Rhox6 transgene had little, if any, effect on EGFP expression in EBs, whereas Rhox6 knockdown significantly decreased EGFP expression in EBs. Thus, it is suggested with these results that Rhox6 is necessary for determination of the germ cell lineage.","['Liu, Chang', 'Tsai, Paichi', 'Garcia, Ana-Marie', 'Logeman, Brandon', 'Tanaka, Tetsuya S']","['Liu C', 'Tsai P', 'Garcia AM', 'Logeman B', 'Tanaka TS']","['Department of Animal Sciences, Institute for Genomic Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['113342cl [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.113342cl [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2011;55(10-12):909-16. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.113342cl.,,,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Rhox6 protein, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Genetic Engineering/methods', 'Germ Cells/*cytology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Models, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The WHO-2008 diagnostic criteria are recommended, even though in children suspected with essential thrombocythemia (ET), a specific set of diagnostic features may be required. Patient communication includes information on natural history, genetic abnormalities and counseling in all women of child-bearing age. The main challenge in children and young adults with ET and polycythemia vera (PV) is to avoid recurrence of major thrombosis by selecting those patients who ultimately can benefit from cytotoxic and antithrombotic therapy without increasing the incidence of drug-induced side effects. In asymptomatic low-risk patients no therapy is prescribed while in high-risk low-dose aspirin, hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha are my first line drugs. My first decision when considering treatment of a young patient with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or post-PV or post ET-myelofibrosis, is whether he/she qualifies for bone marrow allotransplantation.

It is now the first-line therapy for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia patients worldwide. However, its long-term survival benefit still needs to be established in clinical setting among Asian patients. METHODS: All chronic myeloid leukaemia patients in the chronic phase who were on imatinib mesylate therapy were retrospectively reviewed. Data was collected through a review of case notes, which was then processed, managed and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were included in the study. The cumulative rates of complete haematological response, major cytogenetic response and major molecular response were 93.2%, 75.0% and 34.2%, respectively. The overall survival and event-free survival at five years were 86.0% and 84.9%, respectively. 31.8% of the patients developed anaemia, 29.5% neutropenia and 27.3% thrombocytopenia. A total of 43.2% of patients developed non-haematological side effects. Higher dosage (> 600 mg) and smaller body size (< 60 kg) were risk factors for haematological side effects. Patients with major cytogenetic response and absence of thrombocytopenia had better survival. CONCLUSION: The majority of our chronic myeloid leukaemia patients did well with imatinib therapy. The adverse effects in our patients were tolerable, and no patient had to stop treatment permanently.","['Bee, P C', 'Gan, G G', 'Tai, Y T', 'Haris, A R', 'Chin, E', 'Veera, S N']","['Bee PC', 'Gan GG', 'Tai YT', 'Haris AR', 'Chin E', 'Veera SN']","['Medical Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. bpingchong@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/06/02 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2012 Jan;53(1):57-61.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Malaysia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretransplantation cytoreduction with induction chemotherapy (IC) has been used to reduce relapse rates but is associated with significant toxicity and mortality. Hypomethylating agents may achieve cytoreduction with limited toxicity; however, data on the effect of pre-HCT hypomethylation on post-HCT outcomes are limited. We retrospectively reviewed results in 68 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia transformed from MDS. Thirty-five patients had received cytoreduction with azacitidine before HCT with either a high-dose (40%) or a reduced-intensity (60%) conditioning regimen, and 33 had undergone IC before HCT with high-dose conditioning. The estimated 1-year overall survival (OS) was 57% in the azacitidine group and 36% in the IC group. The risk of post-HCT mortality (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.30), nonrelapse mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-2.34), and relapse (hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-2.34) were lower in the azacitidine group compared to the IC group, but only the hazard for relapse was significantly lower. After adjustment for cytogenetic risk, International Prognostic Scoring System, and donor, the rates of post-HCT relapse for the 2 cohorts were similar. Although the current study was retrospective and nonrandomized and needs to be interpreted in this context, the results add to the growing evidence that pre-HCT therapy with azacitidine is associated with less toxicity than IC and may allow for similar post-HCT outcomes.","['Gerds, Aaron T', 'Gooley, Ted A', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Scott, Bart L']","['Gerds AT', 'Gooley TA', 'Estey EH', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Deeg HJ', 'Scott BL']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue N., Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,2012/01/19 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(12)00035-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Aug;18(8):1211-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.01.009.

Primary bone marrow lymphoma (PBML) is a rare entity whose real boundaries and clinicobiological significance are not well defined. Criteria to diagnose PBML encompass isolated bone marrow infiltration, with no evidence of nodal or extranodal involvement, including the bone, and the exclusion of leukemia/lymphomas that are considered to primarily involve the bone marrow. Twenty-one out of 40 lymphomas retrospectively reviewed by the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group from 12 institutions in 7 different countries over a 25-year period fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These cases comprised 4 follicular lymphomas (FLs), 15 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), and 2 peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified. The FL cases showed paratrabecular infiltration, BCL2 protein and CD10 expression, and BCL2 gene rearrangement. DLBCL showed nodular infiltration in 6 cases and was diffuse in 9 cases; it also showed positivity for BCL2 protein (9/10) and IRF4 (6/8). Median age was 65 years with male predominance. All but 3 FL patients were symptomatic. Most cases presented with cytopenias and high lactate dehydrogenase. Four patients (3 FL cases and 1 DLBCL case) had leukemic involvement. Most DLBCL patients received CHOP-like or R-CHOP-like regimens. The outcome was unfavorable, with a median overall survival of 1.8 years. In conclusion, PBML is a very uncommon lymphoma with particular clinical features and heterogenous histology. Its recognition is important to establish accurate diagnosis and adequate therapy.","['Martinez, Antonio', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Hebeda, Konnie M', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Peccatori, Jacopo', 'Campidelli, Cristina', 'Espinet, Blanca', 'Perea, Granada', 'Acevedo, Agustin', 'Mehrjardi, Ali Zare', 'Martinez-Bernal, Monica', 'Gelemur, Marta', 'Zucca, Emanuele', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Campo, Elias', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Rozman, Maria']","['Martinez A', 'Ponzoni M', 'Agostinelli C', 'Hebeda KM', 'Matutes E', 'Peccatori J', 'Campidelli C', 'Espinet B', 'Perea G', 'Acevedo A', 'Mehrjardi AZ', 'Martinez-Bernal M', 'Gelemur M', 'Zucca E', 'Pileri S', 'Campo E', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Rozman M']","['Hematopathology and Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAS.0b013e31823ea106 [doi]', '00000478-201202000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2012 Feb;36(2):296-304. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e31823ea106.,,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",['International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VEGFs and VEGF-Rs are not only expressed on endothelial cells but also on various subtypes of solid tumors and leukemias contributing to the growth of the malignant cells. This study was performed to examine whether VEGF-R2 (KDR) and VEGF-R3 (FLT4) are regulated by DNA methylation. METHODS: Real-time (RT) PCR analysis was performed to quantify KDR and FLT4 expression in some ninety leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs). Western blot analyses and flow cytometric analyses confirmed results at the protein level. After bisulfite conversion of DNA we determined the methylation status of KDR and FLT4 by DNA sequencing and by methylation specific PCR (MSP). Western blot analyses were performed to examine the effect of VEGF-C on p42/44 MAPK activation. RESULTS: Expression of KDR and FLT4 was observed in cell lines from various leukemic entities, but not in lymphoma cell lines: 16% (10/62) of the leukemia cell lines expressed KDR, 42% (27/65) were FLT4 positive. None of thirty cell lines representing six lymphoma subtypes showed more than marginal expression of KDR or FLT4. Western blot analyses confirmed KDR and FLT4 protein expression in HDMECs, HUVECs and in cell lines with high VEGF-R mRNA levels. Mature VEGF-C induced p42/44 MAPK activation in the KDR- /FLT4(+) cell line OCI-AML1 verifying the model character of this cell line for VEGF-C signal transduction studies. Bisulfite sequencing and MSP revealed that GpG islands in the promoter regions of KDR and FLT4 were unmethylated in HUVECs, HDMECs and KDR(+) and FLT4(+) cell lines, whereas methylated cell lines did not express these genes. In hypermethylated cell lines, KDR and FLT4 were re-inducible by treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine, confirming epigenetic regulation of both genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that VEGF-Rs KDR and FLT4 are silenced by DNA methylation. However, if the promoters are unmethylated, other factors (e.g. transactivation factors) determine the extent of KDR and FLT4 expression.","['Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Eberth, Sonja', 'Romani, Julia', 'Weich, Herbert A', 'Zaborski, Margarete', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Eberth S', 'Romani J', 'Weich HA', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. jrh@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-19 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Jan 17;12:19. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-19.,,20120117,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/genetics/*physiology', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,PMC3297533,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that increased expression of miR-181a and miR-181b is also significantly (P < .05; Cox regression) associated with favorable overall survival in cytogenetically abnormal AML (CA-AML) patients. We further show that up-regulation of a gene signature composed of 4 potential miR-181 targets (including HOXA7, HOXA9, HOXA11, and PBX3), associated with down-regulation of miR-181 family members, is an independent predictor of adverse overall survival on multivariable testing in analysis of 183 CA-AML patients. The independent prognostic impact of this 4-homeobox-gene signature was confirmed in a validation set of 271 CA-AML patients. Furthermore, our in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that ectopic expression of miR-181b significantly promoted apoptosis and inhibited viability/proliferation of leukemic cells and delayed leukemogenesis; such effects could be reversed by forced expression of PBX3. Thus, the up-regulation of the 4 homeobox genes resulting from the down-regulation of miR-181 family members probably contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with nonfavorable CA-AML. Restoring expression of miR-181b and/or targeting the HOXA/PBX3 pathways may provide new strategies to improve survival substantially.","['Li, Zejuan', 'Huang, Hao', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Chen, Ping', 'Arnovitz, Stephen', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Elkahloun, Abdel', 'Yang, Xinan', 'He, Chunjiang', 'He, Miao', 'Zhang, Zhiyu', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Price, Colles', 'Lussier, Yves A', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Liu, Paul P', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Li Z', 'Huang H', 'Li Y', 'Jiang X', 'Chen P', 'Arnovitz S', 'Radmacher MD', 'Maharry K', 'Elkahloun A', 'Yang X', 'He C', 'He M', 'Zhang Z', 'Dohner K', 'Neilly MB', 'Price C', 'Lussier YA', 'Zhang Y', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Bullinger L', 'Valk PJ', 'Delwel R', 'Lowenberg B', 'Liu PP', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Rowley JD', 'Chen J']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45979-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-386235 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 8;119(10):2314-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-386235.

In this case, a popular design approach is to specify the response rate and the prevalence of each subgroup, to calculate the response rate of the whole population by the weighted average of the response rates across subgroups, and to choose a standard Phase II design such as Simon's optimal or minimax design to test the response rate for the whole population. In this case, although the prevalence of each subgroup is accurately specified, the observed prevalence among the accrued patients to the study may be quite different from the expected one because of the small sample size, which is typical in most Phase II trials. The fixed rejection value for a chosen standard Phase II design may be either too conservative (i.e., increasing the false rejection probability of the experimental therapy) if the trial accrues more high-risk patients than expected, or too anti-conservative (i.e., increasing the false acceptance probability of the experimental therapy) if the trial accrues more low-risk patients than expected. We can avoid such problems by adjusting the rejection values, depending on the observed prevalence from the trial. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the flexible designs compared with the standard design with fixed rejection values under various settings.","['Jung, Sin-Ho', 'Chang, Myron N', 'Kang, Sun J']","['Jung SH', 'Chang MN', 'Kang SJ']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B Statistical Center and Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA. sinho.jung@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Biopharm Stat,Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics,9200436,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10543406.2010.536873 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biopharm Stat. 2012;22(2):312-28. doi: 10.1080/10543406.2010.536873.,,,"['0 (Drugs, Investigational)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Drugs, Investigational/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Research Design/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sample Size', 'Therapies, Investigational']",,,"['P01 CA142538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142538-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000064/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA142538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3324125,,,['NIHMS361921'],,,,,,,,,,,

NME2 protein was highly overexpressed in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 29/30 patients with CML at diagnosis and 10/10 patients resistant to imatinib. Protein was overexpressed in the absence of increased levels of mRNA and was limited to Bcr-Abl + populations, being absent from Bcr-Abl - patient cells, normal donors and 14/15 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. Furthermore, the Bcr-Abl dependent overexpression of NME2 protein was reversed specifically by tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment of Ba/F3 expressing wild-type and TKI-sensitive, but not TKI-resistant, mutants of Bcr-Abl. The post-transcriptional up-regulation of the tumor antigen NME2 is therefore a common and specific property of CML closely associated with Bcr-Abl activity.","['Tschiedel, Sabine', 'Bach, Enrica', 'Jilo, Annette', 'Wang, Song-Yau', 'Lange, Thoralf', 'Al-Ali, Haifa-Kathrin', 'Vucinic, Vladan', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Cross, Michael']","['Tschiedel S', 'Bach E', 'Jilo A', 'Wang SY', 'Lange T', 'Al-Ali HK', 'Vucinic V', 'Niederwieser D', 'Cross M']","['Division of Hematology, Internal Oncology and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.656631 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Aug;53(8):1569-76. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.656631.

Growth-related oncogene-alpha (GRO-alpha)/CXCL1, a neutrophil-related chemokine, have an important influence on the chronic inflammation of these diseases. It is unknown whether vitamin D has regulatory effects on GRO-alpha expression in human monocytes. To this end, the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, and human primary monocytes were pretreated with 1alpha, 25-(OH)(2)D(3), and was stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Supernatants were collected to determine GRO-alpha level by ELISA. The intracellular signaling was investigated by nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB inhibitor, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, and Western blot. In our studies, LPS-induced GRO-alpha was significantly enhanced in THP-1 cells, but suppressed in human primary monocytes by 1alpha, 25-(OH)(2)D(3). Western blotting revealed that 1alpha, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) increased LPS-stimulated pp38 expression in THP-1 cells, but suppressed LPS-stimulated pMEK1/2-pERK and pJNK in human primary monocytes. In conclusion, the opposite effects of 1alpha, 25-(OH)(2)D(3) on GRO-alpha expression in THP-1 cells and human primary monocytes indicated that the data from THP-1 cells should be further confirmed by human primary monocytes. Moreover, vitamin D3 may have potentiality in treating GRO-alpha-related chronic inflammatory diseases, like asthma and autoimmune diseases.","['Kuo, Yu-Ting', 'Jan, Ren-Long', 'Kuo, Chang-Hung', 'Kuo, Po-Lin', 'Wang, Wei-Li', 'Huang, Ming-Yii', 'Chen, Huan-Nan', 'Hung, Chih-Hsing']","['Kuo YT', 'Jan RL', 'Kuo CH', 'Kuo PL', 'Wang WL', 'Huang MY', 'Chen HN', 'Hung CH']","['Dept of Emergency, Kaohsiung Medical Univ Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Food Sci,Journal of food science,0014052,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02532.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Food Sci. 2012 Feb;77(2):H47-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02532.x.

However, its molecular mechanism of cell death induction has still not been determined. The present study demonstrates that 1 induces apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. Typical morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis were observed in 1-treated cells. Compound 1 induced a concentration-dependent increase in the sub-G1 fraction of the cell cycle. A decrease in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) was also observed. Furthermore, 1 reduced the ratio of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 to pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak, induced cytochrome c release, and increased the activity of caspase 3. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected in 1-treated HL-60 cells, which was attenuated by the pretreatment of cells with a free radical scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC also prevented the increase of the sub-G1 fraction induced by 1. These results indicate that ramentaceone induces cell death through the ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway.","['Kawiak, Anna', 'Zawacka-Pankau, Joanna', 'Wasilewska, Aleksandra', 'Stasilojc, Grzegorz', 'Bigda, Jacek', 'Lojkowska, Ewa']","['Kawiak A', 'Zawacka-Pankau J', 'Wasilewska A', 'Stasilojc G', 'Bigda J', 'Lojkowska E']","['Department of Biotechnology, Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Kladki 24, 80-822 Gdansk, Poland. kawiak@biotech.ug.gda.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,2012/01/19 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2012/01/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/np200247g [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2012 Jan 27;75(1):9-14. doi: 10.1021/np200247g.

Another diagnostic marker of ALT is discrete nuclear co-localized signals of telomeric DNA and the promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML), referred to as ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). Recently, we detected smaller sized co-localized PML and telomere DNA (APB-like) bodies in endothelial cells adjacent to astrocytoma tumour cells in situ. In this study, we examined a wide variety of non-neoplastic tissues, and report that co-localized signals of PML and telomere DNA are present in endothelial, stromal, and some epithelial cells. Co-localized signals of PML and telomere DNA showed an increased frequency in non-neoplastic cells with DNA damage. These results suggest that a mechanism similar to that in ALT-positive tumours also operates in non-neoplastic cells, which may be activated by DNA damage.","['Slatter, Tania L', 'Tan, Xin', 'Yuen, Yi Ching', 'Gunningham, Sarah', 'Ma, Sally Siyan', 'Daly, Erin', 'Packer, Stephen', 'Devenish, Celia', 'Royds, Janice A', 'Hung, Noelyn A']","['Slatter TL', 'Tan X', 'Yuen YC', 'Gunningham S', 'Ma SS', 'Daly E', 'Packer S', 'Devenish C', 'Royds JA', 'Hung NA']","['Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, Health Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,2012/01/18 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2012/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.2981 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2012 Feb;226(3):509-18. doi: 10.1002/path.2981.

In the aberrant regions, we attempted to localize candidate genes with potential relevance to the disease. Using SNP-A, we analyzed peripheral blood granulocytes from 37 MDS patients. The analysis identified 13 cryptic chromosomal defects in 10 patients (27%). Four UPD (affecting chromosomes 3q, 7q, 17q, and 20p), 5 deletions and 4 duplications were detected. Gene expression data measured on CD34+ cells were available for 4 patients with and 6 patients without SNP-A lesions. We performed an integrative analysis of genotyping and gene expression microarrays and found several genes with an altered expression located in the aberrant regions.

The aim here was to determine the incidence of morphological and immunophenotypic AL subtypes in the state of Maranhao, Brazil, and to correlate the expression of aberrant phenotypes in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with prognostic factors. DESIGN AND SETTING: Single prospective cohort study at a public oncology reference center in Maranhao. METHODS: Seventy AL cases were diagnosed between September 2008 and January 2010. For the diagnosis, complete blood cell counts, myelograms (at diagnosis and at the end of the induction phase), cytochemical analysis and immunophenotyping were performed. RESULTS: Among adult patients (n = 22), the incidence of AL types was: ALL (22.7%) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (77.3%). The subtype AML M0 occurred most frequently (29.4%). In children (n = 48), the types were: AML (18.7%), most frequently subtype AML M4 (33.4%); biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) (4.2%); and ALL (77.1%), including the subtypes B-ALL (72.9%) and T-ALL (27.1%). Among the children with ALL, there were no statistically significant differences between patients with and without aberrant phenotypes, in relation to hematological parameters and treatment response. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that the frequencies of AML M0 cases among adults and T-ALL cases among children in Maranhao were high. This suggests that there may be differences in AML subtype incidence, as seen with ALL subtypes, in different regions of Brazil. No association was found between the expression of aberrant phenotypes and prognostic factors, in children with ALL.","['Noronha, Elda Pereira', 'Marinho, Heliana Trindade', 'Thomaz, Erika Barbara Abreu Fonseca', 'Silva, Cintia Assuncao', 'Veras, Geni Lourdes Ramos', 'Oliveira, Raimundo Antonio Gomes']","['Noronha EP', 'Marinho HT', 'Thomaz EB', 'Silva CA', 'Veras GL', 'Oliveira RA']","['Clinical Research Center, University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Maranhao, Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil. eldanoronha@yahoo.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,2012/01/18 06:00,2012/08/01 06:00,['2012/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1516-31802011000600005 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802011000600005 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2011 Dec;129(6):392-401. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802011000600005.,,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/classification/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that the Notch1 receptor promotes survival of glioblastoma cells by regulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. Notch1-dependent regulation of Mcl-1 occurs cell type dependent at a transcriptional or post-translational level and is mediated by the induction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Inhibition of the Notch1 pathway overcomes apoptosis resistance and sensitizes glioblastoma cells to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation, the death ligand TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) or the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor ABT-737.

They display exaggerated apoptosis in early stages, but lose this behavior during evolution to AML. The molecular basis for loss of apoptosis is unknown. To investigate this critical event, we analyzed phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'kinase signaling, implicated as a critical pathway of cell survival control in epithelial and hematological malignancies. PI 3'kinase activates Akt through its production of 3' phosphoinositides. In turn, the phosphoinositides are dephosphorylated by two lipid phosphatases, PTEN and SHIP-1, in myeloid cells. We studied primary MDS-enriched bone marrow cells and bone marrow sections by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and quantitative PCR for components of the SHIP/PTEN/PI 3'kinase signaling circuit. We reported constitutively activated Akt, variable levels of PTEN and uniformly decreased SHIP-1 expression in MDS progenitor cells. Overexpression of SHIP-1, but not the phosphatase-deficient form, inhibited myeloid leukemic growth. Levels of microRNA (miR)-210 and miR-155 transcripts, which target SHIP-1, were increased in CD34(+) MDS cells compared with their normal counterparts. Direct binding of miR-210 to the 3' untranslated region of SHIP-1 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Transfection of a myeloid cell line with miR-210 resulted in loss of SHIP-1 protein expression. These data suggest that miR-155 and miR-210/SHIP-1/Akt pathways could serve as clinical biomarkers for disease progression, and that miR-155 and miR-210 might serve as novel therapeutic targets in MDS.","['Lee, D W', 'Futami, M', 'Carroll, M', 'Feng, Y', 'Wang, Z', 'Fernandez, M', 'Whichard, Z', 'Chen, Y', 'Kornblau, S', 'Shpall, E J', 'Bueso-Ramos, C E', 'Corey, S J']","['Lee DW', 'Futami M', 'Carroll M', 'Feng Y', 'Wang Z', 'Fernandez M', 'Whichard Z', 'Chen Y', 'Kornblau S', 'Shpall EJ', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Corey SJ']","['Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,2012/01/18 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/01/18 06:00'],"['2012/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011579 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.579 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Sep 13;31(37):4085-94. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.579.

One reason might be the limitation of the diagnostic instruments relying mainly on imaging and molecular-based techniques. In this report, we present three cases of toxoplasmosis identified among 155 allograft recipients treated at Greifswald University Hospital. Widely disseminated toxoplasmosis was detected post-mortem in two patients allografted for high-risk multiple myeloma. Clinical signs suspicious for toxoplasmosis occurred after days +32 and +75, respectively. In one case, serology and conventional Toxoplasma gondii PCR, targeting the B1 gene, revealed negative results, while in the other patient, toxoplasmosis was not investigated. Both patients received pentamidine for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PcP) prophylaxis. The third patient, a 68-year-old woman allografted for AML, developed cerebral toxoplasmosis from day +395 after allogeneic SCT with typical signs in magnetic resonance tomography. Toxoplasma DNA was amplified from one of two samples of cerebrospinal fluid. The patient died of disseminated toxoplasmosis despite immediate initiation of therapy. Retrospective comparative testing of clinical specimens by the conventional T. gondii PCR and by a real-time PCR targeting a 529-bp genomic fragment suggests a higher sensitivity of the latter method in our patients. In conclusion, we suggest a rigorous real-time PCR monitoring for high-risk patients or patients with signs of infections suspicious for toxoplasmosis, even though low-copy results are presently difficult to interpret. Our reported cases might also encourage the use of trimethoprim-sufmethoxazole instead of pentamidine for PcP prophylaxis in those patients.","['Busemann, Christoph', 'Ribback, Silvia', 'Zimmermann, Kathrin', 'Sailer, Verena', 'Kiefer, Thomas', 'Schmidt, Christian A', 'Schulz, Katrin', 'Steinmetz, Ivo', 'Dombrowski, Frank', 'Dolken, Gottfried', 'Kruger, William H']","['Busemann C', 'Ribback S', 'Zimmermann K', 'Sailer V', 'Kiefer T', 'Schmidt CA', 'Schulz K', 'Steinmetz I', 'Dombrowski F', 'Dolken G', 'Kruger WH']","['Department of Internal Medicine C (Haematology and Oncology, Marrow Transplantation), Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-University Greifswald, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Str, 17475, Greifswald, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,2012/01/18 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2012/01/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1406-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Jul;91(7):1081-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1406-5.

BCR-ABL regulates activation of many mitogenic and pro-survival pathways, including the PI 3'K/AKT/mTOR pathway that controls various effectors and regulates initiation of mRNA translation in mammalian cells. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the ABL kinase domain have remarkable clinical activity and have dramatically changed the natural history of Ph+ leukemias, resistance to these agents also develops via a wide range of mechanisms. Efforts to target the PI3'K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway using kinase inhibitors have been the focus of extensive ongoing investigations by several research groups. Here we review the effects of activation of the AMPK kinase, which regulates downstream targeting and inhibition of mTOR. The potential for future clinical-translational applications of AMPK activators such as AICAR, metformin and resveratrol for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are discussed.","['Vakana, Eliza', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Vakana E', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

RECENT FINDINGS: A concise summary of European LeukemiaNet guidelines for kinase domain mutation studies was published this year. A new controversial topic emerged: the relevance of IC50 data to guide second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Although flaws in the methodology have been acknowledged, one group summarily rejected IC50 data and recommended that clinicians use individual patient comorbidities and drug safety profiles. The influence of kinase domain mutations on response to second-line and third-line TKI therapy was also published this year; unexpectedly, kinase domain mutations were found to have no effect on response or survival. However, the presence of a kinase domain mutation did influence survival following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Lastly, new findings from laboratories identified transcription factors BCL6 and STAT5 as potential new treatment targets. SUMMARY: The last 12 months has brought much attention to clinical management of patients with kinase domain mutations and identified a new controversy concerning IC50 data use in the clinic.

The BCR-ABL fusion gene, originating in a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell, is the molecular signature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Discovery of this fusion gene has led to the development of one of the first successful targeted molecular therapies for cancer (Imatinib). It illustrates the advances that can result from an understanding of the molecular basis of disease. However, there still remain many as yet unidentified mutations that may influence the initiation or progression of human diseases. Thus, identification and characterization of the mechanism of action of genes that contribute to human diseases is an important and opportune area of current research. One promising candidate as a potential therapeutic target is Abelson helper integration site-1(Ahi-1/AHI-1) that was identified by retroviral insertional mutagenesis in murine models of leukemia/lymphomas and is highly elevated in certain human lymphoma and leukemia stem/progenitor cells. It encodes a unique protein with a SH3 domain, multiple SH3 binding sites and a WD40-repeat domain, suggesting that the normal protein has novel signaling activities. A new AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 interaction complex has recently been identified and this complex regulates transforming activities and drug resistance in CML stem/progenitor cells. Importantly, AHI-1 has recently been identified as a susceptibility gene involved in a number of brain disorders, including Joubert syndrome. Therefore, understanding molecular functions of the AHI-1 gene could lead to important and novel insights into disease processes involved in specific types of diseases. Ultimately, this knowledge will set the stage for translation into new and more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.","['Esmailzadeh, Sharmin', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Esmailzadeh S', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,2012/01/18 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2012/01/18 06:00'],"['2012/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['405 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.405 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2011 Dec;2(12):918-34. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.405.,,,"['0 (AHI1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",,,,PMC3282096,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib mesylate (IM) is the standard treatment for Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia; however, its role in Ph+ AML has not been extensively investigated. METHODS: Two patients aged of 46 and 19 years were diagnosed with de novo Ph+ AML according to the WHO Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms (2002) and the French-American-British (FAB) classification systems (1989). Cytogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of t(9;22). Standard RT-PCR was used to detect expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. Minimal residual disease was monitored by RQ-PCR for the BCR-ABL1/ABL ratio. Both patients received initial IM therapy combined with daunorubicin-based chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and IM maintenance treatment after allo-HSCT. RESULTS: Both patients achieved long-term disease-free survival with complete hematologic response, complete molecular response, and complete cytogenetic response for 44 and 48 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases indicate that IM combined with daunorubicin-based chemotherapy followed by allo-HSCT and IM maintenance treatment is associated with a favorable outcome for de novo Ph+ AML, especially when IM is used in an early phase of AML.","['Sun, Jie', 'Wang, Zhen', 'Luo, Yi', 'Tan, Yamin', 'Allan, David S', 'Huang, He']","['Sun J', 'Wang Z', 'Luo Y', 'Tan Y', 'Allan DS', 'Huang H']","['Department of Hematology, Bone Marrow Transplant Center, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,2012/01/18 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2012/01/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['000334109 [pii]', '10.1159/000334109 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2012;127(3):143-8. doi: 10.1159/000334109.

Two genes are frequently methylated: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A). In our study methylation of these genes was studied in 63 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 2 with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) and 13 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Five patients were monitored during 5-azacytidine treatment. Twenty-six healthy donors were tested in a control group. Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) method with all associated techniques was used for detection. Aberrant methylation was present in the CDKN2A gene in 38% and in the CDKN2B gene in 77% of the patients in MDS group. The level of methylation was higher in the group of AML patients - 77% in CDKN2A gene and 100% in CDKN2B gene. In MDS patients, an aberrant methylation was associated with a tendency to disease progression towards more advanced forms according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Significant differences in methylation level were observed between early and advanced forms of MDS in CDKN2B gene (P value < 0.05) but not for CDKN2A gene. The trend of methylation in patients treated with azacitidine was analyzed in CDKN2B gene and correlated with the course of the disease. Increased methylation was connected with disease progression. We concluded that the methylation level of CDKN2B gene might be used as a marker of leukemic transformation in MDS. Our study indicates the role of hypermethylation as an important event in the progression of MDS to AML.","['Cechova, H', 'Lassuthova, P', 'Novakova, L', 'Belickova, M', 'Stemberkova, R', 'Jencik, J', 'Stankova, M', 'Hrabakova, P', 'Pegova, K', 'Zizkova, H', 'Cermak, J']","['Cechova H', 'Lassuthova P', 'Novakova L', 'Belickova M', 'Stemberkova R', 'Jencik J', 'Stankova M', 'Hrabakova P', 'Pegova K', 'Zizkova H', 'Cermak J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, Prague, Czech Republic. hana.cechova@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,2012/01/18 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/01/18 06:00'],"['2012/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2012_022 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2012;59(2):168-74. doi: 10.4149/neo_2012_022.,,,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'DNA/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eighty individuals were included in this study; 20 with chronic periodontitis (CP), 20 with generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP), 20 with gingivitis, and 20 classified as healthy (H). Probing depth, clinical attachment level, plaque index, and papilla bleeding index were recorded.

RESULTS: CP and GAgP groups had significantly higher GCF IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-11 levels when compared with the H group (P <0.05). Conversely, GCF LIF levels of the CP and GAgP groups were lower than those of the H group (P <0.05). GCF OSM levels did not differ significantly among study groups.

Although previous studies have reported the anti-tumor effects of Tan IIA on various human cancer cells, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. The current study was undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanisms of Tan IIA's apoptotic effects on leukemia cells in vitro. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of Tan IIA on different types of leukemia cell lines was evaluated by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5]-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on cells treated without or with Tan IIA at different concentrations for different time periods. Cellular apoptosis progression with and without Tan IIA treatment was analyzed by Annexin V and Caspase 3 assays. Gene expression profiling was used to identify the genes regulated after Tan IIA treatment and those differentially expressed among the five cell lines. Confirmation of these expression regulations was carried out using real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA. The antagonizing effect of a PXR inhibitor L-SFN on Tan IIA treatment was tested using Colony Forming Unit Assay. RESULTS: Our results revealed that Tan IIA had different cytotoxic activities on five types of leukemia cells, with the highest toxicity on U-937 cells. Tan IIA inhibited the growth of U-937 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Annexin V and Caspase-3 assays showed that Tan IIA induced apoptosis in U-937 cells. Using gene expression profiling, 366 genes were found to be significantly regulated after Tan IIA treatment and differentially expressed among the five cell lines. Among these genes, CCL2 was highly expressed in untreated U-937 cells and down-regulated significantly after Tan IIA treatment in a dose-dependent manner. RT-qPCR analyses validated the expression regulation of 80% of genes. Addition of L-sulforaphane (L-SFN), an inhibitor of Pregnanexreceptor (PXR) significantly attenuated Tan IIA's effects using colony forming assays. CONCLUSIONS: Tan IIA has significant growth inhibition effects on U-937 cells through the induction of apoptosis. And Tan IIA-induced apoptosis might result from the activation of PXR, which suppresses the activity of NF-kappaB and lead to the down-regulation of CCL2 expression.","['Liu, Chang', 'Li, Jianqin', 'Wang, Liangjie', 'Wu, Fuqun', 'Huang, Linfang', 'Xu, Yue', 'Ye, Jieyu', 'Xiao, Bin', 'Meng, Fanyi', 'Chen, Shilin', 'Yang, Mo']","['Liu C', 'Li J', 'Wang L', 'Wu F', 'Huang L', 'Xu Y', 'Ye J', 'Xiao B', 'Meng F', 'Chen S', 'Yang M']","['Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, 151 MaLianWa North Road, Beijing, 100193, PR China. cliu6688@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,2012/01/18 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2012/01/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-12-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-12-5 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2012 Jan 16;12:5. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-12-5.,,20120116,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Pregnane X Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnane X Receptor', 'Receptors, Steroid/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza/*chemistry', 'Sulfoxides', 'Thiocyanates/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,,,PMC3398275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are key to cancer development, as a consequence of which its expression has been studied in an increasingly wide range of human cancers, including lymphoma, breast, prostate, colon, ovarian, cervical, and brain cancers, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia. It is a regulatory transcription factor for a wide range of genes, including genes involved in control of the cell cycle and apoptosis, and it can act either to upregulate or downregulate downstream gene expression, depending on the cellular environment, cofactors, and the gene targeted. Its expression has been associated with development of a malignant phenotype in some human cancers; tumor progression, including metastasis; and survival. However, as data on its prognostic significance has become available for more human cancers, its role in tumor progression has become controversial; there is conflicting data on its association with outcome, with some studies showing a favorable and others an unfavorable association. This is probably because of the many different roles YY1 plays in control of proliferation and apoptosis, one or the other of which may be more prominent in any given tumor. These studies are reviewed to give an overview of the increasingly recognized importance of YY1 in human tumorigenesis.","['Nicholson, Sarah', 'Whitehouse, Helen', 'Naidoo, Khimara', 'Byers, Richard J']","['Nicholson S', 'Whitehouse H', 'Naidoo K', 'Byers RJ']","['Department of Histopathology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Central Manchester University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Oncog,Critical reviews in oncogenesis,8914610,2012/01/18 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2012/01/18 06:00'],"['2012/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['0cf292416bbaa73d,570d8b6470393836 [pii]', '10.1615/critrevoncog.v16.i3-4.80 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncog. 2011;16(3-4):245-60. doi: 10.1615/critrevoncog.v16.i3-4.80.,,,"['0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (YY1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'YY1 Transcription Factor/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This lymphoproliferative disease is rare and predominantly occurs in Japanese children. Between 1998 and 2010, seven adult-onset cases (aged 20-45 years, median 39 years) were identified, which initially presented with inflammatory diseases, including hepatitis, interstitial pneumonitis, uveitis, nephritis and hypersensitivity to mosquito bites. They showed an EBV viral load in the peripheral blood and evidence of EBV infection of T or natural killer (NK) cells. Five cases (71.4%) developed EBV-positive T/NK-cell lymphoma/leukaemia at a median of 5 years (range 1-7 years) after the diagnosis. Although l-asparaginase-containing chemotherapy was effective for the lymphomas, only allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation eradicated EBV-infected cells. This observation indicates that persistent EBV infection of T or NK cells defines a distinct disease entity, which provides an underlying condition for EBV-positive T/NK-cell lymphoma/leukaemia.","['Isobe, Yasushi', 'Aritaka, Nanae', 'Setoguchi, Yasuhiro', 'Ito, Yoshinori', 'Kimura, Hiroshi', 'Hamano, Yasuharu', 'Sugimoto, Koichi', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Isobe Y', 'Aritaka N', 'Setoguchi Y', 'Ito Y', 'Kimura H', 'Hamano Y', 'Sugimoto K', 'Komatsu N']","['Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. yisobe@juntendo.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['jclinpath-2011-200523 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2011-200523 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2012 Mar;65(3):278-82. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2011-200523.

Although the involvement in epigenetic regulation is proposed to involve its chromobarrel and/or Tudor domains because of their potential binding to methylated histone tails, the structures of these domains and their interactions with methylated histone tails are still uncharacterized. In this work, we first found that RBBP1 contains five domains by bioinformatics analysis. Three of the five domains, i.e. chromobarrel, Tudor, and PWWP domains, are Royal Family domains, which potentially bind to methylated histone tails. We further purified these domains and characterized their interaction with methylated histone tails by NMR titration experiments. Among the three Royal Family domains, only the chromobarrel domain could recognize trimethylated H4K20 (with an affinity of approximately 3 mm), as well as recognizing trimethylated H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 (with lower affinities). The affinity could be further enhanced up to 15-fold by the presence of DNA. The structure of the chromobarrel domain of RBBP1 determined by NMR spectroscopy has an aromatic cage. Mutagenesis analysis identified four aromatic residues of the cage as the key residues for methylated lysine recognition. Our studies indicate that the chromobarrel domain of RBBP1 is responsible for recognizing methylated histone tails in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation, which presents a significant advance in our understanding of the mechanism and relationship between RBBP1-related gene suppression and epigenetic regulation.","['Gong, Weibin', 'Zhou, Tao', 'Mo, Jinjin', 'Perrett, Sarah', 'Wang, Jinfeng', 'Feng, Yingang']","['Gong W', 'Zhou T', 'Mo J', 'Perrett S', 'Wang J', 'Feng Y']","['National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)60998-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.299149 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Mar 9;287(11):8531-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.299149.

This assay system, designated ""the PML assay,"" makes use of the GFP-PML-expressing cell line SE/15, and allows real-time monitoring of infected cells by fluorescence microscopy without any staining procedures. A rapid and quantitative drug susceptibility testing was developed for low-titer clinical isolates propagated in fibroblasts in vitro. The present study sought to exploit the PML assay for evaluating in vivo status of HCMV without virus isolation. Progeny viruses were detected directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected in vivo obtained from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. The overall positivity of the PML assay tended to correlate with the levels of genomic DNA. Direct phenotypic susceptibility testing detected one ganciclovir (GCV)-resistant case among 19 samples, which was confirmed further by genomic and plaque reduction assays. However, in another patient with the sequence-proven mutant confirmed by sequencing, the progeny viruses exhibiting GCV-resistance were not detected. Studies on the isolated virus from the latter patient suggested the possibility that replication efficiency may differ between PBMCs and lesions infected in vivo, which may hamper the detection of GCV-resistant viruses by the PML assay, at least in this case. Taken together, the PML assay is sufficiently sensitive to monitor replication-competent HCMV directly from PBMCs infected in vivo, and provides a novel tool for comparing the characteristics of HCMV strains infected in vivo.","['Ogawa-Goto, Kiyoko', 'Ueno, Tomonori', 'Oshima, Kumi', 'Yamamoto, Hisashi', 'Sasaki, Jun', 'Fujita, Kazumasa', 'Sata, Tetsutaro', 'Taniguchi, Shuichi', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Katano, Harutaka']","['Ogawa-Goto K', 'Ueno T', 'Oshima K', 'Yamamoto H', 'Sasaki J', 'Fujita K', 'Sata T', 'Taniguchi S', 'Kanda Y', 'Katano H']","['Nippi Research Institute of Biomatrix, Ibaraki, Japan. kgoto@nippi-inc.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jmv.23220 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2012 Mar;84(3):479-86. doi: 10.1002/jmv.23220.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*virology', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Virology/methods', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, the quantitative estimation of radiation risk of a leukemia demands studying very large exposed cohorts, because of the very low level of this disease in unexposed populations and because of the tendency for its radiation risk to decrease with time. At present, the Japanese cohort of atomic bomb survivors is still the primary source of data that allows analysis of radiation-induced leukemia and the underlying dose-response relationship. The second large cohort that would allow to study radiation-induced leukemia is comprised of individuals who were exposed due to the accident of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. The objective of the present study was to estimate radiation risks of leukemia incidence among the Russian cohort of Chernobyl emergency workers, for different time periods after the accident. Twenty-five years after the Chernobyl accident and based on the results of the present study, one can conclude that the radiation risk of leukemia incidence derived from the Russian cohort of Chernobyl emergency workers is similar to that derived from the cohort of atomic bomb survivors: The time-averaged excess relative risk per Gray (ERR Gy(-1)) equals 4.98 for the Russian cohort and 3.9 for the life span study (LSS) cohort; excess absolute risk decreases with time after exposure at an annual rate of 9% for the Russian cohort, and of 6.5% for the LSS cohort. Thus, the excess in risk of leukemia incidence in a population due to a single exposure is restricted in time after exposure by the period of about 15 years.","['Ivanov, V K', 'Tsyb, A F', 'Khait, S E', 'Kashcheev, V V', 'Chekin, S Yu', 'Maksioutov, M A', 'Tumanov, K A']","['Ivanov VK', 'Tsyb AF', 'Khait SE', 'Kashcheev VV', 'Chekin SY', 'Maksioutov MA', 'Tumanov KA']","['Federal State Institution Medical Radiological Research Center of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation, Obninsk, Kaluga Region, Russia. nrer@obninsk.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-011-0400-y [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2012 May;51(2):143-9. doi: 10.1007/s00411-011-0400-y.

However, the most important SFK and RTK affected by these mutations, and hence, the most important therapeutic targets, have not been clearly characterized. We compared SFK and RTK pathway activity and inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines containing homozygous R420Q mutation (GDM-1), heterozygous deletion (MOLM13) and wild-type (WT) CBL (THP1, U937). As expected with CBL loss, GDM-1 displayed high KIT expression and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) hypersensitivity. Ectopic expression of WT CBL decreased GDM-1 proliferation but not cell lines with WT CBL. GDM-1, but not the other cell lines, was highly sensitive to growth inhibition by dasatinib (dual SFK and RTK inhibitor, LD50 50 nM); there was less or no selective inhibition of GDM-1 growth by sunitinib (RTK inhibitor), imatinib (ABL, KIT inhibitor), or PP2 (SFK inhibitor). Phosphoprotein analysis identified phosphorylation targets uniquely inhibited by dasatinib treatment of GDM-1, including a number of proteins in the KIT and GM-CSF receptor pathways (for example, KIT Tyr721, STAT3 Tyr705). In conclusion, the promiscuous effects of CBL loss on SFK and RTK signaling appear to be best targeted by dual SFK and RTK inhibition.","['Makishima, H', 'Sugimoto, Y', 'Szpurka, H', 'Clemente, M J', 'Ng, K P', 'Muramatsu, H', ""O'Keefe, C"", 'Saunthararajah, Y', 'Maciejewski, J P']","['Makishima H', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Szpurka H', 'Clemente MJ', 'Ng KP', 'Muramatsu H', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20127 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jul;26(7):1547-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.7.

We studied 40 children with ALL marrow relapse piloting an ALL relapse protocol with well-known drugs and drug combinations by using a concept of response-guided design. We also measured response in logarithmic fashion. Our primary end points were achievement of M1 marrow status, minimal residual disease status below 10, and second remission. The remission induction rate was 90% with 10% induction mortality. After the A blocks (dexamethasone, vincristine, idarubicin and pegylated L-asparaginase), 85% had M1 status, 39% had minimal residual disease </=1x10, and 66% had 2 to 3 log response. After B1 block (cyclo, VP-16) the figures were 92%, 58%, and 83%, respectively. Twenty-five of 40 patients received allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Three-year event-free survival of the whole cohort was 37%, and the relapse rate was 38%. Three-year event-free survival by risk group was 53% for late, 34% for early, and 21% for very early relapses. An ALL marrow relapse nonresponsive to steroids, vincristine, asparaginase, anthracyclines, and alkylating agents is uncommon, and these classic drugs can still be advocated for induction of ALL relapse. The problems lie in creating a consolidation capable of preventing particularly posttransplant relapses.","['Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M', 'Parto, Katriina', 'Riikonen, Pekka', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Bekassy, Albert N', 'Glomstein, Anders', 'Mottonen, Merja']","['Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Parto K', 'Riikonen P', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Bekassy AN', 'Glomstein A', 'Mottonen M']","[""Children's Hospital and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. ulla.pihkala@hus.fi""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182352da9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2012 May;34(4):263-70. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182352da9.,,,"['30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Aspartic Acid/administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*prevention & control', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the epigenetic mechanism of HQ exposure was investigated. We characterized the epigenomic response of TK6 cells to HQ exposure, and examined the mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b, methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) and six proto-oncogenes (MPL, RAF1, MYB, MYC, ERBB2 and BRAF). Compared to the control cells, HQ exposure (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 muM for 48 h) resulted in the decrease of DNMTs and MBD2 expression, the global hypomethylation and increase of MPL at mRNA level. Meanwhile, most of these changes were in dose-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of DNMTs induced by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), an identified DNMT inhibitor, caused more induction of MPL expression at mRNA level compared to the HQ (10.0 muM) pre-treated group. Furthermore, treatment of HQ potentially led to MPL itself hypomethylation (10.0 and 20.0 muM reduced by 47% and 44%, respectively), further revealing that the activation of proto-oncogene MPL was related to hypomethylation in its DNA sequences. In conclusion, hypomethylation, including global and specific hypomethylation, might be involved in the activation of MPL, and the hypomethylation could be induced by decreased DNMTs in TK6 cells exposed to HQ.","['Liu, Linhua', 'Ling, Xiaoxuan', 'Liang, Hairong', 'Gao, Yuting', 'Yang, Hui', 'Shao, Junli', 'Tang, Huanwen']","['Liu L', 'Ling X', 'Liang H', 'Gao Y', 'Yang H', 'Shao J', 'Tang H']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical College, Dongguan 523808, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(12)00003-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.12.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2012 Mar 25;209(3):239-45. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.12.020.

Mutations and deletion in the human orthologue BCL11B have been identified in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and a mouse model of thymic lymphomas. Bcl11b(KO/+)p53(KO/+) doubly heterozygous mice, but not Bcl11b(KO/+) heterozygous mice, spontaneously develop thymic lymphomas at a high frequency, suggesting cooperativity of BCL11B and p53 in cancer development. In this study, we have examined whether or not BCL11B directly affects the p53 signaling pathway including HDM2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53 degradation. The p53 pathway regulates cell proliferation and the response to DNA damages to maintain genome integrity. Here we show that BCL11B binds to human HDM2-P2 promoter by ChIP (chromatin immuno-precipitation) assay and inhibits HDM2 expression in a p53-dependent manner. Deletion of the distal p53 responsive element in HDM2 promoter region or the lack of p53 in HCT116 cells greatly reduced the repressive effect of BCL11B on HDM2-P2 promoter activity. The repressive activity was alleviated in gamma-ray induced DNA damage conditions that activate p53, suggesting interaction between BCL11B and p53 for HDM2 expression. These date suggest that BCL11B affects the activity of the p53-HDM2 feedback loop in basal and irradiated conditions. This may be a mechanism underlying the leukemic transformation in T-ALL and in Bcl11b(KO/+)p53(KO/+) mouse thymocytes.","['Obata, Miki', 'Kominami, Ryo', 'Mishima, Yukio']","['Obata M', 'Kominami R', 'Mishima Y']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-dori, Chuo-ku, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(12)00004-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.12.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2012 May;24(5):1047-52. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.12.026.

DNA damage induced by benzene is the crucial mechanism of its genotoxicity, which leads to chronic benzene poisoning, haematotoxicity and leukaemia. Therefore, genetic variation in DNA-repair genes may modulate susceptibility to benzene-induced DNA damage. In light of this, the effects of polymorphisms in DNA-repair genes (APEX1, hOGG1, NBS1, XPD, XRCC1, and XRCC3) on micronucleus (MN) formation as a biomarker of early biological effects were evaluated. A significantly higher median MN frequency was recorded in traffic wardens than in controls. However, none of the analysed polymorphisms was significantly associated with the median MN frequency. A gene-gender interaction was observed for the APEX1 genotype. The APEX1 variant genotype was associated with significantly lower median MN frequency in men, not in women. Statistical analysis did not reveal any association between the score of the protective alleles - hypothetically pushing the pathway towards optimal DNA-damage repair - and MN. Even though there are some limitations in the study, our results indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzene concentrations higher than the threshold level for air-quality standards in the European Union of 10 mug/m(3). Furthermore, urban traffic wardens are exposed to significantly higher levels of benzene than individuals spending most of the time indoors. This higher exposure may contribute to DNA damage, suggesting that benzene might be implicated both as an environmental and occupational risk factor in leukaemia and other haematological diseases. In conclusion, this study suggest the need for (i) regular monitoring of traffic wardens for possible exposure to benzene, as a precautionary step to reduce the associated health risks, and (ii) more comprehensive studies in order to better elucidate the involvement of APEX1 genotypes in benzene genotoxicity.","['Angelini, Sabrina', 'Maffei, Francesca', 'Bermejo, Justo Lorenzo', 'Ravegnini, Gloria', ""L'insalata, Domenica"", 'Cantelli-Forti, Giorgio', 'Violante, Francesco Saverio', 'Hrelia, Patrizia']","['Angelini S', 'Maffei F', 'Bermejo JL', 'Ravegnini G', ""L'insalata D"", 'Cantelli-Forti G', 'Violante FS', 'Hrelia P']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, Bologna 40126, Italy. s.angelini@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2011/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(12)00009-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.10.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2012 Mar 18;743(1-2):99-104. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.10.018.

Overrepresentation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR2 and its serologic split HLA-DR15 has been associated with low-risk MDS in certain ethnic groups and has been proposed as a predictive factor for a favorable response to immunomodulatory treatment. Because the HLA-DRB1*15 haplotype does not predominate in the Greek population, we investigated the frequency of HLA-DRB1 alleles among 114 patients of Greek origin suffering from various types of MDS: 36 refractory anemia (RA), 24 refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 19 refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 14 refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t), 14 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 7 hypoplastic MDS patients. HLA-DRB1 molecular typing was performed with polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotides and results were compared with that from a previously reported control Greek population. HLA-DRB1*1602 was the only allele that was significantly overrepresented in Greek MDS patients as a whole, whereas HLA-DRB1*1501 allele frequency was significantly higher in Greek patients with low-risk myelodysplasia.

CRK-like (CRKL) is a hematopoietic cell-dominant homologue of CRK that is reported to be phosphorylated by BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, but its biological function in non-hematopoietic tumors remains unclear. In this study, we explored the tumorigenic role of CRKL in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in vitro and in vivo. Immunoprecipitation analysis of HNSCC cell line, HSC-3 cells, showed that the dominant binding partner for C3G was CRKL, not CRK. To clarify the molecular function of CRKL, we established lentiviral shRNA-mediated CRKL-knockdown HNSCC cell lines. In CRKL-knockdown HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells, cell growth and motility were diminished compared to control cells. Cell adhesion assays showed that cell attachment onto both fibronectin- and collagen-coated dishes was significantly suppressed in CRKL-knockdown HSC-3 cells, while no significant change was observed for poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that focal adhesion was reduced in CRKL-knockdown HSC-3 cells. With a pulldown assay, CRKL-knockdown HSC-3 cells showed decreased amounts of active Rap1 compared to control cells. Moreover, in an in vivo assay, tumor formation of CRKL-knockdown HSC-3 cells in nude mice was significantly abrogated. Our results indicate that CRKL regulates HNSCC-cell growth, motility, and integrin-dependent cell adhesion, suggesting that CRKL plays a principal role in HNSCC tumorigenicity.","['Yanagi, Hiroko', 'Wang, Lei', 'Nishihara, Hiroshi', 'Kimura, Taichi', 'Tanino, Mishie', 'Yanagi, Teruki', 'Fukuda, Satoshi', 'Tanaka, Shinya']","['Yanagi H', 'Wang L', 'Nishihara H', 'Kimura T', 'Tanino M', 'Yanagi T', 'Fukuda S', 'Tanaka S']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, N15W7, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-8638, Japan. h-naka@med.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)02364-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.142 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Feb 3;418(1):104-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.142.

Two next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, nilotinib and dasatinib, were initially indicated for imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia patients and recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of newly diagnosed, chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients. In comparison with the previous standards of care, benefits with these three tyrosine kinase inhibitors have included more rapid response rates, increased survival, and fewer side effects. The improved long-term outcomes have altered the approach to management of chronic myeloid leukemia from a progressive fatal disease with a poor prognosis to a chronic condition similar to diabetes or hypertension. Prolonged survival increases the need for patient education, support, monitoring, and assistance with adverse event management.

Its pathophysiology is poorly understood and there is no consensus on the definition of high-risk patients for CNS relapse. Consequently, an empirical and highly variable practice of chemoprophylaxis is employed. In this review we critically appraise the available literature in order to address issues related to ineffectiveness of current paradigms of chemoprophylaxis. The commonly used prophylaxis is derived from past experience with childhood acute leukemia where most early CNS relapses are leptomeningeal. In contrast, CNS involvement in DLBCL affects brain parenchyma in almost 60% of cases and thus intrathecal prophylaxis remains ineffective. We propose that CNS relapse in DLBCL is sometimes related to occult malignant cells present in the CNS at diagnosis. In others, CNS relapse is likely due to a later acquisition of CNS-penetrating subtypes of malignant clones. With lack of evidence for occult CNS involvement no strong indication currently exist that any form of chemoprophylaxis is beneficial. Future directions for evaluation and treatment of CNS disease are outlined. This complex and intriguing topic should be ideally investigated by prospective trials.","['Siegal, Tali', 'Goldschmidt, Neta']","['Siegal T', 'Goldschmidt N']","['Gaffin Center for Neuro-Oncology, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. siegal@hadassah.org.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0268-960X(11)00093-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2011.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2012 May;26(3):97-106. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2011.12.001.

To clarify the mechanism of resistance to GO, HL-60 cells were persistently exposed to GO in order to establish GO-resistant HL-60 (HL-60/GOR) cells. Multidrug resistance 1 (MDR-1) was strongly expressed in HL-60/GOR cells, but not in HL-60 cells. Although withdrawal of GO after the chronic exposure of HL-60/GOR cells to this compound gradually decreased MDR-1 expression to trace levels, reintroducing GO restored high MDR-1 expression in HL-60/GOR cells, but not in HL-60 cells. These results indicate that HL-60/GOR cells acquired the ability to induce MDR-1 expression in response to GO. U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, prevented GO-inducible MDR-1 expression and abrogated GO resistance in HL-60/GOR cells. These results suggest that in the clinical use of GO, inducible MDR-1 expression in tumor cells should be investigated before treatment with GO. If the cells are positive then MEK1/2 inhibitors may be effective in overcoming resistance to GO.","['Matsumoto, Taichi', 'Jimi, Shiro', 'Hara, Shuuji', 'Takamatsu, Yasushi', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Tamura, Kazuo']","['Matsumoto T', 'Jimi S', 'Hara S', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Suzumiya J', 'Tamura K']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.656102 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jul;53(7):1399-405. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.656102.

Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a dual Src/Abl inhibitor, is a promising therapeutic agent with oral bioavailability. It has been used for the treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Most kinase inhibitors, including Dasatinib, inhibit multiple cellular targets and do not possess exquisite cellular specificity. Recent efforts in kinase research thus focus on the development of large-scale, proteome-wide chemical profiling methods capable of rapid identification of potential cellular (on- and off-) targets of kinase inhibitors. Most existing approaches, however, are still problematic and in many cases not compatible with live-cell studies. In this work, we have successfully developed a cell-permeable kinase probe (DA-2) capable of proteome-wide profiling of potential cellular targets of Dasatinib. In this way, highly regulated, compartmentalized kinase-drug interactions were maintained. By comparing results obtained from different proteomic setups (live cells, cell lysates, and immobilized affinity matrix), we found DA-2 was able to identify significantly more putative kinase targets. In addition to Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases, a number of previously unknown Dasatinib targets have been identified, including several serine/threonine kinases (PCTK3, STK25, eIF-2A, PIM-3, PKA C-alpha, and PKN2). They were further validated by pull-down/immunoblotting experiments as well as kinase inhibition assays. Further studies are needed to better understand the exact relevance of Dasatinib and its pharmacological effects in relation to these newly identified cellular targets. The approach developed herein should be amenable to the study of many of the existing reversible drugs/drug candidates.","['Shi, Haibin', 'Zhang, Chong-Jing', 'Chen, Grace Y J', 'Yao, Shao Q']","['Shi H', 'Zhang CJ', 'Chen GY', 'Yao SQ']","['Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,2012/01/17 06:00,2012/07/20 06:00,['2012/01/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja208518u [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2012 Feb 15;134(6):3001-14. doi: 10.1021/ja208518u.

METHOD: Different concentrations of the Mat (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 g x L(-1) ) were cultured in vitro in TF-1 cells at different time (24, 48, 72 h). Cell proliferation was assayed by MTT. Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V and PI double staining method. SALL4 mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcription RT-PCR (RTT-PCR). RESULT: Administrated with Mat (0.5-2.0 g x L(-1)) after 24, 48, 72 h, the proliferation of TF-1 cells were inhibited (P < 0.01) , and in dose- and time-dependent manner. Half inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) was 1.0 g L(-1) at 48 h.

Previous studies have demonstrated that maintaining imatinib plasma levels (IMPLs) >1000 ng/mL leads to improved responses and long-term outcomes. However, IMPLs vary among patients because of factors such as drug-drug interactions, adherence, toxicity and differential levels of expression of cellular efflux/influx proteins. In this study, IMPLs were analysed in 191 patients with CML and were compared with achievement of molecular and cytogenetic responses (CyR). IMPLs were also correlated with renal and hepatic dysfunction. Additionally, self-reported adherence was monitored. The median and mean IMPLs were 994 ng/mL and 1070 +/- 686 ng/mL, respectively, with 96 patients (50%) achieving plasma levels >1000 ng/mL. Self-reported patient compliance was 98%. Patients who achieved a complete CyR (CCyR) had significantly higher IMPLs (1078 +/- 545 ng/mL) than those without CyR (827 +/- 323 ng/mL, p = 0.045). When grouped together, patients who achieved a CCyR or partial CyR had significantly higher IMPLs than patients who achieved a minimal CyR or did not achieve a CyR (1066 ng/mL vs 814 ng/mL, p = 0.002). There was no significant difference observed in the IMPLs between patients who achieved molecular responses (n = 177) on treatment (major molecular response, 976 +/- 385 ng/mL versus complete molecular response, 1138 +/- 809 ng/mL, p = 0.387). Mean IMPLs were similar in patients with or without renal or hepatic impairment. Overall, this study confirmed previous reports that higher IMPLs correlate with clinical responses and demonstrated that imatinib exposure did not differ in patients with or without liver and/or renal dysfunction. The use of IMPL testing and patient diaries may be practical tools for the management of imatinib therapy in patients with CML.","['Koren-Michowitz, Maya', 'Volchek, Yulia', 'Naparstek, Elizabeth', 'Gavish, Israel', 'Levi, Itai', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Koren-Michowitz M', 'Volchek Y', 'Naparstek E', 'Gavish I', 'Levi I', 'Rowe JM', 'Shimoni A', 'Nagler A']","['Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,2012/01/14 06:00,2013/02/08 06:00,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2005 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2012 Dec;30(4):200-5. doi: 10.1002/hon.2005.

METHODS: The effect of total flavonoids of Hedysarum polybotry on K562 cell line survival was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) reduction assay. The time- and dose-dependent manner was also observed. The cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed with flow cytometry (FCM). The immunocytochemistry method was applied to quantitatively analyze the effects of flavonoids of Hedysarum polybotry on changes p21(Ras) and PCNA gene expressions. RESULTS: Flavonoids of Hedysarum polybotry (20-100 mug/mL) significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After K562 cells were cultured for 48 h, total flavonoids of Hedysarum polybotry had no significant effect on the apoptosis of K562 cells but showed significantly inhibition (P<0.01), indicating that total flavonoids of Hedysarum polybotry could induce K562 cells arrested at G(0)/G(1) and G(2)/M phases. Compared with the control group, p21(Ras) and PCNA gene expressions were decreased significantly in K562 cells treated with total flavonoids of Hedysarum polybotry (40 and 80 mug/mL, respectively) for 48 h. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect on proliferation of K562 cells was observed in the groups treated with flavonoids of Hedysarum polybotry, which might be related to cells arresting.","['Wang, Ya-li', 'Luo, Ya-li', 'Chen, Che', 'Li, Neng-lian', 'She, Ya-li', 'Zhang, Li']","['Wang YL', 'Luo YL', 'Chen C', 'Li NL', 'She YL', 'Zhang L']","['Gansu College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou, China. wyl050766@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,2012/01/14 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11655-011-0952-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2012 May;18(5):385-90. doi: 10.1007/s11655-011-0952-3.

Previously, we described a novel enzyme/prodrug combination for CFCGT. Here, we present results employing novel lentiviral constructs harboring sequences for truncated surface molecules (CD19 or low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) directly fused to that CFCGT cDNA (TmpkF105Y). This confers an enforced one-to-one correlation between cell marking and eradication functions. In-vitro analysis demonstrated the full functionality of the fusion product. Next, low-dose 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) administration to non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice injected with transduced clonal K562 cells suppressed tumor growth; furthermore, one integrated vector on average was sufficient to mediate cytotoxicity. Further, in a murine xenogeneic leukemia-lymphoma model we also demonstrated in-vivo control over transduced Raji cells. Finally, in a proof-of-principle study to examine the utility of this cassette in combination with a therapeutic cDNA, we integrated this novel CFCGT fusion construct into a lentivector designed for treatment of Fabry disease. Transduction with this vector restored enzyme activity in Fabry cells and retained AZT sensitivity. In addition, human Fabry patient CD34(+) cells showed high transduction efficiencies and retained normal colony-generating capacity when compared with the non-transduced controls. These collective results demonstrated that this novel and broadly applicable fusion system may enhance general safety in gene- and cell-based therapies.","['Scaife, M', 'Pacienza, N', 'Au, B C Y', 'Wang, J C M', 'Devine, S', 'Scheid, E', 'Lee, C-J', 'Lopez-Perez, O', 'Neschadim, A', 'Fowler, D H', 'Foley, R', 'Medin, J A']","['Scaife M', 'Pacienza N', 'Au BC', 'Wang JC', 'Devine S', 'Scheid E', 'Lee CJ', 'Lopez-Perez O', 'Neschadim A', 'Fowler DH', 'Foley R', 'Medin JA']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,2012/01/14 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['gt2011210 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2011.210 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2013 Jan;20(1):24-34. doi: 10.1038/gt.2011.210.

The patient underwent uBMT again with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and CR has been maintained up to 5 months post-second uBMT.

METHODS: Using an array comprising 667 miRNAs, we investigated whether the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is altered in CML K-562 cells becoming resistant to increasing concentrations of imatinib. ABCB1 and ABCG2 mRNA (quantitative real-time PCR) and protein expression (western blot) were quantified under short-term and 4 months' imatinib treatment. Interaction of miR-212 and miR-328 with ABCG2 was investigated by transfection experiments and reporter gene assays using respective miRNA precursors or miRNA inhibitors. RESULTS: Although ABCB1 protein was not expressed, ABCG2 protein was 7.2-fold elevated after long-term treatment with 0.3 micromol/l imatinib and decreased gradually at higher concentrations. miRNAs miR-212 and miR-328 were identified to correlate inversely with ABCG2 expression under these conditions. Short-term treatment also induced ABCG2 protein concentration dependently and caused a downregulation of miR-212, but not of miR-328 at all tested concentrations (P=0.050). Reporter gene assays confirmed miR-212 to target the 3'-UTR region of ABCG2. In contrast, transfection of anti-miR-212 revealed an upregulation of ABCG2 protein expression, whereas the effect of anti-miR-328 was weak. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests an association of imatinib treatment, miRNA downregulation and ABCG2 overexpression, possibly contributing to the mechanisms involved in imatinib distribution and response in CML therapy.","['Turrini, Eleonora', 'Haenisch, Sierk', 'Laechelt, Sandra', 'Diewock, Tobias', 'Bruhn, Oliver', 'Cascorbi, Ingolf']","['Turrini E', 'Haenisch S', 'Laechelt S', 'Diewock T', 'Bruhn O', 'Cascorbi I']","['Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,2012/01/14 06:00,2012/08/02 06:00,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FPC.0b013e328350012b [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2012 Mar;22(3):198-205. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0b013e328350012b.,,,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MIRN212 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN328 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four disease groups were included in this study that represent a significantly longer hospital stay than other cancers: acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, or those undergoing blood marrow transplant. The complexity of care is significantly higher, necessitating greater caregiver burden following hospitalization. Eligible patients and their caregivers received post-hospitalization care education through an Oncology CarePartner Program addressing the patient's physical and emotional needs. The impact of the CarePartners program on caregiver burden was evaluated by the Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale (OCBS) and Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale (BCOS) on two oncology units (medical/oncology (n = 17) and blood marrow transplant (n = 21)) at three times: within 5 days of admission (T1), patient discharge from the hospital (T2), and 30 days post-discharge (T3). There were significant increases seen from T1-T2 (median = 4, p = 0.0007) and T1-T3 (median = 5.5, p = 0.003) in the BCOS. No significant changes in OCBS (time or difficulty) were seen.

Herein, we report that mutant huntingtin (mtHtt) induces the transcription of alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X linked (ATRX), an ATPase/helicase and SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling protein via Cdx-2 activation. ATRX expression was elevated in both a cell line model and transgenic model of HD, and Cdx-2 occupancy of the ATRX promoter was increased in HD. Induction of ATRX expanded the size of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB) and increased trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3) and condensation of pericentromeric heterochromatin, while knockdown of ATRX decreased PML-NB and H3K9me3 levels. Knockdown of ATRX/dXNP improved the hatch rate of fly embryos expressing mtHtt (Q127). ATRX/dXNP overexpression exacerbated eye degeneration of eye-specific mtHtt (Q127) expressing flies.

Following treatment, 20% of patients still develop metastatic disease. Superficial bladder cancer is often multifocal, has high recurrences after surgical resection and recurs after intravesical live Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Oncovex(GALV/CD), an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1, has shown enhanced local tumour control by combining oncolysis with the expression of a highly potent pro-drug activating gene and the fusogenic glycoprotein. METHODS: In vitro fusion/prodrug/apoptotic cell-based assays. In vivo orthotopic bladder tumour model, visualised by computed microtomography. RESULTS: Treatment of seven human bladder carcinoma cell lines with the virus resulted in tumour cell killing through oncolysis, pro-drug activation and glycoprotein fusion. Oncovex(GALV/CD) and mitomycin C showed a synergistic effect, whereas the co-administration with cisplatin or gemcitabine showed an antagonistic effect in vitro. Transitional cell cancer (TCC) cells follow an apoptotic cell death pathway after infection with Oncovex(GALV/CD) with or without 5-FC. In vivo results showed that intravesical treatment with Oncovex(GALV/CD) + prodrug (5-FC) reduced the average tumour volume by over 95% compared with controls. DISCUSSION: Our in vitro and in vivo results indicate that Oncovex(GALV/CD) can improve local tumour control within the bladder, and potentially alter its natural history.","['Simpson, G R', 'Horvath, A', 'Annels, N E', 'Pencavel, T', 'Metcalf, S', 'Seth, R', 'Peschard, P', 'Price, T', 'Coffin, R S', 'Mostafid, H', 'Melcher, A A', 'Harrington, K J', 'Pandha, H S']","['Simpson GR', 'Horvath A', 'Annels NE', 'Pencavel T', 'Metcalf S', 'Seth R', 'Peschard P', 'Price T', 'Coffin RS', 'Mostafid H', 'Melcher AA', 'Harrington KJ', 'Pandha HS']","['Oncology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK. g.simpson@surrey.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,2012/01/14 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2011577 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.577 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 Jan 31;106(3):496-507. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.577.

Specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been designed and are now used for the treatment of CML. These TKI induce apoptosis in leukemic cells in a BIM-dependent mechanism. We hypothesized that an increase in BIM activity could sensitize CML cells to TKI. We blocked the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family by using ABT-737, a Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibitor. ABT-737 modified Bcl-2 protein interactions toward a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Its combination with TKI resulted in a strong synergism in CML cell lines. The association also induced a large decrease in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), followed by caspase-3 activation. This XIAP decrease was due to post-translational events. The mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2/Omi was identified as being responsible for this off-target effect. Then, ABT-737 and TKI cooperate at several levels to induce apoptosis of CML cells lines, and the benefit of this association was also observed in CML hematopoietic progenitors. Interestingly, a lethal effect was also observed in the more immature CD34(+)CD38(-) TKI-insensitive population. Combination therapy might by an interesting strategy for the treatment of CML patients.","['Airiau, Kelly', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Josselin, Marina', 'Jeanneteau, Marie', 'Turcq, Beatrice', 'Belloc, Francis']","['Airiau K', 'Mahon FX', 'Josselin M', 'Jeanneteau M', 'Turcq B', 'Belloc F']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematopoiese Leucemique et Cibles Therapeutiques, INSERM 1035, Universite Bordeaux Segalen, Bordeaux Cedex, France. kelly.airiau@gmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2012/01/14 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00006-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 May;40(5):367-78.e2. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.01.004.

Here we investigate the activity and functional role of Shh signaling in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and leukemia progenitor cells. Differential activation of Shh signaling was found in about 50% CML chronic phase samples, about 70% of CML accelerated phase samples, and >80% CML blast crisis phase samples. Deregulated activation of Shh signaling was observed in CD34(+) and c-kit(+) leukemia progenitor cells. Stimulation of Shh signaling with exogenous Shh peptide induced expansion of CD34(+) and c-kit(+) progenitor cells (p < 0.05), inversely, blocking the pathway with signal inhibitor induced cell apoptosis (p < 0.05). Low level of Shh protein was observed in CML bone marrow stromal cells, and CD34(+) progenitor cells are less sensitive to exogenous Shh peptide and more sensitive to cyclopamine than CD34(-) cells (p < 0.05), implying cell-autonomous activation of Shh signaling play a predominant role in progenitor cells. Coactivation of Shh and beta-catenin signaling was found in CD34(+) and c-kit(+) progenitor cells. Administration of Shh-neutralizing antibody or Wnt3a-neutralizing antibody in c-kit(+) progenitor cells induced cell apoptosis; however, Wnt3a peptide could salvage cell apoptosis, while Shh peptide failed to revert anti-Wnt3a-induced cell apoptosis. C-MYC, GLI1, BCL-2, and P21 were also found to be downstream targets of Shh signaling, mediating apoptosis or G(2)/M cell cycle arrest of progenitor cells. Our results demonstrate that autoactivated Shh signaling provides survival and proliferative cues in CML progenitor cells through downstream beta-catenin signaling, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach in CML.","['Su, Wenxia', 'Meng, Fankai', 'Huang, Lifang', 'Zheng, Miao', 'Liu, Wenli', 'Sun, Hanying']","['Su W', 'Meng F', 'Huang L', 'Zheng M', 'Liu W', 'Sun H']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,2012/01/14 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00005-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 May;40(5):418-27. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.01.003.

Its availability can be regulated at different levels, namely at its synthesis and degradation steps. Accordingly, the expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible for ACh hydrolysis, has been observed to be modulated in inflammation. To further address the mechanisms underlying this effect, we aimed here at characterizing AChE expression in distinct cellular types pivotal to the inflammatory response. This study was performed in the human acute leukaemia monocytyc cell line, THP-1, in human monocyte-derived primary macrophages and in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In order to subject these cells to inflammatory conditions, THP-1 and macrophage were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E.coli and HUVEC were stimulated with the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Our results showed that although AChE expression was generally up-regulated at the mRNA level under inflammatory conditions, distinct AChE protein expression profiles were surprisingly observed among the distinct cellular types studied. Altogether, these results argue for the existence of cell specific mechanisms that regulate the expression of acetylcholinesterase in inflammation.","['de Oliveira, P', 'Gomes, A Q', 'Pacheco, T R', 'Vitorino de Almeida, V', 'Saldanha, C', 'Calado, A']","['de Oliveira P', 'Gomes AQ', 'Pacheco TR', 'Vitorino de Almeida V', 'Saldanha C', 'Calado A']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,9709206,2012/01/14 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['6203R303N18K4330 [pii]', '10.3233/CH-2011-1520 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Hemorheol Microcirc. 2012;51(2):129-37. doi: 10.3233/CH-2011-1520.,,,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/enzymology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an activator, MEN1 is a component of the Set1-like mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) MLL1/MLL2 methyltransferase complex that methylates histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). MEN1 is localized to the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-dependent gene, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), and is further recruited when IRF1 transcription is triggered by interferon-gamma signaling. RESULTS: RNAi-mediated knockdown of MEN1 alters the H3K4 dimethylation and H3 acetylation profiles, and the localization of histone deacetylase 3, at IRF1. While MEN1 knockdown does not impact the rate of transcription, IRF1 heteronuclear transcripts become enriched in MEN1-depleted cells. The processed mRNA and translated protein product are concomitantly reduced, and the antiviral state is attenuated. Additionally, the transcription start site at the IRF1 promoter is disrupted in the MEN1-depleted cells. The H3K4 demethylase, lysine specific demethylase 1, is also associated with IRF1, and its inhibition alters H3K4 methylation and disrupts the transcription start site as well. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data indicate that MEN1 contributes to STAT1-activated gene expression in a novel manner that includes defining the transcription start site and RNA processing.","['Auriemma, Lauren B', 'Shah, Shaili', 'Linden, Lara M', 'Henriksen, Melissa A']","['Auriemma LB', 'Shah S', 'Linden LM', 'Henriksen MA']","['Department of Biology, The University of Virginia, 485 McCormick Road, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA. mah2hx@virginia.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Epigenetics Chromatin,Epigenetics & chromatin,101471619,2012/01/14 06:00,2012/01/14 06:01,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:01 [medline]']","['1756-8935-5-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8935-5-2 [doi]']",epublish,Epigenetics Chromatin. 2012 Jan 12;5(1):2. doi: 10.1186/1756-8935-5-2.,,20120112,,,,,,,PMC3271985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, prevalence rates as high as 7% have been reported in blood donors, raising the risk of transfusion-related transmission. Several laboratories have utilized microneutralization assays as a surrogate marker for detection of anti-MLV serologic responses--with up to 25% of prostate cancer patients reported to harbor neutralizing antibody responses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a high-throughput microneutralization assay for research studies on blood donors using retroviral vectors pseudotyped with XMRV-specific envelopes. Infection with these pseudotypes was neutralized by sera from both macaques and mice challenged with XMRV, but not preimmune serum. A total of 354 plasma samples from blood donors in the Reno/Tahoe area were screened for neutralization. RESULTS: A total of 6.5% of donor samples gave moderate neutralization of XMRV, but not control pseudotypes. However, further testing by Western blot revealed no evidence of antibodies against MLVs in any of these samples. Furthermore, no evidence of infectious virus or viral nucleic acid was observed. CONCLUSION: A microneutralization assay was developed for detection of XMRV and can be applied in a high-throughput format for large-scale studies. Although a proportion of blood donors demonstrated the ability to block XMRV envelope-mediated infection, we found no evidence that this inhibition was mediated by specific antibodies elicited by exposure to XMRV or MLV. It is likely that this moderate neutralization is mediated through another, nonspecific mechanism.","['Zhou, Yanchen', 'Steffen, Imke', 'Montalvo, Leilani', 'Lee, Tzong-Hae', 'Zemel, Reeve', 'Switzer, William M', 'Tang, Shaohua', 'Jia, Hongwei', 'Heneine, Walid', 'Winkelman, Valerie', 'Tailor, Chetankumar S', 'Ikeda, Yasuhiro', 'Simmons, Graham']","['Zhou Y', 'Steffen I', 'Montalvo L', 'Lee TH', 'Zemel R', 'Switzer WM', 'Tang S', 'Jia H', 'Heneine W', 'Winkelman V', 'Tailor CS', 'Ikeda Y', 'Simmons G']","['Blood Systems Research Institute, Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,2012/01/14 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2012/01/14 06:00'],"['2012/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03519.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2012 Feb;52(2):332-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03519.x.,['(c) 2012 American Association of Blood Banks.'],,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/isolation & purification', '*Blood Donors/statistics & numerical data', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microchemistry/methods', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neutralization Tests/*methods', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/diagnosis/epidemiology/virology', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/immunology/*isolation & purification']",,,"['R21 HL109761/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL109761-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3299481,,,['NIHMS342198'],,,,,,,,,,,

Intragenic miRNAs account for approximately 50% of mammalian miRNAs. Classic studies reported that they are usually coexpressed with host genes. Here, using genome-wide miRNA and gene expression profiles from five sample sets, we show that evolutionarily conserved ('old') intragenic miRNAs tend to be coexpressed with host genes, but non-conserved ('young') ones rarely do so. This result is robust: in all sample sets, the coexpression rate of young miRNAs is significantly lower than that of conserved ones even after controlling for abundance. As a result, although young miRNAs dominate in human genome, the majority of intragenic miRNAs that show coexpression with host genes are phylogenetically old ones. For younger miRNAs, extrapolation of their expression profiles from those of their host genes should be treated with caution. We propose a model to explain this phenomenon in which the majority of young miRNAs are unlikely to be coexpressed with host genes; however, for some fraction of young miRNAs coexpression with their host genes, initially imbued by chromatin level effects, is advantageous and these are the ones likely to embed into the system and evolve ever higher levels of coexpression, possibly by evolving piggybacking mechanisms.","['He, Chunjiang', 'Li, Zejuan', 'Chen, Ping', 'Huang, Hao', 'Hurst, Laurence D', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['He C', 'Li Z', 'Chen P', 'Huang H', 'Hurst LD', 'Chen J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['gkr1312 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkr1312 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 May;40(9):4002-12. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkr1312.

Ponatinib (AP24534) is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor being explored in a pivotal phase II trial in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia due to its potent activity against BCR-ABL. Ponatinib has also been shown to inhibit the in vitro kinase activity of all four FGFRs, prompting us to examine its potential as an FGFR inhibitor. In Ba/F3 cells engineered to express activated FGFR1-4, ponatinib potently inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling and viability with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L, with substantial selectivity over parental Ba/F3 cells. In a panel of 14 cell lines representing multiple tumor types (endometrial, bladder, gastric, breast, lung, and colon) and containing FGFRs dysregulated by a variety of mechanisms, ponatinib inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L and inhibited cell growth with GI(50) (concentration needed to reduce the growth of treated cells to half that of untreated cells) values of 7 to 181 nmol/L. Daily oral dosing of ponatinib (10-30 mg/kg) to mice reduced tumor growth and inhibited signaling in all three tumor models examined. Importantly, the potency of ponatinib in these models is similar to that previously observed in BCR-ABL-driven models and plasma levels of ponatinib that exceed the IC(50) values for FGFR1-4 inhibition can be sustained in patients. These results show that ponatinib is a potent pan-FGFR inhibitor and provide strong rationale for its evaluation in patients with FGFR-driven cancers.","['Gozgit, Joseph M', 'Wong, Matthew J', 'Moran, Lauren', 'Wardwell, Scott', 'Mohemmad, Qurish K', 'Narasimhan, Narayana I', 'Shakespeare, William C', 'Wang, Frank', 'Clackson, Tim', 'Rivera, Victor M']","['Gozgit JM', 'Wong MJ', 'Moran L', 'Wardwell S', 'Mohemmad QK', 'Narasimhan NI', 'Shakespeare WC', 'Wang F', 'Clackson T', 'Rivera VM']","['ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 26 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0450 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0450 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Mar;11(3):690-9. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0450.

Nevertheless, XMRV is a retrovirus of undefined pathogenic potential that is able to replicate in human cells. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of two male pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) experimentally infected with XMRV. Following intravenous inoculation with >10(10) RNA copy equivalents of XMRV, viral replication was limited and transient, peaking at </=2,200 viral RNA (vRNA) copies/ml plasma and becoming undetectable by 4 weeks postinfection, though viral DNA (vDNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells remained detectable through 119 days of follow-up. Similarly, vRNA was not detectable in lymph nodes by in situ hybridization despite detectable vDNA. Sequencing of cell-associated vDNA revealed extensive G-to-A hypermutation, suggestive of APOBEC-mediated viral restriction. Consistent with limited viral replication, we found transient upregulation of type I interferon responses that returned to baseline by 2 weeks postinfection, no detectable cellular immune responses, and limited or no spread to prostate tissue. Antibody responses, including neutralizing antibodies, however, were detectable by 2 weeks postinfection and maintained throughout the study. Both animals were healthy for the duration of follow-up. These findings indicate that XMRV replication and spread were limited in pigtailed macaques, predominantly by APOBEC-mediated hypermutation. Given that human APOBEC proteins restrict XMRV infection in vitro, human XMRV infection, if it occurred, would be expected to be characterized by similarly limited viral replication and spread.","['Del Prete, Gregory Q', 'Kearney, Mary F', 'Spindler, Jon', 'Wiegand, Ann', 'Chertova, Elena', 'Roser, James D', 'Estes, Jacob D', 'Hao, Xing Pei', 'Trubey, Charles M', 'Lara, Abigail', 'Lee, Kyeongeun', 'Chaipan, Chawaree', 'Bess, Julian W Jr', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'Keele, Brandon F', 'Macallister, Rhonda', 'Smedley, Jeremy', 'Pathak, Vinay K', 'Kewalramani, Vineet N', 'Coffin, John M', 'Lifson, Jeffrey D']","['Del Prete GQ', 'Kearney MF', 'Spindler J', 'Wiegand A', 'Chertova E', 'Roser JD', 'Estes JD', 'Hao XP', 'Trubey CM', 'Lara A', 'Lee K', 'Chaipan C', 'Bess JW Jr', 'Nagashima K', 'Keele BF', 'Macallister R', 'Smedley J', 'Pathak VK', 'Kewalramani VN', 'Coffin JM', 'Lifson JD']","['AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06886-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06886-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(6):3152-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06886-11.

However, the precise mechanism of HTLV-1 cell tropism has yet to be elucidated. Here, we examined the susceptibilities of various human cell lines to HTLV-1 by using vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing HTLV-1 envelope proteins. We found that the cellular susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection did not correlate with the expression of GLUT1, HS, or NRP-1 alone. To investigate whether other cellular factors were responsible for HTLV-1 susceptibility, we conducted expression cloning. We identified two HS proteoglycan core proteins, syndecan 1 and syndecan 2, as molecules responsible for susceptibility to HTLV-1. We found that treatment of syndecan 1-transduced cells (expressing increased HS) with heparinase, a heparin-degradative enzyme, reduced HTLV-1 susceptibility without affecting the expression levels of HS chains. To further elucidate these results, we characterized the expression of HS chains in terms of the mass, number, and length of HS in several syndecan 1-transduced cell clones as well as human cell lines. We found a significant correlation between HTLV-1 susceptibility and the number of HS chains with short chain lengths. Our findings suggest that a combination of the number and the length of HS chains containing heparin-like regions is a critical factor which affects the cell tropism of HTLV-1.","['Tanaka, Atsushi', 'Jinno-Oue, Atsushi', 'Shimizu, Nobuaki', 'Hoque, Ariful', 'Mori, Takahisa', 'Islam, Salequl', 'Nakatani, Youko', 'Shinagawa, Masahiko', 'Hoshino, Hiroo']","['Tanaka A', 'Jinno-Oue A', 'Shimizu N', 'Hoque A', 'Mori T', 'Islam S', 'Nakatani Y', 'Shinagawa M', 'Hoshino H']","['Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan. atsushit@med.gunma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05783-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05783-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(6):2959-69. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05783-11.

Nevertheless, broad-based, unbiased approaches to globally assess the presence of ectopic organisms within cell model systems have not previously been available. We reasoned that high-throughput sequencing should provide unparalleled insights into the microbiomes of tissue culture cell systems. Here we have used our RNA-seq analysis pipeline, PARSES (Pipeline for Analysis of RNA-Seq Exogenous Sequences), to investigate the presence of ectopic organisms within two EBV-positive B-cell lines commonly used by EBV researchers. Sequencing data sets from both the Akata and JY B-cell lines were found to contain reads for EBV, and the JY data set was found to also contain reads from the murine leukemia virus (MuLV). Further investigation revealed that MuLV transcription in JY cells is highly active. We also identified a number of MuLV alternative splicing events, and we uncovered evidence of APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G)-dependent DNA editing. Finally, reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed the presence of MuLV in three other human B-cell lines (DG75, Ramos, and P3HR1 Cl.13) commonly used by investigators in the Epstein-Barr virus field. We believe that a thorough examination of tissue culture microbiomes using RNA-seq/PARSES-like approaches is critical for the appropriate utilization of these systems in biological studies.","['Lin, Zhen', 'Puetter, Adriane', 'Coco, Joseph', 'Xu, Guorong', 'Strong, Michael J', 'Wang, Xia', 'Fewell, Claire', 'Baddoo, Melody', 'Taylor, Christopher', 'Flemington, Erik K']","['Lin Z', 'Puetter A', 'Coco J', 'Xu G', 'Strong MJ', 'Wang X', 'Fewell C', 'Baddoo M', 'Taylor C', 'Flemington EK']","['Tulane University Health Sciences Center and Tulane Cancer Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06717-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06717-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(6):2970-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06717-11.

Commonly, standard analysis of variance (ANOVA)/regression is implemented to identify the relative effects of these genes over the two types of samples from their respective arrays of expression levels. But, this technique becomes fundamentally flawed when there are unaccounted sources of variability in these arrays (latent variables attributable to different biological, environmental or other factors relevant in the context). These factors distort the true picture of differential gene expression between the two tissue types and introduce spurious signals of expression heterogeneity. As a result, many genes which are actually differentially expressed are not detected, whereas many others are falsely identified as positives. Moreover, these distortions can be different for different genes. Thus, it is also not possible to get rid of these variations by simple array normalizations. This both-way error can lead to a serious loss in sensitivity and specificity, thereby causing a severe inefficiency in the underlying multiple testing problem. In this work, we attempt to identify the hidden effects of the underlying latent factors in a gene expression profiling study by partial least squares (PLS) and apply ANCOVA technique with the PLS-identified signatures of these hidden effects as covariates, in order to identify the genes that are truly differentially expressed between the two concerned tissue types. RESULTS: We compare the performance of our method SVA-PLS with standard ANOVA and a relatively recent technique of surrogate variable analysis (SVA), on a wide variety of simulation settings (incorporating different effects of the hidden variable, under situations with varying signal intensities and gene groupings). In all settings, our method yields the highest sensitivity while maintaining relatively reasonable values for the specificity, false discovery rate and false non-discovery rate. Application of our method to gene expression profiling for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia shows that our method detects an additional six genes, that are missed by both the standard ANOVA method as well as SVA, but may be relevant to this disease, as can be seen from mining the existing literature.","['Chakraborty, Sutirtha', 'Datta, Somnath', 'Datta, Susmita']","['Chakraborty S', 'Datta S', 'Datta S']","['Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['bts022 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/bts022 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2012 Mar 15;28(6):799-806. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts022.

First generation 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists are effective prophylactic agents but require multiple administrations. Palonosetron has a half life of 36-42 hours and has higher affinity and selectivity to the 5-HT(3) receptor. Adult studies have demonstrated that palonosetron is both more effective and require fewer administrations than first generation 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a single dose of palonosetron (5 microg/kg) for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in children 18 years of age with ALL treated with HD-MTX, 5 g/m(2). PROCEDURE: Between January 2010 and December 2010, 138 courses, originating from 53 children, were included from four Danish Childhood Cancer Centers. Information regarding emetic episodes, rescue therapy, and nausea were recorded prospectively on questionnaires. RESULTS: Complete response (no emesis and no rescue therapy) was achieved in 84.1% of courses during the acute (0-24 hours post-chemotherapy) and in 60.1% during the delayed phase (24-66 hours post-chemotherapy). 92.0% of courses were free of emesis during the acute, and 86.2% were free of emesis during the delayed phase. 76.8% of courses were free of nausea during the acute, and 78.3% were free of nausea during the delayed phase. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of palonosetron--without concomitant corticosteroid--was effective in preventing both acute and delayed phase CINV in majority of children with ALL treated with HD-MTX.","['Nadaraja, Sambavy', 'Mamoudou, Aissata Diop', 'Thomassen, Harald', 'Wehner, Peder Skov', 'Rosthoej, Steen', 'Schroeder, Henrik']","['Nadaraja S', 'Mamoudou AD', 'Thomassen H', 'Wehner PS', 'Rosthoej S', 'Schroeder H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark. sambavy.nadaraja@studmed.au.dk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24068 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Nov;59(5):870-3. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24068.

We here report the frequency of TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4, and BCR-ABL chimeric transcripts in 264 Iraqi children newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), using FTA cards impregnated with bone marrow aspirate or whole blood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of ALL was made according to standard French-American-British morphologic criteria. Based on the results of storage temperature and duration, most of the FTA samples were preserved at 4 degrees C for up to 6 weeks in five Iraqi hospitals and then transferred to Japan for molecular analysis. Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was adopted for the analysis. RESULTS: TEL-AML1 chimeric transcript product was found in 32 (12.1%) of 264 ALL patients. Eleven (4.2%) patients, 4 (1.5%) patients, and 11 (4.2%) patients had E2A-PBX1 mRNA, MLL-AF4 mRNA, and BCR-ABL mRNA, respectively. One patient had both TEL-AML1 and E2A-PBX1 fusion genes. The incidence of TEL-AML1 in Iraqi ALL children appears to be similar to or slightly higher than those of Jordan (12%) and Kuwait (7%). The prevalence and clinical findings of ALL patients with either E2A-PBX1 or BCR-ABL were comparable to the data reported elsewhere. CONCLUSION: International collaboration via FTA cards may be helpful to improve diagnosis and management of patients with hematological malignancies in low-income and underdeveloped countries.","[""Al-Kzayer, Lika'a Fasih Y"", 'Sakashita, Kazuo', 'Matsuda, Kazuyuki', 'Al-Hadad, Salma Abbas', 'Al-Jadiry, Mazin Faisal', 'Abed, Wisam Majeed', 'Abdulkadhim, Jaafar M H', 'Al-Shujairi, Tariq Abadi', 'Hasan, Janan Ghalib', 'Al-Abdullah, Hussam M Salih', 'Al-Ani, Mouroge H', 'Saber, Paiman Ali I', 'Inoshita, Toshi', 'Kamata, Minoru', 'Koike, Kenichi']","['Al-Kzayer LF', 'Sakashita K', 'Matsuda K', 'Al-Hadad SA', 'Al-Jadiry MF', 'Abed WM', 'Abdulkadhim JM', 'Al-Shujairi TA', 'Hasan JG', 'Al-Abdullah HM', 'Al-Ani MH', 'Saber PA', 'Inoshita T', 'Kamata M', 'Koike K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24055 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Sep;59(3):461-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24055.

PROCEDURE: To expand the donor pool, we assessed the feasibility, tolerance, and efficacy of using a haploidentical (HI) donor and a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for high-risk pediatric leukemia. This study was facilitated by technology transfer from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital over the 2 preceding years. RESULTS: Between March 2006 and April 2009, 10 patients (median age, 9.8 years) received T cell-depleted grafts at Calvo Mackenna Hospital in Santiago. Median cell doses were CD34+: 7.45 x 10(6)/kg (range, 4.00-20.20 x 10(6)/kg); CD3+: 0.88 x 10(5)/kg (0.11-1.35 x 10(5)/kg); and CD56+: 71.30 x 10(6)/kg (31.50-131.80 x 10(6)/kg). Nine patients experienced complete engraftment; six of the nine remain alive and clinically well 13-50 months post-HSCT. Three patients died after bone marrow relapse, while only one died of transplant-related causes. Virus reactivation was the main post-transplant complication: 5/10 had positive CMV PCR but none had CMV disease. One patient developed acute GvHD > grade II and only one had chronic GvHD. CONCLUSIONS: HI-HSCT is feasible in our setting, offers a rational treatment option, and expands the donor pool significantly for children with high-risk leukemia in a developing country.

METHODS: We constructed four claims-based algorithms to assess myeloid leukemia incidence, applied the algorithms to the 1999-2008 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, and assessed algorithm validity using SEER-registered cases. RESULTS: Each had moderate sensitivities (75%-94%) and high specificities (>99.0%), with the 2+BCBM algorithm showing the highest specificity. On the basis of the 2+BCBM algorithm, SEER registered only 50% of the acute myelogenous leukemia cases and a third of the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases. The annual incidence of myeloid leukemia in 2005 was 26 per 100,000 persons 66 years or older, much higher than the 15 per 100,000 reported by SEER using the same sample. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest underreporting of myeloid leukemias in SEER by a magnitude of 50% to 70% as well as validate and support the use of the 2+BCBM claims algorithm in identifying myeloid leukemia cases. Use of this algorithm identified a high number of uncaptured myeloid leukemia cases, particularly CML cases. IMPACT: Our results call for the commitment of more resources for centralized cancer registries so that they may improve myeloid leukemia case ascertainment, which would empower policy makers with ability to properly allocate limited health care resources.","['Craig, Benjamin M', 'Rollison, Dana E', 'List, Alan F', 'Cogle, Christopher R']","['Craig BM', 'Rollison DE', 'List AF', 'Cogle CR']","['H.Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, Tampa, FL 33612, USA. benjamin.craig@moffitt.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-11-1087 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-1087 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2012 Mar;21(3):474-81. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-1087.

The Bcl-2 family of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules is a key regulator of this phenomenon, with the sub-family of BH3-only molecules serving as activators and/or facilitators. Apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids (GC) is a central component in the therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and defining its molecular basis and that of GC resistance is crucial for therapeutic improvements. We recently identified a novel transcript from the BCL2L11/Bim locus, termed ""Bam"", by affymetrix based whole genome expression profiling performed on 27 children (13 were already published) with ALL and many additional biological systems. Most children that induced Bam also induced Bim as well, in some cases Bam induction was more pronounced than that of Bim and in one patient only the Bam, but not Bim was induced. In C7H2, PreB697, Jurkat-GR(wt) and GC-sensitive (S-lines), this transcript was induced by GC in a translation-independent manner, suggesting that direct transcriptional induction of this BH3-only molecule by GC might cause apoptosis in at least ALL children and other biological systems.","['Mansha, Muhammad', 'Wasim, Muhammad', 'Kofler, Anita', 'Ploner, Christian']","['Mansha M', 'Wasim M', 'Kofler A', 'Ploner C']","['Division of Science and Technology, University of Education, Township Campus, Lahore, Pakistan. mmansha2005@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-011-1414-x [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2012 May;39(5):6007-13. doi: 10.1007/s11033-011-1414-x.

Most patients do not need treatment at the time of first diagnosis. The identification of prognostic factors is of major interest if strategies can be devised to treat patients according to their individual risk profile or biological subgroup. Currently, in spite of a wealth of prognostic factors, individualized treatment approaches in different genetic or risk groups are the exemption in CLL. This review summarizes the most important prognostic and predictive factors in CLL, with particular emphasis on factors affecting treatment decisions in clinical trials and routine practice.","['Sellner, Leopold', 'Dietrich, Sascha', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Glimm, Hanno', 'Zenz, Thorsten']","['Sellner L', 'Dietrich S', 'Dreger P', 'Glimm H', 'Zenz T']","['Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,2012/01/13 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2012/01/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-011-0110-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2012 Mar;7(1):3-12. doi: 10.1007/s11899-011-0110-1.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
