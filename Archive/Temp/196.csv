The available modes of therapy for Graves' disease are antithyroid drugs, radioiodine and surgery. Radioiodine therapy is indicated in patients with nearly all causes of hyperthyroidism and is considered the treatment of choice for most patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism who are beyond the adolescent years. Pregnancy and breast-feeding are absolute contraindications. Although there are many ways of calculating the dose of radioiodine, fixed dose regimens are gaining acceptance. Hypothyroidism follows sooner or later in nearly all patients treated with radioiodine. Available evidence suggest that patients are best treated by a single thyroablative dose, the aim being elimination of hyperthyroidism, with larger doses accomplishing it with more certainty, and the inevitable hypothyroidism develops under physician control. Radioiodine therapy can lead to exacerbation of infiltrative ophthalmopathy and this can be prevented by the concomitant administration of corticosteroids. Radioiodine therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism has no adverse effects on the health of the offspring of treated patients. There are no definitive data that provide evidence for increased rates of thyroid cancer, leukaemia, infertility or neonatal abnormality in patients treated with radioiodine. Radioiodine therapy is safe, definitive and cost-effective.","['Sankar, R', 'Sripathy, G']","['Sankar R', 'Sripathy G']","['Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Lucknow Road, Timarpur, Delhi 110054, India. natram@mantraonline.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Contraindications', 'Female', 'Graves Disease/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/etiology', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",81,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Natl Med J India. 2000 Sep-Oct;13(5):246-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eleven B-CLL patients were studied. Leukemic lymphocytes with (n = 8) or without (n = 3) P2z receptors were exposed in vitro to ATP, benzoyl-benzoic-ATP (BzATP), 2-methylthio-ATP(2MeSATP), adenosine-5'-[gamma-thio] triphosphate (ATP-gamma S), and other nucleosides for 8 h. Apoptosis was detected by electron microscopy (EM), agarose gel electrophoresis, and quantitative TdT assay. RESULTS: Apoptosis was detected only in leukemic lymphocytes with P2z receptors. By using the quantitative assay, ATP-inducing DNA strand breaks were found to occur specifically for BzATP, ATP and 2MeSATP, but not for ATP-gamma S and other nucleosides. Meanwhile, ATP-inducing DNA fragmentation was fully blocked by pretreatment with oxidized ATP (OxATP), a compound recently shown to block P2z receptors. Ca2+/Calmodulin complex played a role in the regulation of the CLL cell apoptosis induced by ATP, because an antagonist of this complex, 1-[N,O-bis (5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (KN-62), was found to inhibit the ATP-inducing apoptosis.

RESULTS: p16 gene methylation was detected in 6 of 55 patients (10.9%), who were 1 patient with M2a, 1 patient with M5a, 2 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis, 1 patient with progressing multiple myeloma (MM), 1 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) accompanied by B-ALL, respectively. p16 gene methylation correlates with adverse prognostic features. The patients with p16 gene methylation had poor response to therapy, and died shortly after p16 gene methylation was detected. CONCLUSION: The methylation of p16 gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis and the development of some hematological malignancies. The patients with p16 gene methylation have poor prognosis.

The exact impact of these particles on the normal immune cell function still remain relatively unclear. Activation of T-cells following exposure to biomaterial particles is driven by macrophages and requires synergistic signals primed by both antigen presentation and costimulation. The pattern of costimulatory molecule expression (CD80,CD86) was primarily examined using immunohistochemistry on tissue specimens of bone/implant interface membranes taken from sites of bone erosion. Additionally, costimulatory molecule expression was also assessed in the monocytic leukemia cell line U937 following exposure to clinically relevant titanium aluminum vanadium (TiAlV) and stainless steel particles (FeCrNi) cultured in vitro. This study demonstrates the induction and prominent expression of CD86 on almost all macrophage subsets at the bone/implant interface, including fused forms and large multinucleated giant cells (MNGC). In vitro analysis also indicated phagocytosis of metal particles by differentiated U937 caused significant induction of both CD80 and CD86 (p < 0.01), although the expression of CD86 dominated following prolonged exposure. The data presented highlights that CD86 is the predominant costimulatory molecule ligating to the complementary CD28 molecule at the inflammatory lesion of the interface. We propose that the intracellular presence of indigestible implant material, in addition to elevated costimulatory molecule expression, may promote T-cell inflammatory reactions at sites close to and distant from the orthopedic implant.","['Bainbridge, J A', 'Revell, P A', 'Al-Saffar, N']","['Bainbridge JA', 'Revell PA', 'Al-Saffar N']","['Department of Histopathology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Hampstead, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biomed Mater Res,Journal of biomedical materials research,0112726,"['0 (Alloys)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '12743-70-3 (titanium alloy (TiAl6V4))', 'D1JT611TNE (Titanium)']",IM,"['Alloys/toxicity', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation/immunology/pathology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Prostheses and Implants/*adverse effects', 'Titanium/toxicity']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biomed Mater Res. 2001 Mar 5;54(3):328-34. doi: 10.1002/1097-4636(20010305)54:3<328::aid-jbm30>3.0.co;2-5.,,['10.1002/1097-4636(20010305)54:3<328::aid-jbm30>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Palliative therapy was gradually replaced by chemotherapy (CT) which rapidly proved unexpectedly effective. In 1948, the first antifolic drugs, aminopterin and methotrexate, were discovered, followed in 1950 by the corticoids and in 1953 by antipurine agents. By 1967, a combination of these drugs yielded a survival index of 50% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with a progressive increase in all important cancer centers today, including in GATLA (Argentine Group for Acute Leukemia). As for acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) the CT results were not as spectacular although now there is a 25% survival index which reaches 40-50% in young adults. As for allogeneic transplant in acute leukemia, its use must be evaluated for each patient and for each circumstance. Leukemias are genetic diseases for which gene therapy undoubtedly has potential value. However, the problems raised by the election of the right gene or gene marker and specially of the adequate vector have not yet been solved. In Hodgkin's disease, the results obtained with CT since the decade of the 60s have been spectacular and today different combinations of drugs have yielded a survival rate above 80%.

When cultured in vitro, spontaneous apoptosis occurs, suggesting the existence in vivo of survival-promoting factors. We here show that non-malignant leukocytes, particularly monocytes and NK cells, are able to inhibit B-CLL cells apoptosis, at least in part, through the release of soluble factors. Neutralizing antibodies directed to interferon-gamma or IL-4 only partially abolish the protecting effects of accessory cells suggesting that they are not the main cytokines involved. Increased apoptosis of B-CLL cells is not associated with modifications in the expression of Bcl-2, Fas or Fas ligand.

It is present in nearly all patients with leukaemia at some time in the disease and in 50% of patients with lymphoma after chemotherapy. Cancer-related anaemia appears to result from a range of factors including chronic inflammation, blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, haemolysis, bone marrow infiltration by malignant cells, low serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels, and a decrease of bone marrow responsiveness to EPO. The consequences of anaemia, namely fatigue and cardiovascular symptoms, can adversely affect patients' quality of life and may even alter their response to cancer treatment. Moreover, anaemia is often associated with the presence of several adverse prognostic parameters and is also itself a predictor of poor prognosis. Furthermore, anaemia and its symptoms can be exacerbated by cancer treatment. Until recently, blood transfusions have been the mainstay of treatment for cancer-related anaemia, despite the associated risks of transfusion-related reactions and transmission of infection. By increasing haemoglobin levels and haematocrit, treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusion in patients with haematological malignancies. It is recommended that rHuEPO be administered when a patient's haemoglobin level is at risk of falling below 8g/dL, and that treatment is maintained until levels rise above 13g/dL. Consideration of the detrimental effects of anaemia on cancer patients' physical and emotional well-being and therapeutic outcome suggests that rHuEPO therapy has the potential to provide substantial clinical benefits.","['Coiffier, B']",['Coiffier B'],"[""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-Benite, France. bertrand.coiffier@chu-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Anemia/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Erythropoietin/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of Life', 'Recombinant Proteins']",46,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2000 Nov;17 Suppl 1:S2-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, blood transfusions have formed the mainstay of therapy for the treatment of cancer-related anaemia. Numerous clinical trials have subsequently confirmed the safety and therapeutic utility of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in anaemic cancer patients, including those with haematological malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Indeed, well over 50% of unselected patients treated with rHuEPO can be expected to respond with increases in haemoglobin level and/or elimination of transfusion need. In addition, a low baseline serum erythropoietin level can identify those patients with haematological malignancies having a very high likelihood of responding to rHuEPO therapy. These findings, in combination with the possibility of titrating to a lower, maintenance dose, have improved the cost-benefit relationship and thus support the use of rHuEPO as an appropriate alternative to blood transfusions for the management of anaemic patients with lymphoma and myeloma.","['Osterbor, A']",['Osterbor A'],"['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. anders.osterborg@ks.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Anemia/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Costs', 'Erythropoietin/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",29,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2000 Nov;17 Suppl 1:S17-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In untreated subjects, the most common type is the so-called anaemia of chronic disease, a condition characterised by excessive release of cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor. These peptides both inhibit erythroid marrow proliferation and blunt the normal exponential relationship between haematocrit and serum erythropoietin. Chemotherapy may cause or worsen anaemia in cancer patients. Cisplatin appears to be peculiar in that this drug can blunt erythropoietin production and cause prolonged anaemia. Controlled studies have demonstrated that recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) can ameliorate anaemia in patients with malignancy and prevent chemotherapy-induced anaemia. However, improvement of anaemia following rHuEPO treatment is seen in only a portion of cancer patients, and significant improvements of quality of life cannot be demonstrated in all responsive patients.

Medical Research Council Childhood Leukaemia Working Party.",2307-20,"Results of three consecutive completed UK trials (1980-1997) for childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia are presented. National accrual has progressively increased so that over 90% of all the country's ALL cases were treated on the latest trial reported, UKALLXI. From 1980 to 1990, event-free and overall survival progressively improved, following adoption of an American therapy template and use of two post-remission intensification modules. Since 1990 despite demonstration of the benefit of a third intensification module overall event-free survival (EFS) has not improved further. Survival remains high due to a good retrieval rate especially for those relapsing off treatment after receipt of two intensification pulses. Possible reasons for the plateau in event-free survival (including type and dose of induction steroid, dropping of induction anthracycline, type and dose of asparaginase, gaps early in therapy following intensification, and overall lack of compliance in maintenance) are being explored in the latest protocol ALL '97. Cranial irradiation had been successfully replaced by a long course of intrathecal methotrexate injections for the majority of patients. Age (<1 year >10 years) sex (male) and white count >50 x 10(9)/l plus slow initial bone marrow clearance were consistently the most important independent prognostic indicators during this time period. Rome/NCI criteria accurately predict standard and high-risk groups for B cell lineage, but not consistently for T cell disease.

Secondly, to report the EFS according to presenting features and lineage. Thirdly, to evaluate the treatment results re-classified by the risks of NCI criteria. Four consecutive protocol studies were performed in the Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group: L81-10 protocol (1981-1984, 189 patients), L84-11 (1984-1989, 484 patents), L89-12 (1989-1992, 418 patients) and L92-13 (1992-1995, 347 patients). Overall EFS at 5 years in each protocol was 56.5 +/- 3.8(1 s.e.)%, 71.0 +/- 2.1%, 67.8 +/- 2.3%, and 63.4 +/- 2.7%, respectively. The cumulative isolated CNS relapse rate at 5 years was 8.1 +/- 2.1%, 3.5 +/- 0.9%, 3.6 +/- 1.0%, 1.0 +/- 0.6. The EFS in SR/HR (standard risk/high risk) according to the NCI criteria in B-precursor ALL at 5 years was 61.9 +/- 4.3%/41.4 +/- 7.4% (lineage was not confirmed.), 72.5 +/- 2.6%/63.4 +/- 5.0%, 77.4 +/- 2.7%/56.3 +/- 4.7%, and 67.8 +/- 3.4%/56.7 +/- 5.4% in each protocol. Also EFSs according to NCI SR/HR at 5 years of T-ALL in protocols L84-11, L89-12 and L92-13 were 55.6 +/- 16.6%/60.9 +/- 10.1%, 72.7 +/- 13.4%/51.6 +/- 9.1%, and 77.1 +/- 14.4%/53.6/10.1%, respectively. The truncation of maintenance therapy to 6 months resulted in a decreased EFS in L92-13, particularly due to an increase of bone marrow relapse after cessation of therapy in SR and HR. The NCI risk criteria work properly even in the patients treated by different intensities, so that it makes the comparison possible among the patients in various groups. The overall EFSs in childhood ALL improved in 1980s, but it seemed stable or decreased in 1990s. The short maintenance therapy resulted in poor outcome in SR on the L92-13 protocol. Many of these late relapsers were effectively rescued and overall survival remained at a high level.

The development from regional or national protocols to common Nordic treatment protocols for all risk groups was completed in 1992 through a successive intensification with multidrug chemotherapy, including pulses of methotrexate in high doses and avoidance of cranial irradiation in most children.

In DCLSG protocol ALL-6 (1984-1988), designed for patients with ALL non-high risk (ALL-NHR) (WBC <50 x 10(9)/l, no mediastinal mass, no B cell phenotype and no CNS involvement at diagnosis, comprising 71% of all ALL patients), CNS prophylaxis consisted of a combination of three methods of chemotherapeutic CNS prophylaxis (the use of dexamethasone during induction and maintenance therapy, i.v. medium dose methotrexate and prolonged administration of intrathecal triple therapy). Total duration of treatment: 116 weeks. 190 patients were enrolled in the study.

Besides improvement in long-term survival major objectives were reduction of treatment-related toxicity by transferring asparaginase (ASP) from induction therapy to intensive phase and omitting CNS irradiation by stepwise increase of the initial white blood count (WBC) up to 50 x 10(9)/l (exception T-ALL) as criterion for irradiation. In study COALL-85 in high risk patients slow vs rapid rotational treatment was randomized. In study COALL-92 initial response to daunorubicin (DNR) as a 1-h vs 24-h infusion and its prognostic value was investigated. Furthermore, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG) were randomized in maintenance treatment. In total, 1191 eligible patients were enrolled. Induction treatment without ASP has been shown to be as effective and less hazardous than the former four-drug induction. CNS control could be obtained in most without cranial irradiation (CNS relapse-free survival >95%). The leukemic cell kill with a 24-h DNR infusion was equivalent to that of a 1-h infusion. DNR response was of less prognostic significance than prednisone response. The rapid rotation regimen failed to improve outcome as well as 6-TG in maintenance treatment. However, intensification of systemic treatment resulted in an increase in overall event-free survival (EFS) to approximately 80% which is comparable to other groups.","['Harms, D O', 'Janka-Schaub, G E']","['Harms DO', 'Janka-Schaub GE']","[""Children's University Hospital, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hamburg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2234-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401974.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401974 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The probability for event-free survival (pEFS) at 8 years improved from 65.8% in study ALL-BFM 81 to 75.9% in study ALL-BFM 90. The cumulative incidence of recurrences with CNS involvement was 10.1% and 9.3% in studies ALL-BFM 81 and 83, but was reduced to less than 5% in study ALL-BFM 90 (for isolated CNS relapses from 5.3% in study ALL-BFM 81 to 1.1% in study ALL-BFM 90). Four major findings were derived from this series of trials performed by 37 to 96 centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland: (1) Reintensification is a crucial part of treatment, even in low risk patients; (2) presymptomatic cranial radiotherapy can be safely reduced to 12 Gy, or even be eliminated if it is replaced by early intensive systemic and intrathecal methotrexate applied; (3) maintenance therapy given a total of 24 months from diagnosis provides a lower rate of systemic relapses than treatment for 18 months; (4) inadequate response to an initial 7-day prednisone window (combined with one intrathecal injection of methotrexate on day 1) defines about 10% of the patients with a very high risk of relapse. For patients with adequate early response (90% of all) an 8-year pEFS of 80% has been achieved in the most recent trial ALL-BFM 90. While it has proven so far to be impossible to improve the outcome for the small group of high risk patients, the number of recurrences could be effectively reduced for the large group of patients responding adequately to the prednisone in vivo sensitivity test. Apart from inadequate prednisone response, patients with hyperleukocytosis, age <1 year, or the presence of the Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph+ ALL) are at a particularly high risk of failure.","['Schrappe, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Harbott, J', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Henze, G', 'Gadner, H', 'Odenwald, E', 'Riehm, H']","['Schrappe M', 'Reiter A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Harbott J', 'Ludwig WD', 'Henze G', 'Gadner H', 'Odenwald E', 'Riehm H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2205-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401973.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401973 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment schedules have been characterized by a progressive intensification of systemic therapy and by a progressive substitution of protracted intrathecal therapy for cranial irradiation as central nervous system (CNS) preventive therapy. In the third period cranial radiotherapy (CRT) has been administered only to patients at high risk of relapse or with CNS involvement at diagnosis (about 15% of the overall population). A progressive improvement of therapeutic results, with a steady reduction of isolated CNS relapse rates have been obtained in the three periods considered here. The AIEOP experience shows that CRT can be safely omitted in non-high risk patients, unless they are T-ALL patients with WBC count at the diagnosis > or =100,000/mm3, and that intensification of treatment allows the improvement of overall results with a reduction of the impact of NCI prognostic criteria.

However, the DC used in these clinical trials were generated with various serum sources and were poorly characterized. Obtaining fully characterized DC in controlled and reproducible culture conditions is thus of major interest. We demonstrate that X-VIVO 15 medium supplemented with 2% human albumin can be used to obtain DC. The phenotypic and functional characteristics of these clinical-grade DC were analyzed according to their differentiation stages. CD83 immature DC, obtained in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-4, were able to endocyte soluble antigens and internalize apoptotic tumor cells, and also expressed receptors for inflammatory chemokines. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced irreversible DC maturation in association with a decreased ability to uptake antigens and an increased allostimulatory capacity. CD83+ mature DC became responsive to EBI1 ligand chemokine (ELC), a chemokine specifically expressed in secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, mature DC obtained with TNF-alpha produced IL-12 and some IL-10 in response to CD40 stimulation. In conclusion, we present well-defined culture conditions allowing the control of DC maturation for clinical or fundamental studies.","['Tarte, K', 'Fiol, G', 'Rossi, J F', 'Klein, B']","['Tarte K', 'Fiol G', 'Rossi JF', 'Klein B']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 475, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Montpellier, H pital Saint Eloi, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', '*Apoptosis', 'Chemokines/pharmacology', '*Chemotaxis', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/pathology', '*Phagocytosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2182-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401925.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401925 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Current techniques for assaying telomerase activity detect only the mean activity in a sample and are unable to isolate specific cell sub-populations. This report describes the development and validation of a cellular, immunofluorescence-based flow cytometry assay that allows detection of intranuclear hTERT while maintaining identifiable cell population characteristics. The assay was shown to be both sensitive to changes in telomerase expression and was semi-quantitative. In both cell line differentiation experiments and in primary cells, a good correlation existed between hTERT expression measured by flow cytometry and telomerase activity detected by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). The method developed offers a quick, simple and reproducible cellular-based assay for hTERT expression. This assay will provide a useful, new tool for future investigations, facilitating the analysis of hTERT expression in mixed cell populations.","['Ali, A S', 'Chopra, R', 'Robertson, J', 'Testa, N G']","['Ali AS', 'Chopra R', 'Robertson J', 'Testa NG']","['Department of Experimental Haematology, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', '*RNA', 'Telomerase/*metabolism']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2176-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401950.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401950 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Methotrexate (MTX) is an important component in the treatment of childhood leukemia. Mechanisms of MTX resistance include (1) decreased transport via the reduced folate carrier (RFC), (2) altered levels of target enzymes, eg dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS), (3) decreased ratio of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS)/folylpolyglutamate hydrolase (FPGH). We designed competitive templates for each of these genes to measure mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized the expression to that of beta-actin. T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), relatively MTX resistant compared to common/preB-ALL, displayed higher mRNA levels of DHFR and TS (three- and four-fold higher, respectively; P < 0.001), while FPGS expression was lower (three-fold, P = 0.006) compared to common/preB-ALL. The ratio of (DHFR x FPGH)/(RFC x FPGS) was more discriminating between T-ALL and c/preB-ALL (eight-fold higher; P < 0.001) than either target independently. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, considered MTX resistant, expressed two-fold lower levels of FPGS mRNA compared to c/preB-ALL (P = 0.04). The ratio of FPGH/FPGS was more discriminating between AML and c/preB-ALL (four-fold higher; P = 0.001) than either target independently. For the total group of 79 leukemic samples, mRNA expression of DHFR varied 549-fold and paralleled TS mRNA expression (r = 0.80; P < 0.001). Although variations in mRNA expression resembled variations in functional activity, no direct correlations were found for RFC (58-fold variation in mRNA expression), FPGS (95-fold) and FPGH (178-fold).

The present study describes two new B lymphoid cell lines, B593 and BR97, derived from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which differ in susceptibility to CD95-mediated apoptosis. While B593 cells are sensitive to CD95mediated apoptosis, BR97 cells are completely resistant. Activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 proteases plays an important role in the CD95 signalling pathway. CD95 stimulation induced caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation in B593, but not in BR97 cells. However, activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-3 was achieved in BR97 cells treated with staurosporine. Furthermore, protein synthesis inhibition by cycloheximide restored sensitivity to CD95-mediated apoptosis and allowed activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-3 in BR97 cells. These results indicate that, in BR97 cells, both caspases are functional and suggest that CD95-apoptosis resistance may result from the presence of inhibitory factor(s). Constitutive high level expression of the apoptotic inhibitor c-FLIP was observed in the CD95-resistant BR97 cell line compared to B593. Moreover, downregulation of c-FLIP expression level by protein synthesis inhibition strictly correlated with restored sensitivity to CD95-mediated apoptosis in BR97 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that c-FLIP is recruited to the CD95 DISC in BR97 cells together with caspase-8 and FADD. The data presented in this study strongly suggests that, in a B-NHL-derived cell line, resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis results from endogenous high level expression of apoptotic inhibitor c-FLIP.","['Irisarri, M', 'Plumas, J', 'Bonnefoix, T', 'Jacob, M C', 'Roucard, C', 'Pasquier, M A', 'Sotto, J J', 'Lajmanovich, A']","['Irisarri M', 'Plumas J', 'Bonnefoix T', 'Jacob MC', 'Roucard C', 'Pasquier MA', 'Sotto JJ', 'Lajmanovich A']","['Research Group on Lymphoma, Albert Bonniot Institute, University Joseph Fourier, La Tronche, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2149-58. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401954.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401954 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the type and pattern of genomic instability occurring in histological transformation of FCLs and the role of DNA mismatch repair defects in this procedure, we have performed microsatellite analysis, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and mutational analysis of hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes on serial biopsy specimens from patients with FCL transformed to diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL). Paired biopsy samples of eight patients were analyzed for microsatellite instability and structural alterations for hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes, and tumor samples of five patients were subjected to CGH analysis. A high level of microsatellite instability was associated with histological transformation of two cases of FCL, but no mutations of the hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes were detected in any of the lymphoma samples. In the five cases subjected to CGH analysis, the histological transformation of FCLs was associated with genomic imbalances at 21 chromosomal regions. The genomic abnormalities found were rather heterogeneous and none of the genetic changes were overrepresented in the transformed DLCLs. These data suggest that histological transformation of FCLs to DLCL is frequently associated with genome wide instability at both nucleic acid and chromosomal levels, although mutations of the hMSH1 and hMLH2 genes are not involved in this process.","['Nagy, M', 'Balazs, M', 'Adam, Z', 'Petko, Z', 'Timar, B', 'Szereday, Z', 'Laszlo, T', 'Warnke, R A', 'Matolcsy, A']","['Nagy M', 'Balazs M', 'Adam Z', 'Petko Z', 'Timar B', 'Szereday Z', 'Laszlo T', 'Warnke RA', 'Matolcsy A']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Pecs University, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carrier Proteins', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/*pathology', 'Microsatellite Repeats/genetics', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2142-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401978.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401978 [doi]'],,,['CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, an overnight 3H-thymidine (3H-Tdr) suicide assay was used to analyze the proliferative status of malignant progenitors detected in both colony-forming cell (CFC) and long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays from the peripheral blood of nine patients with newly diagnosed AML. Culture of AML cells in serum-free medium with 100 ng/ml Steel factor (SF), 20 ng/ml interleukin 3 (IL-3) and 20 ng/ml granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 16-24 h maintained the number of AML-CFC and LTC-IC at near input values (mean % input +/- s.d. for CFC and LTC-IC were 78 +/- 33 and 126 +/- 53, respectively). The addition of 20 muCi/ml high specific activity 3H-Tdr to these cultures reduced the numbers of both progenitor cell types from most of the patient samples substantially: mean % kill +/- s.d. for AML-CFC and LTC-IC were 64 +/- 27 and 82 +/- 16, respectively, indicating that a large proportion of both progenitor populations were actively cycling. FISH analysis of colonies from CFC and LTC-IC assays confirmed that most cytogenetically abnormal CFC and LTC-IC were actively cycling (mean % kill +/- s.d.: 68 +/- 26 and 85 +/- 13, respectively). Interestingly, in six patient samples where a significant number of cytogenetically normal LTC-ICs were detected, the % kill of these cells (74 +/- 20) was similar to that of the abnormal progenitors. These data contrast with the predominantly quiescent cell cycle status of CFC and LTC-IC previously observed in steady-state peripheral blood from normal individuals but also provide evidence that a significant proportion of primitive malignant progenitors from AML patients are quiescent and therefore may be resistant to standard chemotherapeutic regimens.","['Guan, Y', 'Hogge, D E']","['Guan Y', 'Hogge DE']","['Department of Medicine and Pathology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aged', '*Cell Division', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2135-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401975.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401975 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

HSPA9 was recently localized to chromosome 5, band q31, a region that is frequently deleted in myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasia (MDS), making it a candidate tumor suppressor gene, which is consistent with the biological function of its murine homologue. To evaluate mortalin in this capacity, its expression in normal and leukemic cell lines was investigated, and its genomic structure was determined in order to facilitate mutation detection. RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis revealed a broad distribution in normal tissues and in leukemia cell lines, producing a single 2.8 kb transcript. Genomic characterization showed that the gene spans 18 kb, and consisted of 17 exons with boundaries that were almost identical to its murine counterpart. Using intron-based primers to flank each exon, sequence of the complete protein-coding regions was obtained for three AML cell lines, including two lines with chromosome 5 loss (KG-1 and HL-60) and one without (AML-193) compared to normal DNA. No mutations were identified although one conservative nucleotide sequence variant was observed in exon 16. We have shown that mortalin is highly conserved in genomic structure as well as sequence, and the designed primers will be suitable for future studies to detect mutations in clinical samples.","['Xie, H', 'Hu, Z', 'Chyna, B', 'Horrigan, S K', 'Westbrook, C A']","['Xie H', 'Hu Z', 'Chyna B', 'Horrigan SK', 'Westbrook CA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, 60607-7170, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA9 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (mortalin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA Primers', 'Exons', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2128-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401935.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401935 [doi]'],,,"['P01-CA-75606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-72593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

PLD activity appears to be involved in several myeloid cell processes during their development and activation, including proliferation of myeloblasts in the bone marrow and secretion, phagocytosis and NADPH oxidase activation, essential functions of differentiated neutrophils. The present work studies PLD characteristics, activity and both isozyme expression during maturation and differentiation of myeloid cells by using three different systems: leukemic myeloblasts at different stages of maturation, terminally differentiated neutrophils ex vivo and four human myeloid cell lines, NB4, HL-60, PLB 985 and U937, induced to differentiate with alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA), a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analogue or both agents together. HL-60, a bipotential cell line has also been differentiated along the granulocytic pathway with DMSO and the monocytic pathway with 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3. In all these systems, PLD activity increases with maturation and differentiation whatever the inducer used and the granulocytic or monocytic pathways. Increase in basal activity which reflects the expression during development of both hPLD1 and hPLD2 appears to be mainly related to the former isozyme expression. Association of PLD characteristic changes with maturation and differentiation was also confirmed using two NB4 clones resistant to these processes. Comparison between PLD characteristics in myeloblasts during maturation and differentiation ex vivo and in vitro in the different cell lines demonstrated that NB4 induced to differentiate with ATRA represents the best model for further studies on the specific roles of each PLD isoform in various functions of differentiated myeloid cells.","['El Marjou, M', 'Montalescot, V', 'Buzyn, A', 'Geny, B']","['El Marjou M', 'Montalescot V', 'Buzyn A', 'Geny B']","['INSERM U332, Laboratoire de Signalisation, Inflammation et Transformation Cellulaire, ICGM, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2118-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401958.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401958 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Further evidence that the JAKs-centered signalling pathway is switched off early by HMBA was provided by the demonstration that STAT5, a downstream member of this pathway, turned out to be completely dephosphorylated at 6 h in HMBA-treated cells.

In the present study, FACS and biochemical analysis confirm the broad proB and preB reactivity of the 4G7 mAb that contrasts with the narrow specificity of other available anti-psiL reagents for preB cells.

At the time of follow-up, nine patients were in CHR, six remained stable in chronic phase, three presented an mcr and one remained in Mcr. At the last follow-up, 22 patients were alive. We conclude that the results of this strategy are encouraging in poor IFN-alpha responders but that other prospective studies that try to maintain the cytogenetic responses obtained immediately after transplantation are needed.","['Michallet, M', 'Thiebaut, A', 'Philip, I', 'Charrin, C', 'Vigouroux, C', 'Thomas, X', 'Bilger, K', 'Belhabri, A', 'Guyotat, D', 'Corront, B', 'Salles, B', 'Dumontet, C', 'Peaud, P Y', 'Vilque, J P', 'Devidas, A', 'Fiere, D']","['Michallet M', 'Thiebaut A', 'Philip I', 'Charrin C', 'Vigouroux C', 'Thomas X', 'Bilger K', 'Belhabri A', 'Guyotat D', 'Corront B', 'Salles B', 'Dumontet C', 'Peaud PY', 'Vilque JP', 'Devidas A', 'Fiere D']","[""Service d'Hematologie, H pital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2064-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401956.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401956 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of patients who achieve a second remission will ultimately relapse. In this retrospective single-center study, we have analyzed the outcome of patients with a second relapse and tried to define the prognostic factors in intensively treated patients. Of 534 patients with AML, 62 had a second relapse. Thirty-three received further intensive chemotherapy (CT). Eighteen patients (55%) achieved a third complete remission (CR). The early death (ED) rate was only 9%. The overall survival (OS) of treated vs untreated patients was 6.9 vs 1.3 months, respectively (P = 0.01). The major selection criteria for a third CT were a favourable (t(15;17),t(8;21),inv(16)) or normal karyotype, long (>11 months) second CR (P < or = 0.005) and no previous bone marrow transplantation (BMT)(P < 0.01). Favorable or normal karyotype, second CR >11 months, as well as no previous BMT (P < 0.01) were associated with the achievement of a third CR. Favorable (P < 0.005) or normal karyotype (P < 0.01), as well as a second CR >11 months (P < 0.005) were associated with prolonged survival after CT. The median OS for patients receiving CT with favorable or normal cytogenetics, a second CR > 11 months, but no previous BMT was 26.5 months. Five patients with favorable or normal karyotype achieved a fourth or fifth remission.

Most clinically relevant extra-hematological regimen-related toxicities consisted of stomatitis observed in all subjects and hemorrhagic cystitis occurred in five cases (17%) within 100 days after transplant. Six patients (21%) developed a grade 2 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and three (10%) a grade 3 or 4; extensive chronic GVHD was assessed in nine of 22 (41%) evaluable patients. So far, 12 patients have died and 17 are alive, 16 of whom disease-free, 5-41 months after transplant (median, 15 months). The causes of death were related to GVHD in three patients, to sepsis in one and to disease recurrence in the remaining eight. At present, only one of nine relapsed patients is alive. For all patients the actuarial probability of survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years +/- standard error (s.e.) was 63 +/- 9% and 52 +/- 10%, respectively. The actuarial probabilities of disease-free survival (DFS), relapse and transplant-related mortality (TRM) at both 1 and 2 years +/- s.e. were 53 +/- 9%, 35 +/- 9% and 16 +/- 7%, respectively.

It has been suggested that excessive apoptosis is the cause of marrow failure in MDS. We studied the expression of caspase-1 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme, ICE) and caspase-3 (CPP32/apopain) in marrow mononuclear cells, and the growth pattern of committed progenitors in a series of 83 MDS cases. The percentage of apoptotic cells as detected by TUNEL technique, and the percentage of caspase-3-positive cells were significantly higher in refractory anemia (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RAS) than in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T). Spontaneous growth of CFU-GM was associated with a higher percentage of blasts, and with a lower expression of caspase-3 and caspase-1. The yield of CFU-E, BFU-E, and CFU-GM (in the presence of growth factors) was decreased by comparison to normal marrow, but large individual differences were observed in all cytological categories. Inhibition of caspase-1 and caspase-3 activities by specific inhibitors resulted in a significant increase of the production of all types of colonies (up to 50-fold of control). In the presence of caspase-3 inhibitor, the number of BFU-E and CFU-E was in the range of normal values in most cases of RA and RAS. In addition, caspase-1 and -3 protease activities were detectable by fluorogenic assay in all cases studied. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of caspase-3, including the cleaved (activated)-p17 form in most cases of RA/RAS analyzed. It is concluded that caspase-3 is implicated in the increased apoptosis observed in MDS and that inhibition of its activity can restore at least partially the growth of committed progenitors.","['Boudard, D', 'Sordet, O', 'Vasselon, C', 'Revol, V', 'Bertheas, M F', 'Freyssenet, D', 'Viallet, A', 'Piselli, S', 'Guyotat, D', 'Campos, L']","['Boudard D', 'Sordet O', 'Vasselon C', 'Revol V', 'Bertheas MF', 'Freyssenet D', 'Viallet A', 'Piselli S', 'Guyotat D', 'Campos L']","['Equipe Mort Cellulaire et Neoplasie, Faculte de Medicine, Saint-Etienne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 1/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2045-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401959.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401959 [doi]'],,,,['Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2017-8.

Recent discoveries have significantly advanced the understanding of biochemical and genetic requirements of distinct apoptosis pathways (ie mitochondrial, death-receptor and endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis) and their dysregulation in disease. Progress has been made especially in the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of the Bcl-2 family members, in detail the formation of channels and their regulation in the mitochondrial membranes, conformational changes in Bax and Bak, and crosstalk of death receptor-triggered apoptosis to the mitochondria by activation of Bax via Bid. In addition, novel insights have been gained about the regulation of caspases and novel caspase signaling pathways, such as activation of caspase-12 by the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Therapeutic applications of apoptosis manipulation include (1) the inhibition of caspases in acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, ie stroke, Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease by drugs and (2) sensitization of cancer cells for drug/radiation-induced apoptosis by modulation of survival signals and viral transfer of apoptosis promoting genes.","['Daniel, P T']",['Daniel PT'],"['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite, Humboldt University Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Signal Transduction']",50,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Dec;14(12):2035-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401940.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401940 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The signals received by the receptors on hematopoietic cells often determine if the cell proliferates, survives or undergoes apoptosis. Apoptosis can be induced by almost any cytotoxic stimuli. These stimuli may be an absence of signals arising from cellular receptors, stimulation of specific ligand receptors on the cell surface, chemotherapeutic agents, and ionizing radiation or oxygen radicals, as well as a number of other factors. Cellular kinases and phosphatases participate in signaling cascades that influence this process. We review the ability of the calmodulin-dependent-kinases, I-kappaB kinases, PI3-kinases, Jakkinases, PKC, PKA, and MAP kinase signaling pathways (Erk, Jnk, and p38), to influence the apoptotic process.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have been implicated in glucocorticoid resistance. In order to assess a potential association of phenotypically relevant GST polymorphisms with prednisone response in childhood ALL, we conducted a case-control study of 45 prednisone poor-responders (cases) and 90 prednisone good-responders (controls) who were frequency matched according to initial white blood cell count. In addition, we analysed the association of GST genotypes with relapse of leukaemia. In univariate analysis, homozygous deletion of GSTT1 (null genotype) conferred a 6.7-fold reduction in risk of prednisone poor-response compared to individuals who were either heterozygous or homozygous for GSTT1 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, P = 0.071; multivariate odds ratio = 0.18, P = 0.117]. GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotypes did not show any association with prednisone response. In addition, risk of relapse was predicted strongest by the GSTT1 genotype. In univariate analysis, the GSTT1 null genotype conferred a 5.9-fold reduction in risk of relapse compared to the heterozygous or homozygous presence of GSTT1 (OR = 0.17, P = 0.095; multivariate OR = 0.23; P = 0.173). No associations of the GSTM1 genotype with risk of relapse were observed. GSTP1 codon 105 and codon 114 polymorphisms were predominantely associated with central nervous system relapse. Our results add further support to the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms within specific GST genes might be of clinical importance in childhood ALL.","['Anderer, G', 'Schrappe, M', 'Brechlin, A M', 'Lauten, M', 'Muti, P', 'Welte, K', 'Stanulla, M']","['Anderer G', 'Schrappe M', 'Brechlin AM', 'Lauten M', 'Muti P', 'Welte K', 'Stanulla M']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pharmacogenetics,Pharmacogenetics,9211735,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenetics. 2000 Nov;10(8):715-26. doi: 10.1097/00008571-200011000-00006.,,['10.1097/00008571-200011000-00006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore this issue, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization for cells sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from 12 patients with chronic-phase CML. Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) was found in pluripotent stem cells (CD34+Thy-1+), B cells (CD34+CD19+), and T/natural killer (NK) progenitor cells (CD34+CD7+) collected by FACS from bone marrow cells. B (CD19+), T (CD3+), and NK (CD3-CD56+) cells showed a marked decrease in Ph+ cells between progenitor cells and mature cells The Ph+ T and NK cells decreased to below background levels. These data suggest that Ph+ lymphocytes either do not differentiate or are eliminated during their maturation process Among 7 MDS patients associated with trisomy 8, sorted lymphocytes from peripheral blood did not have +8. CD34+ subpopulations from bone marrow including B,T/NK progenitors, and pluripotent progenitor cells also did not have +8. Trisomy 8 was identified from the level of multipotent colony-forming units (CD34+CD33+), and the lymphoid lineage was not involved. Thus, MDS with trisomy 8 conceivably arises from nonlymphoid progenitor cells, sparing T, B, or NK cells.

P-gp is coded for by the MDR1 gene, which in the human genome is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q21-31). At the cellular level, the function of P-gp has been extensively investigated in human cancer. Although innumerable reports have been published in which P-gp has been shown to confer MDR to malignant (including leukemia) cells, so far, large-scale studies in the clinical setting have not convincingly proven that MDR1 plays a major role in clinical drug resistance when the influence of other known prognostic factors in human leukemia are taken into account. At present, results from phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficiency of inhibiting (or reversing) the function of P-gp in hematologic malignancies are eagerly awaited. Moreover, the horizon of cellular drug resistance in human cancer has during recent years widened dramatically. Thus, an array of different molecules and mechanisms by which resistant cells can escape the cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs has now been identified. These molecules and mechanisms include apoptosis-related proteins. In this article, we review the different methods for determining MDR and, in particular, methods for determining P-gp/MDR1, with special reference to their potential importance for therapeutic strategies in human acute leukemia.","['Norgaard, J M', 'Hokland, P']","['Norgaard JM', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. janmaxgaard@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics']",93,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2000 Oct;72(3):290-7.,,,,,,,,['Int J Hematol 2001 Jan;73(1):132'],,,,,,

An analysis of 14 recently published multicenter trials, however, revealed the highest probabilities of relapse-free survival (RFS), in the range of 35% to 42% at 4 to 5 years, only in patients assigned to maintenance treatment as far as adult age and intent-to-treat conditions were considered. After having demonstrated a superior RFS rate from 3 years of maintenance after standard-dose consolidation compared with that from consolidation alone (P = .00004), the German AMLCG requestioned the effect of maintenance randomly compared with sequential high-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and mitoxantrone in patients who received intensified induction treatment. The results show an advantage for maintenance treatment (RFS rate of 32%) versus the sequential Ara-C and mitoxantrone treatment (RFS rate of 25%) (P = .021). We conclude that maintenance treatment continues to substantially contribute to the management of adult patients with AML, even as part of recent strategies using intensified induction treatment, and thus appears necessary in these settings.","['Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Wormann, B', 'Loffler, H', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Schoch, C', 'Haferlach, T', 'Maschmeyer, G', 'Staib, P', 'Aul, C', 'Heyll, G A', 'Gruneisen, A', 'Rasche, H', 'Eimermacher, J H', 'Balleisen, L', 'Pielken, H J', 'Reis, H E', 'Griesinger, F', 'Reichle, A', 'Sauerland, M C', 'Heinecke, A']","['Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Wormann B', 'Loffler H', 'Ludwig WD', 'Schoch C', 'Haferlach T', 'Maschmeyer G', 'Staib P', 'Aul C', 'Heyll GA', 'Gruneisen A', 'Rasche H', 'Eimermacher JH', 'Balleisen L', 'Pielken HJ', 'Reis HE', 'Griesinger F', 'Reichle A', 'Sauerland MC', 'Heinecke A']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster, Germany. buechnr@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Remission Induction']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2000 Oct;72(3):285-9.,,,,,,,['German AMLCG'],,,,,,,

Prevention of relapse is now the central therapeutic issue. A number of factors predict the risk of relapse, the most powerful of which is cytogenetics. Both allogeneic and autologous transplantation have been extensively used as remission consolidation, but intensive chemotherapy has also provided improved results such that the choice of consolidation treatment is not clear. Recent prospective trials of allogeneic and autologous transplantation with careful analysis have not always shown a survival benefit, although both approaches have significantly reduced relapse risk. In analysis where relapse risk is taken into account based on cytogenetics, there is little evidence of the benefit of transplantation in good-risk patients, partly because patients in this group who relapse can then undergo successful salvage therapy. The results are still uncertain in standard-risk patients, so transplantation should continue to be used in the context of a trial. Poor-risk patients have a higher failure rate after transplantation, and for these patients novel approaches are required.","['Burnett, A K', 'Kell, J', 'Rowntree, C']","['Burnett AK', 'Kell J', 'Rowntree C']","['Department of Hematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff Wales, United Kingdom. edwardssa1@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",37,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2000 Oct;72(3):280-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 237 individuals initially suspected to have been significantly exposed to radiation during or in the immediate aftermath of the accident, the diagnosis of acute radiation sickness (ARS) could be confirmed in 134 cases on the basis of clinical symptoms. Of these, 54 patients suffered from cutaneous radiation syndrome (CRS) to varying degrees. Among the 28 patients who died from the immediate consequences of accidental radiation exposure, acute hemopoietic syndrome due to bone marrow failure was the primary cause of death only in a minority. In 16 of these 28 deaths, the primary cause was attributed to CRS. This report describes the characteristic cutaneous sequelae as well as associated clinical symptoms and diseases of 15 survivors of the Chernobyl accident with severe localized exposure who were systematically followed up by our groups between 1991 and 2000. All patients presented with CRS of varying severity, showing xerosis, cutaneous telangiectasias and subungual splinter hemorrhages, hemangiomas and lymphangiomas, epidermal atrophy, disseminated keratoses, extensive dermal and subcutaneous fibrosis with partial ulcerations, and pigmentary changes including radiation lentigo. Surprisingly, no cutaneous malignancies have been detected so far in those areas that received large radiation exposures and that developed keratoses; however, two patients first presented in 1999 with basal cell carcinomas on the nape of the neck and the right lower eyelid, areas that received lower exposures. During the follow-up period, two patients were lost due to death from myelodysplastic syndrome in 1995 and acute myelogenous leukemia in 1998, respectively.

By using human U937 leukemia cells, we previously demonstrated that H(2)O(2) can induce such an adaptive response without elevating the cellular capacity to degrade H(2)O(2), and were able to confer the cells a cross-resistance to an H(2)O(2)-independent lethal stimulus, C(2)-ceramide. In this study, it was found that the adaptation is accompanied by the translocation of cytoplasmic NF-kappa B to the nuclei. This event was promoted or abolished when either IKK alpha or a dominant negative mutant of I kappa B, respectively, was overexpressed. The overexpression of IKK alpha also resulted in the suppression of H(2)O(2)-induced cell death and DNA fragmentation, whereas these events were accelerated by the expression of the I kappa B mutant. The protective effect of IKK alpha was accompanied neither by an elevation of protein levels of various antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, nor by an increase in the cellular capacity to consume H(2)O(2). Moreover, the overexpression of IKK alpha resulted in an enhancement of H(2)O(2)-induced resistance to C(2)-ceramide.

In antigen presenting cells (APC), TNFalpha increased antigen presentation, notably by up-regulation of HLA class II expression. In addition to their role in antigen presentation, HLA-DR molecules transduce intracellular signals which lead to cytokine up-regulation or cell death. We have previously observed that the susceptibility of APC to HLA-DR mediated apoptosis increase throughout their maturation. We therefore investigated the relationship between TNFalpha production and susceptibility to HLA-DR-mediated apoptosis of different APC. The hematopoietic progenitor cell line (KG1), monocytic cell line (THP-1), monocyte-derived dendritic cell (DC), and B-lymphoid cell line (Raji) have been studied. We report that apoptosis susceptibility and spontaneous TNFalpha release are correlated in these different cells. However, while autocrine TNFalpha production was critical for DC maturation, upregulation of TNFalpha release after HLA-DR crosslinking was not observed and neutralization of endogenous TNFalpha did not modify HLA-DR-mediated apoptosis. These data reveal that HLA-DR mediated apoptosis susceptibility and spontaneous TNFalpha release are regulated in a parallel manner and that while TNFalpha may induce maturation of APC to an ""apoptosis sensitive"" stage, there is no direct role for TNFalpha in HLA-DR-mediated apoptosis of APC.","['Bertho, N', 'Laupeze, B', 'Mooney, N', 'Le Berre, C', 'Charron, D', 'Drenou, B', 'Fauchet, R']","['Bertho N', 'Laupeze B', 'Mooney N', 'Le Berre C', 'Charron D', 'Drenou B', 'Fauchet R']","[""Laboratoire Universitaire d'Hematologie et de Biologie des Cellules Sanguines, INSERM CRI 4U006B, Rennes, France. nbertho@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",,2001/02/22 11:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/02/22 11:00'],"['2001/02/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/22 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 2001 Feb;62(2):106-12. doi: 10.1016/s0198-8859(00)00240-8.,,"['S0198-8859(00)00240-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0198-8859(00)00240-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

These include induction chemotherapy, concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and intensified radiation therapy schedules. To date, induction chemotherapy has been validated in randomized prospective trials versus radiotherapy alone. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy has led to promising results when combination chemotherapy regimens were used in the phase II setting. In addition, concomitant chemoradiotherapy has been shown to be superior to induction chemotherapy in direct comparison. Finally, accelerated radiotherapy has been shown to lead to improved locoregional control and survival in one randomized study. Based on these observations, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB study 9431) investigated the addition of either vinorelbine, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine to cisplatin. In this trial, patients with locally advanced and inoperable non-small cell lung cancer received two cycles of induction chemotherapy with an additional two cycles of concomitant chemoradiotherapy utilizing the same agents accompanied by standard radiation to a total dose of 66 Gy. One hundred eighty-seven patients were entered on this study. An early analysis showed the median survival time was 17 months for all patients entered on the trial.

Thiotepa produces ring-opened bases such as formamidopyrimidine and 7-methyl-formamidopyrimidine, which can be recognized and repaired by the formamidopyrimidine glycosylase/AP lyase (Fpg) enzyme of Escherichia coli. Using this background information, we have created constructs using the E. coli fpg gene along with the functional equivalent human ortholog alpha-hOgg1. Although protection with the Fpg protein has been previously observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, we demonstrate significant (100-fold) protection against thiotepa using the E. coli Fpg or the human alpha-hOgg1 cDNA in NIH3T3 cells. We have also observed a 10-fold protection by both the Fpg and alpha-hOgg1 transgenes against 1,3-N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea (BCNU) and, to a lesser extent, mafosfamide (2-fold), an active form of the clinical agent cyclophosphamide.

PMLRARalpha transgenic mice develop leukemia only after several months, suggesting that PMLRARalpha does not by itself confer a fully malignant phenotype. Suppression of apoptosis can have a central role in tumorigenesis; therefore, we assessed whether BCL-2 influenced the ability of PMLRARalpha to initiate leukemia. Evaluation of preleukemic animals showed that whereas PMLRARalpha alone modestly altered neutrophil maturation, the combination of PMLRARalpha and BCL-2 caused a marked accumulation of immature myeloid cells in bone marrow. Leukemias developed more rapidly in mice coexpressing PMLRARalpha and BCL-2 than in mice expressing PMLRARalpha alone, and all mice expressing both transgenes succumbed to leukemia by 7 mo. Although both preleukemic, doubly transgenic mice and leukemic animals had abundant promyelocytes in the bone marrow, only leukemic mice exhibited thrombocytopenia and dissemination of immature cells. Recurrent gain of chromosomes 7, 8, 10, and 15 and recurrent loss of chromosome 2 were identified in the leukemias. These chromosomal changes may be responsible for the suppression of normal hematopoiesis and dissemination characteristic of the acute leukemias.

The PMLRARalpha oncoprotein is thought to antagonize the function of PML through its ability to heterodimerize with and delocalize PML from the nuclear body. In APL, this may be facilitated by the reduction to heterozygosity of the normal PML allele. To determine whether PML acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo and what the consequences of deregulated programmed cell death in leukemia and epithelial cancer pathogenesis are, we crossed PML(-/-) mice with human cathepsin G (hCG)-PMLRARalpha or mammary tumor virus (MMTV)/neu transgenic mice (TM), models of leukemia and breast cancer, respectively. The progressive reduction of the dose of PML resulted in a dramatic increase in the incidence of leukemia, and in an acceleration of leukemia onset in PMLRARalpha TM. By contrast, PML inactivation did not affect neu-induced tumorigenesis. In hemopoietic cells from PMLRARalpha TM, PML inactivation resulted in impaired response to differentiating agents such as RA and vitamin D3 as well as in a marked survival advantage upon proapoptotic stimuli. These results demonstrate that: (a) PML acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor by rendering the cells resistant to proapoptotic and differentiating stimuli; (b) PML haploinsufficiency and the functional impairment of PML by PMLRARalpha are critical events in APL pathogenesis; and (c) aberrant control of programmed cell death plays a differential role in solid tumor and leukemia pathogenesis.","['Rego, E M', 'Wang, Z G', 'Peruzzi, D', 'He, L Z', 'Cordon-Cardo, C', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Rego EM', 'Wang ZG', 'Peruzzi D', 'He LZ', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/etiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2001/02/22 11:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/02/22 11:00'],"['2001/02/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/22 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2001 Feb 19;193(4):521-29. doi: 10.1084/jem.193.4.521.,,['10.1084/jem.193.4.521 [doi]'],PMC2195907,,"['CA74031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['J Exp Med. 2001 Feb 19;193(4):F15-8.

Because different TCD methodologies differ in the degree and specificity with which T cells are removed, it is likely that transplant outcomes would depend on which technique is used. Herein, we report results in the first 48 recipients of unrelated marrow using CD6+ TCD as the sole form of GVHD prophylaxis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Median age of patients was 46 years (20 to 58 years). Donors were matched at A/B HLA loci. Ablation consisted of cyclophosphamide and fractionated total-body irradiation (TBI; 14 Gy). To facilitate engraftment, patients also received 7.5 Gy (22 patients) [corrected] or 4.5 Gy (26 patients) [corrected] of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) before admission. No additional immune suppressive prophylaxis was administered. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered daily from day +1 to engraftment. RESULTS: All 48 patients demonstrated neutrophil engraftment. An absolute neutrophil count of 500 x 10(6)/L was achieved at a median of 12 days (range, 9 to 23 days). There were no cases of late graft failure. The number of CD34+ cells infused/kg was associated with speed of platelet and neutrophil recovery. The dose of TLI did not influence engraftment. Grades 2-4 acute GVHD occurred in 42% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.57). Mortality at day 100 was 19%. There have been only five relapses. Estimated 2-year survival was 44% (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.59) for the entire group, 58% for patients less than 50 years of age. In multivariable analysis, age less than 50 years (P =.002), cytomegalovirus seronegative status (P =.04), and early disease status at bone marrow transplant (P =.05) were associated with superior survival. CONCLUSION: CD6+ TCD does not impede engraftment of unrelated bone marrow after low-dose TLI, cyclophosphamide, and TBI. CD6+ TCD as the sole form of GVHD prophylaxis results in an incidence of GVHD that compares favorably with many adult studies of unrelated transplantation using unmanipulated marrow and immune-suppressive medications, especially in light of the median age of our patients (46 years). Although event-free survival in patients less than 50 years of age is very encouraging, older patients experience frequent transplantation-related complications despite TCD.","['Soiffer, R J', 'Weller, E', 'Alyea, E P', 'Mauch, P', 'Webb, I L', 'Fisher, D C', 'Freedman, A S', 'Schlossman, R L', 'Gribben, J', 'Lee, S', 'Anderson, K C', 'Marcus, K', 'Stone, R M', 'Antin, J H', 'Ritz, J']","['Soiffer RJ', 'Weller E', 'Alyea EP', 'Mauch P', 'Webb IL', 'Fisher DC', 'Freedman AS', 'Schlossman RL', 'Gribben J', 'Lee S', 'Anderson KC', 'Marcus K', 'Stone RM', 'Antin JH', 'Ritz J']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. robert_soiffer@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD6 antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2001/02/22 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/22 11:00'],"['2001/02/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/22 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Feb 15;19(4):1152-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.4.1152.,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.4.1152 [doi]'],,,['AI 29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,['J Clin Oncol 2001 May 1;19(9):2583'],,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred sixty-nine patients, ages 1 to 18 years with ALL, were randomly assigned to receive one of four different doses of corticosteroid (prednisolone 40 mg/m(2)/d or dexamethasone 6, 18, or 150 mg/m(2)/d) administered as a 3-day, single-drug window before initiation of standard, multidrug induction chemotherapy. Corticosteroid drug response was measured by reduction in bone marrow blast counts and absolute peripheral blast counts after 3 days. Glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) number and the effective concentration of dexamethasone resulting in a 50% reduction of leukemic cell viability in vitro (EC-50) were evaluated at days 0 and 3. RESULTS: Increasing dexamethasone doses resulted in greater marrow blast response (P =.007), with a similar trend in peripheral-blood blast response. High-dose corticosteroid regimens (dexamethasone 18 or 150 mg/m(2)/d) elicited better responses than standard doses of dexamethasone or prednisone (bone marrow, P =.002; peripheral blasts, P =.05). Among patients treated with standard-dose corticosteroids, 38% with resistant (EC-50 > 10(-7)) peripheral blasts had a good response compared with 92% with sensitive (EC-50 < 10(-7)) peripheral blasts (P =.01). In contrast, there was no differential response according to EC-50 group after high-dose corticosteroids. Similarly, an association between response and GCR on peripheral-blood blasts was noted after standard-dose corticosteroid regimens but not after high-dose corticosteroid regimens. CONCLUSION: Response of ALL to glucocorticoid therapy increased with dose. Higher-dose corticosteroid treatment abrogated the effect of relative drug insensitivity and of low GCR on peripheral blasts.","['Schwartz, C L', 'Thompson, E B', 'Gelber, R D', 'Young, M L', 'Chilton, D', 'Cohen, H J', 'Sallan, S E']","['Schwartz CL', 'Thompson EB', 'Gelber RD', 'Young ML', 'Chilton D', 'Cohen HJ', 'Sallan SE']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/02/22 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/22 11:00'],"['2001/02/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/22 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Feb 15;19(4):1040-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.4.1040.,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.4.1040 [doi]'],,,"['CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The most common genetic cause of hyperhomocysteinemia is the 677C-->T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. This variant, with mild enzymatic deficiency, is associated with an increased risk for neural tube defects and pregnancy complications and with a decreased risk for colon cancer and leukemia. Although many studies have reported that this variant is also a risk factor for vascular disease, this area of investigation is still controversial. Severe MTHFR deficiency results in homocystinuria, an inborn error of metabolism with neurological and vascular complications. To investigate the in vivo pathogenetic mechanisms of MTHFR deficiency, we generated mice with a knockout of MTHFR: Plasma total homocysteine levels in heterozygous and homozygous knockout mice are 1.6- and 10-fold higher than those in wild-type littermates, respectively. Both heterozygous and homozygous knockouts have either significantly decreased S-adenosylmethionine levels or significantly increased S-adenosylhomocysteine levels, or both, with global DNA hypomethylation. The heterozygous knockout mice appear normal, whereas the homozygotes are smaller and show developmental retardation with cerebellar pathology. Abnormal lipid deposition in the proximal portion of the aorta was observed in older heterozygotes and homozygotes, alluding to an atherogenic effect of hyperhomocysteinemia in these mice.","['Chen, Z', 'Karaplis, A C', 'Ackerman, S L', 'Pogribny, I P', 'Melnyk, S', 'Lussier-Cacan, S', 'Chen, M F', 'Pai, A', 'John, S W', 'Smith, R S', 'Bottiglieri, T', 'Bagley, P', 'Selhub, J', 'Rudnicki, M A', 'James, S J', 'Rozen, R']","['Chen Z', 'Karaplis AC', 'Ackerman SL', 'Pogribny IP', 'Melnyk S', 'Lussier-Cacan S', 'Chen MF', 'Pai A', 'John SW', 'Smith RS', 'Bottiglieri T', 'Bagley P', 'Selhub J', 'Rudnicki MA', 'James SJ', 'Rozen R']","['Departments of Biology, Human Genetics and Pediatrics, Department of Medicine, Department of Pathology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1B1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Hyperhomocysteinemia/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nervous System/*pathology', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2001/02/22 11:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/02/22 11:00'],"['2001/02/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/22 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2001 Mar 1;10(5):433-43. doi: 10.1093/hmg/10.5.433.,,['10.1093/hmg/10.5.433 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sertoli cells are targets of retinoid action in the testis. We have found that FSH, (Bu)(2)cAMP, and leukemia inhibitory factor elicit substantial changes in the metabolism of [(3)H]retinol (vitamin A) in primary cultures of purified rat Sertoli cells. Addition of (Bu)(2)cAMP for 2 h or FSH for 6 h results in a 3-fold increase in the metabolism of [(3)H]retinol to [(3)H]retinoic acid ([(3)H]RA); the esterification of [(3)H]retinol to [(3)H]retinyl esters, especially [(3)H]retinyl palmitate, is also increased by approximately 5-fold. The addition of 1 microM all-trans-RA also elicits changes in [(3)H]retinol metabolism, but in this case the metabolism of [(3)H]retinol to [(3)H]RA is inhibited, whereas the metabolism of [(3)H]retinol to [(3)H]retinyl esters is increased by over 50-fold. Leukemia inhibitory factor increases the esterification of [(3)H]retinol by 2- to 3-fold. FSH leads to a reduction in the level of cellular retinol binding protein I transcripts, whereas RA increases the cellular retinol binding protein I messenger RNA level by about 2-fold at approximately 24 h. Levels of AHD-2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase-2) and RALDH-2 (retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2) messenger RNAs, which encode enzymes that convert [(3)H]retinaldehyde to [(3)H]RA, are increased by about 2-fold by FSH, whereas no change in CYP26 (RA hydroxylase) expression is seen. Our results suggest that one function of FSH (and/or (Bu)(2)cAMP) in Sertoli cells is to increase the metabolism of retinol to the biologically active metabolite RA and to retinyl esters.","['Guo, X', 'Morris, P', 'Gudas, L']","['Guo X', 'Morris P', 'Gudas L']","['Department of Pharmacology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Retinyl Esters)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '1D1K0N0VVC (retinol palmitate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '60A625P70P (Diazomethane)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives', 'Diazomethane/pharmacology', 'Diterpenes', 'Esterification/drug effects', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Retinyl Esters', 'Sertoli Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Vitamin A/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism']",,2001/02/22 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/22 11:00'],"['2001/02/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/22 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2001 Mar;142(3):1024-32. doi: 10.1210/endo.142.3.7996.,,['10.1210/endo.142.3.7996 [doi]'],,,"['R01 HD029428/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-43796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HD-29428/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54-HD-13541/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Wide interindividual variation in busulfan kinetics and rapid clearance of the drug have been reported, especially in children. Some of the factors contributing to interpatient variability have been identified. They include circadian rhythms, age, disease, drug interaction, changes in hepatic function, and busulfan bioavailability. In this study, we demonstrate that hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity correlates negatively with busulfan maximum and minimum concentrations (Pearson's correlation r = -0.74 and -0.77, respectively) and positively with busulfan clearance (Pearson's correlation r = 0.728) in children with thalassemia major in the age range of 2 to 15 years. We also found that plasma alpha GST levels were 5 to 10 times higher in patients with thalassemia than in normal controls and age-matched leukemic patients, either reflecting extensive liver damage, elevated expression of the enzyme, or both in thalassemic patients. Plasma alpha GST concentrations showed a similar correlation with busulfan kinetic parameters to that observed for hepatic GST. The status of hepatic GST activity accounts, at least in part, for the observed interindividual variation in busulfan kinetics, while the observed association with plasma alpha GST is difficult to explain at present.","['Poonkuzhali, B', 'Chandy, M', 'Srivastava, A', 'Dennison, D', 'Krishnamoorthy, R']","['Poonkuzhali B', 'Chandy M', 'Srivastava A', 'Dennison D', 'Krishnamoorthy R']","['Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore-632 994, Tamil Nadu, South India.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase alpha)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/blood/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/blood/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood/enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'beta-Thalassemia/enzymology/*metabolism/*therapy']",,2001/02/22 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/22 11:00'],"['2001/02/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/22 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2001 Mar;29(3):264-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred seventy-nine patients who had Stage II breast cancer (median age, 56 yrs; 68% disease free), treated a mean of 6.8 years since entry to Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 8541, were interviewed by telephone concerning their psychosocial adjustment. The following measures were used: Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS), Life Experience Survey (LES) a measure of stressful life events within the past 12 months, European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) a measure of quality of life, Mental Health Inventory (MHI), and the Systems of Belief Inventory (SBI) a measure of spiritual and religious involvement. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that less than excellent levels of social support (P < 0.01), greater negative impact of LES fateful life events (e.g., death of family member) (P < 0.05), personal illness or injury (P < 0.05), and all other negative life events in the past year (< 4; P < 0.01) were significant predictors of greater MHI psychological distress, in addition to being divorced or separated (P < 0.001), and more recently treated for cancer on CALGB 8541 (P < 0.05). The interaction of LES scores with MOS-SSS or SBI social support, used to test the buffering hypothesis, did not significantly improve the prediction of MHI psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the additive model, with both stressful life events and social support independently and significantly affecting patients' emotional state. However, the level of social support needed to be very high to reduce the likelihood of severe psychological distress.","['Kornblith, A B', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Zuckerman, E', 'Viscoli, C M', 'Horwitz, R I', 'Cooper, M R', 'Harris, L', 'Tkaczuk, K H', 'Perry, M C', 'Budman, D', 'Norton, L C', 'Holland, J']","['Kornblith AB', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Zuckerman E', 'Viscoli CM', 'Horwitz RI', 'Cooper MR', 'Harris L', 'Tkaczuk KH', 'Perry MC', 'Budman D', 'Norton LC', 'Holland J']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Life Change Events', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Regression Analysis', '*Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/*prevention & control']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Jan 15;91(2):443-54. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010115)91:2<443::aid-cncr1020>3.0.co;2-z.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20010115)91:2<443::AID-CNCR1020>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010115)91:2<443::aid-cncr1020>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",,,"['CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,,,,

In the current study, the authors investigated the role of p53 mutations and chromosomal abnormalities in 30 patients with CLL. METHODS: Thirty patients were screened for p53 mutations. Half of the group had aggressive disease characterized by leucocytosis, lymph node enlargement, organomegaly, and shortened tumor doubling time. Because 95% of p53 mutations reside in ""hot-spot"" regions of exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, the authors sequenced these exons completely for mutation detection. RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified p53 mutations in 14 of 30 patients that were distributed equally among patients with aggressive disease and nonaggressive disease. There were six mutations in exon 7, five mutations in exon 5, and one mutation each in exons 6 and 8. Five of 15 patients with clinically aggressive disease had mutations in exon 7. Only one patient with nonaggressive disease had an exon 7 mutation. Abnormal cytogenetics were present in 22 of 30 patients (73%). Most patients with the p53 mutation (13 of 14 patients; 93%) displayed abnormal cytogenetics. Twelve of 15 patients with aggressive disease and 9 of 15 patients with average disease exhibited abnormal karyotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of p53 mutations did not predict clinical behavior or disease outcome, although the frequency of mutations appears to be higher than reported previously. In this study, mutations of exon 7 (5 of 6 patients) occurred in patients with clinically aggressive disease. The significance of this observation warrants further examination.","['Barnabas, N', 'Shurafa, M', 'Van Dyke, D L', 'Wolman, S R', 'Clark, D', 'Worsham, M J']","['Barnabas N', 'Shurafa M', 'Van Dyke DL', 'Wolman SR', 'Clark D', 'Worsham MJ']","['Department of Pathology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Exons/genetics', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Jan 15;91(2):285-93. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010115)91:2<285::aid-cncr1000>3.0.co;2-x.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20010115)91:2<285::AID-CNCR1000>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010115)91:2<285::aid-cncr1000>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",,,['R01 CA70923/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Studies of enzyme activity in red blood cells have shown that TPMT expression displays genetic polymorphism with 11% of individuals having intermediate and one in 300 undetectable levels. Patients with biallelic mutations and undetectable enzyme activity suffer life-threatening myelosuppression when treated with conventional doses of these drugs. Patients with intermediate activity have an increased risk of drug-associated toxicity. In the Caucasian populations studied to date, intermediate activity is associated with mutations at two sites of the TPMT gene, G460A and A719G (designated TPMT*3A), in 80% of cases. Detection of these mutations has, to date, been based on the analysis of restriction digests of PCR products. In order to simplify this process we have investigated the ability of denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to detect the A719G mutation. DHPLC of PCR products from 15 known heterozygotes (TPMT*3A/TPMT*1) and 18 known homozygotes (TPMT*1/TPMT*1) gave a clear pattern difference between the groups and 100% concordance with the results of restriction digests.

Mutations of the group A gene (FancA) are most common. A multitude of polymorphisms and mutations within the 43 exons of the gene are described. To examine the role of heterozygosity as a risk factor for malignancies, a partially automatized screening method to identify aberrations was needed. We report on our experience with DHPLC (WAVE (Transgenomic)). METHODS: PCR amplification of all 43 exons from one individual was performed on one microtiter plate on a gradient thermocycler. DHPLC analysis conditions were established via melting curves, prediction software, and test runs with aberrant samples. PCR products were analyzed twice: native, and after adding a WT-PCR product. Retention patterns were compared with previously identified polymorphic PCR products or mutants. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We have defined the mutation screening conditions for all 43 exons of FancA using DHPLC. So far, 40 different sequence variations have been detected in more than 100 individuals. The native analysis identifies heterozygous individuals, and the second run detects homozygous aberrations. Retention patterns are specific for the underlying sequence aberration, thus reducing sequencing demand and costs. DHPLC is a valuable tool for reproducible recognition of known sequence aberrations and screening for unknown mutations in the highly polymorphic FancA gene.","['Rischewski, J', 'Schneppenheim, R']","['Rischewski J', 'Schneppenheim R']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Childrens Hospital, Martinistr. 52, D-20246, Hamburg, Germany. rischewski@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Biochem Biophys Methods,Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods,7907378,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Exons', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/etiology/genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Factors']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biochem Biophys Methods. 2001 Jan 30;47(1-2):53-64. doi: 10.1016/s0165-022x(00)00151-2.,,"['S0165022X00001512 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-022x(00)00151-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, aggressive cancer cell lines are often either insensitive to the antiproliferative effects of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) or require toxic concentrations to recapitulate them which has, to-date, precluded its use in anticancer therapy. Therefore we are interested in mechanisms by which 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) signaling has become deregulated in malignant cells in order to identify novel therapeutic targets. We observed previously that 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and its metabolites, generated via the C-24 oxidation pathway, drive simultaneous differentiation and hyper-proliferation within the same cell population. Thus we have proposed that metabolism of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) via the C-24 oxidation pathway represents a novel-signaling pathway, which integrates proliferation with differentiation. In the current study we examined further the role of this pathway and demonstrated that these effects are not restricted to leukemic cells but are observed also in both normal myeloid progenitors and breast cancer cell lines. Intriguingly, stable transfection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with antisense vitamin D(3) receptor (VDR) reduced antiproliferative sensitivity to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) but significantly enhanced growth stimulation, which, in turn, was blocked by inhibiting metabolism of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) via C-24 oxidation pathway with ketoconazole. Taken together, these studies indicate that metabolism of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) via C-24 oxidation pathway gives rise to ligands with different biologic effects. We propose that this mechanism may allow the co-ordination of population expansion and cell maturation during differentiation. Cancer cells appear to corrupt this process during malignant transformation, by only responding to the pro-proliferative signals, thereby deriving a clonal advantage.","['Rashid, S F', 'Mountford, J C', 'Gombart, A F', 'Campbell, M J']","['Rashid SF', 'Mountford JC', 'Gombart AF', 'Campbell MJ']","['Division of Immunity & Infection, University of Birmingham Medical School, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, B15 2TT, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Steroids,Steroids,0404536,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Calcitriol/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Steroids. 2001 Mar-May;66(3-5):433-40. doi: 10.1016/s0039-128x(00)00203-8.,,"['S0039-128X(00)00203-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0039-128x(00)00203-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, the metabolic pathways of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and the biologic activity of its various natural intermediary metabolites in HL-60 cells are not fully understood. 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) is metabolized in its target tissues via modifications of both the side chain and the A-ring. The C-24 oxidation pathway, the main side chain modification pathway initiated by hydroxylation at C-24 leads to the formation of the end product, calcitroic acid. The C-23 and C-26 oxidation pathways, the minor side chain modification pathways initiated by hydroxylations at C-23 and C-26 respectively together lead to the formation of the end product, 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)-lactone. The C-3 epimerization pathway, the newly discovered A-ring modification pathway is initiated by epimerization of the hydroxyl group at C-3 to form 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-3-epi-vitamin-D(3). We performed the present study first to examine in detail the metabolism of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in HL-60 cells and then to assess the ability of the various natural intermediary metabolites of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in inducing differentiation and in inhibiting clonal growth of HL-60 cells. We incubated HL-60 cells with [1beta-(3)H] 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and demonstrated that these cells metabolize 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) mainly via the C-24 oxidation pathway and to a lesser extent via the C-23 oxidation pathway, but not via the C-3-epimerization pathway. Three of the natural intermediary metabolites of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) derived via the C-24 oxidation pathway namely, 1alpha,24(R),25-trihydroxyvitamin D(3), 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-24-oxovitamin D(3) and 1alpha,23(S),25-trihydroxy-24-oxovitamin D(3) [1alpha,23(S),25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-D(3)] were almost as potent as 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in terms of their ability to differentiate HL-60 cells into monocytes/macrophages. We then selected 1alpha,23(S),25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-D(3) which has the least calcemic activity among all the three aforementioned natural intermediary metabolites of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) to examine further its effects on these cells. Our results indicated that 1alpha,23(S),25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-D(3) was also equipotent to its parent in inhibiting clonal growth of HL-60 cells and in inducing expression of CD11b protein. In summary, we report that 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) is metabolized in HL-60 cells into several intermediary metabolites derived via both the C-24 and C-23 oxidation pathways but not via the C-3 epimerization pathway. Some of the intermediary metabolites derived via the C-24 oxidation pathway are found to be almost equipotent to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in modulating growth and differentiation of HL-60 cells. In a previous study, the same metabolites when compared to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) were found to be less calcemic.

The findings support the hypothesis that the C-3 epimerization is an inactivation pathway of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and its analogs in vitamin D target tissues. We also found that the 3-epi analogs, but not the 3-natural (beta) analogs, were the potent inducers of apoptosis of HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the analogs could be divided into two groups, in which the 3-epi analogs were the potent inducers of apoptosis of HL-60 cells, and the 3-natural analogs were the potent modulators of HL-60 cell growth and differentiation.

Recent studies have also provided evidence for the involvement of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in regulating the immune system. However, therapeutic application of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) to hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer, or for immunologic purposes, is thwarted by its hypercalcemic activity. In order to overcome this obstacle, analogs of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) have been produced that exhibit decreased hypercalcemic activity while retaining the growth and immunologic regulating properties. In the present study, the efficacy of 1alpha,24(S)-dihydroxyvitamin D(2) (1alpha,24(S)(OH)(2)D(2)), a vitamin D(2) analog, in restraining cell proliferation was compared to that of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). In parallel studies, cancer cell lines were grown in increased concentrations (10(-10)-10(-7) M) of each compound for various incubation periods (1-4 days). Growth was assessed by measuring [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. The results revealed that 1alpha,24(S)(OH)(2)D(2) significantly inhibits proliferation to an extent similar to that observed for 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). Moreover, incubating the human leukemia cell line, HL-60, with 1alpha,24(S)(OH)(2)D(2) resulted in an induction of differentiation of these promyelomonocyte cells into monocyte-macrophage-like cells, in a manner similar to that observed with 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). Using a Western procedure, it was also shown that 1alpha,24(S)(OH)(2)D(2) like 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) enhances the expression of vitamin D receptors (VDR) in the rat osteosarcoma cell line, ROS 17/2.8. The expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha (TNF-alpha) in human peritoneal macrophages (HPM) obtained from uremic patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was found to be regulated by 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) as well as by 1alpha,24(S)(OH)(2)D(2). Incubations of HPM with 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) or 1alpha,24(S)(OH)(2)D(2), have inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha on both mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) has a role in controlling the rate of inflammation in the peritoneal cavity of CAPD treated patients. Since 1alpha,24(S)(OH)(2)D(2) does not cause hypercalcemia, the present results encourage the possible use of this vitamin D(2) analog in the treatment of cancer and hyper-inflammatory diseases.","['Shany, S', 'Levy, Y', 'Lahav-Cohen, M']","['Shany S', 'Levy Y', 'Lahav-Cohen M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev and Soroka University Medical CTR, 84105, Beer Sheva, Israel.

The A-ring synthons were rationally synthesized via a novel and practical route, starting with methyl (R)-(+)- and (S)-(-)-3-hydroxy-2-methyl-propionate, in good yields. X-ray crystallographic analysis of 2alpha-methyl-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (2b) and conformational analysis of the A-ring of 2alpha-methyl-(2b) and 2beta-methyl-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (2f) were carried out, and the results are described. All A-ring diastereomers (2 and 3), thus synthesized, were biologically evaluated both in vitro and in vivo.

In particular, 2b showed 4-fold higher vitamin D receptor [VDR] binding activity than the natural hormone, and its 20-epimer (3b) exhibited exceptionally high activity, 12-fold more potent in VDR binding, 7-fold in calcium mobilization, and 590-fold in induction of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell differentiation as compared with the natural hormone. Further, the 20-epi-2beta-Me-1beta, 3alpha(OH)(2) isomer (3g) had significant biologic potencies compared to the natural hormone despite having 1beta-OH configuration. The transcriptional activities on human osteocalcin gene promoter, including VDRE in transfected mammalian cells, were also evaluated.

However, the possibility of using calcitriol as an antileukemic drug was not feasible because of its potent calcemic effects. Based on these observations, several pharmaceutical companies initiated the synthesis of vitamin D analogs with the aim to separate the calcemic actions of calcitriol from its actions on regulating the cell growth and differentiation. As a result, numerous noncalcemic analogs with a potential for the treatment of leukemia and other cancers were synthesized. The group at Chugai introduced two characteristic analogs of opposite type namely, 22-oxacalcitriol (OCT) and 2beta-(3-hydroxypropoxy)calcitriol (ED-71) which have been shown to have therapeutic value and are already being used clinically. The work on OCT and ED-71 together with the work on calcipotriol and KH-1060 by Leo Laboratories, and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-16-ene-23-yne-D(3) by Hoffmann-La Roche, vigorously stimulated research world-wide in the development of vitamin D analogs into pharmaceutical products. More recently new impressive vitamin D analogs such as 3-epi analogs, 19-nor analogs, 18-nor analogs, 2-methyl-20-epi-calcitriol, non-steroidal vitamin D analogs are being developed. The authors are convinced that various vitamin D analogs will become highly effective therapeutic agents at the clinical level in the new century, and also that a new theory on the mechanism of vitamin D action will be generated.","['Nishii, Y', 'Okano, T']","['Nishii Y', 'Okano T']","['Medical Culture Inc., Toshima-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

RUNX1 is a key regulator of hematopoiesis and a frequent target of leukemia associated chromosomal translocations. Here we present a detailed analysis of the RUNX1 locus based on its complete genomic sequence. RUNX1 spans 260 kb and its expression is regulated through two distinct promoter regions, that are 160 kb apart. A very large CpG island complex marks the proximal promoter (promoter-2), and an additional CpG island is located at the 3' end of the gene. Hitherto, 12 different alternatively spliced RUNX1 cDNAs have been identified. Genomic sequence analysis of intron/exon boundaries of these cDNAs has shown that all consist of properly spliced authentic coding regions. This indicates that the large repertoire of RUNX1 proteins, ranging in size between 20-52 kDa, are generated through usage of alternatively spliced exons some of which contain in frame stop codons. The gene's introns are largely depleted of repetitive sequences, especially of the LINE1 family. The RUNX1 locus marks the transition from a ~1 Mb of gene-poor region containing only pseudogenes, to a gene-rich region containing several functional genes.

The data used for analysis of total cancer mortality and study of the trends in mortality of specific childhood cancer in Mexico were retrieved from official Mexican Cancer Mortality Statistics for the period of 1955-1995, as well as from the latest official death records of the Mexican National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics. Actual mortality rates from all sites of cancer in Mexico show a tendency to increase in adults and in children over the last decades. The mortality rate due to all malignant neoplasms in the Mexican population increased significantly, from 28.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1955 to 52.6 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1995, whereas the rate of total mortality tended to decrease. The death rate among Mexican children under 15 years of age from all malignant neoplasms increased from 1980-1995 by 20.3%. Although these findings offer some support for the suggestion that socioeconomic factors and delayed diagnosis and treatment may be the major contributors to childhood cancer death rates in Mexico, other explanations cannot be excluded. Further and more detailed research into the nature of the influence of environmental exposures, geographical distribution-including rural vs. city life-and purely biological factors concerned with the cancer situation is warranted. Predictions indicate that the increase of both total and childhood cancer mortality will continue. The pattern in the epidemiology of childhood diseases is changing in view of better national health measures to control infectious diseases, diarrheas, and neonatal problems. All these measures would lead to an increase in the incidence of childhood cancer in children who previously died of other causes. Therefore, improved registry, early diagnosis, better knowledge of the epidemiologic pattern of childhood cancer, appropriate treatment, and greater resources are necessary to solve this emerging health problem in Mexico.","['Abdullaev, F I', 'Rivera-Luna, R', 'Roitenburd-Belacortu, V', 'Espinosa-Aguirre, J']","['Abdullaev FI', 'Rivera-Luna R', 'Roitenburd-Belacortu V', 'Espinosa-Aguirre J']","['Laboratorio de Oncologia Experimental, Mexico City, Mexico. fikrat@servidor.unam.mx']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child Welfare/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lymphoma/mortality', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 2000 Sep-Oct;31(5):526-31. doi: 10.1016/s0188-4409(00)00094-1.,,"['S0188-4409(00)00094-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0188-4409(00)00094-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the possible correlation among telomere length, telomerase (a ribonuclear protein that synthesizes the telemeres de novo) activity, hTERT (a catalytic subunit of telomerase) expression, and TRF1 and TRF2 (telomere DNA binding proteins) expression in human acute leukemia cells. The hTERT expression level was strongly associated with telomerase activity (P=0.0001), indicating that the expression level of the catalytic subunit (hTERT) regulates telomerase activity in human acute leukemia cells. TRF1 expression, which is believed to control telomere length, was significantly elevated in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (P=0.0232) compared to those in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); TRF1 expression tended to be higher in patients without telomere shortening (P=0.077) and in those with hTERT expression (P=0.055). This indicates that TRF1 may act to monitor telomere length under the condition of up-regulated telomerase activity in some neoplastic cells. In contrast, TRF2 expression in acute leukemia did not show any correlation with telomere parameters in this study. Although the precise regulation mechanism of telomere length is still uncertain, these results may suggest that regulation of telomere length is partially associated with TRF1 expression, whereas dysfunction of TRF1 expression may be speculated in a subset of acute leukemia.","['Ohyashiki, J H', 'Hayashi, S', 'Yahata, N', 'Iwama, H', 'Ando, K', 'Tauchi, T', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Hayashi S', 'Yahata N', 'Iwama H', 'Ando K', 'Tauchi T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*RNA', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Telomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Mar;18(3):593-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo.18.3.593.,,['10.3892/ijo.18.3.593 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PP1 was ubiquitously but differently expressed in various FAB subtypes (M1-M5), although PP1 activity was significantly higher in blasts of AML-M4 than in AML-M2. PP1 activity was significantly lower in elderly patients > or =55 years (P=0.005), and in those with high white cell counts > or =100,000/microl (P=0.039) at initial diagnosis.

The median overall survival was 8 months for patients with low PP1 activity compared to 27 months for those with high PP1 activity in their AML cells. Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that low PP1 activity significantly contributed to prognosis. This preliminary study suggests that low PP1 activity may be associated with shortened survival time for AML patients with high white cell counts.","['Nishikawa, M', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Watanabe, Y', 'Kita, K', 'Shiku, H']","['Nishikawa M', 'Yamamoto M', 'Watanabe Y', 'Kita K', 'Shiku H']","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan. nisikawa@clin.med.mie-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cytosol/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/drug therapy/*enzymology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Mar;18(3):559-65. doi: 10.3892/ijo.18.3.559.,,['10.3892/ijo.18.3.559 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we showed that bisdioxopiperazines induced erythroid differentiation, inhibited human leukemia K562 cell growth, and caused a slow induction of apoptosis. Dexrazoxane treatment caused DNA endoreduplication resulting in large highly polyploid cells. This result suggested the lack of a DNA topoisomerase II activity-based cell cycle checkpoint. The percentage of K562 cells that became apoptotic was much larger than the percentage of cells that stained for hemoglobin, suggesting that prior differentiation was not required for induction of apoptosis. Use of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571 resulted in a reduction in Bcl-xL levels and potentiation of dexrazoxane-induced apoptosis related to an earlier onset and more extensive cleavage of caspase-3. These results indicated that dexrazoxane-induced apoptosis is associated with a caspase-3 activation/cleavage pathway. In addition, these results were consistent with the antiapoptotic signaling function of Bcr-Abl to regulate expression of Bcl-xL. The ability of dexrazoxane to induce differentiation and apoptosis suggests that bisdioxopiperazines may be useful in treating some types of leukemia.","['Hasinoff, B B', 'Abram, M E', 'Barnabe, N', 'Khelifa, T', 'Allan, W P', 'Yalowich, J C']","['Hasinoff BB', 'Abram ME', 'Barnabe N', 'Khelifa T', 'Allan WP', 'Yalowich JC']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. b_hasinoff@umanitoba.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Razoxane/*pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2001 Mar;59(3):453-61. doi: 10.1124/mol.59.3.453.,,['10.1124/mol.59.3.453 [doi]'],,,"['CA74972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77468/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The RUNX genes encode the alpha subunit of the transcription factor PEBP2/CBF. The beta subunit consists of the non-RUNX protein PEBP2beta. We found that RUNX1/AML1, which is essential for hematopoiesis, is continuously subjected to proteolytic degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. When PEBP2beta is present, however, the ubiquitylation of RUNX1 is abrogated and this causes a dramatic inhibition of RUNX1 proteolysis. Heterodimerization between PEBP2beta and RUNX1 thus appears to be an essential step in the generation of transcriptionally competent RUNX1. Consistent with this notion, RUNX1 was barely detected in PEBP2beta(-/-) mouse. CBF(PEBP2)beta- SMMHC, the chimeric protein associated with inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia, was found to protect RUNX1 from proteolytic degradation more efficiently than PEBP2beta. These results reveal a hitherto unknown and major role of PEBP2beta, namely that it regulates RUNX1 by controlling its turnover.

The previous study revealed that a doxorubicin-resistant AML subline (AML-2/DX100) overexpressed an MDR-associated protein (MRP) but not P-glycoprotein. The AML-2/DX100 also showed various levels of resistance to daunorubicin and vincristine but was paradoxically sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (5-fold), t-butyl hydroperoxide (3-fold), and paraquat (2-fold) when compared to the drug-sensitive parental AML-2 cells (AML-2/WT). We compared the activities of antioxidant enzymes to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide dismutases, glutathione S-transferase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in both AML-2/WT and AML-2/DX100. Interestingly, of these antioxidant enzymes, catalase activity of AML-2/DX100 decreased significantly to about one-third that of AML-2/WT (P < 0.000005). The decreased activity of catalase was due to reduced expression of the catalase gene; confirmed by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. The decreased activity of catalase was maintained even in the absence of doxorubicin for 3 months as well as by the treatment of probenecid, an MRP inhibitor. In addition, there was no difference in catalase activity between HL-60 and another MRP-overexpressing subline HL-60/Adr. Taken together, the paradoxical increase in the sensitivity of an MRP-overexpressing AML-2/DX100 in response to peroxides and paraquat is due to the down-regulation of catalase gene expression, which totally independent of overexpression of MRP. It is therefore possible that decreased catalase activity could be exploited as an Achilles' heel in resistant cells such as this.","['Kim, H S', 'Lee, T B', 'Choi, C H']","['Kim HS', 'Lee TB', 'Choi CH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Chosun University Medical School, 375 Seosuk-dong, Dong-gu, Kwangju, 501-759, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Herbicides)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'PLG39H7695 (Paraquat)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catalase/*metabolism', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Herbicides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Paraquat/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide/pharmacology']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Feb 16;281(1):109-14. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.4324.,,"['10.1006/bbrc.2001.4324 [doi]', 'S0006291X01943244 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, mature astrocytes do not significantly express the specific CNTFalpha receptor subunit, yet they respond to CNTF administration in vivo. Here we show that this controversy may be solved by a shift in astroglial sensitivity to CNTF over time, related to a change in the type of receptor bound by the cytokine on mature astrocytes. A convergent set of results supports the hypothesis that the CNTF effect is due to the illegitimate binding on the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR): (i) it requires high concentration of recombinant rat CNTF; (ii) it involves the Jak/Stat and Ras-MAPK pathways; (iii) it is preserved in CNTFRalpha-/- cells; (iv) it is potentiated by soluble CNTFRalpha added to the medium; and (v) it is significantly decreased by a partial antagonist of LIFR. On these bases, we propose a mechanistic model in which, in the adult brain, a CNTF/LIFR interglial system may be modulated by neurons that synthesize CNTFRalpha.","['Monville, C', 'Coulpier, M', 'Conti, L', 'De-Fraja, C', 'Dreyfus, P', 'Fages, C', 'Riche, D', 'Tardy, M', 'Cattaneo, E', 'Peschanski, M']","['Monville C', 'Coulpier M', 'Conti L', 'De-Fraja C', 'Dreyfus P', 'Fages C', 'Riche D', 'Tardy M', 'Cattaneo E', 'Peschanski M']","['INSERM U421, Creteil cedex, 94010, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/chemistry/*enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Dimerization', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",,2001/02/17 11:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/02/17 11:00'],"['2001/02/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/17 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2001 Feb;17(2):373-84. doi: 10.1006/mcne.2000.0926.,,"['10.1006/mcne.2000.0926 [doi]', 'S1044-7431(00)90926-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,

Different culture conditions including cell-free systems and coculture with different human lymphatic cell lines were compared. Cocultivation with each of the cell lines used enhanced the survival of the parasites. The best results were obtained employing the human T cell leukemia line Jurkat and human dermal fibroblasts as feeder cells in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-in-activated human serum. This culture system allowed the cultivation of B. malayi for more than 7 weeks with an average growth of the larvae by factor 6.4 (0.77 +/- 0.035 cm) and a maximum growth by factor 10 (1.2 cm). 100% of the parasites reached the fourth larval stage after 14 days. By day 37 of culture, 17% of the larvae had completed their final moult. Parasites remained alive up to 52 days. During the first four weeks of culture, both the length and the periods of moulting of the in vitro cultivated filariae closely resembled those observed with B. malayi in vivo in rodent hosts. This system provides a new approach for successful cultivation of B. malayi, that should help to overcome the difficulties of reproduction by other laboratories encountered with previous culture systems. It appeared highly reproducible in our hands and possibly further improvement can be obtained on its basis. This cultivation system represents a further step towards the complete replacement of the vertebrate host by means of in vitro culture systems in parasitological research.","['Falcone, Franco H.', 'Schlaak, Max', 'Haas, Helmut']","['Falcone FH', 'Schlaak M', 'Haas H']","['Forschungsinstitut Borstel, Institut fur Experimentelle Biologie und Medizin.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,ALTEX,ALTEX,100953980,,,,,1995/01/01 00:00,2001/02/15 11:00,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,ALTEX. 1995;12(4):179-187.,"In vitro Kultur von Brugia malayi, einem Erreger der lymphatischen Filariose beim Menschen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For native AML blasts the following functions were compared: (1) autonomous and cytokine-dependent proliferation; (2) frequency of clonogenic cell; and (3) constitutive cytokine secretion. AML blast proliferation differed between patients independent of the culture medium used, and clonogenic cells were maintained after in vitro culture in all media. In contrast, constitutive cytokine secretion was higher for cells cultured in StemSpan and FCS-containing medium than for cells cultured in the X-vivo media. Native AML blasts incubated in StemSpan also showed a low frequency of apoptotic cells. The three serum-free media could also be used for long-term expansion of well-characterized AML cell lines, but the optimal medium for cell expansion and cytokine secretion differed between cell lines.

Thus, primary and osteogenic differentiated MSCs produce important hematopoietic cytokines and support hematopoiesis in long-term cultures, suggesting that these cells may provide an excellent ex vivo environment for hematopoiesis during progenitor cell expansion and may be important for in vivo cell therapy.","['Majumdar, M K', 'Thiede, M A', 'Haynesworth, S E', 'Bruder, S P', 'Gerson, S L']","['Majumdar MK', 'Thiede MA', 'Haynesworth SE', 'Bruder SP', 'Gerson SL']","['Osiris Therapeutics Inc., Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/*drug effects', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2000 Dec;9(6):841-8. doi: 10.1089/152581600750062264.,,['10.1089/152581600750062264 [doi]'],,,"['P30CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA63193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES06288/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have used a nonhuman primate, as a preclinical model, to analyze the limiting steps of this approach using recombinant retroviruses. Seven monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) underwent the complete protocol: their left liver lobe was resected, a catheter was placed in the inferior mesenteric vein and connected to an infusion chamber, and the hepatocytes were isolated, cultured, and transduced with a retroviral vector containing the beta-galactosidase gene. The hepatocytes were harvested and returned to the host via the infusion chamber. Biopsies were taken 4-40 days later. No animal was killed in the course of the experiments. They all tolerated the procedure well. We have developed and defined conditions that permit the proliferation and transduction of up to 90% of the plated hepatocytes. A significant proportion of genetically modified cells, representing up to 3% of the liver mass, were safely delivered to the liver via the chamber. Polymerase chain reaction analysis detected integrated viral DNA sequences and quantitative analysis of the in situ beta-Gal-expressing hepatocytes indicated that a significant amount of transduced hepatocytes, up to 2%, had become integrated into the liver and were functional. These results represent substantial advances in the development of the ex vivo approach and suggest that this approach is of clinical relevance for liver-directed gene therapy.","['Andreoletti, M', 'Loux, N', 'Vons, C', 'Nguyen, T H', 'Lorand, I', 'Mahieu, D', 'Simon, L', 'Di Rico, V', 'Vingert, B', 'Chapman, J', 'Briand, P', 'Schwall, R', 'Hamza, J', 'Capron, F', 'Bargy, F', 'Franco, D', 'Weber, A']","['Andreoletti M', 'Loux N', 'Vons C', 'Nguyen TH', 'Lorand I', 'Mahieu D', 'Simon L', 'Di Rico V', 'Vingert B', 'Chapman J', 'Briand P', 'Schwall R', 'Hamza J', 'Capron F', 'Bargy F', 'Franco D', 'Weber A']","['INSERM EMI 00-20, Hopital Antoine-Beclere, 92141 Clamart, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism/*transplantation/virology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lac Operon/genetics', 'Liver/*surgery', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Portal Vein', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Jan 20;12(2):169-79. doi: 10.1089/104303401750061230.,,['10.1089/104303401750061230 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Pseudotyped vectors using the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope have entered into clinical trials but specific recommendations regarding methods for screening of vector product and analysis of clinical samples have not been set forth. Unfortunately, current screening assays used for detecting amphotropic RCR are not suitable for GALV-pseudotyped RCR. We modified the extended S+/L- assay for RCR detection by using human 293 cells for virus amplification. Of five cell lines tested, 293 cells were selected because they combined a high transduction efficiency and an ability to generate RCR at high titer. After optimizing the amplification assay, a dilution of GALV virus could consistently be detected at a dilution of 10(-6). In coculture experiments, one GALV-infected cell could be consistently detected in 10(6) uninfected cells. A PCR-based assay was developed that was capable of detecting 100 copies of a GALV envelope containing plasmid diluted in 1 microg of DNA obtained from uninfected cells. PCR was also able to detect one GALV-infected cell in 10(6) uninfected cells. These assays will be suitable for testing of vector preparations and for monitoring of clinical samples from patients treated in clinical gene therapy protocols. The assays developed are similar in methodology and sensitivity to those currently used for certification of amphotropic retroviral vectors.","['Chen, J', 'Reeves, L', 'Cornetta, K']","['Chen J', 'Reeves L', 'Cornetta K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Biological Assay', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', '*Virus Replication']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Jan 1;12(1):61-70. doi: 10.1089/104303401450979.,,['10.1089/104303401450979 [doi]'],,,"['P01 HL53586/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 DK49218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U42 RR11148/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have evaluated the efficiency of different viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) in long-term expression of a transgene in vivo, using severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-repopulating cell assays. Vectors used were variants of the simplified retroviral vector GCsap with the different LTRs of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV), and murine stem cell virus (MSCV). The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was used as a marker to assess levels of transduction efficiency. CD34+ cells isolated from human cord blood were transduced by exposure to virus-containing supernatants on fibronectin fragments and in the presence of stem cell factor, interleukin 6, Flt-3 ligand, and thrombopoietin, and then transplanted into nonobese diabetic/SCID mice. Engraftment of human cells highly expressing EGFP, with differentiation along multiple cell lineages, was demonstrated for up to 18 weeks posttransplant, although the three different vectors showed different transduction frequencies (MLV, <0.1-33.2%; MPSV, <0.1-22.8%; MSCV, 0.3-51.7%). Of importance is that high-level transduction frequencies in human progenitor cells were also confirmed by colony-forming cell assays using bone marrow from transplanted mice, in which EGFP-expressing, highly proliferative potential colonies were observed by fluorescence microscopy. In these mice the vector carrying the MSCV LTR generated more EGFP-expressing human cells than did either of the other two constructs, indicating that GCsap carrying the MSCV LTR may be an efficient tool for stem cell gene therapy.","['Kaneko, S', 'Onodera, M', 'Fujiki, Y', 'Nagasawa, T', 'Nakauchi, H']","['Kaneko S', 'Onodera M', 'Fujiki Y', 'Nagasawa T', 'Nakauchi H']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*blood/immunology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Graft Survival', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Luminescent Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Jan 1;12(1):35-44. doi: 10.1089/104303401450942.,,['10.1089/104303401450942 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now identified this lipid-like component to be palmitoyl (16:0)-oleoyl (18:1)-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), using preparative thin-layer chromatographic fractionation and tandem mass spectrometric analysis. In the syncytium formation assay, exogenously added PG inhibited cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Other phospholipids showed less (PE) or no effect (PC, PS, PI, PA, lysoPC, lysoPE, and CL). Binding experiments showed that PG interacted with three synthetic peptides, gp46--111, gp46--197, and gp21--400, which correspond to regions Lys111--Asp138 and Asp197--Leu216 on the gp46 surface glycoprotein, and to region Cys400--Leu429 on the gp21 transmembrane glycoprotein, respectively, as well as with intact gp46 and gp21 proteins of HTLV-1. On the other hand, HSC70 and beta-actin interacted with gp46--197 and gp46, not with gp46--111. However, the eluate from an affinity column coupled with gp46--111 contained not only PG but also HSC70 and beta-actin, despite the lack of direct interaction between gp46--111 and these proteins. In the in vitro binding assay, HSC70 showed interaction with both PG and beta-actin, while there was no evidence of any interaction between PG and beta-actin. These results suggest that HSC70 molecules on target cell surface interact with both PG in lipid bilayers and intracellular beta-actin and that these three cellular components form a receptor complex that plays a critical role in syncytium formation induced by HTLV-1-bearing cells.","['Sagara, Y', 'Inoue, Y', 'Kojima, E', 'Ishida, C', 'Shiraki, H', 'Maeda, Y']","['Sagara Y', 'Inoue Y', 'Kojima E', 'Ishida C', 'Shiraki H', 'Maeda Y']","['Department of Research, Fukuoka Red Cross Blood Center, Fukuoka 818-8588, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA8 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphatidylglycerols)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Giant Cells/*physiology', 'HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Phosphatidylglycerols/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology/*virology', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2001 Jan 20;17(2):125-35. doi: 10.1089/08892220150217210.,,['10.1089/08892220150217210 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

By combining STI571 with leptomycin B (LMB) to block nuclear export, we trapped BCR-ABL in the nucleus and the nuclear BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activates apoptosis. As a result, the combined treatment with STI571 and LMB causes the irreversible and complete killing of BCR-ABL transformed cells, whereas the effect of either drug alone is fully reversible. The combined treatment with STI571 and LMB also preferentially eliminates mouse bone marrow cells that express BCR-ABL. These results indicate that nuclear entrapment of BCR-ABL can be used as a therapeutic strategy to selectively kill chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.","['Vigneri, P', 'Wang, J Y']","['Vigneri P', 'Wang JY']","['Department of Biology, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2001 Feb;7(2):228-34. doi: 10.1038/84683.,,['10.1038/84683 [doi]'],,,"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL57900/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Nat Med. 2001 Feb;7(2):156-7.

When activated in the presence of leukemic CLL B cells, T cells rapidly up-regulate CD30 through an OX40 ligand and interleukin 4 (IL-4)-dependent mechanism. These leukemia-induced CD30+ T cells inhibit CD40 ligand (CD40L)-mediated S mu-->S gamma and S mu-->S alpha class-switch DNA recombination (CSR) by engaging CD30 ligand (CD30L), a molecule that interferes with the assembly of the CD40-tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) complex in nonmalignant IgD+ B cells. In addition, engagement of T cell CD30 by CD30L on neoplastic CLL B cells down-regulates the CD3-induced expression of CD40L.

Statistical evaluation of our experimental results shows that homologous centromeres and the homologous genes are positioned closer to each other 2 h after irradiation because they are localized closer to the center of the nucleus (probably due to more pronounced decondensation of the chromatin related to repair).

Egress of the developing hematopoietic cells is also a highly regulated process governed by adhesive interactions. In leukemia, immature blasts are not retained within the marrow, suggesting a breakdown of adhesive mechanisms. Recent reports suggest that E-cadherin, an epithelial adhesion molecule, is expressed on erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes, but not on other hematopoietic marrow elements. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the expression pattern of E-cadherin in normal and leukemic erythroid precursors by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissue and bone marrow aspirate smears. METHODS: Five normal bone marrow specimens from rib resections, 15 trephine bone marrow biopsy specimens, and 6 bone marrow aspirate smears from the iliac crest of patients with no known leukemia were selected. Fourteen bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with erythroleukemia were also studied. Immunoperoxidase staining of paraffin-embedded tissue and air-dried aspirate smears for E-cadherin (1:200 dilution, HECD-1 clone) was performed using the avidin-biotin peroxidase technique. RESULTS: In paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsy and rib specimens and in air-dried bone marrow aspirate smears, strong membrane expression of E-cadherin was seen in the normal erythroid precursors in all cases. In contrast, no membrane expression of E-cadherin was present in any of the bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with erythroleukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical detection of membrane expression of E-cadherin may be a useful tool for identification of erythroid precursors. Cells of erythroleukemia lack membrane expression of E-cadherin, in contrast to their normal counterparts. Further studies are needed to define the potential role of E-cadherin in the maturation of erythroid precursors and to ascertain the significance of loss of membrane expression of E-cadherin in erythroleukemia.","['Acs, G', 'LiVolsi, V A']","['Acs G', 'LiVolsi VA']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,['0 (Cadherins)'],IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cadherins/*blood', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Erythroblasts/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2001 Feb;125(2):198-201. doi: 10.5858/2001-125-0198-LOMEOE.,,['10.5858/2001-125-0198-LOMEOE [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

After bone marrow transplantation, 8 patients presented normal karyotype, 1 had persistence of identifiable Philadelphia chromosome and 3 had no metaphases. Two cases showed complete chimera and 2 had donor and host cells simultaneously. FISH was possible in all cases after bone marrow transplantation and confirmed the persistence of identifiable Philadelphia chromosome clone in one patient, and identified another that did not present metaphases for analysis.

We characterized the age-related changes of the CD10, CD19, TdT, CD34 and CD79a densities in normal and leukemic BM. Compared to normal adults, the B-precursors from normal children expressed significantly lower values of CD34-specific antibody binding capacity (SABC) (median value of 86.6 vs 160.2 arbitrary units (a.u.) in children and adults, respectively). No significant age-related difference was observed in the expression of the other markers in the normal BM, or in any of the markers in the leukemic BM. Based on the literature, we set the cut-off value for the normal CD10 expression at 45 x 10(3) a.u. for both age groups. For the remaining markers we established the cut-off values based on the minimum-maximum values in the normal BM in each age group. The expression of CD10 was higher than the cut-off in 30 ALL cases and in 18 of them there was a concomitant aberrant expression of other markers. In 9 of the 10 CD10+ ALL with normal CD10 SABC values, the expression of at least one other marker was aberrant.

Most of the known ETS proteins have been shown to activate transcription. However, four ETS proteins (YAN, ERF, NET and TEL) can act as transcriptional repressors. In three cases (ERF, NET and TEL) distinct repression domains have been identified and there are indications that NET and TEL may mediate transcription via Histone Deacetylase recruitment. All four proteins appear to be regulated by MAPKs, though for YAN and ERF this regulation seems to be restricted to ERKs. YAN, ERF and TEL have been implicated in cellular proliferation although there are indications suggesting a possible involvement of YAN and TEL in differentiation as well. Other ETS-domain proteins have been shown to repress transcription in a context specific manner, and there are suggestions that the ETS DNA-binding domain may act as a transcriptional repressor. Transcriptional repression by ETS domain proteins adds an other level in the orchestrated regulation by this diverse family of transcription factors that often recognize similar if not identical binding sites on DNA and are believed to regulate critical genes in a variety of biological processes. Definitive assessment of the importance of this novel regulatory level will require the identification of ETS proteins target genes and the further analysis of transcriptional control and biological function of these proteins in defined pathways.","['Mavrothalassitis, G', 'Ghysdael, J']","['Mavrothalassitis G', 'Ghysdael J']","['School of Medicine, University of Crete and IMBB-FORTH, Voutes, Heraklion, Crete 714-09, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AOP protein, Drosophila)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (ERF protein, human)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (ETS2 protein, human)', '0 (Elk3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ets2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pnt protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Eye Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', '*Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",110,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Dec 18;19(55):6524-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204045.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1204045 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, the etiology of a number of virally induced leukemias, including Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia, has been associated with Fli-1 overexpression. The clinical relevance of Fli-1 becomes apparent in human Ewing's sarcoma in which Fli-1 is the target of a characteristic chromosomal translocation. As such, Fli-1 has generated considerable interest over the past several years for its role in malignant transformation and tumor progression. This review will present a synopsis of the current research on Fli-1 with emphasis on its function in malignant transformation. Moreover, the possible role of Fli-1 in cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival, as well as the recent development of transgenic and knock-out mice to investigate the function of Fli-1 will be discussed.

The expression of many Ets genes is associated with mesenchymal - epithelial interactions and changes in extracellular matrix proteins. These inductive processes contribute to tissue remodeling and integrity, particularly during embryonic development. Overlapping as well as unique patterns of Ets expression are evident in developing tissues, including development of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages, brain and central nervous system, bone and mammary gland.

Abelson murine leukemia virus, which encodes v-Abl/p160, induces a pre-B cell leukemia/lymphoma in mice. It has been unclear whether the apparent specificity of these two abl oncogenes for myeloid versus lymphoid neoplasms is due to specific intrinsic properties of these Abl oncoproteins, or due to the properties of the target cells expressing them. We have recently shown that expression of Bcr-Abl in bone marrow cells by retroviral transduction efficiently induces a myeloproliferative disorder in mice resembling human CML. In this study, we compared Bcr-Abl/p210 and v-Abl/p160 in this mouse CML model. We found that early in the course of disease, both Bcr-Abl/p210 and v-Abl/p160 expanded early immature hematopoietic cells. Later Bcr-Abl/p210 selectively expanded myeloid cells while v-Abl/p160 primarily induced the rapid in vivo expansion of B lymphoblastic cells, along with a minor population of myeloid cells. In vitro, Bcr-Abl/p210 induced more growth of myeloid colonies from 5-fluorouracil treated bone marrow than v-Abl/p160. These results, obtained under equal bone marrow transduction/transplantation conditions, indicate that Bcr-Abl/p210 has a greater intrinsic capacity than v-Abl/p160 to induce the neoplastic growth of myeloid cells. In addition, we found that cultured cells expressing Bcr-Abl/p210 had more activated STAT5 than cells that expressed v-Abl/p160. This suggests that activation of STAT5 might be one part of the mechanism of abl oncogene disease specificity.","['Gross, A W', 'Ren, R']","['Gross AW', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, MS029, Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02454-9110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Milk Proteins', 'Myeloid Cells/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Dec 14;19(54):6286-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204023.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1204023 [doi]'],,,['CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

PML localizes onto discrete intranuclear domains, the PML-nuclear bodies, and displays anti-oncogenic and pro-apoptotic properties. PLZF encodes a transcription factor belonging to the POZ/domain and Kruppel zinc finger (POK) family which interacts directly with PML. PLZF is related to another POK protein, LAZ3(BCL6), which is structurally altered, and presumably misexpressed, in many non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases. PLZF and LAZ3 share many functional properties: both inhibit cell growth, concentrate into punctated nuclear subdomains and are sequence-specific transcriptional repressors recruiting a histone deacetylase-repressing complex. Given these similarities, we tested whether both proteins could be targeted by each other. Here, LAZ3 and PLZF are shown to colocalize onto nuclear dots. Moreover, truncated derivatives of one protein, which display a diffuse nuclear localization, are recruited onto nuclear dots by the full-length other. The colocalization and the reciprocal 'rescue' is the result of a direct interaction between LAZ3 and PLZF, as indicated by yeast two hybrid assays, in vitro immunoprecipitations, and GST pull down experiments. In contrast to LAZ3 homomerization, LAZ3/PLZF heteromerization in yeast does not solely depend on POZ/POZ contacts but rather also relies on interactions between the two zinc finger regions and 'cross' contacts between the zinc finger region and the POZ domain of each partner. Likewise, LAZ3 shows some colocalization with the PLZF partner PML upon stable overexpression of both proteins in CHO cells and interacts with PML in yeast. Finally, endogenous LAZ3 and PLZF are co-induced and partially colocalized in myeloid MDS cells. These data indicate that a physical interaction between LAZ3 and PLZF underlies their simultaneous recruitment onto multiproteic nuclear complexes, presumably involved in transcriptional silencing and whose integrity (for APL) and/or function (for APL and NHL) may be altered in oncogenesis.","['Dhordain, P', 'Albagli, O', 'Honore, N', 'Guidez, F', 'Lantoine, D', 'Schmid, M', 'The, H D', 'Zelent, A', 'Koken, M H']","['Dhordain P', 'Albagli O', 'Honore N', 'Guidez F', 'Lantoine D', 'Schmid M', 'The HD', 'Zelent A', 'Koken MH']","['INSERM U524, IRCL, Place de Verdun, 59045 Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', '*Zinc Fingers']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Dec 14;19(54):6240-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203976.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203976 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of these modified viral vectors to long-wavelength UV light induces a reversal of the neutralizing, chemical modification resulting in restoration of infectivity to the viral vector.

We evaluated patients with cancer and implantable central venous catheters (ports) for this complication. STUDY DESIGN: Children with cancer undergoing port removal were eligible for this study. Vessel patency was evaluated by contrast venography. We examined each child for physical stigmata of thrombosis and retrospectively assessed catheter-related mechanical difficulties and infections. RESULTS: Thirty-one ports had been placed in 24 children (aged 20 months to 18 years; median age, 9 years) with diagnoses of leukemia/lymphoma (n = 10), solid tumor (n = 12), and histiocytosis (n = 2). Venography showed abnormalities in 12 of the 24 patients. Physical examination revealed dilated superficial veins on the chest in 3 patients.

CNL was diagnosed in a 74-year-old white woman in 1998, based on neutrophilic infiltration of the bone marrow and absence of the Philadelphia chromosome. The patient presented to the dermatology service in August 1998 with a 2-week history of a pruritic eruption on the arms, hands, and legs. Physical examination revealed red to violaceous plaques on both thighs and knees, in addition to purpuric patches and plaques on the dorsal hands, arms, and legs. Leukemia cutis was demonstrated on biopsy specimens of several lesional sites. The eruption progressed, despite treatment with topical and systemic corticosteroids. Treatment with systemic chemotherapy did affect partial resolution of the eruption, with parallel decreases in bone pain and white blood cell count, but the disease progressed and the patient ultimately died 5 months after her initial skin findings. Only one other case of CNL with dermatologic manifestations has been reported, CNL associated with a reactional neutrophilic dermatosis. Comparison to and differentiation from this case is discussed.

The FGFR1 and MOZ genes are rearranged in these diseases and encode one of the four fibroblast growth factor receptors and a member of a novel histone acetyltransferase family, respectively. The predicted fusion proteins that are putatively oncogenic - FOP-FGFR1, CEP110-FGFR1, and FIM-FGFR1 - and - MOZ-CBP, MOZ-p300, and MOZ-TIF2 - lead to tumorigenesis through distinct pathways. The constitutive kinase activity triggered by dimerization mediated by the protein-protein interaction motifs of the FGFR1 protein partner regardless of external stimuli and the delocalization of the fusion proteins compared to their normal counterparts may lead to tumorigenesis presumably by inducing inappropriate recruitment in the cytoplasm of signaling substrates. Currently, little is known about the precise role of MOZ in the regulation of gene transcription. However, all the aberrant proteins described to date retain the MOZ histone acetyltransferase domain fused to that of the transcription coactivators CBP, p300, and TIF2. The fusion of two acetyltransferases whose activity may be mistargetted or misregulated could be a critical event in leukemogenesis. The increasing number of translocations affecting FGFR1 and MOZ strongly suggest their involvement in oncogenic processes and point to these proteins as potential therapeutical targets.","['Pebusque, M J', 'Chaffanet, M', 'Popovici, C', 'Birnbaum, D']","['Pebusque MJ', 'Chaffanet M', 'Popovici C', 'Birnbaum D']","[""Laboratoire d'oncologie moleculaire, Inserm U. 119, IFR57, 27, boulevard Lei-Roure, 13009 Marseille, France.""]",['fre'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (CEP43 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*genetics/physiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Leucine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",57,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2000 Dec;87(12):887-94.,"FGFR1 et MOZ, deux genes cles dans les hemopathies malignes associees a des rearrangements de la region chromosomique 8p11-12.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effect of additional heat pretreatment on IL-2-activated cytotoxicity was examined. METHODS: Nonadherent mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PB), PBPC collections or BM were exposed to the desired temperature for 1 h, and successively cultured for 7 days in the presence of 1,000 units/ml of recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2). Cytotoxicity of IL-2-activated cells was determined by flow cytometry, using PKH-26-labelled K-562 or Raji target cells, and the cell surface antigens were also analyzed. RESULTS: IL-2-activated cells from all specimens showed a distinct generation of cytotoxic activities. The activities were significantly decreased by heat at 42 degrees C, but not changed by heat pretreatment at 40 degrees C. In the surface expression of IL-2-activated cells, the increase of CD56+ cells from PB, PBPC collections and the decrease of CD28 cells from PBPC collections were shown to be significant (p < 0.05), but these changes were not found when the cells were heat-pretreated at 42 degrees C. DISCUSSION: These results suggested that a tumor-killing therapeutic temperature (> or =42 degrees C) may lead to a disadvantage in posttransplantation immunity, and that this reduction of IL-2-activated cytotoxicity may partly be due to a lack of the enhancement of CD56+ cells or the reduction of CD28+ cells.","['Tanaka, M', 'Honda, J', 'Imamura, Y', 'Shiraishi, K', 'Tanaka, K', 'Oizumi, K']","['Tanaka M', 'Honda J', 'Imamura Y', 'Shiraishi K', 'Tanaka K', 'Oizumi K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, 67 Asahi-machi, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan. m-tanaka@kurume.ktarn.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/blood', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2000 May-Jun;68(3):124-8. doi: 10.1159/000055912.,,"['55912 [pii]', '10.1159/000055912 [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

Etiologies of this condition are numerous. Treatment of priapism varies from a conservative medical to a drastic surgical approach. Recent findings indicate methylene blue (MB), a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, to be a potential inhibitor of endothelial-mediated cavernous relaxation. This prompted us to assess the feasibility, use and effectiveness of MB in the treatment of priapism. METHODS: 12 patients were treated for priapism. Etiologies were: 10 drug-mediated (PGE(1) or papaverine/phentolamine mixture) after corpus cavernosum injection therapy (CCIT); 1 leukemia-induced, and 1 idiopathic high-flow priapism. The age range for all patients was 13-67 years, the average duration of priapism was 5.5 h after CCIT. MB was administered after blood aspiration of the corpora cavernosa. 5 ml of MB was injected intracavernously (i.c.) and left for 5 min. MB was then aspirated and the penis compressed for an additional 5 min. RESULTS: All patients with CCIT-induced priapism were cured with MB alone. The 2 patients who did not respond to MB underwent i.c. phenylephrine administration and embolization of the pudendal artery, respectively. The etiology and duration of priapism were the strongest predictors for success with i.c. administered MB. The primary side effects were a transient burning sensation and blue discoloration of the penis on injection of MB. The initial baseline erectile status was restored in all patients cured by MB. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that MB is a safe and highly effective treatment agent for short-term pharmacologically induced priapism. The application of MB shows virtually no significant side effects compared to the systemic and local complications induced by alpha-adrenergic agonists.","['Martinez Portillo, F', 'Hoang-Boehm, J', 'Weiss, J', 'Alken, P', 'Junemann, K']","['Martinez Portillo F', 'Hoang-Boehm J', 'Weiss J', 'Alken P', 'Junemann K']","['Department of Urology, University Hospital Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Eur Urol,European urology,7512719,['T42P99266K (Methylene Blue)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylene Blue/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Priapism/*chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur Urol. 2001 Jan;39(1):20-3. doi: 10.1159/000052407.,,"['52407 [pii]', '10.1159/000052407 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It co-localizes transitorily with replication protein A (RPA) and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies, and at times it enters the nucleolus. The observations support the hypothesis that BLM is distributed variously about the nucleus to manipulate DNA in some, very possibly several, nucleic acid transactions, when and where they take place. The specific transaction(s) remain to be identified.

Many translocations result in the fusion of genes located at the translocation breakpoints. In recent years we have witnessed a rapid rise in the number of chromosome translocations in leukemias being characterized at the molecular level. However, the number of genes being newly identified as translocation fusion genes has not risen at the same pace. This is due to the fact that several genes are involved in more than one translocation forming fusion genes with a number of other partner genes. Not only does one find star-shaped topologies, with one gene forming fusions with several others (e.g. ETV6/PDGFRB, ETV6/JAK2, ETV6/ABL etc.), but also networks connecting several genes with more than one fusion partner (e.g. ETV6/RUNX1 (AML1), RUNX1/CBFA2T1 (ETO), ETV6/EVI1, RUNX1/EVI1, ETV6/ABL, BCR/ABL).

These included 11 of 11 cases with c-ALL, 3 of 7 with pre-pre-B, and 8 of 9 cases with pre-B ALL. AB4 was used together with anti CD10 and anti CD19 antibodies and super-paramagnetic particles for developing a direct immunomagnetic procedure for purging human bone marrow of leukemic cells. In model experiments with KM3 cells admixed to mononuclear bone marrow cells, the individual antibodies each removed 2.8-3.1 logs and 3.6-4.1 logs of tumor cells with one and two purging cycles, respectively. In comparison, the efficacy of a mixture of the three antibodies was 4.4 logs with one treatment cycle, and > 5 logs with repeated treatments. Whereas the use of a commercially available anti-HLA-DR antibody resulted in a 90% reduction in the survival of CFU-GMs and normal blast colonies, AB4 had only a moderate effect on the progenitor cells (46% and 30% reduction). In conjunction with autologous transplantation, bone marrow from a patient was purged with the antibody mixture and 50% of the CFU-GMs and 47% of the CD34+ cells remained after treatment. The patient showed a normal engraftment, reaching a level of 0.5 x 109/l neutrophils by day 20 and 20 x 109/l platelets by day 30.

A trisomy 8 was also present in one of them, who later developed an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of the M0 FAB-type and died, whereas the other died with no evolution into AML. Besides FISH studies, microsatellite analysis was performed on both sisters to gather information on the parental origin of the chromosome 7 involved in partial monosomy and of the extra chromosome 8. The chromosomes 7 involved were of different parental origin in the two sisters, thus confirming that familial monosomy 7 is not explained by a germ-line mutation of a putative tumor-suppressor gene. Similar results were obtained in two other families out of the 12 reported in the literature. Noteworthy is the association with a mendelian disease in 3 out of 12 monosomy 7 families, which suggest that a mutator gene, capable of inducing both karyotype instability and a mendelian disorder, might act to induce chromosome 7 anomalies in the marrow.

In addition, this 5' UTR contains translation regulatory elements, such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes) that have been described in oncoretroviruses, as well as in lentiviruses. UV cross-linking experiments suggested that the pyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), a cellular protein known to regulate the activity of several picornaviral IRESes, binds to human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I RNA but not to lentiviral human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, HIV-2 or simian immunodeficiency virus RNAs. To calculate the affinity of such RNA-protein interactions, we developed a new method based on the BIAcore technology. The absence of affinity of PTB for lentiviral RNAs was confirmed, whereas its affinity for HTLV-I RNAs was 1000-fold lower than for picornaviral RNAs. The BIAcore technology also revealed a significant affinity of the La autoantigen, previously described for its involvement in translational control of viral mRNAs, for HIV-1 and HTLV-I RNAs. Addition of recombinant PTB to in vitro translation experiments weakly enhanced translation initiation in the presence of HTLV-I IRES, suggesting that such an IRES requires additional trans-acting factors.","['Waysbort, A', 'Bonnal, S', 'Audigier, S', 'Esteve, J P', 'Prats, A C']","['Waysbort A', 'Bonnal S', 'Audigier S', 'Esteve JP', 'Prats AC']","['INSERM U397, Endocrinologie et Communication Cellulaire, C.H.U.

This DNA-intercalating agent, which is currently undergoing phase I/II clinical trials, was shown to induce apoptosis in HL-60 human leukemia cells. We compared the cellular dysfunctions induced by NB-506 and the reference topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (CPT) at the nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic levels. The two drugs NB-506 and CPT were almost equally toxic to HL-60 cells and produced similar cell cycle changes with a considerable increase in the fraction of cells with DNA content less than G1. The sub-G1 fraction, which can be considered as the apoptotic cell population, appeared more rapidly with CPT than with NB-506 but in both cases, the cell cycle perturbation was accompanied by a marked decrease in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the intracellular pH. In contrast, no change in the intracellular calcium concentration was detected. Treatment of HL-60 cells with NB-506 resulted in an increase in the activity of the intracellular protease caspase-3, as determined by a DEVD-based colorimetric assay and direct monitoring of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage by Western blot analysis. The initiator caspase-8 was also stimulated by NB-506 but, as for caspase-3, the extent of the caspase activation was weaker with NB-506 compared to CPT. With both drugs, the protease activation resulted in DNA degradation, as independently confirmed via the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and characterization of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Collectively, these findings identify some of the molecular events leading to NB-506-induced apoptosis and as such, provide important mechanistic insights into the mode of action of topoisomerase I-targeted indolocarbazole antitumor drugs.","['Facompre, M', 'Goossens, J F', 'Bailly, C']","['Facompre M', 'Goossens JF', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U-524, Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, Place de Verdun, F-59045, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (NB 506)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Glycosylation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Feb 1;61(3):299-310. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00553-0.,,"['S0006-2952(00)00553-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00553-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Coadministration of LY335979 with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone significantly reduced the tumor mass of the Pgp-expressing UCLA-P3.003VLB lung carcinoma in a xenograph model and delayed the development of tumors in mice implanted with the parental drug-sensitive UCLA-P3 tumor. LY335979 was without significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of these anticancer agents. This may be due impart to its poor inhibition of four major cytochrome P450 isozymes important in metabolizing doxorubicin and other oncolytics.

PML-RARalpha chimeric protein disturbs various biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The distinct biological programs that regulate these processes stem from specific transcriptional activation of distinct (but overlapping) sets of genes. These programs are sometimes mutually exclusive and depend on whether the signals are delivered by RAR or RXR agonists. Furthermore, evidence that retinoid nuclear signaling by retinoid, on its own, is not enough to trigger these cellular responses is rapidly accumulating. Indeed, work with NB4 cells show that the fate of APL cells treated by retinoid depends on complex signaling cross-talk. Elucidation of the sequence of events and cascades of transcriptional regulation necessary for APL cell maturation will be an additional tool with which to further improve therapy by retinoids. In this task, the classical techniques used to analyze gene expression have proved time consuming, and their yield has been limited. Global analyses of the APL cell transcriptome are needed. We review the technical approaches currently available (differential display, complementary DNA microarrays), to identify novel genes involved in the determination of cell fate.","['Benoit, G R', 'Tong, J H', 'Balajthy, Z', 'Lanotte, M']","['Benoit GR', 'Tong JH', 'Balajthy Z', 'Lanotte M']","[""INSERM U-496, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, H pital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",99,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Jan;38(1):71-85. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90007-1.,,"['S0037196301000075 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90007-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In approximately 1% of the cases of APL, variant chromosomal aberrations may be found fusing RARa with other genes. Four variant mutations have been described, and the t(11;17)(q21;q23) translocation generating a promyelocyte leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)-RARalpha fusion gene is the most common. PLZF-RARalpha-positive APL forms a clinically distinct group because unlike PML-RARalpha-positive leukemia, it does not respond to retinoic acid with terminal granulocytic differentiation of the cells, and remissions cannot be achieved with retinoids alone. At the molecular level, this has been explained by the retinoic acid-insensitive binding of corepressor proteins to the PLZF part of the fusion protein, leading to sustained repression of target genes that are important for cellular differentiation. Targeting of the PLZF-RARalpha-bound corepressor complexes using a combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and deacetylase inhibitors has shown that the repression of target genes can be relieved, allowing differentiation of the cells. In addition, when a combination of retinoic acid and the hematopoietic growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is applied, the cells may be forced to undergo terminal differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that signals from the activated G-CSF receptor may induce the release of corepressor proteins from PLZF.

In vitro, As2O3 exerts a dose-dependent dual effect: it triggers apoptosis at relatively high concentrations (0.5 to 2.0 micromol/L) and induces partial differentiation at low concentrations (0.1 to 0.5 micromol/L). The apoptosis-inducing effect is associated with the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potentials in a thiol-dependent manner, whereas the retinoic acid signaling is required for APL cell differentiation. As2O3 over a wide range of concentrations (0.1 to 2.0 micromol/L) Induces degradation of PML-RARalpha as well as the wild-type PML and enhances the acetylation of histone, a process important for the transcriptional activation of genes. In vivo, As2O3 induces a high complete remission (CR) rate in patients with both primary and relapsed APL (around 85% to 90%). Side effects, such as skin reaction, gastrointestinal symptoms, electrocardiographic (EKG) changes, neuropathy, and liver dysfunction, are mild to moderate in relapsed patients, and severe hepatic lesions have been found in some primary cases. After CR obtained in relapsed patients, chemotherapy in combination with As2O3 as postremission therapy has yielded better survival than treatment with As2O3 alone. This is in line with the observation that remission induction with As2O3 is not sufficient in most cases to obtain a molecular remission as Judged by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for PML-RARalpha fusion transcripts. The in vivo effect of As2O3 seems to be related to the expression of APL-specific PML-RARalpha oncoprotein, and a synergistic effect between As2O3 and ATRA has been shown in the APL mouse model. Besides As2O3, other arsenic compounds such as As4S4 also show a therapeutic effect in APL. Because the toxic effects of arsenic treatment in primary APL need to be investigated further, we propose use of ATRA as a first-line drug for remission induction in primary APL, whereas As2O3 can be incorporated into multidrug postremission therapy or used as rescue for relapsed APL patients.","['Chen, Z', 'Chen, G Q', 'Shen, Z X', 'Chen, S J', 'Wang, Z Y']","['Chen Z', 'Chen GQ', 'Shen ZX', 'Chen SJ', 'Wang ZY']","[""Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects', 'Oxides/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/toxicity']",37,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Jan;38(1):26-36. doi: 10.1053/shem.2001.20863.,,"['S0037196301000038 [pii]', '10.1053/shem.2001.20863 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it cannot eliminate the leukemic clone and must be used in combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Experience accumulated over the last 10 years has clearly shown that the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy gave better survival than chemotherapy alone in newly diagnosed APL because of fewer relapses and a slightly higher CR rate. It is also strongly suggested that maintenance treatment with ATRA, and possibly with low-dose chemotherapy, can further reduce the incidence of relapse. Overall, more than 90% of patients with newly diagnosed APL can achieved CR, and about 75% can be cured by the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy. ATRA syndrome remains the major side effect of ATRA treatment, which should be prevented by addition of chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone in case of increasing white blood cell (WBC) counts. Current issues in the treatment of newly diagnosed APL include the role of early addition of chemotherapy to ATRA, whether or not ara-C is useful in combination with anthracycline, and a possible interest of arsenic trioxide during consolidation in patients remaining at relatively high risk of relapse.","['Fenaux, P', 'Chomienne, C', 'Degos, L']","['Fenaux P', 'Chomienne C', 'Degos L']","[""Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU Lille, and the Institut d'Hematologie, H pital Saint Louis, Paris, France. pfenaux@chru-lille.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use/toxicity']",78,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Jan;38(1):13-25. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90002-2.,,"['S0037196301000026 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90002-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Because adhesion molecule (AdMol) expression patterns reflect the biology of lymphoid neoplasms, we studied a series of 106 B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, including CD5+ BCLL (n = 56), NHL other than BCLL (n = 35), and CD5-/CD10- CBL (excluding hairy cell leukemia and prolymphocytic leukemia) with no prior history of NHL (n = 15) for expression of components of the very late antigen-4 complex (alpha4/beta1 integrin (CD49d/CD29)), components of the mucosal addressin-cell adhesion molecule receptor (alpha4(CD49d)/beta7 integrin), and L-selectin (CD62L). CD62L expression was significantly greater in CD5+ BCLL than in NHL (P < .001). Conversely, CD29, CD49d, and beta7-integrin expression were significantly greater in NHL than in CD5+ BCLL (P < .001 for each marker).

Here we show that an intracellular pathway including soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) plays a role in induced expression of the gamma-globin gene. sGC, an obligate heterodimer of alpha- and beta-subunits, participates in a variety of physiological processes by converting GTP to cGMP. Northern blot analyses with erythroid cell lines expressing different beta-like globin genes showed that, whereas the beta-subunit is expressed at similar levels, high-level expression of the alpha-subunit is preferentially observed in erythroid cells expressing gamma-globin but not those expressing beta-globin. Also, the levels of expression of the gamma-globin gene correlate to those of the alpha-subunit. sGC activators or cGMP analogs increased expression of the gamma-globin gene in erythroleukemic cells as well as in primary erythroblasts from normal subjects and patients with beta-thalassemia. Nuclear run-off assays showed that the sGC activator protoporphyrin IX stimulates transcription of the gamma-globin gene. Furthermore, increased expression of the gamma-globin gene by well known Hb F-inducers such as hemin and butyrate was abolished by inhibiting sGC or PKG activity. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the sGC-PKG pathway constitutes a mechanism that regulates expression of the gamma-globin gene. Further characterization of this pathway should permit us to develop new therapeutics for the beta-globin disorders.","['Ikuta, T', 'Ausenda, S', 'Cappellini, M D']","['Ikuta T', 'Ausenda S', 'Cappellini MD']","['Center for Human Genetics, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA. tikuta@bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Butyrates)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Guanylate Cyclase)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cyclic GMP/*metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*physiology', '*Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Guanylate Cyclase/*physiology', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Feb 13;98(4):1847-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.041599798.

In the Ukraine alone, more than 4 million people were exposed to radiation. The exact health consequences of this exposure are still being assessed. METHODS: To ascertain the effect of in utero radiation exposure and the development of leukaemia, a review was undertaken of leukaemia sub-types occurring among children born in the year of the accident (1986) and followed 10 years post-exposure. A comparison was made of leukaemia cumulative incidence rates among children from both an exposed and unexposed oblast. RESULTS: Rate ratios (RR) for the all cell types grouping of leukaemia revealed that rates in the exposed Oblast were significantly elevated for females, males and both genders combined. Rates of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were dramatically elevated for males and to a lesser extent for females.

As the major Th1 inducing cytokine, interleukin 12, is undetectable in CD gut mucosa, the mechanism by which Th1 effector cells are generated remains unknown. Interferon (IFN) alpha, a cytokine capable of promoting IFN-gamma synthesis, has been implicated in the development of Th1 mediated immune diseases. Here we report a case of CD-like enteropathy in a patient receiving IFN-alpha for chronic myeloid leukaemia. Morphological assessment of duodenal biopsies taken from the patient showed total villous atrophy, crypt cell hyperplasia, and a high number of CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes. Both antigliadin antibodies and antiendomysial antibodies were positive. RNA analysis revealed pronounced expression of IFN-gamma. Withdrawal of gluten from the diet resulted in a patchy improvement in intestinal morphology, normalisation of laboratory parameters, and resolution of clinical symptoms. By western blot analysis, IFN-alpha protein was seen in the duodenal mucosa from untreated CD patients but not in controls. This was associated with marked expression of IFN-gamma protein in CD mucosa. Collectively, these results suggest a role for IFN-alpha in promoting Th1 responses to gluten.","['Monteleone, G', 'Pender, S L', 'Alstead, E', 'Hauer, A C', 'Lionetti, P', 'McKenzie, C', 'MacDonald, T T']","['Monteleone G', 'Pender SL', 'Alstead E', 'Hauer AC', 'Lionetti P', 'McKenzie C', 'MacDonald TT']","['Division of Infection, Allergy, Inflammation, and Repair, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gut,Gut,2985108R,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Celiac Disease/diagnosis/*etiology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/biosynthesis/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/physiology']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gut. 2001 Mar;48(3):425-9. doi: 10.1136/gut.48.3.425.,,['10.1136/gut.48.3.425 [doi]'],PMC1760133,,,,,['Gut 2001 Apr;48(4):584'],,,,,,

A PKC-specific but isozyme-nonselective inhibitor, Ro-31-8220, and a cPKC selective inhibitor, Go-6976, caused significant attenuation of bufalin-induced interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) gene expression, a mature monocytic marker, indicating that cPKC participates in the bufalin-induced cell differentiation.

Rottlerin, an nPKCdelta-specific inhibitor, partially attenuated preapoptotic effects of bufalin, such as the limited proteolysis of nPKCdelta and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and the cell staining by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, suggesting that nPKCdelta is involved, at least in part, in bufalin-induced apoptosis. In contrast, Go-6976 and rottlerin significantly augmented bufalin-induced apoptosis and differentiation, respectively.

Mutations in lilli suppress excessive neuronal differentiation in response to a constitutively active form of Raf in the eye. In the wild type, Lilli has a partially redundant function in the Ras/MAPK pathway in differentiation but it is essential for normal growth. Loss of Lilli function causes an autonomous reduction in cell size and partially suppresses the increased growth associated with loss of PTEN function. These results suggest that Lilli acts in parallel with the Ras/MAPK and the PI3K/PKB pathways in the control of cell identity and cellular growth.","['Wittwer, F', 'van der Straten, A', 'Keleman, K', 'Dickson, B J', 'Hafen, E']","['Wittwer F', 'van der Straten A', 'Keleman K', 'Dickson BJ', 'Hafen E']","['Zoologisches Institut, Universitat Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (lilli protein, Drosophila)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Size', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*embryology/genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/cytology', 'Embryonic Development', 'Genes, Insect', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Insect Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/metabolism', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate/*cytology/embryology/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Signal Transduction', '*Transcription Factors', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 2001 Mar;128(5):791-800.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF293971'],

Despite a lack of sequence similarities around cleavage sites, most proteins are shed in response to the stimulation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters. The signal-transducing receptor subunit gp130 is not a substrate of the regulated shedding machinery. We generated several chimaeric proteins of gp130 and the proteins tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) and interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R), which are known to be subject to shedding. By exchanging small peptide sequences of gp130 for cleavage-site peptides of TNF-alpha, TGF-alpha and IL-6R we showed that these short sequences conferred susceptibility to spontaneous and phorbol-ester-induced shedding of gp130. Importantly, these chimaeric gp130 proteins were functional, as shown by the phosphorylation of gp130 and the activation of signal transduction and activators of transcription 3 ('STAT3') on stimulation with cytokine. To investigate minimal requirements for shedding, truncated cleavage-site peptides of IL-6R were inserted into gp130. The resulting chimaeras were susceptible to shedding and showed the same cleavage pattern as observed in the chimaeras containing the complete IL-6R cleavage site. Surprisingly, we could also generate cleavable chimaeras by exchanging the juxtamembrane sequence of gp130 for the corresponding region of leukaemia inhibitory factor ('LIF') receptor, a protein that like gp130 is not subject to regulated or spontaneous shedding. Thus it seems that there is no minimal consensus shedding sequence. We speculate that structural changes allow the access of the protease to a membrane-proximal region, leading to shedding of the protein.","['Althoff, K', 'Mullberg, J', 'Aasland, D', 'Voltz, N', 'Kallen, K', 'Grotzinger, J', 'Rose-John, S']","['Althoff K', 'Mullberg J', 'Aasland D', 'Voltz N', 'Kallen K', 'Grotzinger J', 'Rose-John S']","['I.

Dialysis with Ins(1,4,5)P(3) in weak Ca(2+) buffer did not activate any macroscopic I(CRAC) even after precautions had been taken to minimize the extent of Ca(2+) entry during the experiment. Following intracellular dialysis with Ins(1,4,5)P(3) for >150 s in weak buffer, external application of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) pump blocker thapsigargin activated I(CRAC), and the current developed much more quickly than when thapsigargin was applied in the absence of Ins(1,4,5)P(3). This indicates that the Ins(1,4,5)P(3) receptors had not inactivated much over this timecourse. When external Ca(2+) was replaced by Ba(2+), Ins(1,4,5)P(3) still failed to generate any detectable I(CRAC) even though Ba(2+) permeates CRAC channels and is not taken up into the intracellular Ca(2+) stores. In strong Ca(2+) buffer, I(CRAC) could be activated by muscarinic-receptor stimulation, provided protein kinase C (PKC) was blocked. In weak buffer, however, as with Ins(1,4,5)P(3), stimulation of these receptors with carbachol did not activate I(CRAC) even after inhibition of PKC. The inability of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) to activate macroscopic I(CRAC) in weak Ca(2+) buffer was not altered by inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions. Our results suggest that the inability of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) to activate I(CRAC) under conditions of weak intracellular Ca(2+) buffering is not due to strong inactivation of the Ins(1,4,5)P(3) receptors. Instead, a futile Ca(2+) cycle across the stores seems to be occurring and SERCA pumps resequester sufficient Ca(2+) to ensure that the threshold for activation of macroscopic I(CRAC) has not been exceeded.","['Bakowski, D', 'Parekh, A B']","['Bakowski D', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '24GP945V5T (Barium)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YZS2RPE8LE (Strontium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Barium/metabolism', 'Buffers', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*enzymology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/*enzymology', 'Strontium/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Feb 1;353(Pt 3):561-7. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3530561.,,['10.1042/0264-6021:3530561 [doi]'],PMC1221602,,,,,,,,,,,

We found recently that several mammalian tissues have a high capacity for NAADP synthesis, as assessed by sea urchin egg bioassay. To determine the functional significance of NAADP production by mammalian tissues, we sought to determine whether NAADP is capable of inducing calcium release from microsomes prepared from cultured cells. We found that NAADP, but not beta-NADP, activates a specific microsomal calcium release system in mesangial cells isolated from rat kidney; NAADP was without effect in renal tubular epithelial cells. NAADP-induced calcium release is not affected by inhibitors of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or ryanodine channels. However, NAADP-elicited calcium release was inhibited by L-type calcium channel blockers and by alkaline phosphatase treatment of NAADP. NAADP also promotes specific microsomal calcium release in rat vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac myocytes, fibroblasts and a human leukaemia cell line, indicating that the capacity for NAADP-induced calcium release is widespread in mammalian cells. We propose that NAADP may be an important regulator of intracellular calcium in many mammalian tissues.","['Yusufi, A N', 'Cheng, J', 'Thompson, M A', 'Chini, E N', 'Grande, J P']","['Yusufi AN', 'Cheng J', 'Thompson MA', 'Chini EN', 'Grande JP']","['Renal Pathophysiology Laboratory, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Mayo Clinic, Mayo Medical School, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['119340-53-3 (Cyclic ADP-Ribose)', '15662-33-6 (Ryanodine)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '5502-96-5 (NAADP)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic ADP-Ribose', 'Glomerular Mesangium/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/pharmacology', 'Microsomes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'NADP/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Ryanodine/metabolism']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Feb 1;353(Pt 3):531-6. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3530531.,,['10.1042/0264-6021:3530531 [doi]'],PMC1221598,,['DK16105/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The n = 6 compounds, however, have comparable IC(50) values in both cell lines. In general, the substituted compounds are less cytotoxic than their NH(3) counterparts. After incubation with equimolar concentrations, the amount of platinum bound to cellular DNA was determined. The compounds show comparable binding, except for the sterically hindered 2-picoline compounds that bind significantly less. The amounts of platinum bound to DNA do not correlate with the cytotoxicity data. As DNA is considered to be the cellular target of platinum antitumor drugs, structural details of the DNA adducts probably account for the differences in cytotoxic activity.","['Jansen, B A', 'van der Zwan, J', 'den Dulk, H', 'Brouwer, J', 'Reedijk, J']","['Jansen BA', 'van der Zwan J', 'den Dulk H', 'Brouwer J', 'Reedijk J']","['Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University, and Molecular Genetics, Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden University, P.O.

The compound presents a high and selective toxicity toward liver and skin cell cultures and is currently the subject of preclinical studies as an antitumor drug. To date, the molecular basis for its diverse biological effects remains poorly understood. To elucidate its mechanism of action, we studied its interaction with DNA and its effects on human DNA topoisomerases. Practically no interaction with DNA was detected. Peroxisomicine was found to inhibit topoisomerase II but not topoisomerase I. DNA relaxation and decatenation assays indicated that the drug interferes with the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II but does not stimulate DNA cleavage, in contrast to conventional topoisomerase poisons such as etoposide. Two human leukemia cell lines sensitive or resistant to mitoxantrone were used to assess the cytotoxicity of the toxin and its effect on the cell cycle. In both cases, peroxisomicine treatment was associated with a loss of cells from every phase of the cell cycle and was accompanied by a large increase in the sub-G1 region which is characteristic of apoptotic cells. The cell cycle changes were more pronounced with the sensitive HL-60 cells than with the resistant HL-60/MX2 cells (with reduced topoisomerase II activity), in agreement with the cytotoxicity measurements. Treatment of HL-60 cells with T-514 stimulated the cleavage of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by intracellular proteases such as caspase-3. The cytometry and Western blot analyses reveal that peroxisomicine induces apoptosis in leukemia cells. In addition, we characterized a catabolite of peroxisomicine, named T-510R, in the form of a highly stable radical metabolite. The electron spin resonance and mass spectrometry data are consistent with the formation of an anionic semiquinonic radical. The oxidized product T-510R inhibits topoisomerase II with a reduced efficiency compared to the parent toxin and was found to be about 3-4 times less toxic to both the sensitive and resistant leukemia cell lines than T-514. Collectively, the results suggest that topoisomerase II inhibition plays a role in the cytotoxicity of the plant toxin peroxisomicine. Inhibition of topoisomerase II may serve as an inducing signal triggering the apoptotic cell death of leukemia cells exposed to the toxin. The dihydroxyanthracenone unit may represent a useful chemotype for the preparation of topoisomerase II-targeted anticancer agents.","['Lansiaux, A', 'Laine, W', 'Baldeyrou, B', 'Mahieu, C', 'Wattez, N', 'Vezin, H', 'Martinez, F J', 'Pineyro, A', 'Bailly, C']","['Lansiaux A', 'Laine W', 'Baldeyrou B', 'Mahieu C', 'Wattez N', 'Vezin H', 'Martinez FJ', 'Pineyro A', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U-524 et Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, Place de Verdun, 59045 Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '110270-61-6 (Karwinskia toxin T-514)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Anthracenes/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Superhelical/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Free Radicals/metabolism/toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2001 Jan;14(1):16-24. doi: 10.1021/tx000145j.,,"['tx000145j [pii]', '10.1021/tx000145j [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether etoposide catechol and quinone metabolites can damage the MLL breakpoint cluster region in a DNA topoisomerase II-dependent manner like the parent drug and the nature of the damage. Cleavage of two DNA substrates containing the normal homologues of five MLL intron 6 translocation breakpoints was examined in vitro upon incubation with human DNA topoisomerase IIalpha, ATP, and either etoposide, etoposide catechol, or etoposide quinone. Many of the same cleavage sites were induced by etoposide and by its metabolites, but several unique sites were induced by the metabolites. There was a preference for G(-1) among the unique sites, which differs from the parent drug. Cleavage at most sites was greater and more heat-stable in the presence of the metabolites compared to etoposide. The MLL translocation breakpoints contained within the substrates were near strong and/or stable cleavage sites. The metabolites induced more cleavage than etoposide at the same sites within a 40 bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two of the translocation breakpoints, confirming the results at a subset of the sites. Cleavage assays using the same oligonucleotide substrate in which guanines at several positions were replaced with N7-deaza guanines indicated that the N7 position of guanine is important in metabolite-induced cleavage, possibly suggesting N7-guanine alkylation by etoposide quinone. Not only etoposide, but also its metabolites, enhance DNA topoisomerase II cleavage near MLL translocation breakpoints in in vitro assays. It is possible that etoposide metabolites may be relevant to translocations.","['Lovett, B D', 'Strumberg, D', 'Blair, I A', 'Pang, S', 'Burden, D A', 'Megonigal, M D', 'Rappaport, E F', 'Rebbeck, T R', 'Osheroff, N', 'Pommier, Y G', 'Felix, C A']","['Lovett BD', 'Strumberg D', 'Blair IA', 'Pang S', 'Burden DA', 'Megonigal MD', 'Rappaport EF', 'Rebbeck TR', 'Osheroff N', 'Pommier YG', 'Felix CA']","[""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Catechols)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Catechols/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects', 'Etoposide/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Introns/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oligonucleotides/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Quinones/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*drug effects']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2001 Feb 6;40(5):1159-70. doi: 10.1021/bi002361x.,,"['bi002361x [pii]', '10.1021/bi002361x [doi]']",,,"['CA66140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80175 , +/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

These include PDGFRB, JAK2, NTRK3, ABL2, and ABL1, each of which encodes for proteins with tyrosine kinase activity. To date, ETV6/ABL1 transcripts have been detected in only four patients with a leukemic disorder. Here, we describe one adult with chronic myeloid leukemia and a child with T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia with ETV6/ABL1. Molecular cytogenetic analysis confirmed that formation of an ETV6/ABL1 fusion in these patients required at least three chromosomal breaks and showed that each of these translocations is the result of a complex chromosomal rearrangement. Molecular analysis showed the presence of two fusion transcripts in both patients as the result of alternative splicing, questioning the suggested role of these transcripts in the lineage specificity.

No additional abnormalities were detected by G-band and multicolor, using combined binary ratio labeling, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses, indicating that the i(7p) was the sole, i.e., the primary, chromosomal aberration. Although the patients were elderly--68, 72, and 78 years old--they all responded very well to chemotherapy, achieving complete remission lasting more than a year. Further FISH analyses, using painting, centromeric, as well as 7q11.2-specific YAC probes, revealed that the i(7p) contained two centromeres and that the breakpoints were located in 7q11.2. Thus, the abnormality should formally be designated idic(7)(q11.2). The detailed mapping disclosed a breakpoint heterogeneity, with the breaks in 7q11.2 varying among the cases, being at least 1,310 kb apart. Furthermore, the breakpoints also differed within one of the cases, being located on both the proximal and the distal side of the most centromeric probe used. Based on our three patients, as well as on a previously reported 82-year-old patient with AML M2 and idic(7)(q11) as the only chromosomal change, we suggest that this abnormality, as the sole anomaly, is associated with AML in elderly patients who display a good response to induction chemotherapy and, hence, have a favorable prognosis. Furthermore, the heterogeneous breakpoints in 7q11.2 suggest that the important functional outcome of the idic(7)(q11.2) is the genomic imbalance incurred, i.e., gain of 7p and loss of 7q material, rather than a rearrangement of a specific gene.","['Johansson, B', 'Axelsson, P', 'Billstrom, R', 'Strombeck, B', 'Arheden, K', 'Olofsson, T', 'Cervin, A', 'Adriansson, M', 'Tanke, H J', 'Mitelman, F', 'Fioretos, T']","['Johansson B', 'Axelsson P', 'Billstrom R', 'Strombeck B', 'Arheden K', 'Olofsson T', 'Cervin A', 'Adriansson M', 'Tanke HJ', 'Mitelman F', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden. bertil.johansson@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'LAI regimen']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*genetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Isochromosomes/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Mar;30(3):261-6. doi: 10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1087>3.0.co;2-a.,,"['10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::AID-GCC1087>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]', '10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1087>3.0.co;2-a [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,

[1991]: Lancet 337:1187-1189). An extension of this study (Cole J et al. [lsqb[1996]: Radiat Res 145:61-69) and two independent studies (Albering HJ et al. [1992[: Lancet 340:739; Albering HJ et al. [1994[: Lancet 344:750-751) found that hprt mutant frequency was not correlated with domestic radon exposure, and two well-designed epidemiologic studies showed no evidence of a relation between radon exposure and leukemia in children or adults. In this report, we present additional data from a study of Colorado high school students showing no correlation between domestic radon exposure and hprt mutant frequency. We use reanalyses of previous studies of radon and hprt mutant frequency to identify problems with this assay as a biomarker for domestic radon exposure and to illustrate difficulties in interpreting the statistical data. We also show with analyses of combined data sets that there is no support for the hypothesis that domestic radon exposure elevates hprt mutant frequency. Taken together, the scientific evidence provides a useful example of the problems associated with analyzing and interpreting data that link environmental exposures, biomarkers, and diseases in epidemiologic studies.","['Ruttenber, A J', 'Harrison, L T', 'Baron, A', 'McClure, D', 'Glanz, J', 'Quillin, R', ""O'Neill, J P"", 'Sullivan, L', 'Campbell, J', 'Nicklas, J A']","['Ruttenber AJ', 'Harrison LT', 'Baron A', 'McClure D', 'Glanz J', 'Quillin R', ""O'Neill JP"", 'Sullivan L', 'Campbell J', 'Nicklas JA']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and Biometrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, 4200 E.

Six studies of wire codes and childhood leukemia in North America were examined, three of which reported positive associations and all of which found some relation between wire codes and measured magnetic fields. Supporting magnetic fields as the basis for the wire code associations are the correspondence between those wire code levels which predict distinct magnetic fields and those which predict leukemia risk in the positive studies. Geographic locations and methods that refine wire codes as magnetic fields predictors also tend to strengthen the association with leukemia. Opposing arguments are based on the failure of the wire code-magnetic field association to predict the strength of association across studies, including the unexplained lack of association between wire codes and leukemia in the Midwest and in Canada. Alternatives to magnetic fields are less supported; residential mobility, social class, and neighborhood characteristics are unlikely to explain a wire code effect. Ambiguity persists because of the modest strength of the wire code-leukemia association, the complexity of the relation between wire codes and magnetic fields, lack of knowledge of risk factors for childhood leukemia, and the limited evaluation of wire code correlates other than magnetic fields.","['Savitz, D A', 'Poole, C']","['Savitz DA', 'Poole C']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599, USA. david_savitz@unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,"['Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Factors', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Class', 'United States/epidemiology']",39,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2001;Suppl 5:S69-85. doi: 10.1002/1521-186x(2001)22:5+<::aid-bem1025>3.0.co;2-6.,,"['10.1002/1521-186X(2001)22:5+<::AID-BEM1025>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/1521-186x(2001)22:5+<::aid-bem1025>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,

Proximity to high traffic density, as defined by major roadways or automobile counts, and associated socioeconomic neighborhood characteristics have been suggested as potentially important confounders. For traffic or socioeconomic status (SES) to confound any EMF effect these factors would need to have their own independent impact on leukemia risk. This study was designed to use geographic information system (GIS) technology to empirically examine the relationship between traffic density and socioeconomic indicators to early childhood leukemia in an urban area of California. Ninety cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed under the age of five between 1988 and 1994 among children born in San Diego County were matched by gender and birth date to a total of 349 children also born in the county and not known to have developed any cancer. Case-control differences were assessed via conditional logistic regression. No significant differences were observed for the neighborhood median family income of the birth residences. When comparing neighborhoods with median annual income > or = $56,000 to those with incomes < or = $18,000 the odds ratio was 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.31, 2.38). Traffic density was measured using a variety of methods, including information on average daily traffic counts and road characteristics. None of the measures of traffic were associated with case status. Neither SES or traffic density near the birth address as assessed with GIS methods are strong enough risk factors for leukemia to be confounders which could totally explain the effect of another variable (such as wire code). Associations with the diagnosis address or with more direct exposure measures may differ from those reported here.","['Reynolds, P', 'Elkin, E', 'Scalf, R', 'Von Behren, J', 'Neutra, R R']","['Reynolds P', 'Elkin E', 'Scalf R', 'Von Behren J', 'Neutra RR']","['California Department of Health Services, Environmental Health Investigations Branch, Oakland 94612, USA. preynold@dhs.ca.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,['0 (Vehicle Emissions)'],IM,"['California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pilot Projects', 'Risk Factors', 'Vehicle Emissions/*adverse effects']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2001;Suppl 5:S58-68. doi: 10.1002/1521-186x(2001)22:5+<::aid-bem1024>3.3.co;2-0.,,"['10.1002/1521-186X(2001)22:5+<::AID-BEM1024>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/1521-186x(2001)22:5+<::aid-bem1024>3.3.co;2-0 [doi]']",,,['1R01CA71745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,

These concepts are quantified and we use these results to characterize potential factors that might explain the wire code-childhood leukemia association. We then re-evaluate findings from a survey of correlates of wire code in Connecticut with respect to potential for explaining the wire code-leukemia association. Under the presumption that the Connecticut correlations apply to the populations in which a wire code-leukemia association has been observed, only age and type of home are correlated enough to be potential explanatory factors. In particular, it appears very unlikely that traffic density can explain a significant portion of the wire code association. We suggest that correlation studies can be useful for identifying potential explanatory factors, but they must be done in regions where a wire code-childhood leukemia association has been observed.","['Langholz, B']",['Langholz B'],"['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90089-9011, USA. langholz@hsc.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,"['Biometry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Connecticut/epidemiology', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Factors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2001;Suppl 5:S19-31. doi: 10.1002/1521-186x(2001)22:5+<::aid-bem1021>3.3.co;2-9.,,"['10.1002/1521-186X(2001)22:5+<::AID-BEM1021>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/1521-186x(2001)22:5+<::aid-bem1021>3.3.co;2-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,

Caspase-3 activation was detected by Western blot and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining of cells. RESULTS: Fas expression was not reduced in either the MRP- or P-glycoprotein-expressing drug-resistant cell lines, although expression was reduced by 15% in one low-level drug-resistant subline.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling cell proliferation and developing therapeutic strategies to correct nonfunctional regulatory mechanisms are emerging areas of medical research. Ceramide, a metabolite of membrane sphingomyelin hydrolysis, has recently emerged as a key regulator of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in leukaemia cells. METHODS: Leukaemia cell lines were treated with a biologically active analogue of ceramide, C(2)-ceramide. Cell cycle status was assessed flow cytometrically using propidium iodide. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V staining of externalised phosphatidylserine and retinoblastoma activation was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: C(2)-ceramide induced activation of retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein, G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis in leukaemia cell lines. In addition, these effects differed depending upon cell type, thus confirming the pleiotropic nature of the ceramide signalling pathway. Most cells studied responded to exogenous C(2)-ceramide by entering growth arrest, evidently resulting from activation of retinoblastoma protein, and by displaying some degree of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that signalling via ceramide has novel therapeutic applications for treatment of leukaemia.","['Connor, C E', 'Burrows, J', 'Hearps, A C', 'Woods, G M', 'Lowenthal, R M', 'Ragg, S J']","['Connor CE', 'Burrows J', 'Hearps AC', 'Woods GM', 'Lowenthal RM', 'Ragg SJ']","['Division of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'G1 Phase', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Phosphorylation', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,2001/02/15 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/15 11:00'],"['2001/02/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2001 Mar 1;43(3):164-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0320(20010301)43:3<164::aid-cyto1044>3.0.co;2-o.,,"['10.1002/1097-0320(20010301)43:3<164::AID-CYTO1044>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0320(20010301)43:3<164::aid-cyto1044>3.0.co;2-o [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,

Smears showed histiocytic granulomatous inflammation, foamy macrophages, and acute inflammatory exudate. Scattered foamy macrophages displayed intracellular coccobacilli identifiable on Diff-Quik stain. A few cells with changes suggestive of viral inclusions were identified. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunostain was positive in the cell block sections. Lung cultures grew R. equi.

However, the accurate diagnosis and classification of low- and intermediate-grade B-cell lymphomas with a predominant small-cell population still present a diagnostic challenge. In this study, we reviewed the cytology and immunophenotype of 56 cases of low- and intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas composed of predominantly small cells, with histologic correlation in all cases. These cases consisted of 23 small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL), 15 follicular center lymphomas (FCL), grade I (small cell predominant), 8 lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas (LPL), 6 mantle-cell lymphomas (MCL), and 4 marginal zone lymphomas (MZL) including mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Histologic comparison was available in all cases. A cytologic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was made in 46 (82%) cases. Based on cytomorphology and immunophenotyping of cytologic material, 39 (85%) cases were correctly classified using the Revised European and American Lymphoma classification. In 7 (11%) cases, which included 3 FCLs, 2 MALT lymphomas, and 2 SLLs, the findings were atypical but not diagnostic of lymphoma. There were 3 (5%) false-negative cases. They were 2 SLLs and a FCL. Immunophenotyping done in 4 ""atypical"" cases was noncontributory. No marker studies were done in the remaining ""atypical"" case and all false-negative cases. We conclude that cytology, when used in conjunction with immunophenotyping, can accurately diagnose and in most instances subclassify low- and intermediate-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with a predominant small-cell population.","['Chhieng, D C', 'Cohen, J M', 'Cangiarella, J F']","['Chhieng DC', 'Cohen JM', 'Cangiarella JF']","['Department of Pathology, KB 526, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 619 19 St. S., Birmingham, AL 35249-6823, USA. dchhieng@path.uab.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/classification/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/classification/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/classification/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2001 Feb;24(2):90-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0339(200102)24:2<90::aid-dc1017>3.0.co;2-j.,,"['10.1002/1097-0339(200102)24:2<90::AID-DC1017>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0339(200102)24:2<90::aid-dc1017>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,

In human myeloblastoid leukemia HL60 cells rapid (ca. 15 min) but transient activation of ERK1/2 has been reported following induction of macrophage/monocyte differentiation by phorbol esters, or by very high (10(-6) M) concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D3), while retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation was accompanied by sustained activation of ERK1/2. We report here that monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells induced by moderate (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) concentrations of 1,25D3 could be divided into at least two stages. In the first phase, which lasts 24-48 h, the cells continued in the normal cell cycle while expressing markers of monocytic phenotype, such as CD14. In the next phase the onset of G1 cell cycle block became apparent and expression of CD11b was prominent, indicating a more mature myeloid phenotype. The first phase was characterized by high levels of ERKs activated by phosphorylation, and these decreased as the cells entered the second phase, while the levels of p27/Kip1 increased at that time. Serum-starved or PD98059-treated HL60 cells had reduced growth rate and slower differentiation, but the G1 block also coincided with decreased levels of activated ERK1/2. The data suggest that the MEK/ERK pathway maintains cell proliferation during 1,25D3-induced monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells, but that ERK1/2 activity becomes suppressed during the later stages of differentiation, and the consequent G1 block leads to ""terminal"" differentiation.","['Wang, X', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Wang X', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2001;80(4):471-82. doi: 10.1002/1097-4644(20010315)80:4<471::aid-jcb1001>3.0.co;2-j.,,"['10.1002/1097-4644(20010315)80:4<471::AID-JCB1001>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/1097-4644(20010315)80:4<471::aid-jcb1001>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']",,,['R01-CA-44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,

We used special methodology to handle the unusual problems that arise in power simulations when the tests under study are permutation tests. Different conditions yielded different interaction tests as the best performers. Although one test gave comparatively good power under almost all conditions, some of the other tests also appear to be useful. For the sample sizes and configurations in the simulations, power is generally low; thus it may not be possible to detect interaction reliably when it exists, a finding in agreement with the known low power for interaction tests in general.","['Potthoff, R F', 'Peterson, B L', 'George, S L']","['Potthoff RF', 'Peterson BL', 'George SL']","['Cancer Center Biostatistics, Duke University Medical Center, P.O.

The aims of the current study were to immunoselect, genetically mark, and determine the fate of fibroblastic progenitor cells in vivo. A monoclonal antibody, HOP-26, which has high reactivity with a cell surface antigen present on human osteoprogenitors in bone marrow fibroblast populations, was used to select these cells by immunopanning. Following culture in 10% FCS in alphaMEM containing ascorbate-2-phosphate and dexamethasone the amplified cells expressed the osteoblast phenotype as determined by expression of osteocalcin protein determined immunohistochemically, and Type I collagen and osteocalcin mRNA expressions determined by RT-PCR analysis. The selected cells were genetically labeled using a murine leukemia virus (MuLV) encoding a reporter gene (lacZ) with a selective marker gene (neo(r)) using a triple transient transfection protocol. Transfected cells were implanted in CB17 scid/scid mice by local subcutaneous injection over the calvariae. Localization of the genetically marked cells within the calvarial tissues was detected by beta-galactosidase histochemistry and immunocytochemistry. Genetically marked cells were observed within the periosteal layer in close association with the osteoblast layer, covering mineralized bone surfaces and within bone osteoid at 5 and 7 days after injection. This study demonstrates the successful selection, expansion, and retroviral-marking of human osteoprogenitors and their migration and localization within calvariae of SCID mice following in vivo implantation. These basic studies indicate the migration of these cells to skeletal sites and support possibilities for future uses of human osteoprogenitors in therapy of bone deficiency diseases and the potential for development of gene therapy procedures in these conditions.","['Oreffo, R O', 'Virdi, A S', 'Triffitt, J T']","['Oreffo RO', 'Virdi AS', 'Triffitt JT']","['Bone Research Laboratory, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis', 'Collagen/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/physiology', 'Osteocalcin/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Skull', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*physiology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2001 Feb;186(2):201-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-4652(200102)186:2<201::AID-JCP1021>3.0.CO;2-B.,,"['10.1002/1097-4652(200102)186:2<201::AID-JCP1021>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/1097-4652(200102)186:2<201::AID-JCP1021>3.0.CO;2-B [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,

Although both of these pathways are initiated by an increased activity of Lyn kinase, the exact mechanism by which Lyn kinase interacts with aggregated FcepsilonRI and Thy-1 is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that pretreatment of RBL cells with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD) resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cellular cholesterol, increased detergent solubilization of Thy-1 and Lyn kinase, and a transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins. Acute lowering of cholesterol suppressed the activation through Thy-1, as determined by tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk kinase and some other proteins, and modulation of free cytoplasmic calcium. In contrast, the FcepsilonRI-mediated activation events were more resistant. Thy-1 and FcepsilonRI in MBCD-pretreated cells also differed in the extent of aggregation after cross-linking: Thy-1 formed large caps, whereas FcepsilonRI accumulated in small patches. MBCD treatment induced an increased release of secretory components in both Thy-1- and FcepsilonRI-activated cells. The combined data indicate that cholesterol depletion does not merely block receptor signaling but has more complex consequences.","['Surviladze, Z', 'Draberova, L', 'Kovarova, M', 'Boubelik, M', 'Draber, P']","['Surviladze Z', 'Draberova L', 'Kovarova M', 'Boubelik M', 'Draber P']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Cyclodextrins/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Glycosphingolipids/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Thy-1 Antigens/*physiology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', '*beta-Cyclodextrins', 'src-Family Kinases']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2001 Jan;31(1):1-10. doi: 10.1002/1521-4141(200101)31:1<1::AID-IMMU1>3.0.CO;2-W.,,['10.1002/1521-4141(200101)31:1<1::AID-IMMU1>3.0.CO;2-W [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was carried out to study the feasibility of the ex vivo expansion of gamma delta T cells from healthy individuals, and to determine their functional capacity against tumours. We selectively expanded the peripheral gamma delta T cells of five donors against a myeloma cell line, XG-7. Under optimal conditions, the resulting bulk cultures comprised about 82% of the gamma delta T cells, more than 90% of which showed the T-cell receptor (TCR)-V gamma 9 delta 2 rearrangement. These gamma delta T-cell cultures exhibited TCR-gamma delta dependent cytotoxicity against different tumour cell lines including Molt-4, BJAB, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoid cell lines (LCL), and the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines, CNE2 and 915, in addition to the stimulator XG-7. By competitive cytotoxicity assays, the gamma delta T cells demonstrated recognition of at least three distinct target specificities expressed by Molt-4, CNE2 and LCL, respectively, which were related to that expressed by the stimulator XG-7 cells. The recognition of the specificity expressed by XG-7 and Molt-4 was further shown to require the participation of heat shock protein (HSP). The specificity expressed by CNE2 and 915 was preferentially recognized by the CD56 subset of gamma delta T cells, which could be sustained in the presence of interleukin (IL)-7. These results suggested that gamma delta T-cell immunity against tumour cell lines may be acquired in response to other types of tissue injury and, hence, implicates a role for their use in the prevention and treatment of tumours.","['Zheng, B', 'Lam, C', 'Im, S', 'Huang, J', 'Luk, W', 'Lau, S Y', 'Yau, K K', 'Wong, C', 'Yao, K', 'Ng, M H']","['Zheng B', 'Lam C', 'Im S', 'Huang J', 'Luk W', 'Lau SY', 'Yau KK', 'Wong C', 'Yao K', 'Ng MH']","['Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Carcinoma/immunology/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Synergism', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/pathology', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2001 Jan;53(1):40-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3083.2001.00827.x.,,"['sji827 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-3083.2001.00827.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In its severe form, the portal vein is used as an outflow tract for the arterial hepatic perfusion. A portosystemic side-to-side shunt, e.g. a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, may facilitate portal outflow thus increasing hepatic (i.e. arterial) perfusion. METHODS: The effect of a transjugular shunt on liver function and blood flow was studied in three patients receiving shunt treatment 0-2 days after the diagnosis of severe veno-occlusive disease occurring 28, 20, and 17 days after allogeneic transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively. RESULTS: The transjugular shunt reduced the portosystemic pressure gradient from 23 to 8, 18 to 5, and 33 to 13 mmHg in patients 1, 2, and 3, respectively, increased the stagnant portal vein flow to normal, and decreased the arterial resistive index, indicating an increase in the arterial perfusion of the liver. This was accompanied by rapid relief from abdominal pain and removal of ascites. The AST concentration dropped from 1230, 417, and 2930 U/l before to 93, 20, and 41 U/l and the PT-time ratio improved 3-7 days after shunt treatment while the bilirubin concentration continued to rise until the patients died 26, 42, and 33 days after transplantation from multiorgan failure (two patients) or intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The transjugular shunt may have improved abdominal and hepatic perfusion and prevented further necrosis of hepatocytes. It did not, however, affect jaundice or survival, which was limited by extrahepatic complications.","['Zenz, T', 'Rossle, M', 'Bertz, H', 'Siegerstetter, V', 'Ochs, A', 'Finke, J']","['Zenz T', 'Rossle M', 'Bertz H', 'Siegerstetter V', 'Ochs A', 'Finke J']","['Department of Haematology & Oncology, University of Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Liver,Liver,8200939,"['EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hemodynamics', 'Hepatic Veins/physiology', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/blood/*etiology/pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Liver/blood supply/pathology/physiology', 'Liver Circulation/physiology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Liver. 2001 Feb;21(1):31-6. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0676.2001.210105.x.,,"['liv210105 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0676.2001.210105.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Apart from those cases demonstrating concomitant leukemic infiltrates, it has been surmised that SS is a reactive phenomenon induced by a specific cytokine milieu. METHODS: The authors present a patient with CD34+ acute myelogenous leukemia (AAML) who developed SS in the setting granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) therapy. Routine light microscopy and molecular studies were carried on the patient's skin biopsy specimen and post-treatment marrow. An X inactivation assay for clonality was employed. RESULTS: Routine light microscopic examination revealed differentiated myeloid precursors including myelocytes and metamyelocytes within the subcutis; myeloblasts were not identified. In addition, in the overlying skin, features typical of SS were observed. The neutrophils demonstrated dysplastic features including hypolobation compatible with a Pseudo Pelger-Huet anomaly. X inactivation studies showed clonality both within her post-treatment marrow and skin biopsy specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Sweet's syndrome developing in CD34+ AML patients following GCSF therapy likely reflects therapy induced differentiation of sequestered leukemic cells, hence indicative of a clonal neutrophilic dermatosis.","['Magro, C M', 'De Moraes, E', 'Burns, F']","['Magro CM', 'De Moraes E', 'Burns F']","['Department of Pathology, The Ohio State Hospital, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin/pathology', 'Sweet Syndrome/*etiology/genetics/pathology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2001 Feb;28(2):90-6. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0560.2001.280205.x.,,"['cup280205 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0560.2001.280205.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The variable and sometimes low response rate to rHuEpo treatment raises the question whether the existence of autoantibodies against erythropoietin (epo) is partially responsible. In the present study we investigated the presence of anti-epo autoantibodies in MDS patients. METHODS: Forty-three patients with MDS were studied. Sixteen patients had refractory anemia (RA), 13 had RA with ringed sideroblasts, 3 had RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), 9 had RAEB in transformation and 2 patients had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. They were divided in 3 groups according to rHuEpo treatment. Group A consisted of 10 patients who did not receive rHuEpo treatment. Group B included 13 patients who were on rHuEpo treatment (150 IU/kg subcutaneously, 3 times weekly) showing an increase of hemoglobin (Hb) values or reduction of transfusion requirements and Group C consisted of 20 patients who did not respond or stopped responding to rHuEpo treatment. Laboratory studies consisted of a complete blood cell count, measurement of serum epo and determination of anti-epo antibodies using ELISA. RESULTS: There were no significant differences with regard to age and sex among the three groups. No autoantibodies against epo were found in the examined sera, apart from a female patient from group A who showed a low positive titer. CONCLUSION: We suggest that anti-epo autoantibodies do not contribute to the development of MDS-related anemia and are not responsible for the modest response to rHuEpo treatment. Further investigation is needed to identify possible reasons for the low response rate to rHuEpo treatment.","['Voulgari, P V', 'Hatzimichael, E C', 'Tsiara, S', 'Tzallas, C', 'Drosos, A A', 'Bourantas, K L']","['Voulgari PV', 'Hatzimichael EC', 'Tsiara S', 'Tzallas C', 'Drosos AA', 'Bourantas KL']","['Rheumatology Clinic, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/blood/drug therapy/immunology/therapy', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/drug therapy/immunology/therapy', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Autoantibodies/*blood/immunology', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Erythropoietin/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/*blood/immunology', 'Isoantigens/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/drug therapy/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/drug therapy/*immunology/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Jan;66(1):31-6. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00336.x.,,"['ejh336 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00336.x [doi]']",,,,['Eur J Haematol. 2002 Sep;69(3):189-90.

Recently, we unexpectedly noted foci of hypoplasia and aplasia in routine follow-up bone marrow biopsies of several hairy cell leukemia patients in remission with normal blood counts. Because of this finding we examined all available biopsies to assess the incidence of this phenomenon. A total of 94 biopsies in 31 patients were reviewed. Of these, 23 were prior to 2-CDA therapy and 71 (in 30 patients) were obtained 2-76 (mean 22) months following one or more courses of treatment. Nine patients had also received prior interferon and 7 (of whom 3 had also received interferon) had undergone splenectomy. Hypocellular foci were found in only 3 (13%) of the pre-therapy biopsies. Forty-seven of the 71 post-therapy biopsies (in 23 patients) (66%) had a total of 176 hypocellular foci. Of these 47 biopsies, 39 were without evidence of disease. A simultaneous complete blood count was normal in 34 of the 47 hypoplastic biopsies (72%). This suggests that these hypoplastic areas may not be representative of the entire bone marrow and that normal hematopoiesis may take place at other sites. However, since the longest follow-up is less than 7 yr, the potential long-term significance of these findings, such as progressive bone marrow aplasia or dysplasia, may still be unrecognised.","['Gillis, S', 'Amir, G', 'Bennett, M', 'Polliack, A']","['Gillis S', 'Amir G', 'Bennett M', 'Polliack A']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Ein Kerem, Jerusalem, Israel. sgillis@md2.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cladribine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Splenectomy']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Jan;66(1):7-10. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00308.x.,,"['ejh308 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00308.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Image-DNA cytometry (ICM) was used to assess DNA index (DI), and Southern hybridisation was carried out to detect deletions of the Ink4-locus in the leukaemic cells. A DNA content equal to or exceeding 1.16, indicating hyperdiploidy, was detected in 21/72 patients (29%), 1/72 (1.3%) showed DNA-hypodiploidy, and the remaining 50 patients (69%) had a DI within normal limits. Bi-allelic deletion of at least two of the coding sequences from the Ink4 locus was observed in 23/70 (33%) patients. Mono-allelic deletions within the locus were observed in 10/70 patients (14%), and 37/70 patients (53%) had normal signals for both sequences. Out of the 70 patients that could be analysed by both techniques only two had the combination of DNA hyperdiploidy and Ink4-locus bi-allelic deletion (p = 0.004). DNA hyperdiploidy was not associated with any specific clinical characteristics, but there was a trend for a better prognosis for patients with DNA hyperdiploidy (p = 0.09). Ink4-locus deletion was associated with T-cell phenotype and higher white blood cell counts at diagnosis and poor prognosis (p = 0.0015). Multivariate analysis confirmed that Ink4-locus deletion is an independent prognostic marker and a stronger determinant of outcome than DNA ploidy. When DNA ploidy and Ink4-locus deletions were combined, novel subgroups with significantly different outcome could be observed. A group with DNA index > or = 1.16 and no Ink4-locus bi-allelic deletions had an excellent prognosis (p-EFS 0.93 at 60 months), patients with Ink4-locus bi-allelic deletion and a DNA index < 1.16 fared worst (p-EFS 0.57) and patients with no Ink4 deletions and without hyperdiploidy had an intermediate outcome (p-EFS 0.79). The reason for the inverse correlation between DNA ploidy and Ink4 deletion and their combined impact on prognosis remains unclear, and possible reasons are discussed.","['Moreno, T C', 'Widell, S', 'Czader, M', 'Grander, D', 'Soderhall, S', 'Gustafsson, G', 'Einhorn, S', 'Porwit, A', 'Heyman, M']","['Moreno TC', 'Widell S', 'Czader M', 'Grander D', 'Soderhall S', 'Gustafsson G', 'Einhorn S', 'Porwit A', 'Heyman M']","['Radiumhemmet Research Laboratory, Cancer Centre Karolinska, Karolinska Hospital and Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Diploidy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', '*Genes, cdc', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multigene Family/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/14 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2000 Dec;65(6):390-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.065006390.x.,,"['ejh0o296 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.065006390.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

An approximately 25-fold selectivity towards leukemic vs. normal lymphocytes was demonstrated. Cells from patients having a mature subtype (CLL or CLL/mix) or a slowly progressing form of CLL were significantly more sensitive to vincristine in vitro than the cases with a CLL/PL phenotype or faster-progressing disease. Depending on the vincristine dose, the number of dead CLL cells accumulated slowly during the 4-d observation period. Our data indicate a marked individual variation in vincristine susceptibility among individual CLL cells. Vincristine induced annexin positivity, nuclear blebbing and DNA fragmentation in CLL cells. These indicate an ""apoptosis-like"" cell death. Since CLL cells are in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, the only known mode of anticancer action of vinca alkaloids, i.e. anti-mitotic action, cannot explain the death of CLL cells. Furthermore, similar cellular uptake and efflux of vincristine by normal and CLL cells excluded pharmacokinetic differences as a cause of selectivity of vincristine towards leukemic lymphocytes. Immunostaining of filamentous structures of CLL cells revealed that vincristine brings about selective changes in alpha-tubulin but not in beta-actin or vimentin. Although the antitubulin action of vinca alkaloids in the biochemical sense is well demonstrated, this kind of anticancer effect has not previously been shown. Vincristine is used in several regimens for CLL, but its efficacy in CLL has never been demonstrated in a clinical context and its value in routine CLL chemotherapy has been questioned. The present data strongly support the need for further evaluation of the role and mode of action of vincristine in chemotherapy of CLL and other cancers as well.","['Vilpo, J A', 'Koski, T', 'Vilpo, L M']","['Vilpo JA', 'Koski T', 'Vilpo LM']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Tampere University Hospital and Tampere University Medical School, Finland. juhani.vilpo@tays.fi']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leucine/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2000 Dec;65(6):370-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.065006370.x.,,"['ejh90238 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.065006370.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrate that IFN-alpha potently upregulates Mcl-1 on both myeloma cell lines and purified native myeloma cells. Of note, this upregulation is not due to an induction of an IL-6 autocrine loop. Furthermore, we showed that IL-6 and IFN-alpha had no additive effect on Mcl-1 upregulation, suggesting that both cytokines act through a common mechanism. Finally, the analysis of signalling transduction pathways strongly suggests that Mcl-1 upregulation induced by IFN-alpha depends on STAT3 activation.

The amount of bcl-2 protein was reduced during apoptosis, evidenced using quantitative flow cytometry. As early as 1 h post-HCQ treatment, a reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured by 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide. Interestingly, the HCQ effect was not affected by exposure to interleukin-4 or co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells. Our observations suggest that HCQ may offer a new therapeutic tool in the treatment of B-CLL patients.","['Lagneaux, L', 'Delforge, A', 'Carlier, S', 'Massy, M', 'Bernier, M', 'Bron, D']","['Lagneaux L', 'Delforge A', 'Carlier S', 'Massy M', 'Bernier M', 'Bron D']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Experimentale, Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium. laurence.lagneaux@bordet.be""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '4QWG6N8QKH (Hydroxychloroquine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxychloroquine/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Feb;112(2):344-52. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02553.x.,,"['bjh2553 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02553.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the quality of these results, the Dutch Foundation for Immunophenotyping of Haematological Malignancies (SIHON) initiated external quality rounds in 1986. Over a period of more than 10 years, this has led to improvements in the interpretation of immunophenotyping results. However, the evaluation of results focused mainly on the correctness of the interpretation of the immunophenotypical data, leaving the preceding analytical phases unevaluated. Therefore, in 1996 SIHON developed a more comprehensive scoring system, called SIHONSCORE, covering all three phases of immunophenotyping, namely the pre-analytical (i.e. choice of the staining panels), analytical (i.e. the technical part consisting of sample preparation, data acquisition and analysis) and the post-analytical phase (i.e. the interpretation) of the laboratory process. Here, we report how SIHONSCORE was successfully applied to three consecutive external quality rounds consisting of a total of nine different cases tested. For laboratory certification, participation in external quality control programmes is required. Evidently, criteria are needed to define the minimum acceptable performance of a certified laboratory. With SIHONSCORE, a useful instrument is obtained evaluating all phases of the performance of laboratories in leukaemia and lymphoma immunophenotyping.","['Kluin-Nelemans, J', 'Van Wering, E', 'Van Der Schoot, C', 'Adriaansen, H', ""Van'T Veer, M"", 'Van Dongen, J', 'Gratama, J']","['Kluin-Nelemans J', 'Van Wering E', 'Van Der Schoot C', 'Adriaansen H', ""Van'T Veer M"", 'Van Dongen J', 'Gratama J']","['Department of Haematology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden. j.c.kluin-nelemans@int.azg.nl']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*standards', 'Immunophenotyping/*standards', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Quality Control']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Feb;112(2):337-43. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02500.x.,,"['bjh2500 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02500.x [doi]']",,,,,"['Dutch Co-operative Study Group on Immunophenotyping of Haematological', 'Malignancies (SIHON)']",,,,,,,

The CrkL adaptor protein interacts directly with the BCR-ABL fusion protein that causes the malignant transformation and is constitutively phosphorylated in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. In the present study, we provide evidence that CrkL was engaged in IFNalpha-signalling in the CML-derived KT-1 cell line, which expresses BCR-ABL and is sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of IFNalpha. CrkL is constitutively associated with BCR-ABL in these cells and treatment with IFNalpha had no effect on the BCR-ABL/CrkL interaction. After IFNalpha stimulation, CrkL associated with Stat5, which also underwent phosphorylation in an IFNalpha-dependent manner. The interaction of CrkL with Stat5 was facilitated by the function of both the SH2 and the N-terminus SH3 domains of CrkL. The resulting CrkL-Stat5 complex translocated to the nucleus and could be detected in gel shift assays using elements derived from either the beta-casein promoter or the promoter of the PML gene, an IFNalpha-inducible gene that mediates growth inhibitory responses. In addition to its interaction with Stat5, CrkL interacts with C3G in KT-1 cells and such an interaction regulates the downstream activation of the small GTPase Rap1, which also mediates inhibition of cell proliferation. Thus, despite its engagement by BCR-ABL in CML-derived cells, CrkL mediates activation of downstream signalling pathways in response to the activated type I IFN receptor and such signals may contribute to the generation of the anti-proliferative effects of IFNalpha in CML.","['Grumbach, I M', 'Mayer, I A', 'Uddin, S', 'Lekmine, F', 'Majchrzak, B', 'Yamauchi, H', 'Fujita, S', 'Druker, B', 'Fish, E N', 'Platanias, L C']","['Grumbach IM', 'Mayer IA', 'Uddin S', 'Lekmine F', 'Majchrzak B', 'Yamauchi H', 'Fujita S', 'Druker B', 'Fish EN', 'Platanias LC']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, The University of Illinois at Chicago and West Side VA Hospital, Chicago, IL 60607-7173, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interferon-alpha/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', '*Milk Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Feb;112(2):327-36. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02556.x.,,"['bjh2556 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02556.x [doi]']",,,"['CA73381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We assessed the possibility of differentiation-inducing therapy for acute leukaemias with chromosomal translocations involving 11q23. Among the cell lines with MLL translocations that we examined, KOCL48 and KOPN-1 cells were induced to differentiate into granulocytes by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or into monocytes by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3). These cells expressed p16 mRNA before treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), an inhibitor of DNA methylation. On the other hand, differentiation was not induced in SN-1, KOCL33, KOCL51 or KOCL44 cells by ATRA or VD3, and these cells did not express mRNA of this gene. However, these cells were effectively induced to differentiate by ATRA or VD3 in the presence of 5-AZA, and concomitantly exhibited p16 gene expression, suggesting an association between DNA demethylation and restoration of sensitivity to differentiation-inducing activity of ATRA or VD3 in leukaemia cells with MLL abnormalities. Based on these findings, combined treatment with ATRA or VD3 plus 5-AZA may be clinically useful in therapy for acute leukaemia with MLL abnormalities.","['Niitsu, N', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Sugita, K', 'Honma, Y']","['Niitsu N', 'Hayashi Y', 'Sugita K', 'Honma Y']","['Saitama Cancer Centre Research Institute, Ina-machi, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Calcitriol/administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Feb;112(2):315-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02523.x.,,"['bjh2523 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02523.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study presents the results of the calcein tests obtained in two large haematological centres in Hungary. Assays were performed with blast cells of 93 de novo acute leukaemia patients, including 65 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Results were expressed as multidrug resistance activity factor (MAF) values. AML patients were divided into responders and non-responders and MAF values were calculated for each group. In both centres, responder patients displayed significantly lower MAF values than non-responders (P = 0.0045 and P = 0.0454). Cut-off values were established between the MAFR + SEM and MAFNR - SEM values. On the basis of these cut-off levels, multidrug resistance (MDR) negativity showed a 72% predictive value for the response to chemotherapy, whereas MDR positivity was found to have an average predictive value of 69% for therapy failure. MDR activity was a prognostic factor for survival rate and the test was suitable for detecting patients at relapse. The calcein assay can be used as a quantitative, standardized, inexpensive screening test in a routine clinical laboratory setting. The assay detects both P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein activities, and identifies AML patients with unfavourable therapy responses.","['Karaszi , E', 'Jakab, K', 'Homolya, L', 'Szakacs, G', 'Hollo, Z', 'Telek, B', 'Kiss, A', 'Rejto, L', 'Nahajevszky, S', 'Sarkadi, B', 'Kappelmayer, J']","['Karaszi E', 'Jakab K', 'Homolya L', 'Szakacs G', 'Hollo Z', 'Telek B', 'Kiss A', 'Rejto L', 'Nahajevszky S', 'Sarkadi B', 'Kappelmayer J']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, Medical and Health Sciences Centre, University of Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Fluoresceins/*analysis', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*analysis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Feb;112(2):308-14. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02554.x.,,"['bjh2554 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02554.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Some reports have shown an improved outcome of ras-mutated AML. In order to understand the biology of ras mutation in AML, we studied a cohort of patients treated in a prospective multicentre trial for ras mutational status and resistance gene expression. Blast samples from 162 adult patients with de novo or secondary AML were examined for resistance gene expression (mdr1, mrp1 and lrp) and ras mutations using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein nucleic acid-competitive polymerase chain reaction strategies respectively. Ras mutations were confirmed using DNA sequencing. Ras mutations leading to an exchange of amino acids were found in 40 (25%) patients. Thirty AML patients had N-ras mutations and nine patients had K-ras mutations. One patient showed both N-ras and K-ras mutations. Resistance gene expression was positive for mdr1 in 30%, for mrp1 in 43% and for lrp in 62% of patients. There was a strong inverse correlation between the presence of ras mutation and mdr1 expression (P = 0.005). However, no significant difference was seen between patients with or without ras mutations and mrp1 or lrp expression. Whereas mdr1 expression was associated with a lower complete remission rate (P < 0.04), ras mutations had no significant influence on remission status. Neither ras mutation nor mdr1 expression had a significant impact on overall or disease-free survival to date.

We have analysed data from three large consecutive national protocols for ALL from 1980 to 1997 [Medical Research Council United Kingdom ALL (MRC UKALL) trials VIII, X and XI] to compare the incidence and causes of treatment-related deaths (TRD). The percentage of TRD has fallen from 9% to 2% (UKALL VIII to XI), largely as a result of a decrease in fatal infections. Deaths during induction have fallen from 3% to 1%, the main causes of death being bacterial, followed by fungal infection, while other causes, chiefly haemorrhage, have not declined. Remission deaths also decreased from 6% to 1%, particularly those deaths due to measles and pneumocystis carinii. More guidelines for surveillance and treatment of infections have been included within progressively more intensive protocols. Risk factor analysis showed increased TRD in patients with Down's syndrome, high leucocyte count and older age in UKALL XI. In contrast, the introduction of blocks of intensification was not associated with an increased death rate. While improved supportive care has reduced the incidence of TRD, there is still scope for further reduction by prompt treatment of suspected infection.

The role of T-cell depletion (TCD) as a strategy to prevent GVHD is controversial because of the associated increased risk of leukaemic relapse, graft failure and delayed immune reconstitution. The demonstration that donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is effective salvage therapy if patients relapse after transplantation for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) prompted us to examine the proposal that TCD may be a form of GVHD prophylaxis particularly suited to this disease in patients undergoing MUD transplantation. We analysed the outcome of 106 consecutive patients with CML in first chronic phase who underwent MUD transplantation. Patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI), and received in vivo TCD, using CD52 monoclonal antibody, as GVHD prophylaxis. Donor lymphocytes were infused at the time of leukaemic relapse. The projected survival at 5 years for all patients was 52.6%. The probability of developing severe acute GVHD (grade 3 or 4) was 14.5%. The only significant predictor of overall survival in univariate and multivariate analysis was patient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus: in CMV-negative patients survival at 5 years was 60% vs. 42% in CMV-positive patients (P = 0.006). The use of TCD was associated with an increased risk of relapse (62% probability at 5 years after transplant), but 80% of patients who received DLI achieved molecular remission that was durable in all but two cases. In vivo TCD, in conjunction with DLI at relapse, is a valuable GVHD prophylactic regimen in CMV-seronegative recipients of MUD allografts, but in CMV-seropositive patients this approach is associated with an increased non-relapse mortality. Consequently, GVHD prophylactic regimens in MUD transplantation should be tailored according to the patient and donor pretransplant characteristics.","['Craddock, C', 'Szydlo, R M', 'Dazzi, F', 'Olavarria, E', 'Cwynarski, K', 'Yong, A', 'Brookes, P', 'de la Fuente, J', 'Kanfer, E', 'Apperley, J F', 'Goldman, J M']","['Craddock C', 'Szydlo RM', 'Dazzi F', 'Olavarria E', 'Cwynarski K', 'Yong A', 'Brookes P', 'de la Fuente J', 'Kanfer E', 'Apperley JF', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital and Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*complications/mortality', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*surgery/virology', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jan;112(1):228-36. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02519.x.,,"['bjh2519 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02519.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In nine patients, a clonal TCR rearrangement was identified in the CD8(+)CD57(+) cells, and in one patient, the TCR rearrangement was oligoclonal in the CD8(+)CD57(+) fraction. In eight out of nine of the clonally rearranged patients, the same band was also present in the CD8(+)CD57(-) fraction. To define the relationship between CD57(-) and CD57(+) LGL populations, CD8(+)CD57(-) and CD8(+)CD57(+) cells were sorted from five patients and cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 plus CD28 antibodies. The CD57(+) cells died of apoptosis before d 7, while the CD57(-) cells proliferated and differentiated into CD57(+) cells. Clonal analysis identified the same band in both cultured subpopulations and in the uncultured CD8(+) cells. Immunophenotypical analysis showed that CD8(+)CD57(-) cells expressed memory cell markers, while the CD8(+)CD57(+) cells exhibited effector characteristics. These results suggest that LGL disease originates in a CD57(-) memory T-cell compartment that continually generates CD57(+) (effector cell) progeny.","['Melenhorst, J J', 'Sorbara, L', 'Kirby, M', 'Hensel, N F', 'Barrett, A J']","['Melenhorst JJ', 'Sorbara L', 'Kirby M', 'Hensel NF', 'Barrett AJ']","['Bone Marrow transplant Unit, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. melenhoj@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (CD57 Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD57 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jan;112(1):189-94. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02509.x.,,"['bjh2509 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02509.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical effects and toxicity of IL-4 treatment in patients with B-CLL were evaluated. Fourteen patients with B-CLL who were in partial remission after chemotherapy received one, two or three 8-week cycles of escalating doses (2, 4 or 6 microg/kg/d s.c.) of IL-4 for 3 d/week. Clinical response was analysed after each treatment cycle and toxicity was monitored continuously. Ten patients (71%) had progressive disease (PD) during IL-4 treatment. This was mainly attributable to an increase (two- to fourfold) of the blood lymphocyte count during IL-4 therapy. After cessation of IL-4 treatment, the lymphocytosis decreased spontaneously in 8 out of 12 evaluable patients. Splenomegaly remained unchanged in 7/7 patients, whereas enlarged lymph nodes were reduced by > 50% in 1/13 patients and by 25-50% in 4/13 patients. None of the patients achieved an objective tumour regression (complete or partial remission). A temporary increase (16-60%) of the platelet count was observed during IL-4 treatment. The platelet count decreased in 8/11 patients after the end of IL-4 therapy. World Health Organization (WHO) grade I/II fever, arthralgia and fatigue was observed in one-third of the patients and was more commonly seen with the highest dose (6 microg/kg/d). One patient developed pulmonary oedema and WHO grade III neutropenia was recorded in three patients. IL-4 was well tolerated by most patients in an outpatient setting. The anti-tumour activity observed in previous in vitro studies was not verified by the present in vivo trial which showed that IL-4 may instead increase the number of CLL cells in blood, indicating that IL-4 may have induced a stimulatory or antiapoptotic effect on the CLL cells in blood. These results may have important implications for the development of immunotherapy of CLL. In addition, the potential platelet-stimulatory effect of IL-4 warrants further studies.","['Lundin, J', 'Kimby, E', 'Bergmann, L', 'Karakas, T', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Osterborg, A']","['Lundin J', 'Kimby E', 'Bergmann L', 'Karakas T', 'Mellstedt H', 'Osterborg A']","['Department of Oncology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Pulmonary Edema/etiology', 'Treatment Failure']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jan;112(1):155-60. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02525.x.,,"['bjh2525 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02525.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 50 patients, 17 (34%) showed p15(INK4B) gene methylation, first demonstrated at diagnosis or during follow-up. When FAB subtypes at the time of study were used in the analysis, the incidence of (p15INK4B) methylation in each risk group of MDS remained stable throughout the course: 0% for low-risk MDS [refractory anaemia (RA) and RA with ring sideroblasts] and from 23% at diagnosis to 30% for high-risk MDS [RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia] respectively. The incidence of p15(INK4B) methylation rose to 60% at initial study and, finally, to 75% in cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) evolved from MDS. Most patients (69%) with p15(INK4B) methylation showed disease progression to AML; it could be detected before, at the time or after the diagnosis of leukaemic transformation. p15(INK4B) methylation in MDS patients implicated a shorter survival time in univariate analyses, but its prognostic significance disappeared in multivariate analyses. In conclusion, p15(INK4B) methylation can be detected early at the diagnosis of MDS or acquired during disease progression. It may play an important role in the pathogenesis of some high-risk MDS and is related to leukaemic transformation of MDS.","['Tien, H F', 'Tang, J H', 'Tsay, W', 'Liu, M C', 'Lee, F Y', 'Wang, C H', 'Chen, Y C', 'Shen, M C']","['Tien HF', 'Tang JH', 'Tsay W', 'Liu MC', 'Lee FY', 'Wang CH', 'Chen YC', 'Shen MC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. hftd@ha.mc.ntu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Refractory/genetics', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Survival Rate', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jan;112(1):148-54. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02496.x.,,"['bjh2496 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02496.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify genes associated with these processes, we studied the effect of NO on AML gene expression using the technique of Representational Difference Analysis. Exposure of HL-60 cells to the NO donor DETA-NO for 24 h induced the expression of a novel gene that was named rno (regulated by nitric oxide). Treatment of HL-60 cells with dimethyl sulphoxide induced expression of rno, but treatment with Vitamin D3 or all-trans retinoic acid did not. Upregulation of rno by NO was cGMP independent. Northern blot analysis indicated that constitutive expression of the novel gene was limited to leucocytes. Three isoforms of rno were identified. An rno cDNA clone was obtained by screening a human leucocyte library. The nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame shared significant homology with that of the human ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor (RI). The predicted amino acid sequence indicated that, like RI, rno is leucine and cysteine rich and is comprised of a series of repetitive elements (leucine-rich repeats) that may mediate macromolecular interactions. Enhancement of expression of rno may be a component of the process by which differentiation and growth inhibition of leukaemia cells is induced by NO.","['Shami, P J', 'Kanai, N', 'Wang, L Y', 'Vreeke, T M', 'Parker, C H']","['Shami PJ', 'Kanai N', 'Wang LY', 'Vreeke TM', 'Parker CH']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Salt Lake City, UT 84148, USA.

Secondary objectives were to evaluate survival and toxicity. Induction treatment consisted of between one and two courses of FLAG. Patients achieving CR received between one and two courses of consolidation treatment. Eighty-three of the 89 patients entering the study were eligible for assessment. CR rates were: 17 out of 21 (81%) in late relapse AML (Group 1), 13 out of 44 (30%) in early relapse/refractory AML (Group 2), and 10 out of 18 (56%) in de novo RAEB-t (Group 3). Thirty-four of the 40 responders (85%) achieved CR after one induction course. Median survival times were 1.4 years, 3 months and 1.6 years in Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Other than myelosuppression, the FLAG regimen was not generally associated with clinically significant toxicity and was well tolerated by most patients including the elderly. The FLAG regimen offers a very effective alternative treatment for CR induction in poor prognosis adult patients with either relapsed or refractory AML or de novo RAEB-t. FLAG delivers high-dose treatment without increasing overall toxicity, an approach which is of particular value in older patients, who constitute the majority in these diseases. It is therefore an important advance in developing new treatment options for these patients.","['Jackson, G', 'Taylor, P', 'Smith, G M', 'Marcus, R', 'Smith, A', 'Chu, P', 'Littlewood, T J', 'Duncombe, A', 'Hutchinson, M', 'Mehta, A B', 'Johnson, S A', 'Carey, P', 'MacKie, M J', 'Ganly, P S', 'Turner, G E', 'Deane, M', 'Schey, S', 'Brookes, J', 'Tollerfield, S M', 'Wilson, M P']","['Jackson G', 'Taylor P', 'Smith GM', 'Marcus R', 'Smith A', 'Chu P', 'Littlewood TJ', 'Duncombe A', 'Hutchinson M', 'Mehta AB', 'Johnson SA', 'Carey P', 'MacKie MJ', 'Ganly PS', 'Turner GE', 'Deane M', 'Schey S', 'Brookes J', 'Tollerfield SM', 'Wilson MP']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. dept.haem@newcastle.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'FLAG protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Jan;112(1):127-37. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02551.x.,,"['bjh2551 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02551.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

CTAP III can support stem cell-derived haematopoiesis yet inhibits the proliferation of committed megakaryocyte (MK) progenitors. This investigation was aimed at characterizing CTAP III expression in human MKs and determining it's role in MK differentiation. We report high expression of CTAP III in mature human bone marrow (BM) MKs and megakaryoblast cell lines following differentiation induction with phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Immunostaining with anti-CTAP III antibodies demonstrated its prominent presence in platelet producing zones in the cytoplasm and intense staining around the periphery of the large BM MKs. In cultures of logarithmically growing megakaryoblast cell lines DAMI, CHRF-288 or MEG01, which contain primarily 2N cells, only 15% of the cells expressed CTAP III. The addition of PMA stimulated high levels of CTAP III after 24 h in more than 75% of the cells, being expressed in both the 2N and large polyploid MKs. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed upregulation of CTAP III mRNA after only 1 h of exposure to PMA that was sustained for 24 h. In the bone marrow of idiopathic thrombocytopenic pupura (ITP) patients undergoing accelerated MK maturation and thrombopoiesis, 99% of large MKs and 95% of small MKs expressed high levels of CTAP III. While the biological function of this chemokine in MKs is not known, these studies demonstrate that molecular upregulation of CTAP III in MKs is associated with maturation and, as with other chemokines, may be involved in proliferation arrest and cellular interactions with extracellular matrix and platelet production.","['Deutsch, V', 'Bitan, M', 'Friedmann, Y', 'Eldor, A', 'Vlodavsky, I']","['Deutsch V', 'Bitan M', 'Friedmann Y', 'Eldor A', 'Vlodavsky I']","['The Haematology Institute, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Centre, Tel Aviv, Israel. varda@tamsc.health.gov.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '69344-77-0 (connective tissue-activating peptide)', '69670-74-2 (low affinity platelet factor 4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation Factors/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/chemistry/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', '*Peptides', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Dec;111(4):1180-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02476.x.,,"['bjh2476 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02476.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe two approaches to further increase the therapeutic index of the hyperthermic purging modality by using normal murine bone marrow cells and a murine model for acute myeloid leukaemia. First, the tetrapeptide AcSDKP was used to protect the normal haematopoietic progenitor cells against hyperthermic damage. Pretreatment for 8 h at 37 degrees C with 1 x 10(-9) mol/l AcSDKP resulted in a decrease in hyperthermic sensitivity of only normal haematopoietic progenitor cells. This combined treatment protocol revealed a therapeutic index (ratio of surviving fractions of normal vs. leukaemic cells) of > 500, which was considered to be sufficient for purging. This was confirmed in vivo by the survival of lethally irradiated recipients transplanted with purged simulated remission bone marrow (1 x 10(6) normal bone marrow cells and 5 x 10(4) leukaemic cells). A further increase of the therapeutic index cells was achieved by the alkyl-lysophospholipid ET-18-OCH(3). An incubation for 4 h at 37 degrees C with 25 microg/ml in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum preferentially enhanced the cytotoxic effect towards the leukaemic stem cell. The combination of AcSDKP and ET-18-OCH(3) with hyperthermia resulted in a therapeutic index of > 5000. This enabled a reduction of the hyperthermic treatment and will further minimize the toxicity to normal haematopoietic stem cell subsets, while a therapeutic index far above the required value is achieved. This tripartite purging treatment therefore offers a safe and fast purging protocol for the elimination of residual leukaemic cells in autografts.","['Wierenga, P K', 'Setroikromo, R', 'Vellenga, E', 'Kampinga, H H']","['Wierenga PK', 'Setroikromo R', 'Vellenga E', 'Kampinga HH']","['Department of Radiation and Stress Cell Biology, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. p.k.wierenga@med.rug.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', 'H041538E9P (goralatide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', '*Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*surgery', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Models, Animal', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Oligopeptides/therapeutic use', 'Phospholipid Ethers/therapeutic use', '*Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Dec;111(4):1145-52. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02469.x.,,"['bjh2469 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02469.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The probability of relapse at 5 years was 51 +/- 1% in the autografts, 45 +/- 8% in the twins and 34 +/- 2% among the HLA-identical siblings (auto vs. sibs, P < 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, the following factors were significantly associated with an increased risk of relapse: ALL vs. AML M3 [relapse rate (RR) 2.29, P < 0.0001], AML non-M3 vs. AML M3 (RR 1.8, P < 0.0001), autograft vs. sibling transplant (RR 1.76, P < 0.0001), interval diagnosis to transplantation < 261 d (RR 1.45, P < 0.001) and other conditioning vs. total body irradiation (RR 1.16, P = 0.001). Transplant-related mortality was the same in the three groups at approximately 10% at 2 years. Five-year leukaemia-free survival was 42 +/- 1% in the autografts, 44 +/- 8% in the twins and 58 +/- 2% among the siblings (auto vs. sibs, P < 0.0001). The factors significant for relapse were also significant in multivariate analyses for leukaemia-free survival. In addition, children had a significantly better leukaemia-free survival than adults (RR 0.82, P < 0.0001). Recipients of bone marrow from HLA-identical siblings without GVHD had a lower risk of relapse and a better leukaemia-free survival than recipients of autografts.

The aim of this study was threefold: (i) to assess the frequency and clinical association of the fusion gene in patients with and without a cytogenetically detectable chromosome 12 and/or 21 abnormality or failed cytogenetic results, (ii) to characterize alternative forms of ETV6/AML1 transcripts, and (iii) to use ETV6/AML1 as a molecular marker for the investigation of minimal residual disease (MRD). ETV6/AML1 fusion was detected in 22 (39%) of 56 cases studied by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ETV6/AML1 fusion was found in nine out of 16 (56%) cases with a cytogenetically visible chromosome 12 abnormality, but also in nine out of 29 patients (31%) without a chromosome 12 abnormality or patients with failed cytogenetics (four out of 11 patients, 36%), making this the most common cytogenetic abnormality in childhood ALL. Alternatively spliced ETV6/AML1 forms were investigated in 14 of the positive patients. Exon 5 of ETV6 was fused in frame to all AML1 exons, except exon 4. Fusion to exon 6 of AML1 resulted in one amino acid change. The presence of ETV6/AML1 was associated with a lower white blood cell count (Student's t-test; P = 0.009) and common (c)ALL phenotype (chi(2) test; P > 0.001), but no better disease-free survival. Our study shows that (i) RT-PCR is the most effective approach for the detection of t(12;21) in childhood ALL, (ii) the association of ETV6/AML1 and chromosome 12 and/or 21, seen in 56% of our cases, further confirms existing data, (iii) overall survival of patients with t(12;21) was not better than other cytogenetics groups, and (d) MRD analysis using ETV6/AML1 fusion is specific, but not sensitive enough to avoid false negative results.","['Codrington, R', ""O'Connor, H E"", 'Jalali, G R', 'Carrara, P', 'Papaioannou, M', 'Hart, S M', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Potter, M', 'Prentice, H G', 'Harrison, C J', 'Foroni, L']","['Codrington R', ""O'Connor HE"", 'Jalali GR', 'Carrara P', 'Papaioannou M', 'Hart SM', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Potter M', 'Prentice HG', 'Harrison CJ', 'Foroni L']","['Department of Haematology, Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics Laboratory, The Royal Free and University College School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Dec;111(4):1071-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02464.x.,,"['bjh2464 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02464.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen out of 31 cases (51%) were MPO mRNA positive/enzyme negative. MPO mRNA was detected in nine out of 16 (56%) and seven out of 15 (47%) patients with and without the ALL1/AF4 fusion transcript respectively. The comparative study between MPO mRNA positive and negative cases showed statistically significant differences with regard to age and white blood cell (WBC) count, and was 39.5 years vs. 26.3 years (P = 0.016) and 71.4 x 10(9)/l vs. 157.8 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.046) in the MPO mRNA positive and negative groups respectively. The correlation analysis between MPO mRNA expression, age, WBC count and leukaemic relapse according to the presence/absence of the ALL1/AF4 fusion showed that the statistically significant differences observed in the whole group were related mostly to the ALL1/AF4-positive ALL patients. In fact, in this latter group, the mean WBC count and patients' age were 85 +/- 79 x 10(9)/l vs. 289.8 +/- 102 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.0005) and 44.8 +/- 15.3 years vs. 26.7 +/- 13.7 years (P = 0.01) in patients with and without MPO mRNA expression respectively.

Four FA genes, corresponding to complementation groups A, C, F and G, have been cloned, but the molecular functions of the corresponding proteins are unknown. The high risk of AML in FA patients suggests that the 'FA pathway' helps to prevent AML in non-FA individuals. We examined 10 AML cell lines, as well as primary cells from 15 AML patients representing the French-American-British subclasses M1-M5a, for possible deficiencies in the 'FA pathway'. Cellular lysates were analysed for the presence of the FA proteins FANCA, FANCC, FANCF and FANCG, as well as the complexes reported to be formed between these proteins, using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Aberrant protein profiles were observed in five of the 10 cell lines and in 11 of the 15 primary AML samples. Aberrations, that included absence or reduced presence of FA proteins and/or their complexes, were noted in the subclasses M1-M4, but not in M5a (n = 3). Our results suggest that a significant proportion of general AML is characterized by a disturbance of the 'FA pathway' that may represent an early event in the development of this type of leukaemia.","['Xie, Y', 'de Winter, J P', 'Waisfisz, Q', 'Nieuwint, A W', 'Scheper, R J', 'Arwert, F', 'Hoatlin, M E', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'Joenje, H']","['Xie Y', 'de Winter JP', 'Waisfisz Q', 'Nieuwint AW', 'Scheper RJ', 'Arwert F', 'Hoatlin ME', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Joenje H']","['Department of Clinical Genetics and Human Genetics, Free University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FANCA protein, human)', '0 (FANCC protein, human)', '0 (FANCF protein, human)', '0 (FANCG protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group F Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Fanconi Anemia/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group F Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Precipitin Tests/methods', 'Proteins/*analysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Dec;111(4):1057-64.,,['bjh2450 [pii]'],,,['HL56045/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Detection of these abnormalities is important for disease management as both are associated with good responses to conventional chemotherapy and prolonged disease-free survival. Recent reports using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) suggest that significant proportions of AML cases without a visible t(8;21) or inv(16) show expression of an abnormal fusion gene transcript and, consequently, they could not be detected using conventional cytogenetic analysis alone. We present here a four centre study involving 412 cases of AML screened using both standard cytogenetics and RT-PCR for AML1-ETO and CBF beta-MYH11. We detected a cytogenetic t(8;21) in 31 out of 412 (7.5%) cases and an inv(16) or t(16;16) variant in 27 out of 412 (6.6%) cases. RT-PCR detected only two cases (0.5%) of cryptic t(8;21) and no instances of cryptic inv(16). Both cryptic t(8;21) cases had the classic M2 FAB morphology for this type of disease.

Data were linked to MRC trials data to determine the proportion of patients aged 15-29 years at diagnosis in responding hospitals actually treated in MRC leukaemia trials in the 5 years preceding the questionnaire. Eighty-two per cent of haematologists stated that they entered patients 'always' or 'whenever possible' for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 76% for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but actual entry rates from the study hospitals were 46% of 239 AML patients and 36% of 182 ALL patients.

The influence of expression of p28, a low-molecular weight stress protein, on the differentiation of K562 cells was examined. Expression of p28 was modulated by transfection of K562 cells with expression vectors containing the murine p28 cDNA in either the sense or antisense orientation, or without the p28 cDNA. In K562 cells where p28 expression was either unaltered or downregulated, exposure to 40 nM Doxorubicin resulted in an arrest of cell division, the production of hemoglobin, and an increased cell diameter consistent with cells undergoing differentiation. K562 cells that overexpressed p28 continued to divide, had fewer hemoglobin-producing cells, had a smaller mean cell diameter and had a 5.5-fold increase in cell survival. Consistent with an inhibition of doxorubicin-induced erythroid differentiation, p28 may act by changes in redox regulation via the glutathione-binding activity of p28 and suggests a general role for p28 in cellular differentiation. Furthermore, p28 expression may be useful in predicting resistance to chemo- or radiation therapy in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma.","['Kodym, R', 'Calkins, P R', 'Story, M D']","['Kodym R', 'Calkins PR', 'Story MD']","['Department of Experimental Radiation Biology, Box 66, The University of Texas M.

The data support a relationship between etoposide-induced complex accumulation and DNA damage in leukaemic cells from AML and CLL patients.

The goal of this paper is to review the influence of age on cancer biology and cancer management. Specific interactions of cancer and aging include: Increased incidence of cancer with the age: This association may be reported to three factors: duration of carcinogenesis; increased susceptibility of older tissues to late stage carcinogens, and systemic effects of aging, including immune-senescence and enhanced cytokine production. Biological behavior of cancer: With aging, the prognosis of certain neoplasms, including acute myelogenous leukemia and large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma worsens, whereas the behavior of other tumors becomes more indolent. In these biologic variations one may recognize both a 'seed"" effect (different tumor cells) and a ""soil"" effect (different ways in which the older tumor host handles tumor growth. Goals of prevention and treatment: Given the limited life-expectancy of older individuals and reduced tolerance of clinical intervention, the main goal is compression of morbidity, rather than prolongation of survival. Cancer prevention in the older person: In virtue of increased susceptibility to environmental carcinogens, the older person appears an ideal candidate for primary prevention of cancer, including chemoprevention; though randomized controlled studies have not been performed, the older person may benefit from secondary prevention (screening), when the average life-expectancy is 3 years or longer. Cancer treatment: The risk of surgical complications increases only slightly with age for elective surgery, but increases dramatically for emergency surgery. Radiation therapy appears a valuable method of cancer treatment in patients of all ages. Chemotherapy can be made safer by the following provisions: use of hemopoietic growth factors for patients aged 70 and older receiving moderately toxic chemotherapy (CHOP and CHOP-like); maintenance of hemoglobin levels at 12 g/dl with erythropoietin; adjustment of the dose of renally excreted agents to the glomerular filtration rate; selection of the best candidates for chemotherapy based on comprehensive geriatric assessment.","['Balducci, L', ""Beghe', C""]","['Balducci L', ""Beghe' C""]","['University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, FL, USA. balducci@moffitt.usf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",38,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2001 Feb;37(2):137-45. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(00)00109-8.,,"['S1040-8428(00)00109-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(00)00109-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Several groups have searched for mutations in the FAS receptor, a well-characterized apoptotic protein carrying a death domain, and reported the existence of rare mutations in multiple myeloma, T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and adult T-cell leukemia. Our aim was to expand these searches by looking for mutations in the death domains of FAS, FADD, TNFR, TRADD, and RIP, in the promoter region of FAS, and in the protease domain of caspase 10, in a larger variety of hematological malignancies, some of which express an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. METHODS: We extracted RNA and DNA samples from 92 hematological malignancies: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; 31 cases), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 28 cases), essential thrombocythemia (ET; 8 cases), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL; 6 cases), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML; 6 cases), hairy-cell leukemia (HCL; 3 cases), Burkitt's lymphoma (3 cases), polycythemia vera (PV; 3 cases), myelofibrosis (2 cases), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; 2 cases) and performed PCR-SSCP and sequence analysis on these samples. RESULTS: Five polymorphic patterns were found: three in the death domain of the FAS gene in CML patients, one in the promoter of this gene in a CLL patient, and the fifth in the death domain of the TRADD gene in a CML patient. No mutations, altering amino acids, were found in these genes in any of the aforementioned malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: These observations imply that mutations in the death domains of FAS, FADD, TNFR, TRADD, and RIP and in the protease domain of caspase 10 are not a major cause for failure of apoptosis in hematological malignancies, mainly CML and CLL. Regulatory and epigenetic abnormalities in these apoptotic cascade members and aberrations in other components of all death machinery should be looked for.","['Rozenfeld-Granot, G', 'Toren, A', 'Amariglio, N', 'Brok-Simoni, F', 'Rechavi, G']","['Rozenfeld-Granot G', 'Toren A', 'Amariglio N', 'Brok-Simoni F', 'Rechavi G']","['Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Department, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. galitg@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics', 'fas Receptor/*genetics']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Feb;29(2):228-33. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00623-8.,,"['S0301-472X(00)00623-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00623-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Newly synthesized heterocyclic pyrimidine derivatives promote neurite outgrowth and survival in neuronal cell lines. In this study, the growth-inhibiting and differentiation-inducing effects of these pyrimidine derivatives on human myeloid leukemia cells were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several myeloid leukemia cells were cultured with novel heterocyclic pyrimidine derivatives. Cell differentiation was determined by nitroblue tetrazolium-reducing activity, morphologic changes, expression of CD11b, lysozyme activity, and hemoglobin production. RESULTS: MS-430 (2-piperidino-5,6-dihydro-7-methyl-6-oxo (7H) pyrrolo [2,3-d] pyrimidine maleate) effectively induced HL-60 cells into mature granulocytes. MS-430 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of the cells before causing granulocytic differentiation. MAPK activation was necessary for MS-430-induced differentiation, because PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase, suppressed the differentiation induced by MS-430. MS-430 also induced monocytic differentiation of THP-1, P39/Tsu, and P31/Fuj leukemia cells, but did not affect erythroid differentiation of K562 or HEL cells. CONCLUSIONS: MS-430 potently induces differentiation of some myelomonocytic leukemia cells.

Because of the possible transmission of infectious diseases, however, the safety of the delivery of grafts expanded in culture using xenogeneic cells and serum has been debated. Using primary human marrow stromal cells, we established a novel serum-free culture system to expand human primitive progenitors and transplantable stem cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cord blood CD34(+) cells were cultured on a monolayer of human primary marrow stromal cells in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO), flt3/flk2 ligand (FL), and/or stem cell factor (SCF) under serum-free conditions. After 2 or 4 weeks of culture, cells were examined for clonogenic progenitors and severe combined immunodeficient disorder (SCID) mouse-reconstituting cells (SRC). RESULTS: In the presence of TPO, FL, and SCF, marrow stromal cells supported more than a 100- and 1,000-fold expansion of CD34(+) cells and colony-forming units in culture after 2 and 4 weeks of incubation, respectively. In addition, cobblestone area-forming cells were expanded more than 18- and 60-fold after 2 and 4 weeks of culture, respectively. Furthermore, SRC assay demonstrated augmented engraftment by cultured cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Moloney murine leukemia virus amphotropic vector producer cells (1--2 x 10(8) cells/animal) were transplanted into the femoral bone marrow cavities of six macaques. To determine if the levels of gene transfer could be increased, a second injection at the same dose of producer cells was performed into the iliac crest in three of the six macaques. RESULTS: We demonstrated that 0.02-0.1% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells contained the vector transgene for up to 12 months following the initial administration of producer cells. Hematopoietic progenitor cell assays indicated that the neomycin phosphotransferase gene was detected in 10--30% of progenitor cell colonies. A humoral immune response directed toward viral particles was demonstrated in all animals. Additionally, we demonstrated that an increase in the levels of transduced cells, up to 1% of circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells and granulocytes, contain the transgene following producer cell readministration.

HuMab TONO-1 Vlambda belongs to the lambda light chain variable subgroup I family and is derived from the Vlambdalc germ line gene Humlv1042, and germ line gene Jlambda1 without somatic mutations. The results reveal that the production of HuMab TONO-1, with cytotoxic potential for human T-leukemia/lymphoma cells, is achieved by rearrangement of the V(H)71-4/Humlv1042 germ line variable region gene combination, that is associated with the autoimmune repertoire.","['Numasaki, M', 'Nakamura, K', 'Fukuoka, Y', 'Saeki, H', 'Hanai, N', 'Kudo, T']","['Numasaki M', 'Nakamura K', 'Fukuoka Y', 'Saeki H', 'Hanai N', 'Kudo T']","['Cancer Cell Repository, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, 4-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8575, Miyagi, Japan. numasaki77@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (TONO-1 monoclonal antibody)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Base Sequence', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2001 Jan 15;75(3):167-77. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(00)00308-4.,,"['S0165247800003084 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(00)00308-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow chimera system provided the various age of FLV-resistant host mice (B6) possessing the same age of FLV-susceptible target cells from C3H mice. Using this system, we could determine the aging effect on the host resistancy against FLV without an influence of the aging effect on target cells. First, the young C3H-->young B6 chimeras and young C3H-->old B6 chimeras were compared. The young-->old chimeras were more susceptible to FLV-induced acute disease than the young-->young chimeras. The spleen CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells were reduced in young-->old chimeras compared with young-->young chimeras. Similarly, the old C3H-->old B6 chimeras were more susceptible than old-->young chimeras and revealed the lower CD4+ T cell ratio in the spleen.

We investigated this issue in a case-control study comprising 117 patients, aged 2-14 years, with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), Hodgkin's (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), as well as 117 controls matched for age, sex and ethnicity. Information was collected via a telephone interview of the mothers. The median duration of breast-feeding among patients was significantly shorter than among controls, 7 (range 0-23) and 10 (range 0-20) months, respectively (P<0.0001). Breast-feeding of 0-6 months' duration, when compared with feeding of longer than 6 months, was associated with increased odds ratios (OR) for ALL (OR=2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-5.25), HL (OR=3.75, 95% CI 0.80-18.69), NHL (OR=4.06, 95% CI 0.82-22.59), and overall (OR=2.79, 95% CI 1.54-5.05). In the patient group, there were a significantly higher number of children and people per family, and patients were of a higher birth order than controls. In multivariate analysis, breast-feeding duration continues to be an independent predictor of lymphoid malignancies (P=0.015). In conclusion, breast-feeding lasting longer than 6 months may protect against childhood acute leukaemia and lymphomas.","['Bener, A', 'Denic, S', 'Galadari, S']","['Bener A', 'Denic S', 'Galadari S']","['Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, PO Box 17666, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Breast Feeding', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*prevention & control', 'Time Factors']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2001 Jan;37(2):234-8. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(00)00339-7.,,"['S0959804900003397 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(00)00339-7 [doi]']",,,,['Eur J Cancer. 2001 Jan;37(2):155-8.

To explore the mechanism by which Pi induces cell death, we asked the following two questions. First, can we prevent Pi-induced apoptosis by inhibiting plasma membrane Na-Pi cotransport? Second, which specific Na-Pi transporters are expressed in chondrocytes and are they developmentally regulated? Terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes were isolated from chick tibial cartilage and cell death was measured in the presence of 3-7 mmol/L Pi. To ascertain whether apoptosis was linked to a rise in cellular Pi loading, we examined the effect of phosphonoformic acid (PFA), a competitive inhibitor of Na-Pi cotransport on Pi-induced apoptosis in chondrocytes. We found that 1 mmol/L PFA blocked anion-induced cell death and prevented an increase in the cell Pi content. In a parallel study, we determined that the bisphosphonate, alendronate, also protected chondrocytes from death, albeit at a lower concentration than PFA. Using a DNA end-labeling procedure, we showed that the Pi-treated cells were apoptotic and, as might be predicted, the presence of PFA blocked induction of the death sequence. Next, we examined the expression of two Pi transporters in relation to chondrocyte maturation and anion treatment. We noted that there was expression of the constitutive transporter, Glvr-1, and a type II cotransporter in chick growth plate cells. Although these transport systems are active in terminally differentiated cells, it is probable that the initiation of apoptosis may require the induction of other Pi-transport systems. It is concluded that, at the mineralization front, cell death is linked directly to the elevation in environmental anion concentration and the concomitant rise in intracellular Pi levels.","['Mansfield, K', 'Teixeira, C C', 'Adams, C S', 'Shapiro, I M']","['Mansfield K', 'Teixeira CC', 'Adams CS', 'Shapiro IM']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6003, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type II)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '364P9RVW4X (Foscarnet)', 'X1J18R4W8P (Alendronate)']",IM,"['Alendronate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chondrocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Foscarnet/pharmacology', 'Growth Plate/cytology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Phosphates/*pharmacokinetics', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type II', '*Symporters']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone. 2001 Jan;28(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/s8756-3282(00)00409-9.,,"['S8756-3282(00)00409-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s8756-3282(00)00409-9 [doi]']",,,"['DE-10875/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-13319/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In the NB4-2 lineage, two even-skipped (eve)-expressing sibling neuronal cells, RP2 and RP2sib, are formed in each hemineuromere. Throughout embryogenesis, only RP2, but not RP2sib, maintains eve expression. In this report, we describe a P-element induced mutation that alters the expression pattern of EVE in RP2 motoneurons in the Drosophila embryonic CNS. The mutation was mapped to a Drosophila homolog of human AF10/AF17 leukemia fusion genes (alf), and therefore named Dalf. Like its human counterparts, Dalf encodes a zinc finger/leucine zipper nuclear protein that is widely expressed in embryonic and larval tissues including neurons and glia. In Dalf mutant embryos, the RP2 motoneuron no longer maintains EVE expression. The effect of the Dalf mutation on EVE expression is RP2-specific and does not affect other characteristics of the RP2 motoneuron. In addition to the embryonic phenotype, Dalf mutant larvae are retarded in their growth and this defect can be rescued by the ectopic expression of a Dalf transgene under the control of a neuronal GAL4 driver. This indicates a requirement for Dalf function in the nervous system for maintaining gene expression and the facilitation of normal growth.","['Bahri, S M', 'Chia, W', 'Yang, X']","['Bahri SM', 'Chia W', 'Yang X']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 30 Medical Drive, 117609, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Mech Dev,Mechanisms of development,9101218,"['0 (Alh protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (MLLT6 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (eve protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Bacterial Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drosophila', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genotype', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Nervous System/*embryology', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mech Dev. 2001 Feb;100(2):291-301. doi: 10.1016/s0925-4773(00)00539-6.,,"['S0925477300005396 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-4773(00)00539-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML, gene amplification by ring formation has been demonstrated only in another three patients (amplification of the MLL gene in two cases and of the ETV6 gene in one case). Here we present the new evidence that the internal rearrangement of a constitutional ring chromosome 21 resulted in multiplication of a proto-oncogene in bone marrow cells and provided obviously a selective growth advantage. Moreover the amplification of ribosomal DNA was observed in the ring chromosomes of the tumor cells.","['Streubel, B', 'Valent, P', 'Lechner, K', 'Fonatsch, C']","['Streubel B', 'Valent P', 'Lechner K', 'Fonatsch C']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biologie der Universitat Wien, Wahringer Strasse 10, 1090, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Ring Chromosomes', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Jan 1;124(1):42-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00318-6.,,"['S0165-4608(00)00318-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00318-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The SKY confirmed the simple karyotype in 11 and in 7 with a complex karyotype. In 13 of the cases with a complex karyotype, ambiguous structural aberrations were classified, in 6 of these, SKY disclosed cryptic translocations. Thus, SKY either extended or confirmed G-band karyotypes in 31 of 34 analyzed abnormal cases.

While CC is restricted to metaphases with a good quality, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) is also capable of analyzing specific anomalies in the interphase nuclei. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) gives additional information about the imbalanced karyotype changes in the whole genome. The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of CGH to the unraveling of complex GTG karyotypes, which are difficult to evaluate by banding analysis, and to compare these results with those by CC and FISH. Thirteen bone marrow samples and one sample obtained from peripheral blood of 13 leukemia patients were examined by CC, FISH and CGH. The GTG banding analysis showed complex karyotypes with many marker chromosomes. The most frequent abnormalities were numerical and structural aberrations on chromosomes 5 and 7. In 12 of the 14 samples, the CGH analysis was able to detect chromosomal imbalances with losses of material on chromosome 5 and 7 as the most frequent aberrations. In all 14 samples, additional FISH analyses were performed. For most of the studied neoplasias, a close correlation between CC, FISH and CGH data was observed. CGH was considerably helpful in adding additional information to classical karyotyping, if the low quality or number of metaphases was insufficient for a reliable CC analysis. Even in cases where whole chromosome painting could be applied, it added information on the breakpoints of the observed rearrangements. In only 2 of the studied 14 samples, neither CGH nor I-FISH could improve the result of karyotyping. CGH, nevertheless, can be regarded as a powerful additional technique in leukemias with unsuccessful CC, incomplete, or complex karyotypes with many marker chromosomes. A systematic analysis by three techniques such as CC, FISH and CGH guarantees an optimal genetic characterization of the neoplasias.","['Verdorfer, I', 'Brecevic, L', 'Saul, W', 'Schenker, B', 'Kirsch, M', 'Trautmann, U', 'Helm, G', 'Gramatzki, M', 'Gebhart, E']","['Verdorfer I', 'Brecevic L', 'Saul W', 'Schenker B', 'Kirsch M', 'Trautmann U', 'Helm G', 'Gramatzki M', 'Gebhart E']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 10, D-91054, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Jan 1;124(1):1-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00287-9.,,"['S0165-4608(00)00287-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00287-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this synergistic action, transcription factors, Smads and STAT3 (for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activated by respective group of cytokines, as well as a transcriptional coactivator p300 were essential. Taken together with our previous finding that the synergistic astrocyte induction by BMP2 and LIF is attributed to the complex formation of Smads and STAT3 bridged by p300, it is conceivable that this complex formation is a mechanism utilized in common by two different types of cytokines belonging to the BMP and IL-6 families in order to synergistically induce astrocyte differentiation.","['Yanagisawa, M', 'Nakashima, K', 'Takizawa, T', 'Ochiai, W', 'Arakawa, H', 'Taga, T']","['Yanagisawa M', 'Nakashima K', 'Takizawa T', 'Ochiai W', 'Arakawa H', 'Taga T']","['Department of Cell Fate Modulation, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Honjo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Smad6 Protein)', '0 (Smad6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ep300 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Brain/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Smad6 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2001 Feb 2;489(2-3):139-43. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(01)02095-6.,,"['S0014-5793(01)02095-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(01)02095-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The antitumour effects of these compounds were compared with those of RS-TBZ, a thiazolobenzimidazole derivative, previously described in our reports, that was able to induce apoptosis more markedly in MDR cells than in the parental sensitive cell lines. Only two compounds in this study proved to have interesting effects: (a) the S-enantiomer of TBZ, that was able to induce apoptosis in MDR cells in a slightly more selective manner than TBZ (racemic form); and (b) TBZ-4-OCH3 (TBZ-4-OCH3), that showed cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on sensitive and resistant leukaemia cells greater than TBZ, without cytotoxic effects on normal haemopoietic progenitor cells. Moreover, we observed that TBZ-4-OCH3 was also active in cells expressing Bcr-Abl, an oncogene that confers resistance to apoptosis induced by several stimuli, including cytotoxic agents. The inhibition of caspase-9 and caspase-3 by specific polypeptide inhibitors decreased the apoptotic effects of TBZ-4-OCH3 in HL60 cells indicating that apoptosis induced by this compound was, at least partly, caspase-mediated. On the contrary, the blocking of FL-associated cell surface antigen (Fas) using a specific Fas-blocking monoclonal antibody did not affect the level of apoptosis induced by TBZ-4-OCH3 suggesting that the Fas pathway was not involved. In addition, the caspase 8 inhibitor was unable to inhibit the apoptotic activity of TBZ-4-OCH3. The very low toxicity shown by TBZ-4-OCH3 in normal haemopoietic progenitor cells and its high activity in sensitive and MDR neoplastic cells suggest a possible clinical use for this new compound.","['Grimaudo, S', 'Raimondi, M V', 'Capone, F', 'Chimirri, A', 'Poretto, F', 'Monforte, A M', 'Simoni, D', 'Tolomeo, M']","['Grimaudo S', 'Raimondi MV', 'Capone F', 'Chimirri A', 'Poretto F', 'Monforte AM', 'Simoni D', 'Tolomeo M']","[""Divisione di Ematologia e Servizio A.I.D.S., Facolta' di Medicina, Universita' di Palermo, Palermo, Italy. dusonc@unipa.it""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (fas Receptor)', ""138226-12-7 (1-(2',6'-difluorophenyl)-1H,3H-thiazolo(3,4-a)benzimidazole)""]",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2001 Jan;37(1):122-30. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(00)00372-5.,,"['S0959-8049(00)00372-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(00)00372-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

LAB was administered at a constant dose of 50 mg/day over 1--6 h by intravenous infusion, and blood samples were obtained between two infusion intervals without complicating the systemic therapy of the patients. Quantitative analysis of amphotericin B (AB) in plasma was established by a validated reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay. Model independent pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using area and moment analysis. Administration of LAB to the first patient (day 1) diagnosed as malignant melanoma resulted in a mean maximum concentration (C(max)) of 679+/-6 ng/ml and a mean minimum concentration (C(min)) of 139+/-9 ng/ml of AB. Pre-dose, C(max) and C(min) values of AB, after multiple LAB dosing to the other two patients both having acute myeloblastic leukemia were found to be 440+/-6, 1140+/-10, 409+/-11 ng/ml (day 19) and 408+/-3, 1180+/-10, and 283+/-1 ng/ml (day 9), respectively. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the mean residence time (MRT) calculated between the two infusion intervals were 6180 ngh/ml, 7.79 h (day 1) for the first patient; 13,700 ng.h/ml, 10.5 h (day 19) and 14,000 ng.h/ml, 9.93 h (day 9) for the other two patients, respectively.

Human umbilical cord blood is a rich source of cytotoxic CD56+ cells including fetal NK cells (CD16(-)CD56+1) with high lytic capabilities upon activation with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Cord blood transplantations are reported to be associated with lower risk of graft-vs-host disease, which may jeopardize the graft-vs-leukemia effect. Therefore, our goal was to expand and amplify, ex vivo, cord blood-derived CD56+ cell-mediated cytotoxic activity. Cord blood-derived CD56+ cells were separated using anti-CD56 monoclonal antibody and immunomagnetic beads. The cells were expanded in the presence of irradiated feeder cells and various concentrations of IL-2. Maximal fold expansion (152 +/- 29) was achieved on day 22 by culturing the cells in the presence of irradiated autologous lymphocytes. Irradiated murine stromal cells yielded 42 +/- fourfold expansion (p < 0.05). FACS analysis at the peak of expansion revealed that the cells were 96% +/- 1% CD56+. Interferon-gamma levels significantly decreased throughout the culture period (from 1,034 +/- 34 pg/mL to 21 +/- 8 pg/mL) as did IL-6 levels (from 11,535 +/- 1,452 pg/mL to 323 +/- 161 pg/mL) whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels did not change. The expanded cells manifested potent lytic capabilities against K562 and Colo-205 cell lines (70.9% +/- 2.0% and 48.2% +/- 4.0%, respectively) (n = 5) (effector-to-target ratio 25:1). Coculturing the expanded NK cells with fresh ALL blasts resulted in 85% +/- 1% inhibition of colony growth in methylcellulose (n = 2). In addition, the CD56+ expanded cells induced 44% +/- 7.5% apoptosis of K562 target cells (n = 3). It is possible to effectively expand cord blood-derived CD56+ cells, ex vivo, while maintaining their antileukemic capablilities.","['Condiotti, R', 'Zakai, Y B', 'Barak, V', 'Nagler, A']","['Condiotti R', 'Zakai YB', 'Barak V', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel 91120.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/pathology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Jan;29(1):104-13. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00617-2.,,"['S0301-472X(00)00617-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00617-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the role of rae28 in lymphocyte development. Because homozygous rae28-deficient (rae28-/-) mice died in the perinatal period, we examined lymphocyte development by generating chimeric mice reconstituted with green fluorescence protein-labeled mutant fetal liver cells as well as in in vitro culture systems. We further examined RAE28 expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay in human leukemic cells with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Severe B-cell maturation arrest was observed in rae28-/- between pro- and pre-B lymphocyte stages. B-cell development was also delayed in heterozygous neonates. Furthermore, interleukin-7-dependent colony-forming ability was impaired not only in homozygous lymphocytes but also in heterozygotes. Its human homologue, RAE28, is located on chromosome 12p13, which frequently is associated with chromosomal abnormalities and loss of heterozygosity in patients with hematologic malignancies. To determine whether a link exists between RAE28 and leukemia, we examined RAE28 expression in leukemic cells from pediatric patients with B-lineage ALL. RAE28 expression was not detected in four B-cell precursor ALL cases of a total of 43 examined, although RAE28 is normally expressed constitutively during the process of B-cell maturation as assessed in isolated cell populations. rae28 plays an important role in the early B-cell developmental stage in a gene dosage-dependent manner. Furthermore, the human RAE28 locus may provide a candidate gene causing the molecular pathogenesis of childhood B-cell precursor ALL.","['Tokimasa, S', 'Ohta, H', 'Sawada, A', 'Matsuda, Y', 'Kim, J Y', 'Nishiguchi, S', 'Hara, J', 'Takihara, Y']","['Tokimasa S', 'Ohta H', 'Sawada A', 'Matsuda Y', 'Kim JY', 'Nishiguchi S', 'Hara J', 'Takihara Y']","['Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Cell Biology, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, 3-1, Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PHC1 protein, human)', '0 (Phc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chimera', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genotype', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Thymus Gland/abnormalities/embryology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Jan;29(1):93-103. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00620-2.,,"['S0301-472X(00)00620-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00620-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

These transformants can be induced to undergo immunoglobulin light-chain gene rearrangements by incubating them at the non-permissive temperature. In the case of transformed scid cells, a significant amount of hairpin coding ends are accumulated during recombination induction, but few coding joints are generated. After being shifted to the permissive temperature. however, these cells are capable of opening hairpin ends and forming coding joints. Thus, ts-Ab-MLV transformed scid cells can be readily manipulated for both recombination cleavage and end resolution. However, unlike the rapid coding joint formation in s/ + cells that have the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), the process for resolving coding ends in scid cells is slow and error prone, and also appears to be correlated with a reduction in the RAG1/2 expression. Apparently, this process is mediated by a DNA-PK-independent pathway. The fact that the activity of this pathway can be manipulated in vitro makes it possible to delineate the mechanisms in end opening, processing and joining. Therefore, these ts-Ab-MLV transformed scid cell lines offer a model to study the molecular nature as well as the regulation of the DNA-PK-independent pathway in coding end resolution.","['Brown, M L', 'Lew, S', 'Chang, Y']","['Brown ML', 'Lew S', 'Chang Y']","['Department of Microbiology, Arizona State University, Tempe 85287-2701, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mice, SCID', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'VDJ Recombinases']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2000 Dec 1;75(1):21-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(00)00283-2.,,"['S0165-2478(00)00283-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(00)00283-2 [doi]']",,,['CA73857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1986 and December 1995, 478 patients received TBI in our institution. The present study includes 186 adult patients who had complete remission lasting one year or more after BMT. There were 108 males and 78 females. Median age was 36.5 years (range 15-60). Initial diagnoses were lymphomas (50%), acute lymphoid leukemias (16%), acute myeloid leukemias (16%), chronic myeloid leukemia (13%), aplastic anemia (3%), and myelodysplasia (2%). At the time of BMT, 43.5% of patients were in complete response and 56.5% in partial response. Treatment consisted of a single dose TBI at 10 Gy in 9% and fractionated TBI delivering 12 to 13.5 Gy in 6 fractions in 91%. From 1986 to October 1991, TBI was performed in lateral position with 9 MV energy (57% of patients) and thereafter in alternate prone and supine positions with 15 MV energy (43%). Chemical conditioning regimen was cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg at D-4 and D-3) in 69% and CBV (cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m(2) from D-6 to D-3, BCNU 300 mg/m(2) at D-6, VP-16 200 mg/m(2) from D-6 to D-4) in 25%. Fifty eight percent of patients received autologous and 42% allogeneic BMT. All patients had clinical, biologic, and functional examinations at one-year intervals. RESULTS: Median follow-up from BMT was 49 months (range 12-136). Late pulmonary effects were observed only in functional explorations, without clinical effect, including restrictive syndrome in 8% and alteration in the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide in 12%. No patient showed clinical thyroid symptoms, and 10% developed biologic dysfunction: hypothyroidism (6.5%), thyroiditis (3%), and Basedow disease (0.5%). Ocular complications occurred in 29.5%, including cataract (15%), dry syndrome (13%), and keratitis (1.5%). In univariate and multivariate analysis, pulmonary complications were statistically increased by chronicle graft vs. host disease (GVHD) vs. no (p = 0.02), prone and supine vs. lateral TBI position (p = 0.02), and with 15 MV vs. 9 MV beam energy (p = 0.02). Cataract occurred less frequently with fractionated than with single-dose TBI (p = 0.000002). No differences were observed regarding age, sex, initial diagnosis, status at the time of BMT, conditioning chemotherapy regimen, and total dose of TBI. CONCLUSION: From this retrospective study it was shown that long-term complications of TBI were not symptomatic in most patients. The role of parameters of irradiation and especially position of treatment and beam energy should be emphasized and assessed with a longer follow-up.","['Thomas, O', 'Mahe, M', 'Campion, L', 'Bourdin, S', 'Milpied, N', 'Brunet, G', 'Lisbona, A', 'Le Mevel, A', 'Moreau, P', 'Harousseau, J', 'Cuilliere, J']","['Thomas O', 'Mahe M', 'Campion L', 'Bourdin S', 'Milpied N', 'Brunet G', 'Lisbona A', 'Le Mevel A', 'Moreau P', 'Harousseau J', 'Cuilliere J']","['Department of Radiotherapy, Centre Rene Gauducheau, Saint-Herblain, Nantes, France. olivier.thomas1@libertysurf.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Eye Diseases/*etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiation Injuries/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thyroid Diseases/*etiology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Jan 1;49(1):125-31. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(00)01373-0.,,"['S0360301600013730 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(00)01373-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From September 1988 through December 1996, 294 patients with newly diagnosed, Stage I-IV, intermediate-grade or large-cell immunoblastic lymphomas were enrolled on 2 prospective protocols at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Treatment consisted of CHOP-based chemotherapy with or without involved field radiotherapy. One hundred seventy-two patients, with 178 nodal sites and 87 nonbony, extranodal sites of disease achieved a complete response to 2-6 cycles of chemotherapy and underwent involved field radiotherapy. Total radiation doses ranged from 30.0 to 50.4 Gy (mean +/- standard deviation: 39.7 +/- 2.5 Gy) over 22-49 days using a daily fraction size of 1.3-2.3 Gy. Because various fraction sizes were delivered, the linear-quadratic model was used to convert total radiation doses to biologically equivalent doses given at 1.8 Gy per fraction (D1.8). An alpha/beta ratio of 10 Gy was used for the lymphomas, resulting in D1.8 ranging from 29.1 to 50.8 Gy. Regression tree analysis was performed on nodal sites of disease to determine which of the following factors were predictive of local control: age, tumor size, D1.8, total radiation dose, and duration of radiotherapy. Based on the results of the regression tree analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine the probability of local control per site as a function of tumor size and D1.8. Regression tree analysis was also performed on patients with nonbony disease who received D1.8 = 29.1-39.1 Gy to determine if small lymphomas could be locally controlled with relatively low doses of radiation. The log-rank test was used to compare local control curves. RESULTS: The median length of follow-up among survivors was 63 months. Regression tree analysis of nodal sites identified 3 distinct groups: (a) lymphomas < or = 10 cm and D1.8 = 29.1-39.1 Gy; (b) lymphomas < or = 10 cm and D1.8 = 39.2-50.8 Gy; and (c) lymphomas > 10 cm. For nonbony lymphomas that measured < 3.5 cm, low doses of radiation resulted in excellent local control (5-year rates: 96% vs. 97% for D1.8 = 29.1-39.1 Gy vs. D1.8 = 39.2-50.8 Gy; p = 0.610). For 3.5-10.0 cm lymphomas, higher doses of radiation resulted in better local control (5-year rates: 40% versus 98% for D1.8 = 29.1-39.1 Gy versus D1.8 = 39.2-50.8 Gy, p < 0.0001). A narrow dose range (D1.8 = 39.2-40.7 Gy) was delivered to the 8 lymphomas measuring > 10 cm that completely responded to 6 cycles of chemotherapy, resulting in a 5-year local control rate of only 70%. There was no difference in local control for nodal versus nonbony, extranodal sites of disease. CONCLUSION: D1.8 ranging from 29.1 to 39.1 Gy yielded excellent local control for nonbony lymphomas measuring < 3.5 cm that had completely responded to a median of 3 cycles of CHOP-based chemotherapy. D1.8 ranging from 39.2 to 50.8 Gy yielded excellent local control for nonbony lymphomas measuring 3.5-10.0 cm that completely responded to either 3 or 6 cycles of chemotherapy.

Cytotoxicity was associated with an initial decrease in GSH and GSSG, with a concomitant formation of the GSH adduct S-(N-phenethylthiocarbamoyl)glutathione inside cells, which was then exported from cells. After 12 hr, the cellular concentration of GSH recovered and then declined after 24 hr. Buthionine sulphoximine prevented the recovery of cellular GSH concentration and potentiated the cytotoxicity of phenethyl isothiocyanate. S-(N-phenethylthiocarbamoyl)glutathione spontaneously fragmented to GSH and phenethyl isothiocyanate, GSH oxidized to GSSG and glutathionyl-protein disulphides, and phenethyl isothiocyanate hydrolyzed to phenylethylamine. GSH and GSSG depletion was more marked in ML-1 cells than in HL60 cells. Studies with [(14)C]-labelled phenethyl isothiocyanate gave evidence of phenethylthiocarbamoylation of cells that maximized after 2-3 hr. This occurred later than the maximum concentration of S-(N-phenethylthiocarbamoyl)glutathione, but coincided with the commitment to apoptosis and cytotoxicity which developed later. The cytotoxicity of phenethyl isothiocyanate was prevented by a high concentration of GSH (15 mM) and delayed by the antioxidant and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signalling pathway inhibitor curcumin. GSH prevented and curcumin partly prevented the decrease in cellular GSH. These studies show that the cysteinyl thiol group of GSH is an important site of thiocarbamoylation by phenethyl isothiocyanate during induction of apoptosis and that this may lead to depletion of cellular GSH by efflux of the GSH conjugate. Thiocarbamoylation also occurred at other sites. The recent demonstration of a critical role for activation of caspase-8 in phenethyl isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis suggests that this thiocarbamoylation directly or indirectly leads to functional activation of a cell death receptor/adaptor protein complex.","['Xu, K', 'Thornalley, P J']","['Xu K', 'Thornalley PJ']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Central Campus, Wivenhoe Park, CO4 3SQ, Essex, Colchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Cysteine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glutathione/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Jan 15;61(2):165-77. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00526-8.,,"['S0006-2952(00)00526-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00526-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic mice specifically lacking JunB expression in the myeloid lineage (junB(-/-)Ubi-junB mice) develop a transplantable myeloproliferative disease eventually progressing to blast crisis, which resembles human chronic myeloid leukemia. Similarly, mice reconstituted with ES cell-derived junB-/- fetal liver cells also develop a myeloproliferative disease. In both cases, the absence of JunB expression results in increased numbers of granulocyte progenitors, which display enhanced GM-CSF-mediated proliferation and extended survival, associated with changes in the expression levels of the GM-CSFalpha receptor, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bclx, and the cell cycle regulators p16(INK4a) and c-Jun. Importantly, ectopic expression of JunB fully reverts the immature and hyperproliferative phenotype of JunB-deficient myeloid cells.

It has been implicated in modulation of immune responses induced during transplantation events. It is, therefore, important to define the characteristics of soluble HLA species produced by the MPase pathway. We have previously shown that some mutant peptide-conformed beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) free heavy chains (HC) with lower affinity for beta(2)m can be released into supernatants by the MPase. These soluble conformed beta(2)m-free HC intermediates can re-associate with beta(2)m in solution giving rise to beta(2)m-associated HC. We now demonstrate that also nonmutant soluble conformed beta(2)m-free HC can be detected in supernatants of activated cells. These soluble HC intermediates appear to have bound peptides and readily re-associate with exogenous beta(2)m producing beta(2)m-associated HC that are stable at physiologic temperature. Thus, generation of peptide-conformed beta(2)m-free HC intermediates is an important step, which precedes generation of both soluble beta(2)m-free and beta(2)m-associated HC by the MPase pathway operating in activated cells.","['Demaria, S', 'Bushkin, Y']","['Demaria S', 'Bushkin Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Public Health Research Institute, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'HLA Antigens/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Peptides/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Solubility', 'Solutions', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/chemistry/metabolism']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 2000 Dec;61(12):1332-8. doi: 10.1016/s0198-8859(00)00213-5.,,"['S0198885900002135 [pii]', '10.1016/s0198-8859(00)00213-5 [doi]']",,,"['AI 45761/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 59835/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Lentiviruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) are efficient at transducing nondividing, growth-arrested, and post-mitotic cells, but due to complex safety considerations, they may have limited potential for human clinical gene transfer. For this reason, alternatives to MuLV and HIV-1 vectors need to be explored. In this paper, we have found that simian foamy virus vector (SFV-1) containing a CMV-LacZ expression cassette is able to efficiently transduce multiple cell types of various species that include epithelial, lymphoid, and hematopoietic-derived human cell lines and fibroblast cell lines of several species. Previously it was reported that foamy virus replication is cell cycle dependent (P. D. Bieniasz, R. A. Weiss, and M. O. McClure, 1995. J. Virol. 69, 7295-7299). However, others studies demonstrated nuclear import of viral DNA in arrested cells (A. Saibi, F. Puvion-Dutilleul, M. Schmid, J. Peries, and H. d. The 1997. J. Virol. 71, 1155-1161). Here, we show efficient LacZ transduction by SFV-1 vectors in several chemically arrested cell lines and terminally differentiated human neurons. SFV-1 vector can transduce cell lines arrested in G1/S phase of the cell cycle by aphidicolin treatment with similar efficiencies to that of dividing cells. The terminally differentiated human neural cell line, NT2N, was transduced with 30-50% efficiency, corroborating our data obtained with the arrested cell lines. To further examine whether the SFV-1 vector can efficiently deliver a gene into clinically important cells for gene therapy, we transduced primary human peripheral blood cells (PBLs) in the presence and absence of phytohemagglutanin (PHA) stimulation. We observed 81% transduction efficiency in non-stimulated PBLs and 87% in PHA-stimulated PBLs with vector infection carried out twice in 8 hours intervals at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Together, these data indicate that SFV-1 based retroviral vectors may provide a safe, efficient alternative to current onco- and lentiviral vectors for gene transfer in cells from a broad spectrum of lineages across species boundaries.","['Mergia, A', 'Chari, S', 'Kolson, D L', 'Goodenow, M M', 'Ciccarone, T']","['Mergia A', 'Chari S', 'Kolson DL', 'Goodenow MM', 'Ciccarone T']","['Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA. mergiaa@mail.vetmed.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lac Operon', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Mice', 'Spumavirus/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2001 Feb 15;280(2):243-52. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0773.,,"['10.1006/viro.2000.0773 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90773-6 [pii]']",,,"['AI-39126/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09126-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,

Here we studied the stability factors on vesicular stomatitis viral envelope glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped MLV- and HIV-1-derived vectors. Analysis of the ratio of defective particles versus infectious units using electron microscopy and a functional transduction assay revealed that both vectors consisted of high numbers of defective particles ( approximately 100-350:1), which could be reduced ( approximately 10-20:1) by centrifugation. Frequent freeze-and-thaw rapidly decreased vector titer in the first three to five cycles and stabilized thereafter. Both viral vectors were sensitive to temperatures above 37 degrees C but more stable at temperatures below 37 degrees C, exhibiting a two-phase inactivation kinetic starting with a steep inactivation phase, followed by a more leveled phase. Interestingly, HIV-1-derived vectors were significantly more stable than MLV-derived vectors at higher temperatures (>37 degrees C). Both vectors were rapidly destabilized at pH either below or above 7.0. Incubation with human or mouse serum significantly inhibited VSV-G-pseudotyped vector activities. Preheated human serum still reduced vector half-lives to approximately 50% (150 min), suggesting that certain inactivation factors are not heat-labile.

To select phage antibodies with therapeutic potential, a synthetic human single chain Fv (scFv) phage antibody library was panned on whole premyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60). Phages binding to common receptors and undesirable phages were subtracted by incubating the library with human glioma cells. High affinity binding phages to HL60 cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. After the 6th round of selection, 50% of the selected phage antibodies showed significant binding to HL60 cells, whereas none of the analyzed phage antibodies bound to human pre-B cells (Nalm-6). In addition to binding, one scFv antibody inhibited HL60 cell proliferation by 90% compared to irrelevant scFv antibodies. Taken together the data demonstrate that specific scFv antibodies with biological functions can be isolated by using whole cells as affinity matrix.","['Shadidi, M', 'Sioud, M']","['Shadidi M', 'Sioud M']","['Institute for Cancer Research, Department of Immunology, Molecular Medicine Group, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, N-0310, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Peptide Library)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glioma/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/genetics/*immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', '*Peptide Library', 'Precancerous Conditions/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Jan 19;280(2):548-52. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.4158.,,"['10.1006/bbrc.2000.4158 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)94158-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,

An 8-h incubation of WEHI-3B cells with 100 pfu of Reg-Ad vectors/cell resulted in the whole population becoming positive for transgene expression. Under identical conditions of infection, 20-30% of mouse bone marrow (BM) cells were positive for the transgene. When RGD-Ad vectors were used, a brief exposure (10 min) of WEHI-3B cells to 150 pfu of the virus/cell was enough for 100% of the leukemia cells to become positive for the marker transgene (EGFP). Under these conditions, only 15-20% of BM cells and of primitive hematopoietic progenitors (Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells) became EGFP(+), indicating an improved selectivity of the vectors for the leukemic cells. The incubation of WEHI-3B but not normal BM cells with soluble fiber protein (FP) inhibited the infection with Reg-Ad. The use of the RGD-Ad bypassed the FP-CAR interaction required for the transduction of WEHI-3B cells with Reg-Ad, suggesting that the abrogation of this requirement accounts for the improved infectivity of these leukemic cells and for the selectivity of RGD-Ad in targeting WEHI-3B leukemia cells.","['Garcia-Castro, J', 'Segovia, J C', 'Garcia-Sanchez, F', 'Lillo, R', 'Gomez-Navarro, J', 'Curiel, D T', 'Bueren, J A']","['Garcia-Castro J', 'Segovia JC', 'Garcia-Sanchez F', 'Lillo R', 'Gomez-Navarro J', 'Curiel DT', 'Bueren JA']","['Programa de Terapia Genica, CIEMAT, and Fundacion Marcelino Botin, Madrid, 28040, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '78VO7F77PN (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oligopeptides/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2001 Jan;3(1):70-7. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2000.0221.,,"['10.1006/mthe.2000.0221 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(00)90221-1 [pii]']",,,"['R01 CA74242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL50255/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA86881-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of macrophages with either CNTFRalpha in combination with CNTF or IL-6 alone resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of an approximately 130 kD protein, presumed to be gp130. Macrophage chemotaxis induced by the combination of CNTFRalpha and CNTF was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by wortmannin, LY294002 or PD98059, suggesting the involvement of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling proteins.

CLL B-lymphocytes mature to a plasmacytoid phenotype when treated in vitro with phorbol esters. CLL B-cell apparent maturation is associated with altered expression of specific plasma membrane and mitochondrial proteins including heightened expression of a 30-kDa heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) analog. During our efforts to further characterize this hsp60 analog by mass spectrometry, we detected the mitochondrial protein prohibitin in phorbol-ester-matured CLL B-lymphocytes. Prohibitin modulates cell proliferation and inhibits cell cycle traverse in several systems, although few data are available for lymphocytes. A twofold increase in prohibitin concentration was observed in phorbol-ester-matured compared to resting CLL B-cells as determined by quantitative Western immunoblot analysis. A similar increase in prohibitin was observed in phorbol-ester-treated normal human B-lymphocyte populations. An antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the 5' coding region of the prohibitin gene blunted the increase in prohibitin protein in phorbol-ester-treated CLL B-cells by 42%.

By means of flow cytometry, we selected two populations from exponentially growing in vitro cell lines, depending on the cells' DNA synthesis activity during a preceding labeling period. For these populations we determined the time course of the percentages of cells in different phases of the cycles, sampling every 3 hr for 60 hr. Initially, semi-synchronous populations quickly converged to a stable age distribution, which is typical of the cell line (at equilibrium); this desynchronization reflects the intercell variability in cell cycle duration. By matching these experimental observations to mathematical modelling, we related the convergence rate toward the asymptotic distribution (R) and the period of the phase-percentage oscillations (T), to the mean cell cycle duration and its coefficient of variation. We give two formulas involving the above-mentioned parameters. Since T and R can be drawn by fitting our data to an asymptotic formula obtained from the model, we can estimate the other two kinetic parameters.

SAGE permits a quantitative analysis of all transcripts of a tissue or cell line. The expression of genes and ESTs mapping within a 30-cR region covering the amplicon was compared to 4 additional SAGE libraries of neuroblastomas and 12 SAGE libraries of other tissues in the CGAP databases. The IMR32 SAGE database revealed increased expression of the MEIS1 oncogene, whereas other SAGE libraries showed little or no MEIS1 expression. MEIS1 turned out to be highly amplified and overexpressed in IMR32. Analysis of 24 neuroblastoma cell lines and 22 tumors showed high-level expression in about 25% of the cases. The MEIS1 homeobox protein forms a complex with the HOXA9 and PBX proteins that are implicated in human leukemia. MEIS1 is a target of retroviral insertion in murine leukemia.

Analyses with this microarray showed that 17 genes were induced, whereas 8 genes were suppressed at least twofold during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. When repeated with the same combination of fluorescent dyes for probe labeling, the microarray produced consistent data (correlation coefficient = 0.991). In contrast, data were less consistent when repeated with the reverse combination of dyes (correlation coefficient = 0.945). The effect of dye combination was particularly evident in several genes. Total RNA (15 microg) and poly(A) RNA (0.5 microg) showed comparable sensitivity and produced essentially identical data (correlation coefficient = 0.983). The sensitivity of the DNA microarrays was slightly inferior to that of Northern blot analyses. In most genes, data obtained with the two methods were consistent. However, in 4 of 46 genes compared, DNA microarrays failed to detect the expression changes that were revealed by Northern blot. These data demonstrated that DNA microarrays provide quantitative data comparable to Northern blot in general, but a few issues must be considered when analyzing data.","['Taniguchi, M', 'Miura, K', 'Iwao, H', 'Yamanaka, S']","['Taniguchi M', 'Miura K', 'Iwao H', 'Yamanaka S']","['Department of Pharmacology, Osaka City University Medical School, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genomics. 2001 Jan 1;71(1):34-9. doi: 10.1006/geno.2000.6427.,,"['10.1006/geno.2000.6427 [doi]', 'S0888-7543(00)96427-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,

RT-PCR analysis of purified human hematopoietic cells showed that EVI9 is expressed in CD34-positive myeloid precursors, B cells, monocytes, and megakaryocytes, but only weakly in T lymphocytes, suggesting that EVI9 may play an important role in hematopoiesis. Furthermore, EVI9 was down-regulated during myeloid differentiation of HL60 cells induced by all-trans-retinoic acid, whereas the expression remained during monocytic differentiation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

In situ hybridization of normal human testis demonstrated that the expression of GLP was restricted to late meiotic germ cells. There was weak expression in late pachytene spermatocytes and strong expression in spermatids. GLP is 50% homologous to other Golgin-related proteins including the vesicle docking protein GM130. Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA with a GLP probe demonstrated numerous homologous bands outside the PML locus.

In this study two strains of mice were exposed to a rms 50-Hz magnetic field which varied randomly between 0.5 and 77 microT with an average of 2.75 microT and compared to sham-exposed groups. The male mice were exposed for 24 h per day from conception until adult age. Nighttime plasma melatonin values were determined using radioimmunoassay (n=9 for each time point). Statistical comparison was done by nonparametric 95% confidence intervals for median differences to determine nocturnal elevated melatonin values. Although a shortcoming of the study was the small sample size, no statistically significant difference in the nocturnal median elevated melatonin values between exposed and sham-exposed groups could be demonstrated.

Proliferative T cell responses were detected for all AML patients (n = 16) when irradiated leukemia blasts were used as accessory cells during activation. T cell cytokine release was also observed for all patients when nonirradiated AML accessory cells were used, and for most patients a broad cytokine response (interleukin (IL) 2, IL4, IL10, IL13, and interferon-gamma) was detected. However, both T cell proliferation and cytokine release showed a wide variation among AML patients, and T cell responsiveness was in addition dependent both on the nature of the activation signal and on differences between individual T cell clones. The accessory cell function of AML blasts showed no correlation with the release of any single immunomodulatory soluble mediator (IL1beta, IL6, TNF-alpha, soluble IL2 receptors) or the expression of any particular adhesion/costimulatory membrane molecule (CD54, CD58, CD80, and CD86) by the blasts. However, blocking studies with anti-CD58 and anti-CD80/86 monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that both pathways can be involved when AML blasts are used as accessory cells, but the relative importance and the final effects of signaling through these pathways differ between AML populations. Although there is a wide interpatient variation, we conclude that for a majority of patients the native AML blasts can mediate adequate costimulatory signals needed for accessory cell-dependent T cell activation.","['Bruserud , O', 'Ulvestad, E']","['Bruserud O', 'Ulvestad E']","['Division for Hematology, Medical Department, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology/radiation effects', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/radiation effects', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2000 Nov 25;206(1):36-50. doi: 10.1006/cimm.2000.1725.,,"['10.1006/cimm.2000.1725 [doi]', 'S0008874900917258 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,

Some of these associations are consistent with the effects of known inherited cancer susceptibility genes, shared environmental factors, or therapy.","['Evans, H S', 'Lewis, C M', 'Robinson, D', 'Bell, C M', 'Moller, H', 'Hodgson, S V']","['Evans HS', 'Lewis CM', 'Robinson D', 'Bell CM', 'Moller H', 'Hodgson SV']","[""Thames Cancer Registry, Division of Oncology, Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine, Kings College, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Feb 2;84(3):435-40. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1603.,,"['10.1054/bjoc.2000.1603 [doi]', 'S0007092000916033 [pii]']",PMC2363744,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies that have examined seasonality of these dates have produced conflicting results. Using population-based data from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours we conducted a larger study than any to date of 15 835 cases of childhood leukaemia born and diagnosed in the UK between 1953-95. We found no evidence of seasonality in either month of birth or month of diagnosis overall or in any subgroups by age, sex, histology or immunophenotype. We did however find a significant (P = 0.01) February peak in month of birth for cases born before 1960 and a significant (P = 0.02) August peak in month of diagnosis for those diagnosed before 1962. Whilst these findings may be due to chance they are also consistent with changes over time in the seasonality of exposure, or immunological response, to a relevant infection. Changes in the seasonal variation in the fatality rate of a pre-leukaemic illness, such as pneumonia, could be another explanation.","['Higgins, C D', 'dos-Santos-Silva, I', 'Stiller, C A', 'Swerdlow, A J']","['Higgins CD', 'dos-Santos-Silva I', 'Stiller CA', 'Swerdlow AJ']","['Cancer and Public Health Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', '*Seasons', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Feb 2;84(3):406-12. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1575.,,"['10.1054/bjoc.2000.1575 [doi]', 'S0007092000915751 [pii]']",PMC2363743,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanism of action has remained unclear. We have reported previously that indirubin and its analogues are potent and selective inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). In this study, we investigated the influence of indirubin and derivatives on CDK1/cyclin B kinase in human tumour cells at concentrations known to induce growth inhibition. Cells of the mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7, synchronized by serum deprivation, after serum repletion stay arrested in the G(1)/G(0)phase of the cell cycle in the presence of 2 microM indirubin-3'-monoxime. At higher drug concentrations (> or = 5 microM) an increase of the cell population in the G(2)/M phase is additionally observed. Cells synchronized in G(2)/M phase by nocodazole remain arrested in the G(2)/M phase after release, in the presence of indirubin-3'-monoxime (> or =5 microM). After 24 h treatment with 10 microM indirubin-3'-monoxime a sub-G(2)peak appears, indicative for the onset of apoptotic cell death. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with growth inhibitory concentrations of indirubin-3'-monoxime induces dose-dependent inhibition of the CDK1 activity in the cell. After 24 h treatment, a strong decrease of the CDK1 protein level along with a reduction of cyclin B in complex with CDK1 is observed. Taken together, the results of this study strongly suggest that inhibition of CDK activity in human tumour cells is a major mechanism by which indirubin derivatives exert their potent antitumour efficacy.","['Marko, D', 'Schatzle, S', 'Friedel, A', 'Genzlinger, A', 'Zankl, H', 'Meijer, L', 'Eisenbrand, G']","['Marko D', 'Schatzle S', 'Friedel A', 'Genzlinger A', 'Zankl H', 'Meijer L', 'Eisenbrand G']","['Department of Chemistry, Division of Food Chemistry and Environmental Toxicology, University of Kaiserslautern, Erwin-Schroedinger-Str. 52, Kaiserslautern, 67663, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'V86L8P74GI (indirubin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin B/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Jan;84(2):283-9. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1546.,,"['10.1054/bjoc.2000.1546 [doi]', 'S0007092000915465 [pii]']",PMC2363695,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign.'],,,,

Within the R region of the HTLV-I 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) there are seven polypyrimidine motifs. We sought to determine if these were involved in the sensitivity of proliferation to the presence of rapamycin.

Thus, quantification of possible contamination of progenitor cell apheresis with breakpoint cluster region (bcr)/Abelson murine leukemia (abl)-positive cells is of great clinical interest. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two molecular methods were compared to quantify bcr/abl positivity in leukapheresis components obtained after mobilizing chemotherapy in six patients with CML. To document the efficacy of in vivo purging, the leukapheresis procedures were monitored with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative competitive PCR (QC-PCR) as a ratio of bcr/abl:abl. RESULTS: From the first to the last leukapheresis, bcr/abl positivity in FISH increased from a median of 11 percent to 33 percent. For bcr/abl transcripts, a simultaneous increase in consecutive leukapheresis procedures was seen. The median percentage of bcr cells in a bcr/abl:abl ratio was 3.1 percent in the first apheresis. In the last apheresis after the mobilization with mRNA, the QC-PCR showed a median of 19.5 percent. FISH and QC-PCR showed a statistical significant increase of bcr/abl positivity from the first to the last apheresis. CONCLUSIONS: Both FISH and QC-PCR were reliable methods of quantifying bcr/abl positivity, and they allowed selection of the optimal apheresis component for autologous transplantation. In both methods, a significant increase in bcr/abl positivity was seen from the first to the last leukapheresis. With FISH, results can be obtained within 24 hours. This method may prevent additional contaminated leukapheresis in case of increasing percentages of bcr/abl-positive cells.","['Keil, F', 'Mitterbauer, G', 'Chen, X', 'Haas, O A', 'Kalhs, P', 'Lechner, K', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Moser, K', 'Worel, N', 'Pirc-Danoewinata, H', 'Louda, N', 'Loidolt, H', 'Rabitsch, W', 'Greinix, H T']","['Keil F', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Chen X', 'Haas OA', 'Kalhs P', 'Lechner K', 'Mannhalter C', 'Moser K', 'Worel N', 'Pirc-Danoewinata H', 'Louda N', 'Loidolt H', 'Rabitsch W', 'Greinix HT']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria. felix.kiel@ akh-wie.ac.at""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2001 Jan;41(1):111-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2001.41010111.x.,,['10.1046/j.1537-2995.2001.41010111.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

With the advent of gene cloning, large quantities of pure IFN became available for clinical study. This paper reviews the biology, pharmacology, and clinical applications of IFN formulations most commonly used in oncology. It then reviews the most common side effects seen in patients treated with IFN, and makes recommendations for the management of IFN-induced toxicity. The major oncological indications for IFN include melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, follicular lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Unfortunately, IFN therapy is associated with significant toxicity, which can be divided into constitutional, neuropsychiatric, hematologic, and hepatic effects. These toxicities have a major impact on the patient's quality of life, and on the physician's ability to optimally treat the patient. Careful attention to all aspects of patient care can result in improved tolerability of this difficult but promising therapy. CONCLUSION: a better understanding of IFN biology, indications, side effect profiles, and toxicity management will aid in optimizing its use in the treatment of patients with cancer.","['Jonasch, E', 'Haluska, F G']","['Jonasch E', 'Haluska FG']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Here, we present the structure of the NH2-terminal domain of CALM bound to phosphatidylinositol-4,5- bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] via a lysine-rich motif. This motif is found in other proteins predicted to have domains of similar structure (for example, Huntingtin interacting protein 1). The structure is in part similar to the epsin NH2-terminal (ENTH) domain, but epsin lacks the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site. Because AP180 could bind to PtdIns(4,5)P2 and clathrin simultaneously, it may serve to tether clathrin to the membrane. This was shown by using purified components and a budding assay on preformed lipid monolayers. In the presence of AP180, clathrin lattices formed on the monolayer.

Sensitivity to thiopurine cytotoxicity was not dependent on MMR (i.e., MutSalpha) competence among six cell lines tested. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis, we found that the incubation of nuclear extracts from ALL cells with synthetic 34-mer DNA duplexes containing deoxythioguanosine (G(S)) within either G(S).T or G(S).C pairs, resulted in formation of a DNA-protein complex distinct from the DNA-MutSalpha complex and unaffected by ATP. Isolation and sequence analysis of proteins involved in this DNA-protein complex identified glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a component. Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from a panel of human lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines revealed markedly different basal levels of GAPDH in nuclei, which was significantly related to thiopurine sensitivity (p = 0.001). Confocal analysis revealed markedly different intracellular distribution of GAPDH between nucleus and cytosol in six human ALL cell lines. Redistribution of GAPDH from cytosol to nucleus was evident after MP treatment. These findings indicate that a new DNA-protein complex containing GAPDH and distinct from known MMR protein-DNA complexes binds directly to thioguanylated DNA, suggesting that this may act as a sensor of structural alterations in DNA and serve as an interface between these DNA modifications and apoptosis.","['Krynetski, E Y', 'Krynetskaia, N F', 'Gallo, A E', 'Murti, K G', 'Evans, W E']","['Krynetski EY', 'Krynetskaia NF', 'Gallo AE', 'Murti KG', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Base Pair Mismatch', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA Repair/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Thioguanine/chemistry', 'Thionucleosides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2001 Feb;59(2):367-74. doi: 10.1124/mol.59.2.367.,,['10.1124/mol.59.2.367 [doi]'],,,"['R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25-23944/PHS HHS/United States', 'R37-CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, was persistently activated by paclitaxel or other microtubule-damaging agents within human leukemia HL-60 cells. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1-DN) or treatment with JNK-specific antisense oligonucleotide prevented paclitaxel-induced JNK activation, Bcl-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the full-length MEKK1 was cleaved to a 91-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment at the earlier time of apoptosis induced by microtubule-damaging agents. This cleavage, however, occurred consistently with JNK activation and Bcl-2 phosphorylation, but preceded DNA fragmentation in cells in response to paclitaxel activity. The caspase inhibitor Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (DEVD-CHO), but not Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO (Ac-YVAD-CHO), effectively blocked MEKK1 cleavage, JNK activation, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and subsequent apoptosis. Subcellular fractionation revealed that the 91-kDa C-terminal MEKK1 fragment was translocated to cytosol. Notably, the MEKK1 fragment could be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antibodies, suggesting that a signaling complex of C-terminal MEKK1/stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/JNK formed during apoptosis induced by microtubule-damaging agents. Taken together, our results suggest that disruption of cytoarchitecture by paclitaxel triggers a novel apoptosis-signaling pathway, wherein an active DEVD-directed caspase (DEVDase) initially cleaves MEKK1to generate a proapoptotic kinase fragment that is able to activate JNK and subsequent Bcl-2 phosphorylation, finally eliciting cell death.","['Shiah, S G', 'Chuang, S E', 'Kuo, M L']","['Shiah SG', 'Chuang SE', 'Kuo ML']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Toxicology, Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (DEVDase)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2001 Feb;59(2):254-62. doi: 10.1124/mol.59.2.254.,,['10.1124/mol.59.2.254 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The PML protein is induced by interferon, involved in major histocompatibility complex class I presentation, and necessary for certain types of apoptosis. Therefore, it is likely that PML bodies function in an antiviral capacity. SUMO-1 modification of PML is known to be required for the formation of PML bodies. To examine whether Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic replication interferes with PML bodies, we expressed the EBV immediate-early genes BZLF1 (Z) and BRLF1 (R) in EBV-positive cell lines and examined PML localization. Both Z and R expression resulted in PML dispersion in EBV-positive cells. Z but not R expression is sufficient to disrupt PML bodies in EBV-negative cell lines. We show that dispersion of PML bodies by Z requires a portion of the transcriptional activation domain of Z but not the DNA-binding function. As was previously reported for the HSV-1 ICP0 and CMV IE1 proteins, Z reduces the amount of SUMO-1-modified PML. We also found that Z itself is SUMO-1 modified (through amino acid 12) and that Z competes with PML for limiting amounts of SUMO-1. These results suggest that disruption of PML bodies is important for efficient lytic replication of EBV. Furthermore, Z may potentially alter the function of a variety of cellular proteins by inhibiting SUMO-1 modification.","['Adamson, A L', 'Kenney, S']","['Adamson AL', 'Kenney S']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7295, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (BZLF1 protein, Herpesvirus 4, Human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Viral Proteins', 'Virus Replication']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Mar;75(5):2388-99. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.5.2388-2399.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.5.2388-2399.2001 [doi]'],PMC114822,,"['P01 CA019014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA058853/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2-R01-CA58853/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA19014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Burkham, D. M. Coen, and S. K. Weller, J. Virol. 72:10100-10107, 1998). In this paper, we show that some, but not all, PML isoforms are recruited to stage III foci and replication compartments. Genetic experiments showed that the recruitment of PML isoforms to stage III prereplicative sites and replication compartments requires the localization of the HSV-1 polymerase protein (UL30) to these foci but does not require polymerase catalytic activity. We also examined the stages of viral infection under conditions affecting ND10 integrity. Treatment with factors that increase the stability of ND10, arsenic trioxide and the proteasome inhibitor MG132, inhibited viral disruption of ND10, formation of replication compartments, and production of progeny virus. These results strengthen the previously described correlation between ND10 disruption and productive viral infection.","['Burkham, J', 'Coen, D M', 'Hwang, C B', 'Weller, S K']","['Burkham J', 'Coen DM', 'Hwang CB', 'Weller SK']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut 06030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics/metabolism', 'Herpes Simplex/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/drug effects/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Virulence', '*Virus Replication']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Mar;75(5):2353-67. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.5.2353-2367.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.5.2353-2367.2001 [doi]'],PMC114819,,"['R01 DE010051/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'AI19838/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'A121747/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01DE10051/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI019838/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Primary Tax-induced tumors and tumor-derived cell lines exhibited functional inactivation of the p53 apoptotic pathway; such tumors and tumor cell lines were resistant to an apoptosis-inducing stimulus. In contrast, p53 mutations in tumors were found to be associated with secondary organ infiltration. Three of four identified mutations inhibited transactivation and apoptosis induction activities in vitro. Furthermore, experiments which involved mating Tax transgenic mice with p53-deficient mice demonstrated minimal acceleration in initial tumor formation, but significantly accelerated disease progression and death in mice heterozygous for p53.

Tax has been shown to modulate the activities of several cellular promoters. Existing evidence suggests that Tax need not directly bind to DNA to accomplish these effects but rather that it can act through binding to cellular factors, including members of the CREB/ATF family. Exact mechanisms of HTLV-1 transformation of cells have yet to be fully defined, but the process is likely to include both activation of cellular-growth-promoting factors and repression of cellular tumor-suppressing functions. While transcriptional activation has been well studied, transcriptional repression by Tax, reported recently from several studies, remains less well understood. Here, we show that Tax represses the TATA-less cyclin A promoter. Repression of the cyclin A promoter was seen in both ts13 adherent cells and Jurkat T lymphocytes. Two other TATA-less promoters, cyclin D3 and DNA polymerase alpha, were also found to be repressed by Tax. Interestingly, all three promoters share a common feature of at least one conserved upstream CREB/ATF binding site. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we observed that Tax altered the formation of a complex(es) at the cyclin A promoter-derived ATF site. Functionally, we correlated removal of the CREB/ATF site from the promoter with loss of repression by Tax. Furthermore, since a Tax mutant protein which binds CREB repressed the cyclin A promoter while another mutant protein which does not bind CREB did not, we propose that this Tax repression occurs through protein-protein contact with CREB/ATF.","['Kibler, K V', 'Jeang, K T']","['Kibler KV', 'Jeang KT']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TATA-Binding Protein Associated Factors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIID)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TATA-binding protein associated factor 250 kDa)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Cyclin A/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/physiology', '*TATA-Binding Protein Associated Factors', 'Trans-Activators', '*Transcription Factor TFIID', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Mar;75(5):2161-73. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.5.2161-2173.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.5.2161-2173.2001 [doi]'],PMC114800,,,,,,,,,,,

The viral receptor function of Tva is determined by a 40-residue cysteine-rich motif called the LDL-A module. In this study, we expressed and purified the wild-type (wt) Tva LDL-A module as well as several mutants and examined their in vitro folding properties. We found that, as for other LDL-A modules, correct folding and structure of the Tva LDL-A module is Ca2+ dependent. When calcium was present during in vitro protein folding, the wt module was eluted as a single peak by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Furthermore, two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy gave well-dispersed spectra in the presence of calcium. In contrast, the same protein folded in vitro in the absence of calcium was eluted as multiple broad peaks and gave a poorly dispersed NMR spectrum in the presence of calcium. The calcium affinity (Kd) of the Tva LDL-A module, determined by isothermal titration calorimetry, is approximately 40 microM. Characterization of several Tva mutants provided further evidence that calcium is important in protein folding and function of Tva. Mutations of the Ca2+-binding residues (D46A and E47A) completely abrogated the Ca2+-binding ability of Tva, and the proteins were not correctly folded. Interestingly, mutations of two non-calcium-binding residues (W48A and L34A) also exerted adverse effect on Ca2+-dependent folding, albeit to a much less extent. Our results provide new insights regarding the structure and function of Tva in ASLV-A entry.","['Wang, Q Y', 'Dolmer, K', 'Huang, W', 'Gettins, P G', 'Rong, L']","['Wang QY', 'Dolmer K', 'Huang W', 'Gettins PG', 'Rong L']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Tva receptor)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/virology', 'Avian Proteins', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calorimetry', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Folding', 'Receptors, LDL/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Avian/virology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Mar;75(5):2051-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.5.2051-2058.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.5.2051-2058.2001 [doi]'],PMC114789,,"['R01 GM054414/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 54414/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Temperature-sensitive mutations affecting the kinase domain of the protein have demonstrated that the kinase activity is absolutely required for transformation. Despite this requirement, mutations affecting other regions of v-Abl modulate transformation activity. The SH2 domain and the highly conserved FLVRES motif within it form a phosphotyrosine-binding pocket that is required for interactions between the kinase and cellular substrates. To understand the impact of SH2 alterations on Ab-MLV-mediated transformation, we studied the Ab-MLV mutant P120/R273K. This mutant encodes a v-Abl protein in which the beta B5 arginine at the base of the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket has been replaced by a lysine. Unexpectedly, infection of NIH 3T3 or pre-B cells with P120/R273K revealed a temperature-dependent transformation phenotype. At 34 degrees C, P120/R273K transformed about 10-fold fewer cells than wild-type virus of equivalent titer; at 39.5 degrees C, 300-fold fewer NIH 3T3 cells were transformed and pre-B cells were refractory to transformation. Temperature-dependent transformation was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of Shc, a protein that interacts with the v-Abl SH2 and links the protein to Ras, and decreased induction of c-Myc expression. These data suggest that alteration of the FLVRES pocket affects the ability of v-Abl to interact with at least some of its substrates in a temperature-dependent fashion and identify a novel type of temperature-sensitive Abelson virus.","['Mainville, C A', 'Parmar, K', 'Unnikrishnan, I', 'Gong, L', 'Raffel, G D', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Mainville CA', 'Parmar K', 'Unnikrishnan I', 'Gong L', 'Raffel GD', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/chemistry/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Premenopause', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Temperature', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains/*genetics']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Feb;75(4):1816-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.4.1816-1823.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.4.1816-1823.2001 [doi]'],PMC114091,,['CA 24420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

As in human CD5(+) B cells, we report here that CD5 was physically associated with the B-cell receptor (BCR) in normal bovine CD5(+) B cells. In contrast, in CD5(+) B cells from BLV-infected PL cattle, CD5 was dissociated from the BCR. In B cells from PL cattle, apoptosis decreased when cells were stimulated with antibody to surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM), while in B cells from uninfected cattle, apoptosis increased after sIgM stimulation. The functional significance of the CD5-BCR association was suggested by experimental dissociation of the CD5-BCR interaction by cross-linking of CD5. This caused CD5(+) B cells from uninfected animals to decrease apoptosis when stimulated with anti-sIgM. In contrast, in CD5(+) B cells from PL animals, in which CD5 was already dissociated from the BCR, there was no statistically significant change in apoptosis when CD5 was cross-linked and the cells were stimulated with anti-sIgM. Disruption of CD5-BCR interactions and subsequent decreased apoptosis and increased survival in antigenically stimulated B cells may be a mechanism of BLV-induced PL.","['Cantor, G H', 'Pritchard, S M', 'Dequiedt, F', 'Willems, L', 'Kettmann, R', 'Davis, W C']","['Cantor GH', 'Pritchard SM', 'Dequiedt F', 'Willems L', 'Kettmann R', 'Davis WC']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164-7040, USA. gcantor@vetmed.wsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/physiopathology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Feb;75(4):1689-96. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.4.1689-1696.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.4.1689-1696.2001 [doi]'],PMC114078,,['K08 AI01198/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

For example, axotomy of sympathetic neurons in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) dramatically increases levels of galanin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and substance P and their respective mRNAs and decreases mRNA levels for neuropeptide Y (NPY) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Axotomy of sensory neurons in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) increases protein and mRNA levels for galanin and VIP and decreases levels for substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). To assess whether reduction in the availability of endogenous NGF might play an important role in triggering these changes, we injected nonoperated animals with an antiserum against NGF (alphaNGF). alphaNGF increased levels of peptide and mRNA for galanin and VIP in neurons in both the SCG and DRG. NPY protein and mRNA were decreased in the SCG, but levels of TH protein and mRNA remained unchanged. In sensory neurons the levels of SP and CGRP protein decreased after alphaNGF treatment. These data suggest that the reduction in levels of NGF in sympathetic and sensory neurons after axotomy is partly responsible for the subsequent changes in neuropeptide expression.

Despite a large number of neurotrophic molecules with survival-promoting activity for isolated embryonic motoneurons, those factors that are required for motoneuron survival during development are still not known. Cytokines of the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) family have been shown to play a role in motoneuron (MN) survival. Importantly, in mice lacking the LIFRbeta or the CNTFRalpha there is a significant loss of MNs during embryonic development. Because genetic deletion of either (or both) CNTF or LIF fails, by contrast, to perturb MN survival before birth, it was concluded that another ligand exists that is functionally inactivated in the receptor deleted mice, resulting in MN loss during development. One possible candidate for this ligand is the CNTF-LIF family member cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). CT-1 is highly expressed in embryonic skeletal muscle, secreted by myotubes, and promotes the survival of cultured embryonic mouse and rat MNs. Here we show that ct-1 deficiency causes increased motoneuron cell death in spinal cord and brainstem nuclei of mice during a period between embryonic day 14 and the first postnatal week. Interestingly, no further loss was detectable during the subsequent postnatal period, and nerve lesion in young adult ct-1-deficient mice did not result in significant additional loss of motoneurons, as had been previously observed in mice lacking both CNTF and LIF. CT-1 is the first bona fide muscle-derived neurotrophic factor to be identified that is required for the survival of subgroups of developing motoneurons.","['Oppenheim, R W', 'Wiese, S', 'Prevette, D', 'Armanini, M', 'Wang, S', 'Houenou, L J', 'Holtmann, B', 'Gotz, R', 'Pennica, D', 'Sendtner, M']","['Oppenheim RW', 'Wiese S', 'Prevette D', 'Armanini M', 'Wang S', 'Houenou LJ', 'Holtmann B', 'Gotz R', 'Pennica D', 'Sendtner M']","['Department of Neurobiology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Axotomy', 'Brain Stem/embryology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Facial Nerve', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/embryology/innervation/*metabolism', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/embryology/metabolism/pathology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2001 Feb 15;21(4):1283-91.,,['21/4/1283 [pii]'],PMC6762241,,"['R01 NS020402/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS20402/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS36945/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

FMuLV(gag) is also expressed by the FBL leukemia, and is the immunodominant tumor Ag of the CD8(+) T cell response in C57BL/6 mice. gag-TG mice expressing FMuLV(gag) in the liver were tolerant to the protein and failed to generate a CTL response to either FBL or FMuLV(gag). This tolerance reflected anergy rather than deletion, as CTL responsiveness could be recovered after four cycles of in vitro stimulation. Adoptively transferred gag-specific T cells were not anergized in gag-TG recipients, as revealed by antitumor activity in vivo. Also, such T cells did not induce detectable autoimmune injury in gag-TG liver cells. These results suggest that the requirements for a tissue Ag to provide a tolerizing stimulus are distinct from those for being the target of a T cell-mediated autoimmune response and that the requirements for induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance are distinct for naive and primed T cells.

We showed that transient HTLV-I Tax expression lead to increased IL-15Ralpha mRNA levels. In addition, by using a reporter construct that bears the human IL-15Ralpha promoter, we demonstrated that Tax expression increased promoter activity by at least 4-fold. Furthermore, using promoter deletion constructs and gel shift analysis, we defined a functional NF-kappaB-binding motif in the human IL-15Ralpha promoter, suggesting that Tax activation of IL-15Ralpha is due, in part, to the induction of NF-kappaB.

These findings suggest a role for IL-15Ralpha in aberrant T cell proliferation observed in HTLV-I-associated diseases.","['Mariner, J M', 'Lantz, V', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Azimi, N']","['Mariner JM', 'Lantz V', 'Waldmann TA', 'Azimi N']","['Metabolism Branch, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. marinerj@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/immunology', 'Protein Binding/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Transcription, Genetic/immunology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Feb 15;166(4):2602-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.4.2602.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.4.2602 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF283296'],

We examined edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cytokine responses following CFA injection in the adult mouse footpad. Inflammatory cell infiltration and edema are significantly enhanced when CFA is injected in LIF knockout mice as compared with injection of wild-type littermates. Moreover, local injection of an adenoviral vector encoding LIF suppresses both measures of inflammation. In contrast, injection of an adenoviral vector encoding beta-galactosidase has no discernable effect on inflammation. In addition, comparison of the CFA responses in LIF knockout vs wild-type skin reveals that LIF is an important regulator of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-7, IL-2Ralpha, and IFN-gamma in cutaneous inflammation. These and our previous data indicate that both endogenous and exogenous LIF are anti-inflammatory in the CFA model and that LIF is a key regulator of the cytokine cascade.

Furthermore, PTX-B suppressed the replication of T cell-tropic (X4) viruses at a postentry level in the same cells. In this study we demonstrate that PTX-B profoundly impairs entry and replication of the HIV-1(ADA) (R5), as well as of HIV pseudotyped with either murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus envelopes, in primary monocyte-derived macrophages. In addition, PTX-B strongly inhibited X4 HIV-1 replication in U937 promonocytic cells and virus expression in the U937-derived chronically infected U1 cell line stimulated with cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. Of interest, TNF-alpha-mediated activation of the cellular transcription factor NF-kappaB was unaffected by PTX-B. Therefore, PTX-B may represent a novel and potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication to be tested for efficacy in infected individuals.

Here, we studied the functional relationship among PI3-kinase, its effector protein kinase B (PKB), and Rac using inhibitors of PI3-kinase and toxins inhibiting Rac. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, blocked FcepsilonRI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma, inositol phosphate formation, calcium mobilization, and secretion of hexosaminidase. Similarly, Clostridium difficile toxin B, which inactivates all Rho GTPases including Rho, Rac and Cdc42, and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, which inhibits Rac (possibly Cdc42) but not Rho, blocked these responses. Stimulation of the FcepsilonRI receptor induced a rapid increase in the GTP-bound form of Rac. Whereas toxin B inhibited the Rac activation, PI3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) had no effect on activation of Rac. In line with this, wortmannin had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav. Wortmannin, toxin B, and lethal toxin inhibited phosphorylation of PKB on Ser(473). Similarly, translocation of the pleckstrin homology domain of PKB tagged with the green fluorescent protein to the membrane, which was induced by activation of the FcepsilonRI receptor, was blocked by inhibitors of PI3-kinase and Rac inactivation. Our results indicate that in rat basophilic leukemia cells Rac and PI3-kinase regulate PKB and suggest that Rac is functionally located upstream and/or parallel of PI3-kinase/PKB in FcepsilonRI signaling.","['Djouder, N', 'Schmidt, G', 'Frings, M', 'Cavalie, A', 'Thelen, M', 'Aktories, K']","['Djouder N', 'Schmidt G', 'Frings M', 'Cavalie A', 'Thelen M', 'Aktories K']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie der Universitat Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/immunology', 'Calcium Signaling/immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/immunology', 'Cytoskeleton/enzymology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Feb 1;166(3):1627-34. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.3.1627.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.3.1627 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, using an antisense oligonucleotide approach to diminish STAT3 expression, we found that Fas sensitivity was restored in leukemic LGL. AG-490-induced apoptosis in leukemic LGL was independent of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 expression. However, we found that the Bcl-2-family protein Mcl-1 was significantly reduced by AG-490 treatment. Activated STAT3 was shown to bind an SIE-related element in the murine mcl-1 promoter. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that v-src overexpression in NIH3T3 induced STAT3-dependent transcriptional activity from the mcl-1 promoter and increased endogenous Mcl-1 protein levels.

As glucocorticoids induce apoptosis in numerous cell types, we investigated the role of glucocorticoids in the control of apoptosis in immortalized human granulosa cells (HO-23) transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of p53 (Val(135)). When HO-23 were incubated with forskolin in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (Dex) at 32 or 37 C, progesterone production was higher by 4- and 8-fold in the presence of Dex at 37 or 32 C, respectively (P: < 0. 01). The expression of adrenodoxin (ADX), which is an intrinsic part of the cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme system, remained the same in the presence or absence of Dex in forskolin-stimulated cells. Dex reduced apoptosis (to 33% of control) in cultures after activation of p53 by shifting the temperature from 37 to 32 C. Moreover, Dex suppressed apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (to 40% of control) or forskolin stimulation (to 28% and 40% at 37 and at 32 C, respectively). The protective effect of Dex on cAMP-, p53-, and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis was confirmed by both 4',6-diamido-2-phenylindole hydrochloride DNA staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling with an ED(50) of 7 nM Dex. Hydrocortisone showed a similar antiapoptotic effect. The protective effect of glucocorticoids against apoptosis was completely abolished by RU486 when cells were coincubated with 10 nM Dex and 10-100 nM RU486. The protection against apoptosis by glucocorticoid involved a sharp elevation in intracellular levels of Bcl-2 (3-7.6 fold; P: < 0.01). In contrast to the effect of Dex in the prevention of apoptosis in HO-23 granulosa cells, Dex dramatically stimulated apoptosis by 3-fold in LTR-6 myeloid leukemia cells expressing the same temperature-sensitive mutant (Val(135) p53) and the same amount of glucocorticoid receptor-alpha. Forskolin did not stimulate apoptosis when incubated with these cells. However, it augmented by 1.2-fold the p53-induced apoptosis in cells shifted from 37 to 32 C. Dex further enhanced apoptosis by 1.9-fold in p53-activated cultures (32 C). Incubation of the cells with Dex dramatically reduced Bcl-2 levels to 15% of control at 37 C (P: < 0.01) or 32 C in the presence or absence of forskolin (P: < 0.01). Our data suggest that glucocorticoids exert a protective effect against induced apoptosis in immortalized granulosa cells and a stimulatory effect on apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells. Moreover, modulation of Bcl-2 levels plays an important role in mediating the glucocorticoid effect on cell survival. The opposite effect of glucocorticoids on Bcl-2 levels in the two cell lines may be due to the different ontogeneses of the two cell types: epithelial for granulosa cells vs. mesenchymal for myeloid cells studied in the present work.","['Sasson, R', 'Tajima, K', 'Amsterdam, A']","['Sasson R', 'Tajima K', 'Amsterdam A']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', '*Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*physiology', 'Granulosa Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Progesterone/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2001 Feb;142(2):802-11. doi: 10.1210/endo.142.2.7942.,,['10.1210/endo.142.2.7942 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It confers resistance to multiple drugs including paclitaxel, an agent useful in treating malignancies including acute leukemia. Pgp-mediated drug resistance appears to be due to primary active drug-transport as well as other effects on membrane permeability, but the relative contribution of each is unclear. Flow cells are useful for differentiating transport-mediated efflux from altered membrane permeability, but their utility is limited to attached cells. We developed a novel flow cell to study drug efflux kinetics in suspension culture cells and examined paclitaxel efflux in resistant CEM/VLB100 leukemia cells, which overexpress Pgp, compared with its sensitive CEM parent line. Paclitaxel efflux from both cell lines was described by bi-exponential kinetics. The predominant initial rapid component increased linearly with paclitaxel concentration, consistent with passive efflux, and was faster in CEM/VLB100 than CEM cells. The slow terminal component of efflux was also more rapid for CEM/VLB100 than CEM, and was saturable (V(max)= 9.1 +/- 1.1 versus 3.5 +/- 0.3 pmol/min/10(7) cells, respectively) at a lower paclitaxel concentration than the parental CEM cells (k(m) = 63 +/- 46 nM versus 144 +/- 56 nM, respectively). In CEM/VLB100 cells, this saturable component was inhibited by verapamil and was temperature-sensitive, consistent with Pgp-mediated transport. Verapamil also inhibited the rapid component of efflux, suggesting additional effects on membrane permeability. Our studies show that the present technique is useful for studying drug transport and that effects of Pgp on membrane permeability contribute significantly to the net drug-accumulation defect.","['Lin, J T', 'Sharma, R', 'Grady, J J', 'Awasthi, S']","['Lin JT', 'Sharma R', 'Grady JJ', 'Awasthi S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, TX 77555-0565, USA. jlin@utmb.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacokinetics', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2001 Feb;29(2):103-10.,,,,,['CA63660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Because suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are negative regulators of cytokine-induced signaling, it has been hypothesized that an aberrant SOCS expression plays a role in neoplastic transformation. This study reports on a constitutive SOCS-3 expression in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines. SOCS-3 protein is constitutively expressed in tumor cell lines (but not in nonmalignant T cells) obtained from affected skin from a patient with mycosis fungoides (MF) and from peripheral blood from a patient with Sezary syndrome (SS). In contrast, constitutive SOCS-3 expression is not found in the leukemic Jurkat T-cell line, the MOLT-4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, and the monocytic leukemic cell line U937. Expression of SOCS-3 coincides with a constitutive activation of STAT3 in CTCL tumor cells, and stable transfection of CTCL tumor cells with a dominant negative STAT3 strongly inhibits SOCS-3 expression, whereas transfection with wild-type STAT3 does not. Moreover, the reduced SOCS-3 expression in cells transfected with the dominant negative STAT3 is associated with an increased sensitivity to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). In conclusion, evidence is provided for a constitutive SOCS-3 expression in cancer cells obtained from patients with CTCL. Moreover, the findings indicate that the aberrant expression of SOCS-3 is mediated by a constitutive activation of STAT3 in CTCL cells and affects the IFN-alpha sensitivity of these cells.

Our data show that monospecific Ig light chain expression is in about 90% of cases determined by ordered recombination: Igkappa gene (IGK) rearrangements, followed by IGK deletions and Iglambda gene (IGL) rearrangements, resulting in the presence of only one functional Ig light chain rearrangement. In about 10% (10 cases), 2 functional Ig light chain rearrangements (IGK/IGL or IGL/IGL, but not IGK/IGK) were identified. This might be explained by the fact that regulation of the ordered recombination process is not fully strict, particularly when the IGL locus is involved. Unfavorable somatic mutations followed by receptor editing might have contributed to this finding. Eight of these 10 cases indeed contained somatic mutations. In cases with 2 functional Ig light chain rearrangements, both alleles were transcribed, but monospecific Ig expression was still maintained. This suggests that in these cases allelelic exclusion is not regulated at the messenger RNA level but either at the level of translation or protein stability or via preferential pairing of Ig light and Ig heavy chains. Nevertheless, ordered rearrangement processes are the main determinant for monospecific Ig light chain expression.","['van der Burg, M', 'Tumkaya, T', 'Boerma, M', 'de Bruin-Versteeg, S', 'Langerak, A W', 'van Dongen, J J']","['van der Burg M', 'Tumkaya T', 'Boerma M', 'de Bruin-Versteeg S', 'Langerak AW', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam/ University Hospital Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Feb 15;97(4):1001-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.4.1001.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.4.1001 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56311-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore whether there is genetic variation in HTLV-I tax that can escape CTL recognition during the development of ATL, the HTLV-I tax gene was sequenced in 55 patients with ATL, 61 patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and 62 healthy carriers, and it was correlated with the presence of HLA-A*02. First, a premature stop codon in the 5' half of the tax gene that looses transactivation activity on the viral enhancer was observed in 3 patients with acute and 1 patient with chronic ATL. This stop codon was revealed to emerge after the viral transmission to the patient from sequence analysis in family members with ATL. Second, amino acid change in Tax peptide 11-19 was observed in 3 patients with ATL. CTL assays demonstrated that this altered Tax 11-19 peptide, observed in ATL patients with HLA-A*02, was not recognized by Tax 11-19-specific CTL. Two patients with ATL had large deletions in tax by sequencing, and 5 patients with ATL had deletions in HTLV-I by Southern blotting. These findings suggest that at some stage of ATL development, HTLV-I-infected cells that can escape the host immune system are selected and have a chance to accumulate genetic alterations for further malignant transformation, leading to acute ATL.","['Furukawa, Y', 'Kubota, R', 'Tara, M', 'Izumo, S', 'Osame, M']","['Furukawa Y', 'Kubota R', 'Tara M', 'Izumo S', 'Osame M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine and the Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan. furukawy@m2.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Codon, Terminator)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)']",IM,"['*Codon, Terminator', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/immunology', '*Genes, pX', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Surveillance', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*virology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Feb 15;97(4):987-93. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.4.987.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.4.987 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56309-X [pii]']",,,,['Blood. 2001 Feb 15;97(4):833.

At present, mDYRK-3 and mDYRK-2 have been cloned, and mDYRK-3 has been characterized with respect to kinase activity, expression among tissues and hematopoietic cells, and possible function during erythropoiesis. In sequence, mDYRK-3 diverges markedly in noncatalytic domains from mDYRK-2 and mDYRK-1a, but is 91.3% identical overall to hDYRK-3. Catalytically, mDYRK-3 readily phosphorylated myelin basic protein (but not histone 2B) and also appeared to autophosphorylate in vitro. Expression of mDYRK-1a, mDYRK-2, and mDYRK-3 was high in testes, but unlike mDYRK1a and mDYRK 2, mDYRK-3 was not expressed at appreciable levels in other tissues examined. Among hematopoietic cells, however, mDYRK-3 expression was selectively elevated in erythroid cell lines and primary pro-erythroid cells. In developmentally synchronized erythroid progenitor cells, expression peaked sharply following exposure to erythropoietin plus stem cell factor (SCF) (but not SCF alone), and in situ hybridizations of sectioned embryos revealed selective expression of mDYRK-3 in fetal liver. Interestingly, antisense oligonucleotides to mDYRK-3 were shown to significantly and specifically enhance colony-forming unit-erythroid colony formation. Thus, it is proposed that mDYRK-3 kinase functions as a lineage-restricted, stage-specific suppressor of red cell development.

For example, adoptive transfer of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been effective prophylaxis and treatment of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease in immunocompromised patients. For all immunotherapies, however, there has been a hypothetical concern that mutations in tumor-specific antigens may lead to tumor escape. We now demonstrate that such events may indeed occur, with lethal outcome. A patient who developed lymphoma after marrow transplantation received donor-derived, EBV-specific CTLs but died with progressive disease. The tumor cells proved substantially less sensitive to cytolysis than the EBV-transformed B-cell line used for CTL generation. The major cytolytic activity of the donor CTL was directed against 2 HLA-A11-restricted epitopes in the viral EBNA-3B antigen. Sequence analysis of this gene in the tumor virus revealed a 245-base pair deletion, which removed these 2 CTL epitopes. Hence, the viral antigen in the tumor had mutated in a way that allowed escape from CTLs. Analysis of EBV polymorphisms demonstrated that before CTL infusion, more than one virus was present, including a virus with wild-type EBNA-3B. After CTL infusion, only the virus with the EBNA-3B deletion could be detected, suggesting that the infused CTLs had selected a resistant strain in vivo. Such an occurrence, even when polyclonal CTL lines are used against genetically stable virus antigens, suggests that escape mutants may be a serious problem when CTL therapy is directed against more unstable tumor cell-derived targets.","['Gottschalk, S', 'Ng, C Y', 'Perez, M', 'Smith, C A', 'Sample, C', 'Brenner, M K', 'Heslop, H E', 'Rooney, C M']","['Gottschalk S', 'Ng CY', 'Perez M', 'Smith CA', 'Sample C', 'Brenner MK', 'Heslop HE', 'Rooney CM']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (EBNA-3B antigen)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A11 Antigen)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed/immunology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Progression', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/*immunology/transmission/virology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', '*Genes, Viral', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-A11 Antigen', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/genetics/*immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics']",,2001/02/13 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/13 11:00'],"['2001/02/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Feb 15;97(4):835-43. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.4.835.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.4.835 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56286-1 [pii]']",,,['R01 CA61384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Blood. 2001 Feb 15;97(4):833.

In this study, the frequency, clinical manifestations, and informative diagnostic tests for UMS are described. DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients with UMS were identified in a cohort of 828 consecutive patients with uveitis. The mean follow-up was 4.5 years. METHODS: A review of clinical, laboratory, photographic, and angiographic records was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features, associated systemic diseases, diagnostic procedures and their role in the diagnostic process, and systemic and visual outcomes. RESULTS: Nineteen patients had intraocular malignancy (48% of all with UMS; 2.3% of all with uveitis), mainly intraocular lymphoma (n = 13) and leukemia (n = 3). The ophthalmologist was the first to recognize malignant disease in 11 of 19 patients (58%). Of 21 patients with nonmalignant UMS, 10 had an ocular vascular disease and 5 a hereditary ocular disorder. The patients with malignant UMS were older than those with nonmalignant UMS (average age, 50 vs 44 years, P: < 0.05). During follow-up, 9 of 19 patients with malignant UMS died. The most informative diagnostic procedure for malignant UMS was intraocular fluid analysis; for nonmalignant UMS, fluorescein angiography. The cytologic analysis of intraocular fluids yielded the best results for diagnosing intraocular malignancies (7 of 11 patients, 64%); the association of negative cytologic results with the recent administration of systemic corticosteroids was noted. Immunophenotyping of the aqueous confirmed the diagnosis of hematologic malignancy for 3 of 5 patients examined. Panuveitis was the most frequent manifestation of malignant UMS. Intraocular lymphomas presented with isolated vitreitis (n = 6), chorioretinal lesions (n = 5) and iris infiltration (n = 2). Clinical presentation of nonmalignant UMS was diverse but consisted mainly of abnormalities of the retinal vasculature. CONCLUSIONS: UMS was diagnosed in 5% of the patients with uveitis at a tertiary center. Despite the variety of underlying disorders and different clinical presentations, a high frequency of malignant and vascular diseases was found. Awareness of the clinical manifestations of UMS and application of the correct diagnostic procedures should promote timely diagnosis and treatment, which are essential not only for visual acuity but also for the life of the patient.","['Rothova, A', 'Ooijman, F', 'Kerkhoff, F', 'Van Der Lelij, A', 'Lokhorst, H M']","['Rothova A', 'Ooijman F', 'Kerkhoff F', 'Van Der Lelij A', 'Lokhorst HM']","['F.C.

Normal cytogenetics (CN) constitutes the single largest group, while trisomy 8 (+8) as a sole abnormality is the most frequent trisomy. How trisomy contributes to tumorigenesis is unknown. We used oligonucleotide-based DNA microarrays to study global gene expression in AML+8 patients with +8 as the sole chromosomal abnormality and AML-CN patients. CD34(+) cells purified from normal bone marrow (BM) were also analyzed as a representative heterogeneous population of stem and progenitor cells. Expression patterns of AML patients were clearly distinct from those of CD34(+) cells of normal individuals. We show that AML+8 blasts overexpress genes on chromosome 8, estimated at 32% on average, suggesting gene-dosage effects underlying AML+8. Systematic analysis by cellular function indicated up-regulation of genes involved in cell adhesion in both groups of AML compared with CD34(+) blasts from normal individuals. Perhaps most interestingly, apoptosis-regulating genes were significantly down-regulated in AML+8 compared with AML-CN. We conclude that the clinical and cytogenetic heterogeneity of AML is due to fundamental biological differences.","['Virtaneva, K', 'Wright, F A', 'Tanner, S M', 'Yuan, B', 'Lemon, W J', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'de La Chapelle , A', 'Krahe, R']","['Virtaneva K', 'Wright FA', 'Tanner SM', 'Yuan B', 'Lemon WJ', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Bloomfield CD', 'de La Chapelle A', 'Krahe R']","['Division of Human Cancer Genetics and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reference Values', '*Trisomy']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jan 30;98(3):1124-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.98.3.1124.,,"['10.1073/pnas.98.3.1124 [doi]', '98/3/1124 [pii]']",PMC14719,,"['U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM58934/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Pdx-1 heterozygotes develop normally, but they display glucose intolerance in adulthood. Like certain other homeobox proteins, PDX-1 contains a consensus FPWMK motif that promotes heterodimer formation with the ubiquitous homeodomain protein PBX. To evaluate the importance of PDX-1:PBX complexes in pancreatic morphogenesis and glucose homeostasis, we expressed either wild-type or PBX interaction defective PDX-1 transgenes under control of the PDX-1 promoter. Both wild-type and mutant PDX-1 transgenes corrected glucose intolerance in pdx-1 heterozygotes. The wild-type PDX-1 transgene rescued the development of all pancreatic lineages in pdx-1(-/-) animals, and these mice survived to adulthood. In contrast, pancreata from pdx-1(-/-) mice expressing the mutant PDX-1 transgene were hypoplastic, and these mice died within 3 weeks of birth from pancreatic insufficiency. All pancreatic cell types were observed in pdx-1(-/-) mice expressing the mutant PDX-1 transgene; but the islets were smaller, and increased numbers of islet hormone-positive cells were noted within the ductal epithelium. These results indicate that PDX-1:PBX complexes are dispensable for glucose homeostasis and for differentiation of stem cells into ductal, endocrine, and acinar lineages; but they are essential for expansion of these populations during development.","['Dutta, S', 'Gannon, M', 'Peers, B', 'Wright, C', 'Bonner-Weir, S', 'Montminy, M']","['Dutta S', 'Gannon M', 'Peers B', 'Wright C', 'Bonner-Weir S', 'Montminy M']","['Clayton Laboratories for Peptide Biology, The Salk Institute, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 protein)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Death', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Islets of Langerhans/cytology/growth & development/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Pancreas/cytology/growth & development/*physiology', 'Pancreatic Ducts/cytology/growth & development/physiology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Trans-Activators/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jan 30;98(3):1065-70. doi: 10.1073/pnas.031561298.

We wanted to examine the intracellular distribution of PML protein in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. We used high-resolution microscopy to study the distribution of PML protein and other POD-associated proteins along with the proteasomes themselves under normal conditions and in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Inhibition of the proteasomes in MCF-7, HeLa, and IB-4 cell lines resulted in a radical redistribution of the POD-associated proteins PML, Sp100, and SUMO-1. After 6-10 h of MG132 treatment, PML, Sp100, and SUMO-1 were no longer detectable in the PODs and accumulated mainly in the nucleolus. Moreover, MG132 treatment changed the cellular distribution of the proteasomes. Interestingly, this included the accumulation in euchromatin areas of the nucleus and within the nucleoli. Several non-POD-associated proteins did not change their cellular distribution under the same conditions. The accumulation of POD-associated proteins and proteasomes in the nucleoli of MG132-treated cells indicates that these proteins may target the nucleoli under normal conditions and that the nucleolus may have a function in the regulation of proteasomal protein degradation.","['Mattsson, K', 'Pokrovskaja, K', 'Kiss, C', 'Klein, G', 'Szekely, L']","['Mattsson K', 'Pokrovskaja K', 'Kiss C', 'Klein G', 'Szekely L']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, S-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Transport', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jan 30;98(3):1012-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.031566998.

METHODS: In the present in vitro study, the effect of calcitriol, uraemic ultrafiltrate (UUF) and a combination of both on the human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, HL-60, was studied by evaluating bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into the DNA, luminol-amplified chemiluminescence (CL) production, expression of CD14, and levels of vitamin D receptor mRNA (VDR mRNA) and CD14 mRNA. RESULTS: The ability of calcitriol to block cell proliferation (37.4+/-5.4 to 30.5+/-5.6% cells incorporating BrdU, P:<0.01) was neutralized when UUF was applied together with calcitriol (53.4+/-21.3% cells incorporating BrdU, P:<0.01 vs calcitriol alone). Similarly to what was observed for BrdU incorporation, the CL production of HL-60 cells was enhanced in the presence of calcitriol (20126+/-10154 to 61528+/-24021 cpm, P:<0.01), and was suppressed again in the presence of calcitriol and UUF (20916+/-12075 cpm, P:<0.01 vs calcitriol alone); finally UUF also inhibited the calcitriol-induced CD14 expression (71.1+/-11.2 to 54.9+/-17.7% CD14 positive cells, P:<0.05). On the other hand, the calcitriol-induced CD14 mRNA levels were not significantly different in the presence of calcitriol and UUF compared to calcitriol alone. This points to an inhibition by UUF at a post-transcriptional level. Similar data were found for VDR mRNA levels. UUF was fractionated by HPLC in four fractions, hydrophilic uraemic solutes being eluted first (F1) and hydrophobic solutes being eluted last (F4); fractions 1, 2 and 3 simultaneously affected both BrdU incorporation and CL production in a significant way. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that UUF contains factors that impair calcitriol-activated function of HL-60 cells. Hence, the differentiation and immune response of these promyelocytic leukaemia cells, as induced by the supplementation of calcitriol, is neutralized in the presence of uraemic biological fluids. This may be of relevance for the propensity to infection and malignancy of the uraemic patient.","['Glorieux, G', 'Hsu, C', 'De Smet , R', 'Dhondt, A', 'van Emmelo , J', 'Waterloos, M A', 'Lameire, N', 'Plum, J', 'Vanholder, R']","['Glorieux G', 'Hsu C', 'De Smet R', 'Dhondt A', 'van Emmelo J', 'Waterloos MA', 'Lameire N', 'Plum J', 'Vanholder R']","['Renal Division, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Gent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",8706402,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/*antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ultrafiltration', 'Uremia/*metabolism']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2001 Feb;16(2):246-52. doi: 10.1093/ndt/16.2.246.,,['10.1093/ndt/16.2.246 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphorylation of Bcl2 at serine 70 is required for suppression of apoptosis in interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid cells deprived of IL-3 or treated with antileukemic drugs and can result from agonist activation of mitochondrial protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha). However, we have recently found that high concentrations of staurosporine up to 1 microM: can only partially inhibit IL-3-stimulated Bcl2 phosphorylation but completely block PKCalpha-mediated Bcl2 phosphorylation in vitro, indicating the existence of a non-PKC, staurosporine-resistant Bcl2 kinase (SRK). Although the RAF-1MEK-1-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is required for factor-dependent mitogenic signaling, a direct role in antiapoptosis signaling is not clear. In particular, the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of death substrates is not yet clear. Our findings indicate a potential role for the MEK/MAPK pathway in addition to PKC in antiapoptosis signaling, involving Bcl2 phosphorylation that features a role for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and 2 as SRKs. These findings indicate a novel role for ERK1 and 2 as molecular links between proliferative and survival signaling and may, at least in part, explain the apparent paradox by which Bcl2 may suppress staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Although the effect of phosphorylation on Bcl2 function is not clear, effector molecules that regulate Bcl2 phosphorylation may have clinical significance in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who express detectable levels of Bcl2. Preliminary findings suggest that expression of PKCalpha, ERK2, and Bax in leukemic blast cells from patients with AML, although individually not prognostic, appears to have potential clinical value in predicting chemoresistance and survival outcomes.","['Deng, X', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Ruvolo, P P', 'May, W S Jr']","['Deng X', 'Kornblau SM', 'Ruvolo PP', 'May WS Jr']","['University of Florida Shands Cancer Center, Gainesville 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Concerns about possible carcinogenic effects of radiofrequency signals have been raised, although they are based on limited scientific evidence. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of cancer incidence was conducted in Denmark of all users of cellular telephones during the period from 1982 through 1995. Subscriber lists from the two Danish operating companies identified 420 095 cellular telephone users. Cancer incidence was determined by linkage with the Danish Cancer Registry. All statistical tests are two-sided. RESULTS: Overall, 3391 cancers were observed with 3825 expected, yielding a significantly decreased standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86 to 0.92). A substantial proportion of this decreased risk was attributed to deficits of lung cancer and other smoking-related cancers. No excesses were observed for cancers of the brain or nervous system (SIR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.81 to 1.12) or of the salivary gland (SIR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.29 to 1.49) or for leukemia (SIR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.78-1.21), cancers of a priori interest. Risk for these cancers also did not vary by duration of cellular telephone use, time since first subscription, age at first subscription, or type of cellular telephone (analogue or digital). Analysis of brain and nervous system tumors showed no statistically significant SIRs for any subtype or anatomic location. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation, the first nationwide cancer incidence study of cellular phone users, do not support the hypothesis of an association between use of these telephones and tumors of the brain or salivary gland, leukemia, or other cancers.","['Johansen, C', 'Boice, J Jr', 'McLaughlin, J', 'Olsen, J']","['Johansen C', 'Boice J Jr', 'McLaughlin J', 'Olsen J']","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark. christof@cancer.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', '*Telephone']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Feb 7;93(3):203-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/93.3.203.,,['10.1093/jnci/93.3.203 [doi]'],,,,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Feb 7;93(3):166-7.

We show here that a novel t(10;16)(q22;p13) in a childhood AML M5a leads to a MORF-CBP chimera. RT-PCR using MORF forward and CBP reverse primers amplified a MORF-CBP fusion in which nucleotide 3103 of MORF was fused in-frame with nucleotide 284 of CBP. Nested RT-PCR with CBP forward and MORF reverse primers generated a CBP-MORF transcript in which nucleotide 283 of CBP was fused in-frame with nucleotide 3104 of MORF. Genomic analyses revealed that the breaks were close to Alu elements in intron 16 of MORF and intron 2 of CBP and that duplications had occurred near the breakpoints. A database search using MORF cDNA enabled us to construct an exon-intron map of the MORF gene. The MORF-CBP protein retains the zinc fingers, two nuclear localization signals, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, a portion of the acidic domain of MORF and the CBP protein downstream of codon 29. Thus, the part of CBP encoding the RARA-binding domain, the CREB-binding domain, the three Cys/His-rich regions, the bromodomain, the HAT domain and the Glu-rich domains is present. In the reciprocal CBP-MORF, part of the acidic domain and the C-terminal Ser- and Met-rich regions of MORF are likely to be driven by the CBP promoter. Since both fusion transcripts were present, their exact role in the leukemogenic process remains to be elucidated.","['Panagopoulos, I', 'Fioretos, T', 'Isaksson, M', 'Samuelsson, U', 'Billstrom, R', 'Strombeck, B', 'Mitelman, F', 'Johansson, B']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Fioretos T', 'Isaksson M', 'Samuelsson U', 'Billstrom R', 'Strombeck B', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, SE-221 85 Lund, Sweden. ioannis.panagopoulos@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence/genetics', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2001 Feb 15;10(4):395-404. doi: 10.1093/hmg/10.4.395.,,['10.1093/hmg/10.4.395 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The NUP98 portion of the fusion protein was shown to be responsible for transforming a clinically silent pre-leukemic phase observed for Hoxa9 into a chronic, stem cell-derived MPD. The co-expression of NUP98-HOXA9 and Meis1 accelerated the transformation of MPD to AML, identifying a genetic interaction previously observed for Hoxa9 and Meis1.

In addition, LIF induces activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt, which are known to be required for cell survival. However, their regulatory roles in cell death remain unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the fate of these proteins and the cytoprotective effects of LIF on doxorubicin (DOX)-induced apoptosis in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Myocyte apoptosis increased significantly in DOX-treated cells but was significantly reduced by LIF pretreatment. The kinase activities of PI 3-kinase and Akt declined below basal levels but were partially recovered with LIF. Moreover, DOX-induced caspase-3 activation and decrease in Bcl-xL abundance are completely inhibited by LIF and caspase inhibitor. LIF phosphorylates Bad through PI 3-kinase and reduces the heterodimerization of Bad with Bcl-xL. Adenovirus transfer of the constitutively active form of Akt to cardiac myocytes restored cardiac myocyte survival after DOX treatment. Conversely, the dominant-negative form of Akt inhibited LIF-induced increase in cell viability and suppression of caspase-9 activation. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of gp130 inhibits DOX-induced cell death in cardiac myocytes, resulting in the restoration of PI 3-kinase/Akt activities and in the inactivation of caspase-3, leading to facilitation of the protective function of Bcl-xL.","['Negoro, S', 'Oh, H', 'Tone, E', 'Kunisada, K', 'Fujio, Y', 'Walsh, K', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Yamauchi-Takihara, K']","['Negoro S', 'Oh H', 'Tone E', 'Kunisada K', 'Fujio Y', 'Walsh K', 'Kishimoto T', 'Yamauchi-Takihara K']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Bad protein, rat)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzymes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Akt1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzymes/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heart Ventricles/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/05/11 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Circulation. 2001 Jan 30;103(4):555-61. doi: 10.1161/01.cir.103.4.555.,,['10.1161/01.cir.103.4.555 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

An inverse insertion of murine leukemia retrovirus (MuLV) into the 5'-flanking region of the mdr1a gene was found. This insertion was concomitantly accompanied by up-regulation of the mdr1a gene and the loss of chemosensitivity. Deletion of long-terminal repeat (LTR) sequences dramatically decreased the mdr1a promoter-driven reporter activity. The MuLV LTR insertion appears to exert its enhancer activity on mdr1a transcription during the appearance of MDR leukemia cells. Two mechanisms were postulated to explain the mdr1a gene activation by retrovirus insertion during in vivo chemotreatment: de novo insertion of MuLV induced by vincristine treatment and selection of a small fraction of pre-existing cells carrying MuLV insertion during vincristine treatment. No rearranged sequence was detected by polymerase chain reaction in parental cells. This result argued for the first mechanism. The randomly altered distribution of MuLV during repetitive chemotreatment might also be consistent with this hypothesis. On the other hand, the retrovirus insertion was detected at the same site of the mdr1a promoter region in 2 independent experiments, which suggests the second mechanism. It should be noted that in vivo chemotreatment using vincristine could generate the mdr1a-overexpressing cells through retrovirus insertion and the enhancer effect of the LTR.","['Nagayama, J', 'Iino, M', 'Tada, Y', 'Kusaba, H', 'Kiue, A', 'Ohshima, K', 'Kuwano, M', 'Wada, M']","['Nagayama J', 'Iino M', 'Tada Y', 'Kusaba H', 'Kiue A', 'Ohshima K', 'Kuwano M', 'Wada M']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9EI49ZU76O (multidrug resistance protein 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, MDR', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Feb 1;97(3):759-66. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.3.759.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.3.759 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56403-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent findings that site-specific cleavage of the MLL gene can be induced by chemotherapeutic agents such as topoisomerase-II inhibitors suggest that apoptogenic agents can cause chromosomal translocations in hematopoietic cells. This study demonstrates a possible relationship between exposure to apoptogenic stimuli, TEL breaks, and the formation of TEL-AML1 fusion in immature B lymphocytes. Short-term culture of immature B cell lines in the presence of apoptogenic stimuli such as serum starvation, etoposide, or salicylic acid induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in intron 5 of the TEL gene and intron 1 of the AML1 gene. TEL-AML1 fusion transcripts were also identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in cell lines treated by serum starvation or aminophylline. DSBs within the TEL gene were also associated with fusion to other unknown genes, presumably as a result of chromosomal translocation. We also examined 67 cord blood and 147 normal peripheral blood samples for the existence of in-frame TEL-AML1 fusion transcripts. One cord blood sample (1.5%) and 13 normal peripheral blood samples (8.8%) were positive as detected by nested RT-PCR. These data suggest that breakage and fusion of TEL and AML1 may be relatively common events and that sublethal apoptotic signals could play a role in initiating leukemogenesis via the promotion of DNA damage.","['Eguchi-Ishimae, M', 'Eguchi, M', 'Ishii, E', 'Miyazaki, S', 'Ueda, K', 'Kamada, N', 'Mizutani, S']","['Eguchi-Ishimae M', 'Eguchi M', 'Ishii E', 'Miyazaki S', 'Ueda K', 'Kamada N', 'Mizutani S']","[""Department of Virology, National Children's Medical Research Center, Tokyo, Japan. mieguchi@icr.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '27Y3KJK423 (Aminophylline)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'O414PZ4LPZ (Salicylic Acid)']",IM,"['Aminophylline/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Salicylic Acid/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Feb 1;97(3):737-43. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.3.737.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.3.737 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56400-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the study described here, most such cells expressed a primitive phenotype (CD38-, CD45RA-, CD71-, and HLA-DR(lo)) and cultures of these cells containing growth factors produced ultimately larger, but initially more slowly growing clones than do cultures of initially cycling CD34+ leukemic cells. Initially quiescent leukemic cells expressing BCR-ABL proliferated in single-cell cultures in the absence of added growth factors, thereby demonstrating their ability to spontaneously exit G0 and enter a continuously cycling state. Interestingly, on isolation, few of these quiescent BCR-ABL+ cells contained either interleukin-3 (IL-3) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) transcripts, whereas both were present in most cycling BCR-ABL+ CD34+ cells. However, after 4 days of culture in the absence of added growth factors and in association with their entry into the cell cycle (as indicated by up-regulation of Ki-67 and cdc25 transcripts), IL-3 transcripts became detectable. These findings show that entry of leukemic (BCR-ABL-expressing) progenitors into a quiescent (G0) state in vivo is highest among the most primitive leukemic cell populations, associated with a down-regulation of IL-3 and G-CSF gene expression, and spontaneously reversible in association with up-regulation of IL-3 expression. These results highlight the potential physiologic relevance of quiescent CML progenitors, even in treated patients, in whom these cells would be predicted to have a proliferative advantage over their quiescent normal counterparts when cytokine concentrations are low.","['Holyoake, T L', 'Jiang, X', 'Jorgensen, H G', 'Graham, S', 'Alcorn, M J', 'Laird, C', 'Eaves, A C', 'Eaves, C J']","['Holyoake TL', 'Jiang X', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Graham S', 'Alcorn MJ', 'Laird C', 'Eaves AC', 'Eaves CJ']","['Academic Transfusion Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, United Kingdom. tlhig@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Feb 1;97(3):720-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.3.720.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.3.720 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56398-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We now present results achieved with that approach, as carried out at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and as reported in the literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one unselected MSKCC patients with newly diagnosed ES/PNET metastatic to bone/BM received the ""P6"" protocol which includes cycles of cyclophosphamide (4.2 g/m(2))/doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2))/vincristine and cycles of ifosfamide (9 g/m(2))/etoposide (500 mg/m(2)). Patients in complete/very good partial remission (CR/VGPR) after P6 received myeloablative therapy with either total-body irradiation (TBI) (hyperfractionated 15 Gy)/melphalan (180 mg/m(2)) or thiotepa (900 mg/m(2))/carboplatin (1,500 mg/m(2)). We reviewed the literature. RESULTS: Only one MSKCC patient became a long-term event-free survivor; all but one relapse was in a distant site. Initial responses to P6 were CR/VGPR in 19 patients, but eight of them plus two others developed PD while receiving or shortly after completing P6. Eight patients were treated with TBI/melphalan: four relapsed 2 to 7 months after transplantation; two died early of toxicity; one died of pulmonary failure 17 months after transplantation (no evidence of ES/PNET); and one remains in CR at more than 7 years. The three patients treated with thiotepa/carboplatin relapsed 3 to 4 months after transplantation. All reports on large series of unselected patients with ES/PNET metastatic to bone/BM showed similarly unsatisfactory results. Poor outcome was seen with use of active agents for ES/PNET-cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, dactinomycin, vincristine, etoposide - at standard dosages for prolonged periods of time and at higher dosages in intensive regimens for short or prolonged periods of time. No improvements in event-free survival rates occurred with successive cooperative group or large single-institutional studies that used increasingly aggressive chemotherapeutic approaches. Inclusion of ifosfamide with or without etoposide made no difference nor did consolidation of remission with myeloablative chemoradiotherapy. Secondary leukemia emerged as a major risk with dose-intensive regimens. CONCLUSION: The MSKCC experience and findings reported in the literature suggest that dose-intensive use of the chemotherapy agents with established activity against ES/PNET is reaching its efficacy and toxicity limits. A major impact on prognosis awaits the development of entirely novel therapies.","['Kushner, B H', 'Meyers, P A']","['Kushner BH', 'Meyers PA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. kushnerb@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'CAV protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/secondary', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/secondary', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/secondary', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/secondary', 'Thiotepa/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",63,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Feb 1;19(3):870-80. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.3.870.,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.3.870 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Forty-two patients (AML: 31 patients; MDS: six patients [five MDS + one CMML]; ALL: four patients; CML-BP: one patient) were treated. Median age was 61 years (range, 23 to 79 years), and 29 patients were males. Stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome were the DLTs. The MTD was defined as 8 mg/m(2)/d. The pharmacokinetic behavior of troxacitabine is linear over the dose range of 0.72 to 10.0 m/m(2). Approximately 69% of troxacitabine was excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. Marrow hypoplasia occurred between days 14 and 28 in 73% of AML patients. Three complete remissions and one partial remission were observed in 30 assessable AML patients. One MDS patient achieved a hematologic improvement. A patient with CML-BP achieved a return to chronic phase disease. CONCLUSION: Troxacitabine has a unique metabolic and pharmacokinetic profile and significant antileukemic activity. DLTs were stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome. Troxacitabine merits further study in hematologic malignancies.","['Giles, F J', 'Cortes, J E', 'Baker, S D', 'Thomas, D A', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Smith, T L', 'Beran, M', 'Bivins, C', 'Jolivet, J', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Giles FJ', 'Cortes JE', 'Baker SD', 'Thomas DA', ""O'Brien S"", 'Smith TL', 'Beran M', 'Bivins C', 'Jolivet J', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030-4095, USA. frankgiles@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dioxolanes)', '60KQZ0388Y (troxacitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cytosine/*adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Dioxolanes/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Feb 1;19(3):762-71. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.3.762.,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.3.762 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Ultrasonography (US) supports the diagnosis of NE by showing pathologic thickening of the bowel wall. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the degree of mural thickening evaluated by US in patients with clinically suspected NE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Neutropenic patients with fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain after intensive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies were studied with abdominal US. We evaluated the degree of bowel wall thickening detected by US and its correlation with the duration of the clinical syndrome as well as NE-related mortality. RESULTS: Eighty-eight (6%) of 1,450 consecutive patients treated for leukemia had clinical signs of NE. In 44 (50%) of 88 patients, US revealed pathologic wall thickening (mean +/- SD, 10.2 +/- 2.9 mm; range, 6 to 18). The mean duration of symptoms was significantly longer in this group (7.9 days) than among patients without mural thickening (3.8 days, P <.0001), and the NE-related mortality rate was higher (29.5% v 0%, P <.001). Patients with bowel wall thickness of more than 10 mm had a significantly higher mortality rate (60%) than did those with bowel wall thickness < or = 10 mm (4.2%, P <.001). CONCLUSION: Symptomatic patients with sonographically detected bowel wall thickening have a poor prognosis compared with patients without this finding. In addition, mural thickness of more than 10 mm is associated with poorer outcome among patients with NE.","['Cartoni, C', 'Dragoni, F', 'Micozzi, A', 'Pescarmona, E', 'Mecarocci, S', 'Chirletti, P', 'Petti, M C', 'Meloni, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Cartoni C', 'Dragoni F', 'Micozzi A', 'Pescarmona E', 'Mecarocci S', 'Chirletti P', 'Petti MC', 'Meloni G', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Policlinico Umberto I, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. cartoni@bce.med.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blast Crisis/complications/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Enterocolitis/chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Intestines/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Ultrasonography']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Feb 1;19(3):756-61. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.3.756.,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.3.756 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We administered Rasburicase intravenously, at 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg, for 5 to 7 consecutive days to 131 children, adolescents, and young adults with newly diagnosed leukemia or lymphoma, who either presented with abnormally high plasma uric acid concentrations or had large tumor cell burdens. Blood levels of uric acid, creatinine, phosphorus, and potassium were measured daily. The pharmacokinetics of Rasburicase, the urinary excretion rate of allantoin, and antibodies to Rasburicase were also studied. RESULTS: At either dosage, the recombinant enzyme produced a rapid and sharp decrease in plasma uric acid concentrations in all patients. The median level decreased by 4 hours after treatment, from 9.7 to 1 mg/dL (P =.0001), in the 65 patients who presented with hyperuricemia, and from 4.3 to 0.5 mg/dL (P =.0001) in the remaining 66 patients. Despite cytoreductive chemotherapy, plasma uric acid concentrations remained low throughout the treatment (daily median level, 0.5 mg/dL). The urinary excretion rate of allantoin increased during Rasburicase treatment, peaking on day 3. Serum phosphorus concentrations did not change significantly during the first 3 days of treatment, decreased significantly by day 4 in patients presenting with hyperuricemia (P =.0003), and fell within the normal range in all patients by 48 hours after treatment. Serum creatinine levels decreased significantly after 1 day of treatment in patients with or without hyperuricemia at diagnosis (P =.0003 and P =.02, respectively) and returned to normal range in all patients by day 6 of treatment. Toxicity was negligible, and none of the patients required dialysis. The mean plasma half-lives of the agent were 16.0 +/- 6.3 (SD) hours and 21.1 +/- 12.0 hours, respectively, in patients treated at dosages of 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg. Seventeen of the 121 assessable patients developed antibodies to the enzyme. CONCLUSION: Rasburicase is safe and highly effective for the prophylaxis or treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with leukemia or lymphoma.","['Pui, C H', 'Mahmoud, H H', 'Wiley, J M', 'Woods, G M', 'Leverger, G', 'Camitta, B', 'Hastings, C', 'Blaney, S M', 'Relling, M V', 'Reaman, G H']","['Pui CH', 'Mahmoud HH', 'Wiley JM', 'Woods GM', 'Leverger G', 'Camitta B', 'Hastings C', 'Blaney SM', 'Relling MV', 'Reaman GH']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. ching-hon.pui@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/*complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/*complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*complications', 'Male', 'Phosphorus/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications', 'Recombinant Proteins/blood/therapeutic use', 'Urate Oxidase/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Uric Acid/*blood']",,2001/02/07 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Feb 1;19(3):697-704. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.3.697.,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.3.697 [doi]'],,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1990 and July 1993, 565 operable breast cancer patients with either more than three positive nodes or between one and three positive nodes with Scarff Bloom Richardson grade > or = 2 and hormone receptor negativity were randomized after surgery to receive either fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) every 21 days for six cycles (FEC 50) or the same regimen except with epirubicin dose of 100 mg/m(2) (FEC 100). Postmenopausal patients received tamoxifen 30 mg/d for 3 years at the beginning of chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was delivered at the end of chemotherapy in both groups. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 67 months. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 54.8% with FEC 50 and 66.3% with FEC 100 (P =.03). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 65.3% and 77.4%, respectively (P =.007). The mean relative dose-intensity was similar in the two groups (90.3% and 86.1%, respectively). Neutropenia and anemia were significantly more frequent in FEC 100 (P < 10(-3)), as were nausea-vomiting (P =.008) and stomatitis and alopecia (P < 10(-3)). Nine cases of grade 3 infection occurred only with FEC 100, and no toxic deaths occurred. Three cases of acute cardiac toxicity were observed (FEC50 = 1, FEC100 = 2) and 10 patients (FEC50 = 6, FEC100 = 4) presented delayed cardiac dysfunctions. Two cases of secondary leukemia were observed (acute lymphatic leukemia with FEC 50 and acute myelogenous leukemia with FEC 100).

The stem cell leukemia (SCL) gene encodes a bHLH transcription factor with a pivotal role in hemopoiesis and vasculogenesis, and it displays a highly conserved expression pattern. We present here a detailed sequence comparison of 193 kb of the human SCL locus to 234 kb of the mouse SCL locus. Four new genes have been identified together with an ancient mitochondrial insertion in the human locus. The SCL gene is flanked upstream by the SIL gene and downstream by the MAP17 gene in both species, but the gene order is not collinear downstream from MAP17. To facilitate rapid identification of candidate regulatory elements, we have developed a new sequence analysis tool (SynPlot) that automates the graphical display of large-scale sequence alignments. Unlike existing programs, SynPlot can display the locus features of more than one sequence, thereby indicating the position of homology peaks relative to the structure of all sequences in the alignment. In addition, high-resolution analysis of the chromatin structure of the mouse SCL gene permitted the accurate positioning of localized zones accessible to restriction endonucleases. Zones known to be associated with functional regulatory regions were found to correspond precisely with peaks of human/mouse homology, thus demonstrating that long-range human/mouse sequence comparisons allow accurate prediction of the extent of accessible DNA associated with active regulatory regions.","['Gottgens, B', 'Gilbert, J G', 'Barton, L M', 'Grafham, D', 'Rogers, J', 'Bentley, D R', 'Green, A R']","['Gottgens B', 'Gilbert JG', 'Barton LM', 'Grafham D', 'Rogers J', 'Bentley DR', 'Green AR']","[""The Wellcome Trust Centre for Molecular Mechanisms in Disease, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Addenbrooke's Hospital Site, Cambridge CB2 2XY, UK. bg200@cam.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Conserved Sequence/*genetics', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/*genetics', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2001 Jan;11(1):87-97. doi: 10.1101/gr.153001.,,['10.1101/gr.153001 [doi]'],PMC311011,,['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-six FNAs and 1 pleural effusion fluid specimen of GS obtained from 23 patients were reviewed for cytomorphologic features and clinical characteristics. The cases were categorized as blastic, immature, or mature GS based on the population of the cells present on the smears. RESULTS: The patients included 18 men and 5 women (mean age, 54 years). Aspiration sites included subcutaneous or soft tissue (15 cases), lymph nodes (5 cases), bones (3 cases), testis (1 case), ileum (1 case), and liver (1 case). One sample of pleural effusion fluid also was included. Review of the patients' clinical history revealed that GS was secondary to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in 17 patients, was secondary to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in 2 patients, and was secondary to acute myelogenous leukemia in 2 patients. GS preceded the manifestation of CML in one patient and of CMML in another patient. Based on the proportions of cells, morphologic classification was attempted and revealed blastic GS in 8 aspirates and 1 pleural effusion fluid specimen, immature GS in 13 aspirates, and mature GS in 5 aspirates. Twelve of 22 specimens from extranodal sites (55%) demonstrated lymphoglandular bodies in the background. Five aspirates showed rare eosinophilic myelocytes. Auer rods were not identified in any of the aspirates. Immunophenotypic and histochemical studies confirmed myeloid and/or myelomonocytic differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: GS especially can be confused with non-Hodgkin lymphoma because of morphologic similarities of the blasts to large cell lymphoma, the presence of lymphoglandular bodies, and the rarity of Auer rods and eosinophilic myelocytes. In conjunction with careful cytomorphologic evaluation, knowledge of the patient's clinical history and use of appropriate immunophenotypic studies should lead to a correct diagnosis.","['Suh, Y K', 'Shin, H J']","['Suh YK', 'Shin HJ']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle/standards', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eosinophils/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleural Effusion/cytology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Dec 25;90(6):364-72.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(20001225)90:6<364::AID-CNCR7>3.3.CO;2-T [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This model is primarily based on studies performed in leukemia cells; however, little is known about caspase cascades in relatively resistant solid tumor cells, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Using the NSCLC cell line NCI-H460 (H460), here, we studied the effect of stable expression of various caspase inhibitors on apoptosis induced by the anticancer drugs cisplatin, topotecan, and gemcitabine. Interestingly, overexpression of caspase-9S and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), both able to inhibit caspase-9 activity, failed to block apoptosis. In contrast, stable expression of caspase-8 inhibitors, such as cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) and dominant-negative caspase-8, almost completely abrogated apoptosis and also enhanced clonogenic survival. Caspase-8 activation in H460 cells was not mediated by death receptors, inasmuch as overexpression of dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain (FADD-DN) did not prevent procaspase-8 cleavage and subsequent apoptosis. However, stable expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL did suppress these apoptotic events, including the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which was observed in drug-treated H460 cells. In the NSCLC cell line H460, we, thus, provide evidence for the existence of a novel drug-inducible apoptotic pathway in which activation of caspase-8, and not of caspase-9, forms the apical and mitochondria-dependent step that subsequently activates the downstream caspases.","['Ferreira, C G', 'Span, S W', 'Peters, G J', 'Kruyt, F A', 'Giaccone, G']","['Ferreira CG', 'Span SW', 'Peters GJ', 'Kruyt FA', 'Giaccone G']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Academic Hospital Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Topotecan/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Dec 15;60(24):7133-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, additional functions have been described for uPA and uPAR, particularly in cell adhesion and chemotaxis. The amounts of uPA and uPAR in various tumor types and in the plasma/serum samples of cancer patients have been shown to correlate with survival prognosis, indicating the relevance of these molecules in malignancy. We previously showed that in acute myeloid leukemia, a high level of plasma soluble uPAR (suPAR) at diagnosis correlates with poor response to chemotherapy. However, in this case, as in other cancers, the origin of suPAR is unknown. Therefore, we have now analyzed uPAR in cells, plasma, and urine of patients with acute leukemia (n = 35) at 0, 5, 14, 28, and 56 days after start of chemotherapy. In response to cytotoxic treatment, suPAR levels decreased rapidly, and the decreasing plasma suPAR (p-suPAR levels correlated highly with decreasing numbers of circulating tumor cells, suggesting that the elevated p-suPAR was produced by circulating tumor cells. Moreover, the p-suPAR level appeared to correlate with the amount of uPAR in tumor cell lysates at diagnosis. Our results also show for the first time that in lysates of circulating tumor cells, studied by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, uPAR was partly in fragmented form, whereas only full-length uPAR was found in normal leukocytes. We also detected fragmented suPAR in peripheral blood plasma, in urine, and especially in the plasma compartment of bone-marrow aspirates of acute myeloid leukemia patients, in a pattern differing considerably from that found in healthy individuals. Because proteolytic cleavage of uPAR induces a potent chemotactic response in vitro, it is possible that these fragments may play a role in the pathophysiology of acute leukemia.","['Mustjoki, S', 'Sidenius, N', 'Sier, C F', 'Blasi, F', 'Elonen, E', 'Alitalo, R', 'Vaheri, A']","['Mustjoki S', 'Sidenius N', 'Sier CF', 'Blasi F', 'Elonen E', 'Alitalo R', 'Vaheri A']","['Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Finland.

We observed the opposite result when assessing the effects of UDCA on the apoptotic response to mitochondrial photodamage induced by photodynamic therapy (PDT). Two photosensitizers with predominantly mitochondrial specificity were used: a porphycene we have designated CPO; and the tin etiopurpurin SnET2. UDCA potentiated the loss of mitochondrial potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3, and apoptotic cell death after irradiation of photosensitized murine leukemia L1210 or hepatoma 1c1c7 cells. These effects were not observed when UDCA was added after irradiation. Glyco-UDCA and tauro-UDCA, conjugated forms of UDCA that are formed in vivo, were as effective as UDCA in promoting PDT phototoxicity. Because UDCA does not act by enhancing intracellular accumulation of the photosensitizing agents used in this study, we propose that the mode of action of UDCA involves the sensitization of mitochondrial membranes to photodamage. UDCA is used currently in gastroenterology for several indications.

The leukemia consists of an overabundance of activated T cells, which are characterized by the expression of CD25, or IL-2Ralpha, on their cell surface. Presently, there is not an accepted curative therapy for ATL. We developed an in vivo model of ATL in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/ SCID) mice by introducing cells from an ATL patient (MET-1) into the mice. The leukemic cells proliferated in these mice that lack functional T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells. The MET-1 leukemic cells could be monitored by measurements of both serum soluble Tac (IL-2Ralpha) and soluble human beta2-microglobulin (beta2mu) by ELISA. The disease progressed to death in the mice after approximately 4-6 weeks. The mice developed grossly enlarged spleens and a leukemia involving ATL cells that retained the phenotype and the T-cell receptor rearrangement and human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-I integration pattern of the patient's ATL leukemia cells. This model is of value for testing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents for ATL. The administration of humanized anti-Tac (HAT), murine anti-Tac (MAT), and 7G7/B6, all of which target IL-2Ralpha, significantly delayed the progression of the leukemia and prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing mice. In particular, HAT induced complete remissions in 4 of 19 mice and partial remissions in the remainder. It appears that the antibodies act by a mechanism that had not been anticipated. The prevailing view is that antibodies to the IL-2Ralpha receptor have their effective action by blocking the interaction of IL-2 with its growth factor receptor, thereby inducing cytokine deprivation apoptosis. However, although both HAT and MAT block the binding of IL-2 to IL-2Ralpha of the high affinity receptor, the 7G7/B6 monoclonal antibody binds to a different epitope on the IL-2Ralpha receptor, one that is not involved in IL-2 binding. This suggested that the antibodies provide an effective therapy by a mechanism other than induction of cytokine deprivation. In accord with this view, the MET-1 cells obtained from the spleens of leukemic mice did not produce IL-2, nor did they express IL-2 mRNA as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. Another possible conventional mechanism of action involves complement-mediated killing. However, although MAT and 7G7/B6 fix rabbit complement, HAT does not do so. Furthermore, in the presence of NOD/SCID mouse serum, there was no complement-mediated lysis of MET-1 cells. In addition, the antibodies did not manifest antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity with NOD/SCID splenocytes that virtually lack NK cells as the effector cells as assessed in an in vitro chromium-release assay. However, in contrast to the efficacy of intact HAT, the F(ab')2 version of this antibody was not effective in prolonging the survival of mice injected with MET-1 ATL cells. In conclusion, in our murine model of ATL, monoclonal antibodies, HAT, MAT, and 7G7/B6, appear to delay progression of the leukemia by a mechanism of action that is different from the accepted mechanism of IL-2 deprivation leading to cell death. We consider two alternatives: the first, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by FcRI- or FcRIII-expressing cells other than NK cells, such as monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The second alternative we consider involves direct induction of apoptosis by the anti-IL-2R antibodies in vivo. It has been shown that the IL-2R is a critical element in the peripheral self-tolerance T-cell suicide mechanism involved in the phenomenon of activation-induced cell death.","['Phillips, K E', 'Herring, B', 'Wilson, L A', 'Rickford, M S', 'Zhang, M', 'Goldman, C K', 'Tso, J Y', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Phillips KE', 'Herring B', 'Wilson LA', 'Rickford MS', 'Zhang M', 'Goldman CK', 'Tso JY', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1374, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Dec 15;60(24):6977-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that the growth inhibition activity of cyclists' PHA-MNC-CM were higher than that of controls. The dosage of PHA used to prepare MNC-CM to achieve about 90% growth inhibition was 5 microg/ml in the control group and was 2 microg/ml in the athletes group. The differentiation-inducing effects were evaluated by morphological scoring, superoxide production, and monocyte-associated antigen expression (CD14 and CD68). These three parameters all demonstrated the differentiation-inducing effect of MNC-CM increased with increasing dose of PHA. These effects were significantly greater in the athletic when compared to the sedentary control group at all doses of PHA. The levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma PHA-MNC-CM increased in a PHA dose-dependent manner and were much higher in the athletic group when compared to the controls.

There was no synergism, but the additive effects of As2O3 were demonstrated with cisplatin, adriamycin, and etoposide. We strongly suggest that As2O3 alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents be evaluated further as a new agent for the treatment of prostate and ovarian cancers.","['Uslu, R', 'Sanli, U A', 'Sezgin, C', 'Karabulut, B', 'Terzioglu, E', 'Omay, S B', 'Goker, E']","['Uslu R', 'Sanli UA', 'Sezgin C', 'Karabulut B', 'Terzioglu E', 'Omay SB', 'Goker E']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Ege University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey. uslu@alpha.med.ege.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '25013-16-5 (Butylated Hydroxyanisole)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Butylated Hydroxyanisole/metabolism', 'Carcinogens', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Dec;6(12):4957-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes however, the price paid is ovarian failure and sterility. It is highly important to detect who are the patients at risk in order to verify when fertility preservation is indicated. With conventional chemotherapy, there is significant differences in ovarian failure rate according to patients age, disease for which patients are treated for, and the drugs used. Bone marrow transplantation in cancer patients almost invariably induced ovarian failure, irrespective of patient age, treatment protocol or administration of hormonal treatment. Moreover, normal reproductive parameters post-chemotherapy does not necessarily imply that the ovaries escaped damage; ovarian injury is not an all or none phenomenon--partial loss of primordial follicle reserve can result in premature menopause as a delayed reaction to treatment. This should be taken into account while consulting former cancer patients about future planed pregnancies. The direct mechanisms of chemotherapy induced ovarian failure are poorly understood. An in vitro study has demonstrated that in the human ovary chemotherapy acts primarily on primordial follicles through induction of apoptotic changes in pregranulosa cells which lead to follicle loss. Protecting fertility potential in females exposed to chemotherapy with IVF and embryo cryopreservation or cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is practiced. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation: A recent study has demonstrated that laparoscopic ovarian biopsy performed with the round biopter is a safe and efficient method for collecting ovarian tissue for cryopreservation in cancer patients. In order to avoid possible hazards of transferring malignant cells, genetic and immunohistochemical markers for detection of minimal residual cancer cells in ovarian tissue are currently used. However, the reproductive potential of this method is still questionable. IVF: IVF and embryocryopreservation is currently used in infertile patients, however, several obstacles prevent it's wide implementation in cancer patients such as the need for male partner and the time needed for ovarian stimulation. A highly important issue is the possible risk of performing IVF and embryo cryopreservation to preserve fertility in females already exposed to chemotherapy. An animal study has raised serious concerns regarding the consequences of chemotherapy on future pregnancies. High abortion and malformation rates related to the different stages of oocyte maturation at the time of exposure to chemotherapy were demonstrated. These results should be taken into account when considering the use of IVF and embryo cryopreservation following chemotherapy treatment in cancer patients.","['Meirow, D']",['Meirow D'],"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rabin Medical Centre, Jerusalem, Israel. meirow@md2.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cryopreservation/methods', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Ovary/cytology', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/chemically induced/etiology/pathology', '*Reproductive Techniques', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2000 Nov 27;169(1-2):123-31. doi: 10.1016/s0303-7207(00)00365-8.,,"['S0303-7207(00)00365-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0303-7207(00)00365-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the majority of patients ultimately relapse and die with cytotoxic drug resistant blasts. Novel agents which circumvent resistance are needed. One such class are AML-cell surface targeted proteins. These genetically engineered polypeptides are hybrid molecules composed of two moieties--a haptophore which triggers AML cell binding and a toxophore which kills the cell. The haptophore or ligand portion consists of a monoclonal antibody or antibody fragment or a cytokine. These peptides react with cell surface receptors or antigens on AML cells. The haptophore is genetically or chemically linked to the toxophore. The toxophore may consist of an antibody Fc domain which triggers antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, a DNA-damaging cytotoxic drug, a radionuclide or a protein synthesis-inactivating peptide toxin. The toxophore may provide a cell death signal that overcomes standard resistance phenotypes. Further, the targeting provided by the haptophore may reduce normal tissue toxicities. This review describes some of the properties of the cell surface molecular targets, the reactive haptophores and toxophores and how these functional peptides have been optimally combined to kill leukemic blasts in patients with AML.","['Frankel, A E', 'Sievers, E L', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Frankel AE', 'Sievers EL', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Drive, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (monoclonal antibody M195)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Radioimmunotherapy/methods', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",84,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2000 Oct;15(5):459-76. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2000.15.459.,,['10.1089/cbr.2000.15.459 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Among patients with transformation, 20% to 30% will develop BC with lymphoid-associated antigens (Ly-BC), and the remaining cases with myeloid-associated antigens (My-BC) or with both (Mix-BC). In this study, we investigated the lineage of blast cells in CML-BC using immunophenotypic and genetic analyses and analyzed the prognostic significance of genotypic change in CML-BC. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with CML-BC diagnosed at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 1982 to 1992 were included. Immunophenotyping was done by using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique. Genetic analyses were carried out by using Southern Blot hybridization. The prognostic influence of genotypic change was analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (61.9%) expressed myeloid-associated antigens, one patient (4.8%) expressed megakaryoblast-associated antigens, four patients (19%) expressed B lymphoid-associated antigens and three patients (14.3%) expressed both myeloid and B lymphoid antigens. Clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene was found in six cases. Among them, four expressed B lymphoid markers only and two expressed both myeloid and B lymphoid markers. Patients with clonal IgH gene rearrangement tended to have a better response to chemotherapy (50% vs 8.3%, p = 0.08) and significantly longer survival (median survival, 5 months vs 3 months, p < 0.05) than did those with a germline configuration. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal rearrangement of the IgH gene was found mostly in cases of Ly-BC and Mix-BC. We found that CML-BC with clonal rearrangement of the IgH gene had a more favorable prognosis than in cases with a germline configuration.","['Yen, C C', 'Liu, J H', 'Wang, W S', 'Fan, F S', 'Chiou, T J', 'Tai, C J', 'Yang, M H', 'Chao, T C', 'Hsiao, L T', 'Chen, P M']","['Yen CC', 'Liu JH', 'Wang WS', 'Fan FS', 'Chiou TJ', 'Tai CJ', 'Yang MH', 'Chao TC', 'Hsiao LT', 'Chen PM']","['Section of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",25,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 2000 Nov;63(11):785-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with essential thrombocythemia evaluated at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn, between 1969 and 1991 and identified 74 young women (median age, 35 years; range, 18-48 years) with essential thrombocythemia. The diagnosis was based on previously established criteria. Median follow-up was 9.2 years (range, 0.2-26.2 years). RESULTS: Overall survival was similar to that of an age- and sex-matched control population. Thrombotic events (except superficial thrombophlebitis) occurred at and after diagnosis in 11 patients (15%) and 13 patients (18%), respectively. A history of thrombosis at diagnosis was significantly associated with recurrent thrombosis (P = .03). A platelet count higher than 1500 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis was significantly associated with gastrointestinal tract bleeding and subsequent development of venous (but not arterial) thrombosis (P = .04). Major hemorrhagic events occurred in only 3 patients (4%) after diagnosis. Only 1 patient developed acute leukemia. Thirty-four pregnancies occurred in 18 patients. Of these, 17 (50%) resulted in live births. Of the 17 patients with unsuccessful pregnancies, 14 had spontaneous abortions, 1 had an ectopic pregnancy, and 2 had elective abortions. Preconception platelet count, thrombotic history, or specific therapy was not useful in predicting pregnancy outcome. CONCLUSION: Young women with essential thrombocythemia can expect long survival with a low incidence of life-threatening thrombohemorrhagic complications or acute leukemia. There is an increased incidence of first-trimester miscarriages that may not be influenced by specific therapy.","['Tefferi, A', 'Fonseca, R', 'Pereira, D L', 'Hoagland, H C']","['Tefferi A', 'Fonseca R', 'Pereira DL', 'Hoagland HC']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Thrombocytopenia/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality']",,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2001 Jan;76(1):22-8. doi: 10.4065/76.1.22.,,"['S0025-6196(11)62075-2 [pii]', '10.4065/76.1.22 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The intensity of immunosuppressive therapy was decreased once a diagnosis of KS had been established. However, the nodular lesions continued to progress in size and number. Therefore, a course of irradiation was administered to sites of bulk disease on her legs. Furthermore, thalidomide was initiated along with a topical retinoid, alitretinoin 0.1% gel applied twice daily to the nonirradiated lesions.

We investigated (1) the function of cytokines as growth factors for preactivated monoclonal T cell populations which had been prepared by long-term in vitro culture, and (2) the ability of cytokines to modulate anti-CD3-stimulated proliferation of polyclonal, nonexpanded T cells. A subset of CD4+ and CD8+ clones could utilize IL-16 and IL-17 as growth factors after previous mitogenic activation, but for the CD4+ subset IL-16 responses were significantly higher than IL-17 responses. Cytokine-dependent proliferation was higher for the CD4+ than for the CD8+ clones in the presence of both IL-16 and IL-17. The effects of IL-16/IL-17 were modulated by the presence of exogenous IL-2 and IL-4. The IL-16-responsive CD8+ clones seemed to represent a minor subset expressing the phenotype CD4lowCD8high. The anti-CD3-stimulated polyclonal responses were generally lower for the cytopenic patients than for healthy individuals, and this decreased responsiveness was probably caused by a combination of quantitative T cell defects and suboptimal accessory cell costimulation. Although IL-16 and IL-17 could function as growth factors for a large subset of our T cell clones, both cytokines had either no or only minor effects on the polyclonal T cell responses for cytopenic patients (e.g. only weak enhancement of anti-CD3 and anti-CD3+anti-CD28 responses, no alteration of the cytokine responsiveness profile after anti-CD3 stimulation). We conclude that both IL-16 and IL-17 are potentially immunostimulatory cytokines in patients with acute leukemia and chemotherapy-induced leukopenia, but the final effects of IL-16/IL-17 on proliferative T cell responses are modulated by local immunoregulatory networks.","['Bruserud, O', 'von Volkman , H L', 'Ulvestad, E']","['Bruserud O', 'von Volkman HL', 'Ulvestad E']","['Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-16)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects/immunology', 'Interleukin-16/immunology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-17/immunology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukopenia/*chemically induced/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;104(2-3):80-91. doi: 10.1159/000039756.,,"['39756 [pii]', '10.1159/000039756 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lovastatin has been shown to reduce tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Here, the potential of lovastatin for purging leukemia cells from bone marrow was investigated using the myeloblastic cell lines K562 and KG-1 as a model system, derived from an erythroleukemia and an acute myelogenous leukemia, respectively. Optimal purging conditions were determined using an MTT proliferation and a leukemia colony assay. Elimination of leukemia cells was time- and dose-dependent. Depletion of K562 was 2.5 logs for 100 microM of lovastatin at 72 h of incubation. Compared to another purging agent, 100 microg/ml mafosfamide had an activity comparable to 100 mM lovastatin. Interestingly, KG-1 acute myelogenous leukemia cells were even more sensitive to lovastatin than K562 cells. In clonogenic assays, 100 microM of lovastatin resulted in a 3- to 4-log reduction of K562 colonies. Lovastatin had a progressive effect on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. At a concentration of 100 microM of lovastatin, CFU-GM colonies were reduced by 1-2 logs. In conclusion, a differential effect on leukemia and normal progenitor cells could be detected in a clonogenic assay.

Since CML cell accumulation has been related to apoptosis inhibition by the product of the BCR-ABL gene, attempts to eradicate leukemic cells would require therapeutic drugs able to overcome this inherent resistance. Here, we investigated in vitro the apoptotic effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C), employed alone, in combination or in sequence, on freshly isolated cells from 10 patients with chronic-phase CML. Our cell cultures showed that both ATRA and ARA-C were able to induce apoptosis in CML cells, even if ARA-C resulted more effective than ATRA. The combined use of ATRA and ARA-C seemed to have only an additive effect while the sequential use did not show any advantage. These in vitro observations indicate that ATRA and ARA-C may be effective in reducing CML cells through apoptosis induction, suggesting that it could be worthwhile to examine ATRA and ARA-C combinations in the therapy of CML.","['Stagno, F', 'Guglielmo, P', 'Consoli, U', 'Inghilterra, G', 'Giustolisi, G M', 'Palumbo, G A', 'Giustolisi, R']","['Stagno F', 'Guglielmo P', 'Consoli U', 'Inghilterra G', 'Giustolisi GM', 'Palumbo GA', 'Giustolisi R']","['University of Catania, Italy. fsematolo@sirio-oncology.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/13 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/01/13 11:00'],"['2001/01/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;104(2-3):57-64. doi: 10.1159/000039753.,,"['39753 [pii]', '10.1159/000039753 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that Bcr-Abl contains multiple functional domains and motifs and can disrupt regulation of many signaling pathways and cellular functions. However, the role of specific domains and motifs of Bcr-Abl or of specific signaling pathways in the complex in vivo pathogenesis of CML is not completely known. We have previously shown that expression of Bcr-Abl in bone marrow cells by retroviral transduction efficiently induces a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) in mice resembling human CML. We have also shown that the Abl kinase activity within Bcr-Abl is essential for Bcr-Abl leukemogenesis, yet activation of the Abl kinase without Bcr sequences is not sufficient to induce MPD in mice. In this study we investigated the role of Bcr sequences within Bcr-Abl in inducing MPD using this murine model for CML. We found that the NH(2)-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain was both essential and sufficient, even though not efficient, to activate Abl to induce an MPD in mice. Interestingly, deletion of the Src homology 3 domain complemented the deficiencies of the CC-deleted Bcr-Abl in inducing MPD in mice. We further demonstrated that the Grb2 binding site at Y177 played an important role in efficient induction of MPD. These studies directly demonstrated the important roles of Bcr sequences in induction of MPD by Bcr-Abl.","['Zhang, X', 'Subrahmanyam, R', 'Wong, R', 'Gross, A W', 'Ren, R']","['Zhang X', 'Subrahmanyam R', 'Wong R', 'Gross AW', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02454-9110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Mice', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tyrosine/chemistry']",,2001/01/12 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/12 11:00'],"['2001/01/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Feb;21(3):840-53. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.3.840-853.2001.,,['10.1128/MCB.21.3.840-853.2001 [doi]'],PMC86675,,"['R01 CA068008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

A minimal region of deletion has been assigned to 11q22-q23. Trinucleotide repeats have been associated with anticipation in disease, and evidence of anticipation has been observed in various malignancies including CLL. Loss of heterozygosity at 11q22-23 is common in a wide range of cancers, suggesting this is an unstable area prone to chromosome breakage. The location of 8 CCG-trinucleotide repeats on 11q was determined by Southern blot analysis of a 40-Mb YAC and PAC contig spanning 11q22-qter. Deletion breakpoints in CLL are found to co-localize at specific sites on 11q where CCG repeats are located. In addition, a CCG repeat has been identified within the minimal region of deletion. Specific alleles of this repeat are associated with worse prognosis. Folate-sensitive fragile sites are regions of late replication and are characterized by CCG repeats. The mechanism for chromosome deletion at 11q could be explained by a delay in replication. Described here is an association between CCG repeats and chromosome loss suggesting that in vivo ""fragile sites"" exist on 11q and that the instability of CCG repeats may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Auer, R L', 'Jones, C', 'Mullenbach, R A', 'Syndercombe-Court, D', 'Milligan, D W', 'Fegan, C D', 'Cotter, F E']","['Auer RL', 'Jones C', 'Mullenbach RA', 'Syndercombe-Court D', 'Milligan DW', 'Fegan CD', 'Cotter FE']","[""Department of Experimental Haematology, St Bartholomew's, and The Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Contig Mapping', 'Cytogenetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Trinucleotide Repeats/genetics/*physiology']",,2001/01/12 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/01/12 11:00'],"['2001/01/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jan 15;97(2):509-15. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.2.509.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.2.509 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)66018-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently the results of workshops organized by several groups concluded that accurate measurement of low activity of Pgp is a difficult goal in clinical samples. Therefore, highly sensitive and specific assays were developed to assess the functionality of Pgp using JC-1, a fluorescent molecule with the different emission wavelength (green and red fluorescence) according to its concentration in 129 AML samples. It was shown that JC-1 (green and red bands) may define 3 groups of patients: resistant (R) (29% of patients), intermediate (I) (36%), and sensitive (S) (35%). In contrast, rhodamine 123 assay detected only the R group defined by JC-1. Nevertheless, the I group has an intermediate expression of Pgp (0.39, 0.29, and 0.19 for the R, I, and S groups, respectively, P =.002), an intermediate biologic profile (percentage of CD34, 95%, 67%, and 44%, respectively, P <.0001; in vitro resistance to daunorubicin, 94 microM, 20 microM, and 12 microM, respectively, P =. 02), and an intermediate prognosis (achievement of complete remission, 55%, 65%, and 87%, P =.006; 3-year disease-free survival, 11%, 16%, and 36%, respectively, P =.005; and 3-year overall survival, 0%, 20%, and 51%, respectively, P <.0001).

The molecular basis of these properties remains poorly understood. Recently the piwi gene was found in the embryonic germline stem cells (GSCs) of Drosophila melanogaster and has been shown to be important in GSC self-renewal. This study demonstrated that hiwi, a novel human homologue of piwi, is also present in human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells but not in more differentiated cell populations. Placing CD34(+) cells into culture conditions that supported differentiation and rapid exit from the stem cell compartment resulted in a loss of hiwi expression by day 5 of a 14-day culture period. Expression of the hiwi gene was detected in many developing fetal and adult tissues. By means of 5' RACE cloning methodology, a novel putative full-length hiwi complementary DNA was cloned from human CD34(+) marrow cells. At the amino acid level, the human HIWI protein was 52% homologous to the Drosophila protein. The transient expression of hiwi in the human leukemia cell line KG1 resulted in a dramatic reduction in cellular proliferation. Overexpression of hiwi led to programmed cell death of KG1 cells as demonstrated by the Annexin V assay system. These studies suggest that hiwi maybe an important negative developmental regulator, which, in part, underlies the unique biologic properties associated with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.","['Sharma, A K', 'Nelson, M C', 'Brandt, J E', 'Wessman, M', 'Mahmud, N', 'Weller, K P', 'Hoffman, R']","['Sharma AK', 'Nelson MC', 'Brandt JE', 'Wessman M', 'Mahmud N', 'Weller KP', 'Hoffman R']","['Hematology/Oncology Section, Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (PIWIL1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Induced Silencing Complex)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (piwi protein, Drosophila)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Argonaute Proteins', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Drosophila/chemistry', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Formazans', 'Humans', 'Insect Proteins/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/12 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/01/12 11:00'],"['2001/01/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jan 15;97(2):426-34. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.2.426.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.2.426 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)66007-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Because young patients have the greatest compromise in longevity, the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose radiochemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation after conventional chemotherapy was evaluated in a prospective phase II clinical trial. Thirty-seven patients in a minimal disease state after conventional chemotherapy received fractionated total body irradiation and high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide, followed by purged autologous bone marrow. A reference sample of 188 patients of similar age, stage, and histology managed at this institution before 1988 was identified for comparison of patient characteristics and outcomes. Compared with reference patients, transplant recipients had a higher tumor burden at diagnosis. With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the estimated 10-year survival after transplantation was 86%. There was a single lymphoma death yielding a 10-year disease-specific survival of 97%. There were 2 early transplant-related deaths and 2 late acute leukemia deaths.

In this study, therefore, the relationship between leukemic blast glutathione levels and prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was investigated. A total of 77 childhood ALL samples were analyzed, 62 at initial presentation and 15 at relapse. A 20-fold interindividual variation in glutathione levels at presentation (median, 6.54 nmol/mg protein; range, 1.37 to 27.9) was demonstrated. The median level in T-lineage ALL was 2. 3-fold higher than in B-lineage ALL (Mann-Whitney test, P <.0001). There was a significant correlation between presenting white cell count (WBC) and glutathione level (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, rho = 0.45, P =.001). A high DNA index correlated with low glutathione levels (Mann-Whitney test, P =.013). There was no significant relationship between glutathione levels and in vitro drug sensitivity. Patients with glutathione levels above the median had a significantly greater risk of relapse (log-rank test statistic, 5.55; P =.018), and the overall survival rate was significantly reduced (log-rank test statistic, 4.38; P =.04). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that glutathione concentration was of independent prognostic value when assessed in conjunction with age, gender, WBC, and immunophenotype. The association of elevated blast glutathione levels with an increased risk of relapse suggests that glutathione-depleting agents may be of therapeutic value in patients who present with a high WBC.","['Kearns, P R', 'Pieters, R', 'Rottier, M M', 'Pearson, A D', 'Hall, A G']","['Kearns PR', 'Pieters R', 'Rottier MM', 'Pearson AD', 'Hall AG']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, University of Newcastle, and the Medical School, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/01/12 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/01/12 11:00'],"['2001/01/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jan 15;97(2):393-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.2.393.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.2.393 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)66002-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-four patients developed graft failure (actuarial probability, 11%; 95% confidence interval, 7.1-14. 9). Prognostic factors considered were sex and age of donor and recipient, donor-recipient blood group compatibility, diagnosis, disease status at transplant, conditioning regimen, cytomegalovirus serology, number of CD34(+) and CD3(+) cells infused, and cryopreservation. The major factor associated with graft failure was the number of CD3(+) cells in the inoculum. Twenty-three of 155 patients receiving a T-cell dose in the graft less than or equal to 0.2 x 10(6)/kg experienced graft failure, compared with only one of 102 patients receiving more than 0.2 x 10(6)/kg (actuarial probability 18% vs 1%, respectively; P =.0001). The actuarial probability of graft failure progressively increased as the number of CD3(+) cells in the graft decreased, which was determined by grouping the number of CD3(+) cells in quartiles (log-rank P =.03; log-rank for trend P =.003). In the multivariate analysis by the proportional hazard method, 2 covariates entered into regression at a significant level: CD3(+) cells less than or equal to 0.2 x 10(6)/kg (risk ratio = 17; P <.0001), and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) conditioned with busulphan-based regimens (risk ratio = 4.8; P =.001). From these results it appears that the number of CD3(+) cells in the inoculum-with a threshold of 0.2 x 10(6)/kg or less-is the most critical factor in maintaining a sustained engraftment in allo-PBT/CD34(+) from HLA-identical siblings. In addition, for patients with CML receiving 0.2 x 10(6)/kg or less CD3(+) cells, total body irradiation might be better than busulphan-based regimens.","['Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Rozman, C', 'Pimentel, P', 'Solano, C', 'de la Rubia, J', 'Brunet, S', 'Perez-Oteiza, J', 'Ferra, C', 'Zuazu, J', 'Caballero, D', 'Carvalhais, A', 'Diez, J L', 'Espigado, I', 'Martinez, C', 'Campilho, F', 'Sanz, M A', 'Sierra, J', 'Garcia-Conde, J', 'Montserrat, E']","['Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Rozman C', 'Pimentel P', 'Solano C', 'de la Rubia J', 'Brunet S', 'Perez-Oteiza J', 'Ferra C', 'Zuazu J', 'Caballero D', 'Carvalhais A', 'Diez JL', 'Espigado I', 'Martinez C', 'Campilho F', 'Sanz MA', 'Sierra J', 'Garcia-Conde J', 'Montserrat E']","['Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. aurbano@clinic.ub.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Blood Donors', 'CD3 Complex/*blood', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/blood/*etiology/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/standards', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/standards', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nuclear Family', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/immunology']",,2001/01/12 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/01/12 11:00'],"['2001/01/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jan 15;97(2):383-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.2.383.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.2.383 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)66000-1 [pii]']",,,,,['Spanish Group for Allogenic Peripheral Blood Transplantation'],,,,,,,

DESIGN: The complementary DNA of mAb 2F5, an anti-HIV-1 gp41 antibody, and of sCD4-IgG chimeric immunoadhesin were transferred into 3T3 cells using Moloney murine leukaemia virus vectors. The cells were then incorporated into a collagen structure called the neo-organ, which allowed the continuous production of the therapeutic molecules. METHODS: The antiviral effects in vivo of 2F5 or sCD4-IgG or both compounds were evaluated in neo-organ-implanted SCID mice that were grafted with human CD4 CEM T cells and challenged with HIV-1 Lai or MN. RESULTS: In SCID mice implanted with 2F5 neo-organs, antibody plasma levels reached 500-2000 ng/ml. Viral loads after HIV-1 challenge were significantly reduced in neo-organ-implanted HIV-infected mice. Although 29 x 10(7) and 13 x 10(8) HIV-1-RNA copies/ml were detected at 12 days in the controls (mice injected with Lai and MN, respectively) less than 16.5 x 10(3) HIV-1-RNA copies/ml were observed in all implanted mice injected with either Lai or MN. The intracellular viral load was also reduced in CD4 cells recovered from the implanted mice. Comparable antiviral effects were obtained with CD4-IgG neo-organs. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the anti-HIV properties of 2F5 and sCD4-IgG continuously produced in vivo after ex-vivo gene therapy in SCID mice.","['Sanhadji, K', 'Grave, L', 'Touraine, J L', 'Leissner, P', 'Rouzioux, C', 'Firouzi, R', 'Kehrli, L', 'Tardy, J C', 'Mehtali, M']","['Sanhadji K', 'Grave L', 'Touraine JL', 'Leissner P', 'Rouzioux C', 'Firouzi R', 'Kehrli L', 'Tardy JC', 'Mehtali M']","['Laboratoires des Deficits Immunitaires et de Retrovirologie, Faculte de Medecine RTH Laennec, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Immunoadhesins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/transplantation', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'CD4 Immunoadhesins/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genetic Therapy', 'HIV Antibodies/genetics/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/*therapy/virology', 'HIV-1/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Load']",,2001/01/12 11:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/01/12 11:00'],"['2001/01/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS. 2000 Dec 22;14(18):2813-22. doi: 10.1097/00002030-200012220-00002.,,['10.1097/00002030-200012220-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the basis for AN-9 increased anticancer activity compared to BA, by studying the uptake of BA and AN-9 into the cells. METHODS: The uptake rate and level of [14C]-AN-9 and [14C]-BA, labeled on the carboxylic moiety of BA, into HL-60 and MEL leukemic cell lines was measured. The cells were filtered and the retained radioactivity was determined. The dependence of the uptake on the activity of cellular esterases and membrane fluidity was investigated. RESULTS: The uptake level in cells incubated with [14C]-AN-9 increased rapidly, peaked after 30 min in MEL and 1 h in HL-60 cells, and declined thereafter. This decline could be attributed to the hydrolysis of AN-9 by cellular esterases and catabolism of the released BA to CO2. In cells pretreated with an esterase inhibitor and incubated with [14C]-AN-9, the reduction of radioactivity was less precipitous. In cells exposed to [14C]-BA, the intracellular radioactivity level was low and unaffected by treatment with an esterase inhibitor. The uptake of [14C]-AN-9 decreased significantly at 4 degrees C compared to that at 37 degrees C. CONCLUSION: The higher potency of AN-9 compared to BA could be at least partially attributed to the more rapid uptake of the lipophilic AN-9 and the release of BA in the cells.","['Zimra, Y', 'Nudelman, A', 'Zhuk, R', 'Rabizadeh, E', 'Shaklai, M', 'Aviram, A', 'Rephaeli, A']","['Zimra Y', 'Nudelman A', 'Zhuk R', 'Rabizadeh E', 'Shaklai M', 'Aviram A', 'Rephaeli A']","['Basil and Gerald Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine Tel-Aviv University, Beilinson Campus, Petach-Tikva 49100, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '122110-53-6 (pivalyloxymethyl butyrate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Esterases/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Prodrugs/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/12 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/01/12 11:00'],"['2001/01/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2000 Dec;126(12):693-8. doi: 10.1007/s004320000165.,,['10.1007/s004320000165 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work we investigated the presence of GHR in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, as well as the ability of GH treatment to stimulate both GHR and survival signaling pathways downstream GHR. Our results demonstrate that (1) both GHR mRNA and GHR immunoreactivity are present in HL-60 cells; (2) GH treatment results in an increase in the phosphorylation of the GHR-associated Jak2 and Stat3 proteins, indicating the ability of the hormone to induce receptor activation; and (3) activation of GHR increases the activity of Akt, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a prominent role in the regulation of cell survival. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GHR activation promotes survival of HL-60 cells, thus suggesting that GH plays a major role in the regulation of cell survival in the hemopoietic system, via an autocrine/paracrine mechanism.","['Costoya, J A', 'Rios, R', 'Garcia-Barros, M', 'Gallego, R', 'Garcia-Caballero, T', 'Senaris, R', 'Arce, V M', 'Devesa, J']","['Costoya JA', 'Rios R', 'Garcia-Barros M', 'Gallego R', 'Garcia-Caballero T', 'Senaris R', 'Arce VM', 'Devesa J']","['Departamento de Fisiologia, Facultad de Medicina, Santiago de Compostela, 15705, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol Res Commun,Molecular cell biology research communications : MCBRC,100889076,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Primers', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Somatotropin/genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2001/01/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/12 11:00'],"['2001/01/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol Res Commun. 2000 Jul;4(1):26-31. doi: 10.1006/mcbr.2000.0252.,,"['10.1006/mcbr.2000.0252 [doi]', 'S1522472400902526 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,

BLV infection has also been studied extensively in an in vivo ovine model that provides a unique system for studying B-cell leukemogenesis. There is no evidence that BLV can directly infect ovine B cells in vitro, and there are no direct data regarding the oncogenic potential of the viral Tax transactivator in B cells. Therefore, we developed ovine B-cell culture systems to study the interaction between BLV and its natural target, the B cell. In this study, we used murine CD154 (CD40 ligand) and gamma-chain-common cytokines to support the growth of B cells isolated from ovine lymphoid tissues. Integrated provirus, extrachromosomal forms, and viral transcripts were detected in BLV-exposed populations of immature, rapidly dividing surface immunoglobulin M-positive B cells from sheep ileal Peyer's patches and also in activated mature B cells isolated from blood. Conclusive evidence of direct B-cell infection by BLV was obtained through the use of cloned B cells derived from sheep jejunal Peyer's patches. Finally, inoculation of sheep with BLV-infected cultures proved that infectious virus was shed from in vitro-infected B cells. Collectively, these data confirm that a variety of ovine B-cell populations can support productive infection by BLV. The development of ovine B-cell cultures permissive for BLV infection provides a controlled system for investigating B-cell leukemogenic processes and the pathogenesis of BLV infection.","['Van den Broeke, A', 'Cleuter, Y', 'Beskorwayne, T', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Szynal, M', 'Bagnis, C', 'Burny, A', 'Griebel, P']","['Van den Broeke A', 'Cleuter Y', 'Beskorwayne T', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Szynal M', 'Bagnis C', 'Burny A', 'Griebel P']","['Hematologie Experimentale, Institut J.

This result indicates that the activity of LIF for mast cell growth is mediated by 3T3 fibroblasts. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts enhanced mast cell growth. In addition, dominant-negative Stat3-transfected fibroblasts blocked LIF-mediated mast cell growth in the co-culture system.

The purpose of this study is to assess the outcome of OLT in patients with a preexistent malignant state.

Those patients with solid-organ malignancies had their tumor detected at an early stage and underwent curative treatment before or during OLT. Patients were followed up for a median of 71 months (range, 1 to 119 months) post-OLT, and the rates of rejection and malignancy were compared with those of transplant recipients without preexisting malignancy during the same period. One patient had a recurrence of his primary malignancy (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) after 27 months, whereas another patient developed a de novo posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder after 57 months. One patient with MPD developed acute leukemia 72 months after OLT. In comparison, of 1,079 OLTs performed in patients without preexisting malignancy during the same period, there were 34 cases of de novo malignancies. The rate of rejection in patients with and without preexisting malignancy was similar. Successful medium-term outcome after OLT can be achieved in carefully selected patients with preexisting malignancy providing the malignancy is amenable to curative treatment before or at OLT.

Recently, members of the NF-kappaB family, including p65(Rel A), have been implicated in promoting survival of various hematopoeitic neoplasms, including T cell malignancies such as adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma. We investigated the expression of active NF-kappa B p65(Rel A) in cases of mycosis fungoides (MF) and the effect of chemical inhibitors of NF-kappa B on apoptosis in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines. Paraffin-embedded tissues from 23 cutaneous lesions and a single lymph node biopsy from patients diagnosed with MF were evaluated for p65(Rel A) expression by using a monoclonal mouse antibody that detects the activated form of p65(Rel A). Apoptosis after treatment with the NF-kappa B inhibitors gliotoxin, MG132, BAY 11-7082, and BAY 11-7085 was quantitatively measured in the CTCL cell lines HuT-78 and HH by propidium iodide (PI)/cell cycle analysis for detection of a hypodiploid (sub-G(0)) population and by determination of increased Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) expression. Nuclear extracts from CTCL cells before and after chemical inhibition were analyzed for NF-kappa B nuclear DNA-binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with quantitative densitometry. Nuclear expression of p65(Rel A) before and after treatment with the various inhibitory compounds was measured by immunofluorescence staining in each CTCL cell line. Neoplastic T lymphocytes from 22 of 24 cases of MF showed strong nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of active p65(Rel A). Compared with untreated control cells, a marked increase in apoptosis, a significant decrease in NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity, and a marked decrease in nuclear p65(Rel A) expression were seen in cells from both CTCL cell lines after chemical NF-kappa B inhibition. These data show that the active form of NF-kappa B p65(Rel A) is commonly expressed in neoplastic T lymphocytes in patients with MF. In CTCL cell lines, the significant decrease in nuclear NF-kappa B expression and the marked increase in spontaneous apoptosis caused by chemical NF-kappa B inhibition suggest a critical role for NF-kappa B in the pathogenesis and tumor cell maintenance of CTCLs.

ETO has been shown to interact with corepressors, such as N-CoR and mSin3A to form complexes containing histone deacetylases. To define regions of ETO required for maximal repressor activity, we analyzed amino-terminal deletions in a transcriptional repression assay. We found that ETO mutants lacking the first 236 amino acids were not affected in their repressor activity, whereas a further deletion of 85 amino acids drastically reduced repressor function and high molecular weight complex formation. This latter mutant can still homodimerize and bind to N-CoR but shows only weak binding to mSin3A. Furthermore, we could show that a ""core repressor domain"" comprising nervy homology region 2 and its amino- and carboxyl-terminal flanking sequences recruits mSin3A and induces transcriptional repression. These results suggest that mSin3A and N-CoR bind to ETO independently and that both binding sites cooperate to maximize ETO-mediated transcriptional repression. Thus, ETO has a modular structure, and the interaction between the individual elements is essential for the formation of a stable repressor complex and efficient transcriptional repression.","['Hildebrand, D', 'Tiefenbach, J', 'Heinzel, T', 'Grez, M', 'Maurer, A B']","['Hildebrand D', 'Tiefenbach J', 'Heinzel T', 'Grez M', 'Maurer AB']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Biomedical Research, Paul-Ehrlich Strasse 42-44, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Deletion', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2001/01/21 19:15,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/01/21 19:15'],"['2001/01/21 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/21 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Mar 30;276(13):9889-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M010582200.

Antisense oligonucleotides directed against p75NTR promote the survival of nerve growth factor-deprived dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons in vitro (Barrett, G.; Bartlett, P., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:6501-6505; 1994) and axotomized dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons in vivo (Cheema, S. S.; Barrett, G. L.; Bartlett, P. F., J. Neurosci. Res. 46:239-245; 1996). In this study we compared the neuroprotective effects of antisense p75NRT oligonucleotides with two neurotrophic factors, namely nerve growth factor (NGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor, on cultured sensory neurons derived from postnatal day 7 and 14 rat dorsal root ganglia. After 3 d in culture, treatment with the neurotrophic factors had significant survival effects on sensory neuron cultures compared to treatment with basal medium (control). However, after 6 and 9 d in culture these rescue effects were not apparent. In contrast, antisense p75NTR oligonucleotides rescued significantly higher numbers of dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons after 6 and 9 d in culture than treatment with neurotrophic factors, sense oligonucleotides, and basal medium. Furthermore, antisense p75NTR oligonucleotides rescued trkA-, B-, and C-expressing neurons, while NGF and leukemia inhibitory factor targeted primarily the trkA-positive neurons. These findings suggest that antisense-based strategies that inhibit gene expression of cytotoxic molecules are more efficient at preventing postnatal sensory neuronal death in vitro than treatment with individual neurotrophic factors.","['Lowry, K S', 'Cheema, S S']","['Lowry KS', 'Cheema SS']","['Department of Anatomy, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

The proportion of patients from whom Ph-negative stem cells were obtained was similar between patients who had, or had not, received prior alphaIFN. Fifteen patients in chronic phase (median age 45) proceeded to PBSCT following busulphan 16 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/m2. Nine of the 13 patients who had failed to respond to prior alphaIFN proceeded to stem cell transplantation as soon as was feasible and six of the newly diagnosed patients were transplanted after failing to achieve a cytogenetic response after a minimum of 12 months on alphaIFN following progenitor cell harvest.

Survival for alphaIFN non-responders who were transplanted is 74% at 5 years from diagnosis and 75% at 3 years from transplant. Cytogenetic analysis performed 3 months post transplant demonstrated one patient with a complete cytogenetic response, seven with a partial response and three with no response. Six patients remain partially Ph-negative, with one major CR. Survival for all patients in the protocol is favourable compared with conventional therapy and is particularly encouraging following PBSCT for alphaIFN non-responsive patients.

Down-regulation of the lck and fyn genes and activation of the lyn gene was demonstrated in the IL-2 independent HTLV-positive TY8-3 cells. Subclones of TY8-3 cells were again able to be efficiently transformed and became IL-2 independent several months after coculture. Our results thus exhibit that TY8-3 cells and its subclones provide us with a very unique model whereby IL-2 independent transformation events of human T cells by HTLV-I/II in vitro can be studied at a clonal level.","['Yoshida, T', 'Miyagawa, E', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Takahashi, Y', 'Yamashita, A', 'Miura, H', 'Itoyama, Y', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Yoshida T', 'Miyagawa E', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Kobayashi S', 'Takahashi Y', 'Yamashita A', 'Miura H', 'Itoyama Y', 'Yamamoto N']","['Biophenix Co., Ltd., Ube Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Line, Transformed', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/genetics', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Myasthenia Gravis/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thymoma/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'src-Family Kinases']",,2001/01/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/10 11:00'],"['2001/01/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/10 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Jan 1;91(1):99-108. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(20010101)91:1<99::aid-ijc1016>3.0.co;2-o.,,"['10.1002/1097-0215(20010101)91:1<99::AID-IJC1016>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(20010101)91:1<99::aid-ijc1016>3.0.co;2-o [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

LMP-1 mimics a constitutively activated receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, mediating diverse oncogenic functions that influence growth, differentiation and susceptibility to apoptosis. Given the critical functions of LMP-1 in EBV-associated transformation, it represents a rational therapeutic target for modulation. We used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeted to LMP-1 as a strategy to suppress LMP-1 expression and thereby inhibit its functions. In previous studies, we have shown that short-term treatment of EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) with LMP-1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides can dramatically reduce levels of LMP-1 protein in association with inhibition of proliferation, stimulation of apoptosis, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and enhanced sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide. Here, we provide further evidence of the profound effects of reducing LMP-1 levels using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in EBV-transformed B cells. We have shown that LMP-1 antisense treatment of LCLs partially restores sensitivity to the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of transforming growth factor-beta, a potent negative regulator of normal human B-cell growth, in association with a reduction in cyclin D2 levels. In addition, LMP-1 antisense sensitizes LCLs to chemotherapeutic drugs from diverse classes, including etoposide, vincristine and dexamethasone, by enhancing apoptotic cell death. Finally, the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of LMP-1 antisense treatment were observed not only in laboratory-derived LCLs, but also in an EBV-positive cell line derived from an AIDS-related lymphoma. These studies demonstrate that antisense targeting of LMP-1 represents a rational therapeutic strategy for EBV-positive lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Kenney, J L', 'Guinness, M E', 'Reiss, M', 'Lacy, J']","['Kenney JL', 'Guinness ME', 'Reiss M', 'Lacy J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Separation', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'DNA, Antisense/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*genetics']",,2001/01/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/10 11:00'],"['2001/01/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/10 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Jan 1;91(1):89-98. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(20010101)91:1<89::aid-ijc1015>3.0.co;2-u.,,"['10.1002/1097-0215(20010101)91:1<89::AID-IJC1015>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(20010101)91:1<89::aid-ijc1015>3.0.co;2-u [doi]']",,,['CA 67396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Nonablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation holds the promise of allowing powerful alloimmune responses to eradicate disease processes while minimizing the initial treatment-related morbidity and mortality, and it appears to be the necessary enabling platform by which to apply allogeneic cellular therapy. Intuitively, this approach should broaden the eligibility for potentially curative allogeneic transplantation in various disease categories, reduce initial hospitalization costs, and at the same time have a positive impact on quality of life.

Immunologic detection of the drug efflux pumps, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), correlate with functional assays of drug resistance. These accumulation defects also appear operable in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Many of the efflux pumps identified share significant structural homology with the large superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters. Other markers such as lung-resistance protein, bcl-2, and breast cancer-resistance protein, have been described in acute myeloid leukemia patients although their pathophysiology and clinical relevance are less clear and the methodology for their quantification are not well standardized. Preclinical studies have shown that small molecules capable of reversing efflux can restore drug sensitivity in resistant tumor models. Although initial clinical studies were limited by both potency and specificity of the reverser, later studies with more effective reversers have in many instances been limited by pharmacokinetic interactions exacerbating the clinical toxicities of chemotherapy. Although one large randomized study has demonstrated a proven survival advantage without increased toxicity using cyclosporine, the inconsistent results with other modulators raise doubt as to the utility and overall strategy of using drug efflux blockers in patients with established Pgp overexpression. Many of these patients have additional resistance mechanisms, and achieving meaningful clinical responses will likely require more complex clinical strategies. Preventing or delaying development of drug resistance in chemosensitive patients represents another therapeutic strategy to be tested.","['Chauncey, T R']",['Chauncey TR'],"['Marrow Transplant Unit, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, Washington, USA. thomas.chauncey@med.va.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*pharmacology', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis']",65,2001/01/10 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/10 11:00'],"['2001/01/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/10 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2001 Jan;13(1):21-6. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200101000-00005.,,['10.1097/00001622-200101000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred and thirty eight survivors were evaluated. Of these 73 had had acute leukemia and 65 had had solid tumour (nephroblastoma or sympathetic nervous system tumour) diagnosed before the age of 15 years. Elapsed time since diagnosis was at least 10 years and duration of therapy was more than two years. Demographic and social data of the survivors, their parents and siblings, diagnosis, number of relapses and treatment given were obtained from medical records and from individual interviews at the time of assessment. Cognitive and emotional dimensions and the tools used to measure them were intelligent quotient (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for children and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), anxiety features and state (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for children and adults) and depressive symptoms (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Depression subscale). Ophthalmologic assessment included visual acuity, measurement of intraocular pressure and ophthalmoscopic examination. Audiologic evaluation included tonal audiometry for frequencies from 125 to 8,000 Hz. RESULTS: Total, verbal and performance intelligent quotients were 102, 106 and 105 respectively for the whole sample. Five percent of survivors scored under 70 (mental deficiency), and 6.5 % over 129 (gifted). The scores of solid tumour survivors were higher than those of leukemia survivors who were cranially irradiated at dosages >= 24 Gy (108 vs 98; p = 0.03), and were similar to those of leukemia survivors irradiated at lower dosages (102) or who had not been irradiated (109). Intelligent quotient correlated positively with age at diagnosis and negatively with cumulated intrathecal methotrexate and cranial irradiation dosages. Survivors of acute leukemia who relapsed scored 14 points less than those who had not relapsed. The most affected cognitive areas were comprehension, arithmetic ability, attention, visual and verbal memory, causative reasoning and visual-motor coordination. No relationship was found between sensory sequelae and cognitive capacities, probably due to the mildness of the sequelae. The prevalence of depression was greater in cancer survivors than in the general population but that of anxiety was lower. CONCLUSIONS: Intelligent quotient was within normal limits. Lower scores were related to cranial radiotherapy, age at diagnosis and relapses. Emotionally, the survivors coped successfully with cancer, depressive symptoms being more prevalent than in the general population and anxiety almost negligible.","['Benedito Monleon, M C', 'Lopez Andreu , J A', 'Serra EstellesI, I', 'Harto Castano , M', 'Gisbert Aguilar , J', 'Mulas Delgado , F', 'Ferris I Tortajada , J']","['Benedito Monleon MC', 'Lopez Andreu JA', 'Serra EstellesI I', 'Harto Castano M', 'Gisbert Aguilar J', 'Mulas Delgado F', 'Ferris I Tortajada J']","['Unidad de Oncologia Pediatrica, Hospital Infantil La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,An Esp Pediatr,Anales espanoles de pediatria,0420463,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', '*Survivors']",,2001/01/10 11:00,2002/01/30 10:01,['2001/01/10 11:00'],"['2001/01/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/30 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/10 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,An Esp Pediatr. 2000 Dec;53(6):553-60.,Secuelas psicologicas en los supervivientes a largo plazo de cancer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (mean age 6.5 years; mean weight 25 kg) received a CBT between July 1994 and May 1998 in several centres of the Spanish Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Group. In 2 patients the donor was an identical human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-sibling and in two the donor was a mismatched family donor. In 24 patients the donor was unrelated, and 21 of these received an HLA-mismatched CBT. Twenty-one patients (75 %) received a CBT for leukemia mainly in advanced phase. Seven patients were transplanted for genetic disease. Of these, five had congenital immunodeficiency. The conditioning treatment included total body irradiation in ten patients and combined chemotherapy in the remaining patients. In all patients graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was performed with cyclosporine, and corticosteroids or methotrexate were added in patients with HLA-mismatched donors. The mean number of nucleated cells infused was 53.4 x 106/kg. RESULTS: Graft failure was observed in nine patients. Eighteen patients (64.3%) developed grade IIIV acute GVHD. Eight patients (28.6%) developed severe GVHD. Actuarial event free survival (EFS) of all the patients was 34.4 +/- 9% at 3 years, with a mean followup of 16.6 months. EFS was more favorable in patients with genetic disease (71>=6 17%) and in those with an HLA (A, B and DR) identical donor (6/6) (66>=6 19%). CONCLUSIONS: The most favorable results were obtained in patients with genetic diseases. We observed an inverse correlation between EFS and patients with HLA identical donors. The high incidence of severe acute GVHD could have been related to a lack of accuracy in the HLA typography of some patients.","['Badell Serra I', 'Olive Oliveras T', 'Madero Lopez L', 'Munoz Villa A', 'Martinez Rubio A', 'Verdeguer Miralles A', 'Diaz De Heredia Rubio C', 'Diaz Perez M', 'Cubells Riero J', 'Maldonado Regalado M', 'Ortega Aramburu J']","['Badell Serra I', 'Olive Oliveras T', 'Madero Lopez L', 'Munoz Villa A', 'Martinez Rubio A', 'Verdeguer Miralles A', 'Diaz De Heredia Rubio C', 'Diaz Perez M', 'Cubells Riero J', 'Maldonado Regalado M', 'Ortega Aramburu J']","['Servicios de Pediatria, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Madrid. ibadell@hsp.santpau.es']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,An Esp Pediatr,Anales espanoles de pediatria,0420463,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Fetal Blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2001/01/10 11:00,2002/01/30 10:01,['2001/01/10 11:00'],"['2001/01/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/30 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/10 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,An Esp Pediatr. 2000 Dec;53(6):513-9.,Trasplante de progenitores hematopoyeticos de sangre de cordon umbilical en ninos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mast cells, the majority of MHC class II molecules reside in intracellular cell type-specific compartments, secretory granules. To understand the molecular basis for the localisation of MHC class II molecules in secretory granules, MHC class II molecules were expressed, together with the invariant chain, in the mast cell line, RBL-2H3. Using electron and confocal microscopy, we observed that in RBL-2H3 cells, mature and immature class II molecules accumulate in secretory granules. Two particular features of class II transport accounted for this intracellular localization: first, a large fraction of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules remained associated with invariant chain fragments. This defect, resulting in a slower rate of MHC class II maturation, was ascribed to a low cathepsin S activity. Second, although a small fraction of class II dimers matured (i.e. became free of invariant chain), allowing their association with antigenic peptides, they were retained in secretory granules. As a consequence of this intracellular localization, cell surface expression of class II molecules was strongly increased by cell activation stimuli which induced the release of the contents of secretory granules. Our results suggest that antigen presentation, and thereby antigen specific T cell stimulation, are regulated in mast cells by stimuli which induce mast cell activation.","['Vincent-Schneider, H', 'Thery, C', 'Mazzeo, D', 'Tenza, D', 'Raposo, G', 'Bonnerot, C']","['Vincent-Schneider H', 'Thery C', 'Mazzeo D', 'Tenza D', 'Raposo G', 'Bonnerot C']","['INSERM, U. 520, Institut Curie,12, rue Lhomond, France. bonnerot@curie.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cathepsins/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Lysosomes/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Rats', 'Secretory Vesicles/enzymology/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/10 11:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/01/10 11:00'],"['2001/01/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/10 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2001 Jan;114(Pt 2):323-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is released from metabolically active or stressed cells and subsequently acts as a regulatory molecule through binding to specific A1, A2A, A2B and A3 cell surface receptors. The synthesis of agonists and antagonists to the adenosine receptors and their cloning enabled the exploration of their physiological functions. As nearly all cells express specific adenosine receptors, adenosine serves as a physiological regulator and acts as a cardioprotector, neuroprotector, chemoprotector, and as an immunomodulator. At the cellular level, activation of the receptors by adenosine initiates signal transduction mechanisms through G-protein associated receptors. Adenosine's unique characteristic is to differentially modulate normal and transformed cell growth, depending upon its extracellular concentration, the expression of adenosine cell surface receptors, and the physiological state of the target cell. Stimulation of cell proliferation following incubation with adenosine has been demonstrated in a variety of normal cells in the range of low micromolar concentrations, including mesangial and thymocyte cells, Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, and bone marrow cells. Induction of apoptosis in tumor or normal cells was shown at higher adenosine concentrations (>100 microM) such as in leukemia HL-60, lymphoma U-937, A431 epidermoid cells, and GH3 tumor pituitary cell lines. It was further noted that the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) plays a key role in the inhibitory and stimulatory growth activities of adenosine. Modulation of the A3AR was found to affect cell growth either positively or negatively depending on the concentration of the agonist, similar to the effect described for adenosine. At nanomolar concentrations, the A3AR agonists possess dual activity, i.e., antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells and stimulatory effect on bone marrow cells. In vivo, these agonists exerted anti-cancer effects, and when given in combination with chemotherapy, they enhanced the chemotherapeutic index and acted as chemoprotective agents. Taken together, activation of the A3AR, by minute concentrations of its natural ligand or synthetic agonists, may serve as a new approach for cancer therapy.","['Ohana, G', 'Bar-Yehuda, S', 'Barer, F', 'Fishman, P']","['Ohana G', 'Bar-Yehuda S', 'Barer F', 'Fishman P']","['Laboratory of Clinical and Tumor Immunology, The Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Tel-Aviv University, Petach-Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Receptor, Adenosine A3)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Receptor, Adenosine A3', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/*physiology', 'Reference Values', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",47,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2001 Jan;186(1):19-23. doi: 10.1002/1097-4652(200101)186:1<19::AID-JCP1011>3.0.CO;2-3.,,"['10.1002/1097-4652(200101)186:1<19::AID-JCP1011>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-4652(200101)186:1<19::AID-JCP1011>3.0.CO;2-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The SWI/SNF family of complexes, which are conserved from yeast to humans, are ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes required for the transcription of a number of genes in yeast. In humans, the gene encoding the BAF47/hSNF5 subunit of the complex, located at 22q11.2, has been found to be mutated in a number of human tumors including rhabdoid, rhabdomyosarcoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, and CNS tumors such as medulloblastomas and choroid plexus carcinomas. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been reported for the BAF47 region in breast and liver cancer. LOH has also been reported in breast and ovarian cancer within 17q12-25, a gene-rich area including BRCA1, BAF60B, and BAF57.

However, to the authors' knowledge, data regarding pesticide exposures in children diagnosed with NHL have been lacking. METHODS: The Children's Cancer Group conducted a study comparing 268 children who developed NHL or leukemia with bulk disease with a group of matched, randomly selected regional population controls. The telephone interviews of both the case and control mothers included selected questions regarding occupational and home exposures to pesticides around the time of the index pregnancy and exposure of the child. RESULTS: A significant association was found between risk of NHL and increased frequency of reported pesticide use in the home (odds ratio [OR] = 7.3 for use most days; trend P = 0.05), professional exterminations within the home (OR = 3.0; P = 0.002), and postnatal exposure (OR = 2.4; P = 0.001). Elevated risks were found for T-cell and B-cell lymphomas; for lymphoblastic, large cell, and Burkitt morphologies; and in both young (age < 6 years) and older children. There was an increased risk of NHL with occupational exposure to pesticides (OR = 1.7) that was not significant overall, but that was significant for Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 9.6; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study provide further evidence linking pesticide exposure to the risk of NHL, but the authors were unable to implicate any specific agent.","['Buckley, J D', 'Meadows, A T', 'Kadin, M E', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Siegel, S', 'Robison, L L']","['Buckley JD', 'Meadows AT', 'Kadin ME', 'Le Beau MM', 'Siegel S', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA. jbuckley@hsc.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mothers', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Dec 1;89(11):2315-21. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20001201)89:11<2315::aid-cncr21>3.0.co;2-g.,,"['10.1002/1097-0142(20001201)89:11<2315::AID-CNCR21>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20001201)89:11<2315::aid-cncr21>3.0.co;2-g [doi]']",,,"['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA38908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Caspase activation culminates in a cell death process known as ""apoptosis."" The activation of these intracellular proteases is carefully controlled through a delicate balance of anti- and pro-death proteins, serving to precisely regulate cell life span. Defects in the natural death pathway promote tumorigenesis by prolonging cell life span and hence cell accumulation. Low-grade B-cell malignancies, particularly follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) represent quintessential examples of human neoplasms characterized primarily by a problem with cell death rather than cell cycle. Because the cell suicide pathway is also required for tumor eradication by the immune system, anticancer drugs, and irradiation, cancer-associated defects in the cellular apoptosis machinery also play an important role in treatment failures. Monoclonal antibody-based therapies may provide opportunities to either bypass defects in apoptosis pathways or to activate latent apoptotic programs in cancer cells, particularly in lymphoid malignancies where tissue-specific antigens can be exploited for cell-selective activation of apoptosis. Recent knowledge about apoptosis pathways is reviewed, and some examples of opportunities for therapeutic intervention are discussed.","['Reed, C J']",['Reed CJ'],"['The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology']",42,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2000 Oct;37(4 Suppl 7):9-16. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90055-6.,,"['S0037-1963(00)90055-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90055-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The studied material comprised 60 blood samples from 19 patients including 13 renal transplant recipients and 6 with acute leukaemia. The samples were subjected to hybridisation (Murex Hybrid Capture System CMV DNA) and PCR carried out in 3 variants: with one pair of primers (single PCR), nested PCR and Digene SHARP System with detection of PCR product using a genetic probe in ELISA system. The sensitivity of the variants ranged from 10(0) particles of viral DNA in nested PCR to 10(2) in single PCR. The producer claimed the sensitivity of the hybridisation test to be 3 x 10(5) and it seems to be sufficient for detection of CMV infection. The obtained results show that sensitivity of hybridisation was comparable to that of single PCR and the possibility of obtaining quantitative results makes it superior, on efficacy of antiviral therapy, especially in monitoring CMV infection in immunossuppressed patients and in following the efficacy of antiviral treatment.","['Siennicka, J', 'Trzcinska, A', 'Litwinska, B', 'Durlik, M', 'Seferynska, I', 'Palynyczko, G', 'Kantoch, M']","['Siennicka J', 'Trzcinska A', 'Litwinska B', 'Durlik M', 'Seferynska I', 'Palynyczko G', 'Kantoch M']",['Zaklad Wirusologii PZH w Warszawie.'],['pol'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Med Dosw Mikrobiol,Medycyna doswiadczalna i mikrobiologia,0210575,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Cytomegalovirus Infections/*diagnosis/immunology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Kidney Transplantation/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Dosw Mikrobiol. 2000;52(3):283-93.,Ocena przydatnosci roznych wariantow metody PCR oraz metody hybrydyzacji kwasow nukleinowych w wykrywaniu zakazenia CMV u pacjentow z immunosupresja.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examination of the survival curves shows the DFS rate at 5 years in UKALL Trial 1 of 5% rising to 38% in UKALL Trial XII (year 2000). Unfortunately, compared with children with ALL, these results in adults must be regarded as poor, because in the UKALL children's trials the EFS rate at 5 years for a child entered in the year 2000 is expected to be above 80%. With a low proportion of all adults entered into randomized trials, one cannot be certain that improvements result from treatment rather than patient selection. Only recently have randomized trials in adults become large enough to detect plausible treatment effects. The authors believe that the main contribution of these trials so far, confirmed by other groups, is in examining prognostic features in al patients and finding that age and the presence of the Ph chromosome, independent of WBC count, gender, and cell type, is the main feature for predicting outcome. The UKALL XII trial will provide valuable information on the relative merits of transplantation and molecular studies of MRD. An in-depth study of a large number of Ph chromosome-positive ALL leukemias will also provide information on which to base future studies. Preliminary data suggest that all Ph-positive patients should undergo some sort of allograft early after CR is achieved, because these patients are not rescued by BMT after relapse. At the time of the publication of this article, preliminary studies suggest that STIs may not be as effective in Ph-positive ALL as in chronic granulocytic leukemia. The challenge for the future is to understand the biologic role of age and its impact on outcome so as to overcome ""ageism"" in adult ALL.","['Durrant, I J', 'Richards, S M', 'Prentice, H G', 'Goldstone, A H']","['Durrant IJ', 'Richards SM', 'Prentice HG', 'Goldstone AH']","['Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Data Collection', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",30,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2000 Dec;14(6):1327-52. doi: 10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70189-1.,,"['S0889-8588(05)70189-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70189-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, most adults with ALL will ultimately experience a recurrence and die of their leukemia. Although most children with ALL may now be cured with current therapeutic regimens, the ability to distinguish good-risk patients from those who are likely to relapse has important clinical implications. Relapse, in most pediatric and adult cases, is thought to result from residual leukemia cells that remain following achievement of ""complete"" remission but are below the limits of detection using conventional morphologic assessment of the bone marrow.

Role of flow cytometry in diagnosis and monitoring of disease.,1251-65,"Flow cytometry has revolutionized the study of hematopoietic cells. Immunophenotyping by multiparameter flow cytometry supplements conventional morphologic diagnosis by providing information on cell lineage and differentiation in ALL and helps monitor disease by improving sensitivity in detecting minimal residual disease. The use of multiple MoAbs and multicolor study by flow cytometry has revealed heterogeneity among ALL and mixed-lineage acute leukemia, which are assigned to the same diagnostic categories by morphology. As technology has improved, clinical and research applications of flow cytometry have expanded to include evaluation of nuclear markers, oncogene proteins, apoptosis, cytokine receptors, and drug resistance. Expanded identification of MoAbs against leukemia-specific markers and the use of QFCM be a significant in managing patients with ALL in the future. In addition, flow cytometry and flow cytometric sorting will be combined more and more with other technologies, such as molecular probing or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The sorting of rare malignant cells based on immunophenotype and subsequent confirmation by PCR or FISH has already been proven feasible. Ultimately, it is hoped that further definition of subgroups of ALL by immunophenotyping using prognostically significant markers and the use of hybrid technologies of flow cytometry and molecular analysis or cytogenetics will improve treatment strategies for patients with ALL.","['Huh, Y O', 'Ibrahim, S']","['Huh YO', 'Ibrahim S']","['Department of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas, M.

We devised their lipophilic derivatization as a means of enhancing EE by covalently coupling 6-MP with glyceryl monostearate (GMS) via a succinic anhydride spacer. This prodrug had an improved partition coefficient value of 25.16 compared to 1.22 for free drug, confirming higher lipophilicity. A hydrolysis rate study of prodrug indicated 2.90%, 12.5%, 24.1%, and 25.1% hydrolysis in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and 10%, 20%, and 30% serum, respectively. Liposomes of phosphatidylcholine (PC)/sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and dicetyl phosphate bearing drug or prodrug were prepared by shaking by hand and sonication methods. The EE was found to increase from 1.92% for free drug to 91.8% for drug-conjugate. An in vitro cell line toxicity study on L1210 leukemia cells showed improved performance of liposome-encapsulated drug-conjugate compared to free drug. The plasma drug level profile following administration of free drug and the liposomal formulation containing prodrug (HE liposome) manifested a higher sustained level of the latter, which was further improved in case of sphingomyelin-containing liposomes (STHE liposome). The pharmacokinetic parameters revealed an increase in half-life, from 61 min to 120 min for the HE liposomes and 296 min for the STHE liposomes. Therefore, increased entrapment was made possible through lipophilic derivatization, and it was subsequently tested in vivo.","['Taneja, D', 'Namdeo, A', 'Mishra, P R', 'Khopade, A J', 'Jain, N K']","['Taneja D', 'Namdeo A', 'Mishra PR', 'Khopade AJ', 'Jain NK']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dr. Hari Singh Gour Vishwavidyalaya, Sagar.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Drug Dev Ind Pharm,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,7802620,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '2V6E5WN99N (dicetylphosphate)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Cholesterol', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Leukemia', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Organophosphates', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Prodrugs/*administration & dosage', 'Rats', 'Sphingomyelins/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Dev Ind Pharm. 2000 Dec;26(12):1315-9. doi: 10.1081/ddc-100102315.,,['10.1081/ddc-100102315 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the response rate declines to 10-15% in MDS with substantial transfusion needs. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that the addition of growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) may potentiate the effect of r-EPO on dysplastic erythropoiesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the combination of r-EPO with G-CSF, GM-CSF or IL-3 on the anemia of heavily transfusion-dependent MDS patients, previously unresponsive to r-EPO alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with transfusion-dependent MDS, already treated without significant erythroid response with r-EPO alone, were scheduled to receive, for at least 8 weeks, r-EPO subcutaneously at the dose of 300 U/kg t.i.w. in combination with G-CSF (300 microcg s.c. t.i.w., 27 patients), or GM-CSF (300 microcg s.c. t.i.w., 23 patients), or IL-3 (5 microcg/kg s.c. t.i.w., 10 patients), after a two-week pre-phase during which G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL-3 were administered daily at the same dose, as single drugs. RESULTS: Ten patients were not evaluable for erythroid response because of relevant side effects related to GM-CSF or IL-3 administration. Overall, among 50 patients who completed the study, there were 3 erythroid responses (as determined by complete abolition of red-cell transfusions): 1 (4%) in the G-CSF + r-EPO and 2 (10.5%) in the GM-CSF + r-EPO treated groups. No patient responded to the combination of r-EPO + IL-3. All responders had inappropriate serum levels of endogenous EPO and a relatively short disease duration. Both responders to GM-CSF + r-EPO developed acute myeloid leukemia 2-9 months after the start of the combined therapy. A third elderly patient, treated with the same association, developed marrow hypoplasia. A significant increase in leukocyte count occurred in 96% of patients who received r-EPO + G-CSF, 78.9% of those treated with r-EPO + GM-CSF and 66% of subjects receiving r-EPO + IL-3. A significant increase in platelet count was observed in a single patient receiving r-EPO and GM-CSF, while a slight decrease in platelet count with respect to baseline levels occurred in about 20% of patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the combination of r-EPO with G-CSF, GM-CSF or IL-3, at least at the doses and schedules employed in the present study, has limited efficacy on the anemia of heavily transfusion-dependent MDS patients previously unresponsive to r-EPO alone. However, in this setting of patients, the combination of G-CSF or GM-CSF + r-EPO may occasionally be effective in subjects with low circulating levels of serum EPO and short disease duration.","['Musto, P', 'Sanpaolo, G', ""D'Arena, G"", 'Scalzulli, P R', 'Matera, R', 'Falcone, A', 'Bodenizza, C', 'Perla, G', 'Carotenuto, M']","['Musto P', 'Sanpaolo G', ""D'Arena G"", 'Scalzulli PR', 'Matera R', 'Falcone A', 'Bodenizza C', 'Perla G', 'Carotenuto M']","['Department of Onco-Hematology, Unit of Hematology, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, 71013 S.

We adopted a defective lentivirus derived from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 backbone and carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene to transduce primary human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: AML blasts were maintained with or without cytokines (stem cell factor, FLT3 ligand and interleukin 3) for 48 hours, and successively infected with two spin infection cycles. ALL blasts were cultured on a murine S17 stromal cell line. RESULTS: As regards AML cells, the efficiency of infection at 7 days varied from 8.4 to 37%. As confirmed by cell cycle analysis, cells were, in most of the cases, blocked in different phases of the cycle and did not proliferate during culture: the infection was therefore obtained in the absence of cell proliferation. In contrast, the maintenance of optimal cell viability was of fundamental importance for obtaining good infection levels. As regards ALL blasts, the percentages of infection after 3 days varied from 4.4 to 21%. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that gene delivery into primary human AML and B-precursor ALL cells by an HIV-1 derived lentiviral vector could represent a strategy for engineering leukemic cells for use as cancer vaccines.","['Biagi, E', 'Bambacioni, F', 'Gaipa, G', 'Casati, C', 'Golay, J', 'Biondi, A', 'Introna, M']","['Biagi E', 'Bambacioni F', 'Gaipa G', 'Casati C', 'Golay J', 'Biondi A', 'Introna M']","['Centro M.

Studies based on tumor registries of the general population or including patients referred to hematologic institutions have analyzed reasons for these changes. However, results need to be validated on independent series. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 518 CLL patients diagnosed at our institution between January 1970 and December 1998. In this cohort of patients we looked at characteristics affecting natural history such as age and sex distribution, stage at diagnosis, survival probability and impact of the disease status on the actuarial survival. Trends in these variables were analyzed after splitting the whole series into three groups according to the period in which the diagnosis was made. Group I consisted of 75 patients diagnosed between 1970 and 1979, group II consisted of 149 patients diagnosed in the period 1980--1989, group III was composed of 293 patients diagnosed between 1991 and 1998. RESULTS: Age and sex distribution did not reflect different periods of diagnosis. The proportion of patients in whom diagnosis was established in low clinical stage (stage A) was higher in the group III (72%) than in groups I or II (26.3% and 50.3%, respectively) (p < 0.0001). Differences in the stage distribution affected life-expectancy which was longer for patients diagnosed in the nineties (median survival, 93 months) than in those diagnosed in the eighties (median survival, 54 months) or in the seventies (median survival, 38 months) (p < 0.0001). Finally, survival analyses by stage showed an improvement of life-expectancy when dealing with patients of high risk category (p =0.005). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: CLL patients diagnosed in the last decade enjoy the best clinical outcome, mostly as a result of a greater proportion of patients in the low-risk clinical stage and a relatively longer survival of the high risk group. It is not clear whether these changes represent true modifications of the natural history of CLL. At the beginning of the third millennium CLL continues to be a fatal disease with a significant impact on life-expectancy.","['Molica, S', 'Levato, D']","['Molica S', 'Levato D']","['Divisione Ematologia e Oncologia Clinica, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, viale Pio X, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Jan;86(1):8-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To prove that expression profiling on the protein level can be correlated with clinical data we systematically compared in a pilot study the protein expression patterns obtained by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis with clinical features in human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), a disease characterized by broad clinical variability. Statistical methods were devised to analyze the spot pattern from 24 patient samples. This analysis allowed the identification of proteins that clearly discriminated between the patient groups with defined chromosomal characteristics or whose expression levels did correlate with clinical parameters such as patient survival. This report demonstrates that the correlation of large-scale protein expression profiles with clinical data can be used to gain new insights into molecular aspects of a disease. The data described here show that B-CLL patient populations with shorter survival times exhibit changed levels of redox enzymes, heat shock protein 27 and protein disulfide isomerase. These molecules may be potentially involved in drug resistance.","['Voss, T', 'Ahorn, H', 'Haberl, P', 'Dohner, H', 'Wilgenbus, K']","['Voss T', 'Ahorn H', 'Haberl P', 'Dohner H', 'Wilgenbus K']","['Boehringer-Ingelheim Austria, Vienna, Austria. tilman.voss@vie.boehringer-ingelheim.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Proteins/*analysis', '*Proteome']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Jan 15;91(2):180-6. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1037>3.0.co;2-j.,,"['10.1002/1097-0215(20010115)91:2<180::AID-IJC1037>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1037>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,

We investigated the potential use of As(2)O(3) in human gastric cancer and its possible mechanisms. Human gastric cancer cell lines AGS and MKN-28 were treated with various concentrations (0.1 to 100 microM) of As(2)O(3) for 24 to 72 hr. Apoptosis was determined by acridine orange staining, flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation. Protein levels of p53, p21(waf1/cip1), c-myc, bcl-2 and bax were detected by Western blotting. Effects of As(2)O(3) on caspase-3 protease activity, its protein concentration and cleavage of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) were also studied. As(2)O(3) inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in both cell lines, though AGS cells were more sensitive. As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis in AGS cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment resulted in a marked increase in p53 protein levels as early as 4 hr. Co-incubation with p53 anti-sense oligo-nucleotide suppressed As(2)O(3)-induced intracellular p53 over-expression and apoptosis. As(2)O(3) increased the activity of caspase-3, with appearance of its 17 kDa peptide fragment, and cleavage of PARP, with appearance of the 85 kDa cleavage product, both in parallel with the induction of apoptosis. Both the tripeptide caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk and the specific caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-fmk partially suppressed As(2)O(3)-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. As(2)O(3) inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, involving p53 over-expression and activation of caspase-3. The potential use of this compound in the treatment of gastric cancer is worth further investigation.","['Jiang, X H', 'Wong, B C', 'Yuen, S T', 'Jiang, S H', 'Cho, C H', 'Lai, K C', 'Lin, M C', 'Kung, H F', 'Lam, S K']","['Jiang XH', 'Wong BC', 'Yuen ST', 'Jiang SH', 'Cho CH', 'Lai KC', 'Lin MC', 'Kung HF', 'Lam SK']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Jan 15;91(2):173-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1039>3.0.co;2-d.,,"['10.1002/1097-0215(20010115)91:2<173::AID-IJC1039>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1039>3.0.co;2-d [doi]']",,,,,,['Int J Cancer 2001 Sep 15;93(6):916.

These regulatory proteins present overlapping yet distinct patterns of expression in hematopoietic cells. Absence of GATA-2 leads to defective hematopoiesis and an embryonic lethal phenotype. Disruption of GATA-1 results in a compensatory increase in GATA-2 in early erythroid cells and incomplete erythropoiesis with embryos dying at 11.5 days. We examine the specific role of GATA-2 later in hematopoiesis, during erythroid differentiation. Stable K562 cell lines expressing various levels of GATA-2 were generated using a GATA-2 expression plasmid. Overexpression of GATA-2 transcripts was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cytospin smears, growth curve analysis, PCR, and flow cytometry were used to examine the effects of increased levels of GATA-2 in altering cell phenotype and activation of megakaryocytic markers. Human progenitor erythroid cells also were transfected with a GATA-2 expression vector. Growth curve analysis, benzidine staining, and high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis were used to study the effects of GATA-2 on erythroid maturation and proliferation.K562/GATA-2 cell lines expressing high levels of GATA-2 mRNA showed a marked decrease in proliferation and a shift in phenotype toward the megakaryocyte lineage. Ploidy analyses showed that these cell lines developed a multinuclear phenotype, including tetraploids and octaploids. PCR analysis showed activation of megakaryocyte-specific genes including thrombopoietin receptor (c-mpl). Surface expression of platelet glycoprotein receptors Ib/IX (CD42b/CD42a) and IIb/IIIa (CD41/CD61) also was demonstrated by flow cytometry. In primary human adult erythroid cultures transfected with a GATA-2 expression vector, production of total hemoglobin and cell proliferation decreased in a dose-dependent manner.GATA-2 plays an important role in deciding cell lineage throughout hematopoiesis, and increased expression of GATA-2 determines megakaryocytic differentiation.

Here, we define acute myeloid leukemia (AML) antigens eliciting a humoral immune response in the autologous host. We applied the method of serologic screening of cDNA expression libraries with autologous serum (SEREX). To date, this technique has been used to characterize antigen structures in solid tumors. The mRNA expression pattern of these newly in AML isolated antigens and previously described leukemia antigens (PRAME, MAGE-1, and Wt-1) was evaluated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. For Wt-1, Western blotting also was performed. Screening of a cDNA expression library prepared from a patient with AML FAB M2 using autologous and allogeneic sera, followed by sequencing of positive clones, yielded three autoantigens (Prp1p/Zer1p, L19H1, and one without homology to previously described genes) and two antigens reactive with allogeneic sera (MAZ, PINCH).

The effect of GF stimulation on proliferation and expansion of committed and primitive progenitors (colony forming cells [CFC]) was evaluated. Culture of CML and normal CD34(+) cells with different GF for 7 days resulted in similar expansion of committed progenitors (CFC). In contrast, GF culture conditions that expanded normal primitive progenitors (week-6 long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC)] led to depletion of CML LTC-IC numbers. GF culture also resulted in increased depletion of week-10 extended LTC-IC, which represent an even more primitive progenitor population, from CML compared with normal CD34(+) cells. CML CD34(+) cells enter into cycle more quickly than normal CD34(+) cells and CML CFC expansion was accelerated compared to normal CFC. Evaluation of primitive progenitor proliferation using PKH-26 and single-cell LTC-IC analysis demonstrated that the majority of CML LTC-IC remaining after GF culture originated from divided CD34(+) cells, whereas GF-cultured normal LTC-IC were derived mainly from undivided cells. Depletion of CML primitive progenitor numbers in association with increased proliferation suggests increased sensitivity to GF-induced maturation. These studies indicate that CML primitive progenitors have enhanced sensitivity to GF-induced cell division and maturation. Altered GF responsiveness may contribute to abnormal expansion of malignant myeloid cells in CML. These findings may also be applied toward the development of novel approaches to select benign stem cells in CML.","['Bhatia, R', 'Munthe, H A', 'Williams, A D', 'Zhang, F', 'Forman, S J', 'Slovak, M L']","['Bhatia R', 'Munthe HA', 'Williams AD', 'Zhang F', 'Forman SJ', 'Slovak ML']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. rbhatia@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Dec;28(12):1401-12. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00545-2.,,"['S0301-472X(00)00545-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00545-2 [doi]']",,,"['CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

A reduction of marrow blast cells was seen with 7 of 9 samples tested 4 to 12 weeks post one course of toxin. Repeating the 5-day course of toxin 2 or 3 times at 4-week intervals did not improve the response, while delaying administration until 4 to 8 weeks post AML cell injection reduced the toxin's effectiveness (n = 5).This fusion toxin may prove useful for in vitro purging of stem cell harvests from selected AML patients and for direct administration to such patients.","['Feuring-Buske, M', 'Frankel, A', 'Gerhard, B', 'Hogge, D']","['Feuring-Buske M', 'Frankel A', 'Gerhard B', 'Hogge D']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell Death', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Dec;28(12):1390-400. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00542-7.,,"['S0301-472X(00)00542-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00542-7 [doi]']",,,['R01CA76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The MPD cell line was derived using standard tissue culture techniques from the peripheral blood of a patient with an aggressive nonchronic myelogenous leukemia myeloproliferative disorder. Immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analysis, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Northern blotting, immunoblotting, and colony assays were used to characterize the line and to assess its ability to express lineage-specific genes representative of advanced differentiation.Light microscopic morphologic analysis of the MPD cell line suggests that it has the unique property of spontaneous differentiation to mature-appearing neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, and basophils in proportions that approximate those found in normal bone marrow or peripheral blood. It was demonstrated that this cell line is capable of producing lineage-specific mRNA and granule proteins of at least two myeloid lineages, neutrophil and eosinophil, including neutrophil secondary granule proteins, which are not expressed in other available human cell lines. MPD cells were found to be capable of producing differentiated myeloid colonies (neutrophil, eosinophil, macrophge, mixed) in semisolid medium. The ability of MPD cells to express genetic programs associated with advanced differentiation of multiple myeloid lineages will make it a valuable tool for the study of the processes underlying lineage commitment and the regulation of expression of lineage-specific genes.","['Paul, C C', 'Aly, E', 'Lehman, J A', 'Page, S M', 'Gomez-Cambronero, J', 'Ackerman, S J', 'Baumann, M A']","['Paul CC', 'Aly E', 'Lehman JA', 'Page SM', 'Gomez-Cambronero J', 'Ackerman SJ', 'Baumann MA']","['Research Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Medicine, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Basophils/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*genetics', 'Eosinophils/pathology', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/pathology', 'Neutrophils/ultrastructure', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Dec;28(12):1373-80. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00552-x.,,"['S0301472X0000552X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00552-x [doi]']",,,"['AI25230/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33043/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL056653/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Both hyper-phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of HMGA1a have been ascertained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hyper-phosphorylation (at least five phosphate groups/HMGA1a molecule) occurs at the early apoptotic stages and is probably related to HMGA1a displacement from DNA and chromatin release from the nuclear scaffold. De-phosphorylation (one phosphate or no phosphate groups/HMGA1a molecule) accompanies the later formation of highly condensed chromatin in the apoptotic bodies. We report for the first time a direct link between the degree of phosphorylation of HMGA1a protein and apoptosis according to a process that involves the entire amount of HMGA1a present in the cells and, consequently, whole chromatin.

We examined the activity of Tax in transcription through AP-1-binding sites (AP-1 site) in T cells. Transient transfection studies showed that Tax activated the expression of a luciferase gene regulated by two copies of an AP-1 site in the human Jurkat T-cell line. Tax activates the expression of viral and cellular genes through two different enhancers: a cAMP-responsive (CRE)-like element and a kappaB element. Two Tax mutants differentially activated expression of these two elements. Tax703 preferentially activated the kappaB element but not the CRE-like one, whereas TaxM22 showed the reverse. In addition, Tax703 and Tax, but not TaxM22, converted cell growth of a mouse T-cell line from being interleukin (IL)-2-dependent to being IL-2-independent. Unlike the wild-type Tax, Tax703 and TaxM22 only weakly activated the AP-1 site in the T-cell line. Thus, Tax seems to activate the AP-1 site via mechanisms distinct from those of kappaB or CRE-like elements, and the activation of the AP-1 site is dispensable for IL-2-independent growth of CTLL-2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Tax induced strong binding activity to an AP-1 site in CTLL-2, whereas Tax703 did not, indicating that the induction of binding activity to the AP-1 site is essential for the transcriptional activation by Tax. The binding complex induced by Tax in CTLL-2 contained JunD and Fra-2. Other AP-1 proteins were undetectable. Activation of transcription through the AP-1 site in Jurkat cells by JunD and/or Fra-2 was weak. c-Jun, JunB, and c-Fos activation was greater, although the level was still less than that with Tax. Thus, the induction of AP-1 mRNA by Tax may not be sufficient for a complete activation of AP-1 site by Tax. Our results suggest that Tax activates the transcription of cellular genes with AP-1 sites by inducing the DNA-binding activity of AP-1 proteins in T cells, a mechanism distinct from those of CRE-like and kappaB elements.","['Iwai, K', 'Mori, N', 'Oie, M', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Fujii, M']","['Iwai K', 'Mori N', 'Oie M', 'Yamamoto N', 'Fujii M']","['Department of Virology, Niigata University School of Medicine, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, fos/genetics/physiology', 'Genes, jun/genetics/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2001 Jan 5;279(1):38-46. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0669.,,"['10.1006/viro.2000.0669 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90669-X [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,

These viruses appear to use a receptor other than CD46, the molecule to which most laboratory strains of virus bind. Methods used to identify and characterize this lymphocyte receptor for measles virus are described in this study. A binding assay with a soluble form of measles virus H protein demonstrated that B-cell lines, activated with Epstein-Barr virus, or T cells, transformed with human T-cell leukemia virus, exhibit this receptor on their cell surfaces. On the other hand, resting lymphocytes, monocytes, or immature leukocytes either failed to express or possessed reduced levels of this receptor. A cDNA library derived from B95-8 marmoset B-cell lines was used to identify this receptor through expression cloning. This molecule was shown to be CDw150, which is also known as the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM). When the lymphocyte receptor was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHOP) or human embryonic kidney (293T) cells, these cells became susceptible to lymphotropic as well as laboratory strains of measles virus. Binding assays confirmed that either lymphotropic or laboratory strains of measles virus could adhere to human or marmoset CDw150, but interaction with the mouse homolog was weak.

As rheumatoid synovium is infiltrated by Th(1)cells, local cell interactions result in a pro-inflammatory pattern with defective repair, which can be reversed at least in part, by a Th(2)pattern.","['Chabaud, M', 'Aarvak, T', 'Garnero, P', 'Natvig, J B', 'Miossec, P']","['Chabaud M', 'Aarvak T', 'Garnero P', 'Natvig JB', 'Miossec P']","['Departments of Immunology and Rheumatology, Hopital Edouard Herriot, 69437 Lyon Cedex 03, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collagen/biosynthesis', 'Culture Media/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Inflammation', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-17/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Joints/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'Synovial Fluid/*cytology', 'Th1 Cells/*metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2001 Jan 21;13(2):113-8. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2000.0811.,,"['10.1006/cyto.2000.0811 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(00)90811-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,

Characterization of leukaemic cells regarding their potency to express growth factors and surface molecules can provide insight into their aberrant biology. Thus, we analyzed bone marrow blasts from 10 children with relapsed B cell precursor ALL. The gene and protein expression of essential haematopoietic growth factors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-gamma, G-CSFR), their corresponding receptors as well as the expression pattern of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, CD58) and costimulatory proteins (CD40, CD40L, B7.1, B7.2, CD28, MHC-I and II) was analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Constitutive gene expression was found for IL-7, IL-10, IL-15 and IFN-gamma and their corresponding receptors. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that IL-10R, IL-7Ralpha, IL-4Ralpha and the gamma(c)chain are constitutively expressed, and that some cells bear the G-CSFR. IL-10 and IL-15 protein-producing leukaemic cells were easily detectable. The neoplastic cells mainly lack B7.1, and ICAM-1 is mostly decreased. Furthermore, high CD40, and, surprisingly, CD40L expression could be found. These studies show that ALL cells are likely to be sensitive to many growth factors and some factors are produced by the neoplastic cell itself. The secretion of IL-10 by leukaemic cells, and the absence or downregulation of conventional adhesion and costimulatory molecules might represent an effective mechanism of escape of immune surveillance in relapsed ALL.","['Kebelmann-Betzing, C', 'Korner, G', 'Badiali, L', 'Buchwald, D', 'Moricke, A', 'Korte, A', 'Kochling, J', 'Wu, S', 'Kappelmeier, D', 'Oettel, K', 'Henze, G', 'Seeger, K']","['Kebelmann-Betzing C', 'Korner G', 'Badiali L', 'Buchwald D', 'Moricke A', 'Korte A', 'Kochling J', 'Wu S', 'Kappelmeier D', 'Oettel K', 'Henze G', 'Seeger K']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite, Campus Virchow-Medical Center, Humboldt-University at Berlin, Germany. christain. kebelmann_betzing@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Substances/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/genetics', 'Interleukin-15/genetics', 'Male', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/genetics']",,2001/01/09 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/01/09 11:00'],"['2001/01/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2001 Jan 7;13(1):39-50. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2000.0794.,,"['10.1006/cyto.2000.0794 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(00)90794-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,

METHODS: Growth curve analysis was used to examine neuropsychological outcome and treatment-related change in children (N = 30) who were treated at two childhood cancer centers. A comprehensive test battery was administered at baseline (8 months), 2, 3, and 4 years postdiagnosis (age at diagnosis M = 5.90 years, SD = 4.2C). RESULTS: Results indicated modest declines in arithmetic, visual motor integration, and verbal fluency. Intrathecal and systemic treatment was related to poorer visual motor integration at 4 years postdiagnosis and a faster rate of decline in visual motor integration skills across the observation period than intrathecal treatment alone. Arithmetic proficiency at 4 years after diagnosis was related to maternal education, but the rate of decline was not. Verbal fluency was unrelated to demographic or treatment variables. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that neuropsychological outcome and declines are related to both demographic and treatment characteristics depending on the cognitive domain examined.","['Espy, K A', 'Moore, I M', 'Kaufmann, P M', 'Kramer, J H', 'Matthay, K', 'Hutter, J J']","['Espy KA', 'Moore IM', 'Kaufmann PM', 'Kramer JH', 'Matthay K', 'Hutter JJ']","['Department of Psychiatry, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL 62901-6503, USA. kespy@siumed.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Psychol,Journal of pediatric psychology,7801773,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Brain/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Verbal Behavior/*drug effects']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Psychol. 2001 Jan-Feb;26(1):1-9. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/26.1.1.,,['10.1093/jpepsy/26.1.1 [doi]'],,,['NR02557/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

A multivalent, optionally multispecific F(ab')(n) core is formed in stage one, and one or more Fc modules added in stage two. Examples include bispecific Fab(2)Fc(2) (for simplicity, primes and Greek letters are omitted from names of final constructs) and trivalent Fab(3)Fc(2), which are designed to kill neoplastic cells. An essential element in the construction is the availability of the Fab' in two reduced forms, Fab'(-sulfhydryl (SH))(5) and Fab'-SH. The first is obtained by full reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds (SS) in the F(ab')(2) fragment of IgG. Fab'-SH is obtained by disulfide-interchange reactions on Fab'(-SH)(5), whereby the gamma-light SS is reconstituted, an unusual intrachain SS forms in the gamma-chain hinge, and one hinge SH remains. F(ab')(2) and F(ab')(3) cores are built using partially reduced modules, being given intermodular thioether links that resist reduction. These cores are then fully reduced, making available SH groups for addition of the Fcgamma modules. In the final constructs, all intermodular links embody tandem thioether bonds arising at hinge-region cysteines. Cytotoxic activities of representative constructs, and some enhancements deriving from multiple modules, are assessed. In guinea pigs, catabolism of Fab(2)Fc(2) yielded a t(1/2) similar to that of human IgG1, although the serum Fab(2)Fc(2) revealed some proteolytic breakdown not shown by the IgG1.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), two multifunctional neuropeptides, modulate innate and adaptive immunity. We reported previously that VIP/PACAP protect T cells from activation-induced cell death through down-regulation of Fas ligand (FasL). In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the protective effect of VIP and PACAP. VIP/PACAP reduce in a dose-dependent manner anti-CD3-induced apoptosis in 2B4.11 T cell hybridomas. The protective effect is mediated through the specific type 2 VIP receptor, and the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. A functional study demonstrates that VIP/PACAP inhibit activation-induced FasL expression. VIP/PACAP inhibit the expression and/or DNA-binding activity of several transcriptional factors involved in FasL expression, i.e., c-myc, NF-kappaB, NF-ATp, and early growth factors (Egr) 2/3. The inhibition of NF-kappaB binding is due to the stabilization of I-kappaB (inhibitory protein that dissociates from NF-kappaB), through the inhibition of I-kappaB kinase alpha activity. Subsequently, p65 nuclear translocation is significantly reduced. The inhibition in NF-ATp binding results from a calcineurin-independent reduction in NF-ATp nuclear translocation. VIP/PACAP inhibit the expression of Egr2 and 3, but not of Egr1. The effects on the transcriptional factors are mediated through type 2 VIP receptor with cAMP as secondary messenger.","['Delgado, M', 'Ganea, D']","['Delgado M', 'Ganea D']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adcyap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (Egr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Egr3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, Type II)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '144516-98-3 (Early Growth Response Protein 3)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/immunology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive/immunology', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2', 'Early Growth Response Protein 3', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Hybridomas', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Ligands', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'Neuropeptides/metabolism/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/physiology', 'Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, Type II', 'Response Elements/immunology', 'Second Messenger Systems/immunology', '*Sulfonamides', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/metabolism/*physiology', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Jan 15;166(2):1028-40. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.2.1028.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.2.1028 [doi]'],,,['AI 041786-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

To clarify whether TEI-9647 could function as an antagonist of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in vivo, we investigated in vitamin D-deficient (-D) rats the effects of single doses of TEI-9647 on several parameters of calcium metabolism modulated by 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). TEI-9647 (50 microgram/kg iv) acting alone slightly, but significantly, stimulated intestinal calcium transport (ICA) and bone calcium mobilization (BCM) only at 8 h, but not at 24 h. In contrast, TEI-9647 dose-dependently inhibited ICA and BCM stimulated by an iv dose of 0.25 microgram/kg 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) after 24 h, but not after 8 h. With respect to serum PTH levels, the administration of either TEI-9647, 50 microgram/kg, or 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), 0.25 microgram/kg, began to decrease the circulating levels by 4 h, which reached a nadir 24 h after administration. But, when TEI-9647 and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) were simultaneously administered to -D rats, the TEI-9647 dose-dependently reversed the inhibition of PTH secretion caused by 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), 0.25 microgram/kg, at 8 and 24 h after the treatment. In separate experiments, the daily iv administration of 20 microgram/kg of TEI-9647 alone to +D rats for 2 weeks resulted in no significant changes in the prevailing serum Ca(2+) concentration. But doses of 1-20 microgram/kg of TEI-9647 in combination with 0.5 microgram/kg of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), for 2 weeks, dose-dependently and significantly suppressed the serum calcium concentration increase caused by the 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). Collectively, these results show that TEI-9647 acting alone displays in vivo weak agonistic actions, but when administered in combination with 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), is a potent antagonist of three genomic-mediated calcium metabolism parameters. We conclude that TEI-9647 can also function as an antagonist of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in vivo in the rat.","['Ishizuka, S', 'Miura, D', 'Ozono, K', 'Chokki, M', 'Mimura, H', 'Norman, A W']","['Ishizuka S', 'Miura D', 'Ozono K', 'Chokki M', 'Mimura H', 'Norman AW']","['Department of Bone and Calcium Metabolism (S.I., M.C., H.M.) and Safety Research Department (D.M.), Teijin Institute for Biomedical Research Instruments, Inc., Tokyo 191-8512, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Calcium, Dietary)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (TEI 9647)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone and Bones/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium, Dietary', 'Duodenum/physiology/physiopathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption/*physiology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/physiology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone/blood', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/*blood', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/*metabolism/physiopathology']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2001 Jan;142(1):59-67. doi: 10.1210/endo.142.1.7925.,,['10.1210/endo.142.1.7925 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The study comprised 25 patients (median age 49 years) who had been transplanted by either bone marrow (n = 13) or G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (n = 12). Overall transplant-related mortality was 30% but was lower for patients < 50 years of age at transplant (21%). The main cause of treatment-related mortality was viral infection. Of the 19 patients evaluable post-transplant, 17 have so far achieved complete remissions. Currently, with a median follow-up of 3.4 years, 18 out of 25 patients are alive, of whom 15 are in continuing complete remission (CR) and 2 in second remission after suffering localized relapses, which were treated with radiotherapy and donor leucocyte infusions. Patients transplanted after 1 line of previous therapy, < 50 years of age and receiving peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) rather than bone marrow (BM) had a superior outcome, although there was no statistically significant factor. We conclude that allogeneic transplantation should be considered as a potentially curative option for younger patients with myeloma and that the regimen using fractionated total body irradiation and melphalan has a high CR rate and a relatively low risk of treatment-related mortality, particularly in younger patients.","['Russell, N', 'Bessell, E', 'Stainer, C', 'Haynes, A', 'Das-Gupta, E', 'Byrne, J']","['Russell N', 'Bessell E', 'Stainer C', 'Haynes A', 'Das-Gupta E', 'Byrne J']","['Division of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, UK. nigel.russell@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2000;39(7):837-41. doi: 10.1080/028418600750063596.,,['10.1080/028418600750063596 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The prostaglandin D2 generation was also inhibited almost completely by methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), an inhibitor of cPLA2, but not by diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor. Furthermore, stimulation with antigen resulted in an increase in lysophosphatidic acid formation, which was suppressed by MAFP in parallel with an increase in PA formation.

We searched for retroviral sequences in RA synovial fluid pellets, identified a sequence similar to that of open reading frame 2 (ORF2)/L1 retrotransposable elements, explored the expression of L1 in RA synovial tissues and cultured RA SF, and investigated the link to genomic DNA hypomethylation and the influence of functional L1 on gene expression. METHODS: RA synovial fluid pellets were screened by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using degenerated pol primers. The sequences were identified by GenBank search. Riboprobes to ORF2/L1 and galectin-3 and antibodies to the ORF1/L1-related p40 protein were used for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry of synovial tissues and cultured RA SF. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used for detecting ORF1 messenger RNA (mRNA). Since DNA hypomethylation occurs in inflammatory diseases, we incubated cells with the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azaC) and compared RA SF and osteoarthritis (OA) SF. L1-negative RA SF were transfected with the functional L1.2 construct, and differential gene expression was analyzed by subtractive hybridization combined with nested PCR. RESULTS: RNA sequences similar to those of ORF2/L1 retrotransposable elements, THE1 transposon, human endogenous retrovirus (ERV)-E, human ERV-HC2, and gibbon ape leukemia virus pol genes were isolated from different RA synovial fluid pellets. In RA synovial tissues, ORF2/L1 transcripts were detected in the sublining layer and at sites of cartilage and bone destruction. Galectin-3 mRNA and L1-related ORF1/ p40 protein showed similar expression patterns. In contrast, OA synovial tissues in situ and cultures in vitro were negative. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the presence of ORF1 mRNA in cultured RA SF (30-300-fold the amount in normal SF), demonstrating the existence of a nondegenerated and functional L1 element. In vitro, the majority of RA SF expressed ORF2/L1 mRNA. After incubation of SF with 5-azaC, L1 mRNA appeared in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Compared with OA SF, RA SF were more sensitive to 5-azaC. After transfection of RA SF with a functional L1.2 element, human stress-activated protein kinase 2 delta (SAPK2delta [or SAPK4]), met protooncogene, and galectin-3 binding protein genes were differentially expressed. The transcription of the SAPK2delta gene, favored also by DNA hypomethylation in vitro, was confirmed in RA synovial tissues. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest that L1 elements and SAPK2delta pathways play a role in the activation of RA SF.","['Neidhart, M', 'Rethage, J', 'Kuchen, S', 'Kunzler, P', 'Crowl, R M', 'Billingham, M E', 'Gay, R E', 'Gay, S']","['Neidhart M', 'Rethage J', 'Kuchen S', 'Kunzler P', 'Crowl RM', 'Billingham ME', 'Gay RE', 'Gay S']","['Center for Experimental Rheumatology, Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroelements)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/genetics', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*genetics', 'Ecthyma, Contagious/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry', 'Galectin 3', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Lectins/genetics', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/*genetics/physiology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Synovial Membrane/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2000 Dec;43(12):2634-47. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(200012)43:12<2634::AID-ANR3>3.0.CO;2-1.,,['10.1002/1529-0131(200012)43:12<2634::AID-ANR3>3.0.CO;2-1 [doi]'],,,,['Arthritis Rheum. 2002 May;46(5):1412-3; author reply 1413.

However, its use in bone marrow biopsies is not well established. In addition, increased levels of cyclin D1 mRNA have been found in hairy cell leukemia but have not consistently been detected by immunohistochemistry. We used a polyclonal antibody and heat-induced antigen retrieval conditions to evaluate 73 fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node specimens with small B-cell infiltrates, obtained from 55 patients. Cyclin D1 was overexpressed in 13/13 specimens of MCL (usually strong, diffuse reactivity in most tumor cells) and in 14/14 specimens of hairy cell leukemia (usually weak, in a subpopulation of tumor cells). No reactivity was detected in five cases of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia; five cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma; six cases of nodal marginal zone cell lymphoma; two cases of gastric marginal zone cell lymphoma; or ten benign lymphoid infiltrates in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes. In summary, although the total number of studied cases is small and a larger series of cases may be required to confirm our data, we present optimized immunohistochemical conditions for cyclin D1 in fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue that can be useful in distinguishing MCL and hairy cell leukemia from other small B-cell neoplasms and reactive lymphoid infiltrates.","['Miranda, R N', 'Briggs, R C', 'Kinney, M C', 'Veno, P A', 'Hammer, R D', 'Cousar, J B']","['Miranda RN', 'Briggs RC', 'Kinney MC', 'Veno PA', 'Hammer RD', 'Cousar JB']","['Department of Pathology, Truman Medical Center and University of Missouri-Kansas City, 64108, USA. tmcmiranda@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)'],IM,"['Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/metabolism/pathology']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2000 Dec;13(12):1308-14. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880239.,,['10.1038/modpathol.3880239 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, genistein is extensively investigated as a novel anticancer drug. To improve physicochemical properties of genistein (e.g., water solubility) we have synthesized its complexes with amines. Genistein-piperazine complex (GP) has been then examined whether it exhibits anticancer action against human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) cultured in vitro. The parallel study with pure genistein has also been undertaken. Cell proliferation, viability, apoptosis and cell cycle kinetics have been assayed for various drugs concentrations (10-40 microM) and periods of exposure (1-6 days). GP reduced proliferation rate, decreased cell viability and induced apoptotic cell death, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow-cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution revealed a progressive and sustained accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase that was accompanied by unperturbed protein synthesis. The measured anticancer effects of GP and genistein were qualitatively and quantitatively similar, indicating that genistein-amine complex does not loose the activity of the parent compound.","['Polkowski, K', 'Skierski, J S', 'Mazurek, A P']","['Polkowski K', 'Skierski JS', 'Mazurek AP']","['Drug Institute, 30/34 Chelmska Str., 00-725 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Acta Pol Pharm,Acta poloniae pharmaceutica,2985167R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Piperazines)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genistein/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Piperazines/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Pol Pharm. 2000 May-Jun;57(3):223-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified 2814 individuals with Down syndrome from the Danish Cytogenetic Register, and linked the data to the Danish Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated on the basis of age- and sex-specific cancer rates in the general population. Sixty cases of cancer were observed, with 49.8 expected (SIR = 1.20; CI: 0.92-1.55). Leukaemia constituted 60% of the malignancies overall and 97% of the malignancies in children. The SIR for leukaemia varied considerably with age, being 56 (CI: 38-81) at age 0-4 years and 10 (CI: 4-20) at 5-29 years. No cases of leukaemia were observed after age 29. The cumulative risk of leukaemia by the age of 5 years was 2.1% and that by 30 years was 2.7%. Only 24 solid tumours were observed with 47.8 expected (SIR = 0.50; CI: 0.32-0.75). No cases of breast cancer were observed, with 7.3 expected (p = 0.0007). Increased risks of testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, and retinoblastoma were observed but were not statistically significant. The occurrence of cancer in Down syndrome is unique with a high risk of leukaemia in children and a decreased risk of solid tumours in all age groups. The distinctive pattern of malignancies may provide clues in the search for leukaemogenic genes and tumour suppressor genes on chromosome 21.","['Hasle, H', 'Clemmensen, I H', 'Mikkelsen, M']","['Hasle H', 'Clemmensen IH', 'Mikkelsen M']",['Borneafdelingen Skejby Sygehus Arhus Universitetshospital DK-8200 Arhus N.'],['dan'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2000 Oct 10;120(24):2878-81.,Forekomsten af cancer hos personer med Downs syndrom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During 1996 and 1999 a regular follow-up of the Philadelphia chromosome level in treated patients was performed with molecular biological techniques, i.e. with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods. During the follow-up period of 33 months from the 31 patients with CML (16 males, 15 females) 25 ones were treated with human recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN), however, six others were getting only hydroxyurea (HU). During this period in three patients allogen bone marrow transplantation was performed and seven ones expired (six out of them of blastic crisis). The quality of therapeutic response at cytogenetical level was determined by decrease of the bcr-abl level due to the treatment (non-responders, major, minor and complete cytogenetic remission groups). In nine patients (five from the IFN-group, four from the HU-group) achieved no cytogenetic therapeutic response (non-responders, 29%). However, in 13 patients a minor (bcr-abl range of 60-30%), and in nine patients a maior/complete (bcr-abl of 30-10%) cytogenetic response (42% and 29%, respectively) were detected. Moreover, the quality of cytogenetic response correlated with the haematological remission. The maior/complete cytogenetic response was durable in eigth patients. The improvement of the overall survival of patients with CML, the postpone of the fatal accelerated-blastic phase could be expected only from the early introduced, in individually adjusted and given in maximally tolerated dosage of interferon (3-5 million UI/m2/day). The qualitative (RT-PCR) and quantitative (FISH) detections of the Philadelphia chromosome are reliably reproducible up-to-date molecular biological methods getting relevant results, which could be very helpful in the planning, monitoring, in setting of optimal dosage of the interferon therapy of patients with CML, in addition in the judgement of the effectiveness of the therapy, in the reduction of adverse effects, as well as in forecasting of the cytogenetic progression.","['Ivanyi, J L', 'Marton, E', 'Kereskai, L', 'Kiss, Z', 'Pajor, L']","['Ivanyi JL', 'Marton E', 'Kereskai L', 'Kiss Z', 'Pajor L']","['Vas Megyei Markusovszky Korhaz Szombathely, Hematologiai Osztaly.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2000 Nov 19;141(47):2527-33.,Kronikus myeloid leukemias betegek interferon-kezelesenek kovetese molekularis biologiai modszerekkel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to establish whether its catalytic inhibition of topoisomerase II was mediated by mechanisms similar to those identified for the bisdioxopiperazines. In vitro combinations of F 11782 with etoposide resulted in greater than additive cytotoxicity in L1210 cells, contrasting with marked antagonism for combinations of etoposide with either ICRF-187 or ICRF-193. All three compounds caused a G2/M blockade of P388 cells after an 18-h incubation, but by 40 h polyploidization was evident only with the bisdioxopiperazines. Gel retardation data revealed that only F 11782, and not the bisdioxopiperazines, was capable of completely inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of topoisomerase II, confirming its novel mechanism of action. Furthermore, unlike ICRF-187 and ICRF-193, the cytotoxicity of F 11782 appeared mediated, at least partially, by DNA damage induction in cultured GCT27 human teratoma cells, as judged by a fluorescence-enhancement assay and monitoring p53 activation. Finally, the major in vivo antitumor activity of F 11782 against the murine P388 leukemia (i.v. implanted) and the B16 melanoma (s.c. grafted) contrasted with the bisdioxopiperazines' general lack of activity. Overall, F 11782 and the bisdioxopiperazines appear to function as quite distinctive catalytic topoisomerase II inhibitors.","['van Hille, B', 'Etievant, C', 'Barret, J M', 'Kruczynski, A', 'Hill, B T']","['van Hille B', 'Etievant C', 'Barret JM', 'Kruczynski A', 'Hill BT']","['Division de Cancerologie, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Diketopiperazines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', ""21416-68-2 (4,4'-(1,2-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediyl)bis-2,6-piperazinedione)"", '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'QN043X3ZDW (tafluposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Diketopiperazines', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Naphthalenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrans/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Razoxane/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2000 Nov;11(10):829-41. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200011000-00007.,,['10.1097/00001813-200011000-00007 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We identified 3164 persons with BCSC and 15,730 comparison subjects matched for age, sex, race, residence area and length of membership in a health maintenance organization. RESULTS: In retrospective follow-up for up to 24 years (mean 11.3 years), BCSC patients experienced statistically significant increases in the incidence of all cancer (relative risk [RR] = 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-1.4) lung cancer (RR = 1.4, CI = 1.0-1.8) and melanoma (RR = 2.2, CI = 1.6-3.0). Women experienced significantly increased risk for all cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and thyroid cancer, increases of borderline significance in breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia, and increased pre-existing bladder cancer. Men showed statistically significant increases in all cancer, melanoma, and kidney cancers, and mouth and throat cancers. Multivariate analysis incorporating available risk factor data did not weaken positive associations with BCSC except slightly for melanoma and for bladder cancer in women. Other previously reported associations were not confirmed. CONCLUSION: Periodic skin examinations appear well justified after removal of BCSC to detect new skin cancers including melanoma. Given the relatively weak, unexplained associations of BCSC with internal cancers, the costs vs. benefits of extra efforts to detect the latter still need to be determined.","['Friedman, G D', 'Tekawa, I S']","['Friedman GD', 'Tekawa IS']","['Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Oakland, California, USA. gdf@leland.stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*complications', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*complications', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2000 Dec;11(10):891-7. doi: 10.1023/a:1026591016153.,,['10.1023/a:1026591016153 [doi]'],,,['R35 CA49761/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Relative survival rates were not included because no differences were appreciated with the observed ones. Cases between 0-4 years and females account for the highest frequencies. Leukaemia accounts for 27% of the cases, followed by lymphomas and tumours of the central nervous system. Lymphoid and non-lymphoid acute leukaemia had 41 and 9% 5-year survival rate respectively being the latter comparable with Bangalore, India (10%). For lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease present better prognosis compared with non-Hodgkin lymphoma with 73 and 35% 5-year survival rates, respectively.

The mortality survey consisted of two steps, i.e., the follow-up of cohort members and the ascertainment of causes of death. The cohort members in HBRA were divided into three dose-groups on the basis of environmental dose-rates per year. The mortality experiences of those three dose groups were compared with those in the residents of control areas by means of relative risk (RR). During the period 1987-1995, we observed 926,226 person-years by following up 106,517 subjects in the cohort study, and accumulated 5,161 deaths, among which 557 were from cancers. We did not observe an increase in cancer mortality in HBRA (RR = 0.96, 96% CI, 0.80 to 1.15). The combined data for the period 1979-95 included 125,079 subjects and accumulated 1,698,316 person-years, observed 10,415 total deaths and 1,003 cancer deaths. The relative risk of all cancers for whole HBRA as compared with the control area was estimated to be 0.99 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.14). The relative risks of cancers of the stomach, colon, liver, lung, bone, female breast and thyroid within whole HBRA were less than one, while the risks for leukemia, cancers of the nasopharynx, esophagus, rectum, pancreas, skin, cervix uteri, brain and central nervous system, and malignant lymphoma were larger than one.

In this study we investigated the relation between this phenomenon and interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, interferon-gamma, leukemia inhibitory factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and anemia-inducing substance (AIS) in vitro by examining changes in their levels in the plasma of advanced ovarian cancer patients. When the patients' plasma was incubated with noncoated charcoal for one hour, its lipolytic activity decreased by 39.0 +/- 2.4%, which was similar to the results obtained with the plasma of healthy subjects. IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, interferon-gamma, leukemia inhibitory factor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha did not adsorb the charcoal. IL-6 was 3.7% adsorbed, but this did not cause a significant difference (p = 0.131). Nor was the recombinant form of these cytokines adsorbed to the charcoal. AIS, however, was 98.1% adsorbed.

Overt heart failure occurs in 4.5% to 7% of patients treated with anthracyclines and the incidence of cardiac function abnormalities increases with the time. Anthracycline-induced congestive heart failure is usually due to permanent changes in the myocardium, changes most consistent with the contractile failure of cardiomyopathy. Although the causes of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity are probably many, a large body of evidence points to free-radical-mediated myocyte damage. The risk of developing cardiac heart failure is modified by the presence of certain risk factors that reduce cardiac tolerance to anthracyclines. Age and female gender seem to have an important role in the anthracycline cardiotoxicity. This cardiotoxicity can be divided, on the base of when it started, into acute, subacute and progressive late, chronic form. Various invasive and non-invasive methods have been used to measure the extent of cardiac damage done. Depending on the sensitivity of the method employed, the proportion of hearts found to be damaged has varied widely. Attempts to ameliorate anthracycline cardiotoxicity have been directed toward: 1. decreasing myocardial concentrations of anthracyclines and their metabolites, 2. developing less cardiotoxic analogous, and 3. concurrently administering cardioprotectants to attenuate the effects of anthracyclines on the heart. Much progress has been made in terms of monitoring of clinical and subclinical anthracycline cardiotoxicity, finding alternative schedules, introducing special carriers of anthracyclines and using cardioprotecting agents. It is hoped that with all these effects and with results of ongoing and future trials, we will be able to reduce further or even eliminate anthracycline cardiotoxicity.","['Iarussi, D', 'Indolfi, P', 'Galderisi, M', 'Bossone, E']","['Iarussi D', 'Indolfi P', 'Galderisi M', 'Bossone E']","['Cattedra di Cardiologia, Istituto Medico Chirurgico di Cardiologia, Italy. dianal.iarussi@unina2.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Herz,Herz,7801231,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced/diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/*chemically induced/diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",107,2001/01/06 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/06 11:00'],"['2001/01/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Herz. 2000 Nov;25(7):676-88. doi: 10.1007/pl00001982.,,['10.1007/pl00001982 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

All the secondary recipients of SC from mAML-bearing SJL/J mice rescued with syngeneic (SJL/J) or allogeneic (B10.S) BMC+SC (H-2s) differing at minor antigens of the histocompatibility complex (MiHC) developed leukemia and died. In sharp contrast, none of the secondary recipients of SC obtained from identical mAML-bearing mice rescued with B10.S BMC + SC but activated in vivo with IL-2 developed leukemia. Adoptive recipients of SC obtained from mAML-bearing recipients of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-disparate (C57BL/6, H-2b) cells remained free of leukemia regardless of the use of rIL-2. In parallel with the in vivo findings, a 4-day in vitro exposure of splenocytes to 6 x 10(3) IU/ml rIL-2 resulted in a 5- to 20-fold increase in the frequency of alloreactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) precursors (CTLp) across MiHC and MHC barriers and a 2- to 6-fold increase in their cytotoxic activity. Our data suggest that augmentation of GVL effects by rIL-2 may be due to CTL activation by rIL-2, not excluding the potential beneficial role of rIL-2-activated allogeneic natural killer cells and MHC non-restricted killer cells. Cumulatively, our results suggest potentially beneficial effects of rIL-2, when used jointly with bone marrow transplantation or allogeneic cell therapy, on eradication of leukemia.","['Leshem, B', 'Vourka-Karussis, U', 'Slavin, S']","['Leshem B', 'Vourka-Karussis U', 'Slavin S']","['Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther,"Cytokines, cellular & molecular therapy",9713367,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Graft Enhancement, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2001/01/05 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/01/05 11:00'],"['2001/01/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/05 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther. 2000 Sep;6(3):141-7. doi: 10.1080/mccm.6.3.141.147.,,"['G4712MACEV8YNT1T [pii]', '10.1080/mccm.6.3.141.147 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the essential requirements for this strategy if it is to be applicable in a clinical setting is a high efficiency of gene transfer to primary human AML blasts. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter gene, we have systematically evaluated a variety of physical, chemical and viral vector-based gene transfection systems in order to determine which gave the highest gene transfer efficiency to myeloid leukaemia cell lines and primary AML blasts. Transfection efficiency was low for all the physical and chemical transfection methods tested. Retroviral vector-based infection gave a high efficiency of gene transduction in two of the four leukaemia cell lines (KG1a and U937), but was low in primary AML blasts. An adenoviral vector gave a high transduction efficiency in all of the leukaemia cell lines with the exception of the HL60. In primary AML blasts, derived from 19 patients, gene transduction efficiency was variable, ranging from 1.1% to 67.1% (mean 12.1%). Following culture in cytokines GM-CSF/IL-4/CD40L, which induced differentiation of AML blasts to dendritic-like cells, transduction efficiency was increased between two- and eightfold in 6 out of the 15 cases that underwent differentiation.","['Roddie, P H', 'Paterson, T', 'Turner, M L']","['Roddie PH', 'Paterson T', 'Turner ML']","['Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland. hroddie@holyrood.ed.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther,"Cytokines, cellular & molecular therapy",9713367,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dendritic Cells/pathology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/05 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/01/05 11:00'],"['2001/01/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/05 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther. 2000 Sep;6(3):127-34. doi: 10.1080/mccm.6.3.127.134.,,"['1HA4J9Y8R8AKQFC5 [pii]', '10.1080/mccm.6.3.127.134 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A median of 22 colonies (range 7-88) before and 30 colonies (5-71) after LTC were analyzed per patient.

The mechanism that they use to induce tumour formation varies. Insertional mutagenesis is a common mechanism in rodent, feline and avian retroviruses, where the retrovirus integrates into the host genome and affects the transcription of the neighbouring genes. Cloning of these affected genes led to identification of a series of oncogenes that play a significant role in the induction of human neoplasms. Retrovirus insertion also serves as a model to identify collaborating oncogenes. Human retroviruses use different, more complex mechanisms contributing to oncogenesis.

However, the extent and tendency of the initially enhanced cell mortality steadily diminished throughout the experiment. After 12 h the G2/M phase reappeared. After 24 h all indices almost returned to control levels indicating either the selection of subpopulation of unaffected leukaemic cells or cells developing resistance to the treatment. A DNA ladder of oligonucleosomes was observed for apoptogenic treatments. We conclude that quercetin unmasked cell death, promoting the activity of TNF-alpha. However, after 12 and 24 h of exposure, surviving cells could complete the cell cycle and finally recover. At the same time, increased NF-kappaB activation was demonstrated by immunoblotting of the immunoreactive RelA/p65 subunit in nuclear extracts.

In 1997, it was suggested that the risk of leukaemia was associated with some aspects of lifestyle, in particular, the consumption of local seafood and use of local beaches. To respond to public concern, the French Ministries of the Environment and Health decided to commission complementary epidemiological studies and a detailed radioecological analysis. The radioecological study was entrusted to a group of experts with various backgrounds (inspectors, governmental experts, operators, experts from non-governmental laboratories and foreign experts)--the Nord-Cotentin Radioecology Group. Its principal objective was to assess realistically the exposure to ionising radiation of young people from 0 to 24 years of age who had lived near the La Hague nuclear reprocessing plant and to estimate their risk of radiation-induced leukaemia from 1978 through 1996, the period covered by the epidemiological studies. The Group chose to use a three-stage approach: reconstruction of the population of young people from 0 to 24 years who resided in the region between 1978 and 1996, assessment of their exposure to all sources of ionising radiation, and estimation of the risk of radiation-induced leukaemia attributable to this exposure. The collective red bone marrow dose due to the discharges from the local nuclear facilities from Nord-Cotentin has thus been estimated at approximately 0.5 man-Sv, which is less than 0.2% of the total exposure to ionising radiation, including natural and medical sources and fallout from atmospheric testing and the accident at Chernobyl. The number of cases of radiation-induced leukaemia attributable to discharges from the local nuclear facilities based on the estimated level of exposure was around 0.002 over this period. This is the best estimate, in the current state of knowledge, of the incidence of radiation-induced leukaemia attributable to environmental exposure to ionising radiation among the young people living in the vicinity of the La Hague reprocessing plant based on mean habits for the population. This estimate must be interpreted in the light of the limitations inherent in the risk assessment process, and some participants in the Nord-Cotentin Radioecology Group have expressed reservations about it. Nonetheless, the number of cases estimated here is low in comparison to the four cases of leukaemia observed during the same period. It is thus very improbable that exposure attributable to local nuclear facilities is implicated to any salient degree in the elevated incidence of leukaemia observed in this region among young people.","['Rommens, C', 'Laurier, D', 'Sugier, A']","['Rommens C', 'Laurier D', 'Sugier A']","['Institut de Protection et de Surete Nucleaire, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France. catherine.rommens@ipsn.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'France', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Assessment']",,2001/01/05 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/01/05 11:00'],"['2001/01/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/05 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2000 Dec;20(4):361-80. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/20/4/302.,,['10.1088/0952-4746/20/4/302 [doi]'],,,,['J Radiol Prot. 2000 Dec;20(4):349-51.

The investigated compounds were sulfanilyl-sulfanilamide-, 4-thioureido-benzenesulfonamide- and benzene-1,3-disulfonamide-derivatives. The mechanism of antitumor action with these sulfonamides is unknown, but it might involve either inhibition of several CA isozymes (such as CA IX, CA XII, CA XIV) predominantly present in tumor cells, a reduced provision of bicarbonate for the nucleotide synthesis (mediated by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II), the acidification of the intracellular milieu as a consequence of CA inhibition or uncoupling of mitochondria and potent CA V inhibition among others. A combination of several such mechanisms is also plausible. Optimization of such derivatives from the SAR point of view, might lead to the development of effective novel types of anticancer agents/therapies.","['Supuran, C T', 'Scozzafava, A']","['Supuran CT', 'Scozzafava A']","['Universita degli Studi, Laboratorio di Chimica Inorganica e Bioinorganica, Florence, Italy. cts@bio.chim.unifi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Enzyme Inhib,Journal of enzyme inhibition,8709734,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arylsulfonates)', '0 (Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '98-10-2 (benzenesulfonamide)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Arylsulfonates/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Design', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfonamides/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/01/05 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/01/05 11:00'],"['2001/01/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/05 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Enzyme Inhib. 2000;15(6):597-610. doi: 10.3109/14756360009040713.,,['10.3109/14756360009040713 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here an investigation of the role of PARP in the cellular responses to inhibitors of topoisomerase I and II using NU1025. The cytotoxicity of the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, was increased 2.6-fold in L1210 cells by co-incubation with NU1025. Camptothecin-induced DNA strand breaks were also increased 2.5-fold by NU1025 and exposure to camptothecin-activated PARP. In contrast, NU1025 did not increase the DNA strand breakage or cytotoxicity caused by the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. Exposure to etoposide did not activate PARP even at concentrations that caused significant levels of apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that potentiation of camptothecin cytotoxicity by NU1025 is a direct result of increased DNA strand breakage, and that activation of PARP by camptothecin-induced DNA damage contributes to its repair and consequently cell survival. However, in L1210 cells at least, it would appear that PARP is not involved in the cellular response to etoposide-mediated DNA damage. On the basis of these data, PARP inhibitors may be potentially useful in combination with topoisomerase I inhibitor anticancer chemotherapy.","['Bowman, K J', 'Newell, D R', 'Calvert, A H', 'Curtin, N J']","['Bowman KJ', 'Newell DR', 'Calvert AH', 'Curtin NJ']","['Cancer Research Unit, University of Newcastle upon Tyne Medical School, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NU 1025)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,2001/01/05 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/05 11:00'],"['2001/01/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/05 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Jan 5;84(1):106-12. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1555.,,"['10.1054/bjoc.2000.1555 [doi]', 'S0007092000915556 [pii]']",PMC2363607,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign.'],,,,

Therefore, the expression of specific genes controlled by CRE-containing promoters is likely to determine cell fate. We now show that cAMP-induced cell death also is abrogated by the over-expression of the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-2. Contrary to ICER, Bcl-2 does not affect cAMP-signalling and allows the analysis of cAMP responses in death rescued cells. The Bcl-2 transfected cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP were growth-arrested and thereafter cells embarked in granulocytic differentiation, with no additional stimulation. Neutrophilic polynuclear granulocytes benefited from a long life span in G0-G1 and remained functional (phagocytosis). This work demonstrates that, using anti-apoptosis regulators, 'death signals' could be exploited to trigger distinct biological responses. Indeed, cAMP signal can trigger several simultaneously developing biological programs, in the same cell, i.e., growth regulation, apoptosis and differentiation. This cell system should prove useful to determine how a tumour cell can be re-programmed for either apoptosis or functional maturation by physiological signals.","['Seite, P', 'Ruchaud, S', 'Hillion, J', 'Gendron, M C', 'Bruland, O', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, E', 'Doskeland, S O', 'Lillehaug, J R', 'Lanotte, M']","['Seite P', 'Ruchaud S', 'Hillion J', 'Gendron MC', 'Bruland O', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E', 'Doskeland SO', 'Lillehaug JR', 'Lanotte M']","[""INSERM U496, Institut d'Hematologie, Hopital St Louis, 75010-Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""41941-66-6 (8-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)cyclic-3',5'-AMP)"", 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2000 Nov;7(11):1081-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400730.,,['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400730 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: A source of fever was identified in 81% of all febrile episodes. Mucositis (21.7%), pneumonia (13.2%), central venous catheter infection (12.4%), neutropenic enterocolitis (9.3%) and invasive fungal disease (9.3%) were the most common sources of fever. Of 16 central venous catheter infections, seven (43.8%) were not associated with local signs. 49 febrile episodes (37.9%) were associated with bloodstream infections, of which 14 (28.6%) were polymicrobic and seven (14.3%) had an undefined source of infection. Bloodstream infection was commonly associated with cellulitis (60%), mucositis (57.1%), central venous catheter infection (55.6%), neutropenic enterocolitis (41.7%) and invasive fungal disease (41.7%). Gram-positive microorganisms were the most common blood isolates (75.8%). Gram-negative bacteremic infections occurred in eight episodes (12.1%) experienced by patients who were not receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxes at the time of bacteremia. Noninfectious sources of fever accounted for 23 (17.8%) of the 129 febrile episodes. CONCLUSION: Although the spectrum of pathogens that cause infection in this group of patients has shifted from gram-negative to gram-positive bacteria, the most common sources of infection remain the same as previously described and they mainly involve integumental surfaces.","['Madani, T A']",['Madani TA'],"['Dept. of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. tmadani@saudidoctors.org.sa']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*etiology/*microbiology', 'Cross Infection/etiology', 'Fever/etiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Neutropenia/complications/etiology', 'Risk Factors']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infection. 2000 Nov-Dec;28(6):367-73. doi: 10.1007/s150100070007.,,['10.1007/s150100070007 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to these differentiating cells about 25% of U937 cells accumulated in the subG1 phase after TPA treatment. This effect proved to be phorbol ester-specific, since other compounds such as retinoic acid or vitamin D3 failed to induce apoptosis in conjunction with differentiation. Only a specific inhibitor of PKC, GF109203X, but not the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein could reverse the induction of apoptosis. Bryostatin-1, another specific PKC activator with distinct biochemical activity failed to induce apoptosis. Moreover, bryostatin-1 completely abolished the induction of apoptosis in U937 cells even if added 8 hours after TPA treatment. Apart from apoptosis induced by various chemotherapeutic drugs, TPA-related cell death is not mediated by an autocrine Fas-FasL loop and could not be prevented by a blocking antibody to the Fas receptor. However, a 75% reduction in the number of apoptotic cells after TPA stimulation was achieved by preincubation with a blocking antibody to the TNFalpha receptor. Tetrapeptide cleavage assays revealed a four-fold increase in the DEVD-cleavage activity in U937 cells compared to a three-fold increase in TUR cells. Immunoblotting demonstrated that TUR cells did not activate significant levels of caspase-3 or -7, whereas in U937 cells a 20-kDa cleavage product corresponding to activated caspase-3 was detectable after 3 d TPA exposure. Moreover, immunoblots revealed a strongly reduced expression of the adaptor molecule APAF-1, which is required for cytochrome c-dependent activation of caspase-9 and subsequently caspase-3. APAF-1 proved to be inducible after PKC activation with phorbol ester in U937, but not in TUR cells. Thus, APAF-1 expression may, at least in part, be regulated by PKC activity and reduced APAF-1 levels are associated with resistance to various inducers of apoptosis. Furthermore, TPA exposure of U937 cells is associated with increased levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bcl-xs, whereas simultaneously a decline in the Bcl-2 expression was noticable.","['Meinhardt, G', 'Roth, J', 'Totok, G']","['Meinhardt G', 'Roth J', 'Totok G']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Medizinische Klinik Innenstadt of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. geroldmeinhardt@yahoo.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2000 Nov;79(11):824-33. doi: 10.1078/0171-9335-00100.,,"['S0171-9335(04)70094-1 [pii]', '10.1078/0171-9335-00100 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect of genistein has been attributed partially to its tyrosine kinase-regulating properties, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and limited angiogenesis. Genistein has been used in chemotherapy-resistant cases of advanced leukemia with promising results. Here we demonstrate that genistein primarily affects nucleic acid synthesis and glucose oxidation in tumor cells using the [1,2-(13)C2]glucose isotope as the single tracer and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to follow various intracellular glucose metabolites. The ribose fraction of RNA demonstrated a rapid 4.6%, 16.4%, and 46.3% decrease in isotope uptake through the nonoxidative branch of the pentose cycle and a sharp 4.8%. 24.6%, and 48% decrease in 13CO2 release from glucose after 2, 20, and 200 micromol/L genistein treatment, respectively. Fatty acid synthesis and the 13C enrichment of acetyl units were not significantly affected by genistein treatment. De novo glycogen synthesis from media glucose was not detected in cultured MIA cells. It can be concluded from these studies that genistein controls tumor growth primarily through the regulation of glucose metabolism, specifically targeting glucose carbon incorporation into nucleic acid ribose through the nonoxidative steps of the pentose cycle, which represents a new paradigm for the antiproliferative action of a plant phytochemical.","['Boros, L G', 'Bassilian, S', 'Lim, S', 'Lee, W N']","['Boros LG', 'Bassilian S', 'Lim S', 'Lee WN']","['Harbor-UCLA Research and Education Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Torrance, California 90502, USA. boros@gcrc.humc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pancreas,Pancreas,8608542,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '681HV46001 (Ribose)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Pentose Phosphate Pathway/*drug effects', 'Ribose/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pancreas. 2001 Jan;22(1):1-7. doi: 10.1097/00006676-200101000-00001.,,['10.1097/00006676-200101000-00001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We collected all incident cases 20-74 years of age from 12 areas, with a combined population of approximately 7 million residents. The control group was formed by a random sample of the study population. Data presented in this paper refer to 2,737 interviewed cases of 3,357 eligible cases and to 1,779 of 2,391 eligible controls. We analyzed risks associated with occupation using job-title information to evaluate disease pattern according to job category. An earlier publication presented results for women; here, we report the findings for men and discuss the overall patterns in both genders. The most consistent overall finding was an approximate doubling in relative risk for all four types of malignancies among male managers and related occupations. Several additional occupations were associated with elevated risk of one or more malignancies among men. These included cooks, waiters, and bartenders, and building caretakers and cleaners, for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; textile workers and machinery fitters for Hodgkin's lymphoma; metal processors, material handlers, rubber workers, and painters for leukemia; and hairdressers, metal processors, tailors, electrical workers, and plumbers for multiple myeloma. The finding of increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among both male and female cooks, waiters, and bartenders has not been previously reported; nor has the elevated risk of leukemia among material handlers. Among people engaged in agriculture, those employed as tractor drivers and as ""orchard, vineyard, and related tree and shrub workers"" appeared to be at increased risk for hematolymphopoietic malignancies.","['Costantini, A S', 'Miligi, L', 'Kriebel, D', 'Ramazzotti, V', 'Rodella, S', 'Scarpi, E', 'Stagnaro, E', 'Tumino, R', 'Fontana, A', 'Masala, G', 'Vigano, C', 'Vindigni, C', 'Crosignani, P', 'Benvenuti, A', 'Vineis, P']","['Costantini AS', 'Miligi L', 'Kriebel D', 'Ramazzotti V', 'Rodella S', 'Scarpi E', 'Stagnaro E', 'Tumino R', 'Fontana A', 'Masala G', 'Vigano C', 'Vindigni C', 'Crosignani P', 'Benvenuti A', 'Vineis P']","['Epidemiology Unit, Center for Study and Prevention of Cancer, Azienda Ospedaliera Careggi, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,"['0 (Pesticides)', '0 (Solvents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Occupations/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Solvents/*adverse effects']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Epidemiology. 2001 Jan;12(1):78-87. doi: 10.1097/00001648-200101000-00014.,,['10.1097/00001648-200101000-00014 [doi]'],,,['CA51086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

These MMR-deficient cancers are frequently resistant to alkylating agent chemotherapy such as DNA-methylating or platinum-containing compounds. To correlate drug resistance with MMR status in a large panel of human tumor cell lines, we evaluated by Western blot the cellular levels of the two MMR proteins most commonly mutated in human cancers, MLH1 and MSH2, in the NCI human tumor cell line panel. This panel consists of 60 cell lines distributed among nine different neoplastic diseases. RESULTS: We found that in most of these cell lines both MLH1 and MSH2 were expressed, although at variable levels. Five cell lines (leukemia CCRF-CEM, colon HCT 116 and KM12 and ovarian cancers SK-OV-3 and IGROV-1) showed complete deficiency in MLH1 protein. MSH2 protein was detected in all 57 cell lines studied. Absence of MLH1 protein was always linked to resistance to the methylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide. This resistance was independent of cellular levels of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase. Based on data available for review in the NCI COMPARE database, cellular levels of MLH1 and MSH2 did not correlate significantly with sensitivity to any standard anticancer drug or with any characterized molecular target already tested against the same panel of cell lines. CONCLUSION: Based on evaluation of 60 tumor cell lines in the NCI anticancer drug screen, MLH1 deficiency was more common than MSH2 deficiency and was always associated with a high degree of temozolomide resistance. These data will enable correlations with other drug sensitivities and molecular targets in the COMPARE database to evaluate linked processes in tumor drug resistance.","['Taverna, P', 'Liu, L', 'Hanson, A J', 'Monks, A', 'Gerson, S L']","['Taverna P', 'Liu L', 'Hanson AJ', 'Monks A', 'Gerson SL']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine and Ireland Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine and University Hospitals of Cleveland, BRB-3, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106-4937, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins', '*DNA Repair', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Software', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;46(6):507-16. doi: 10.1007/s002800000186.,,['10.1007/s002800000186 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

TS inhibition was induced by the specific TS inhibitor Thymitaq. Within 24 h, TS inhibition resulted in S-phase cell cycle arrest in both cell lines and subsequent apoptotic cell death as characterized by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies. A biphasic hyper/hypopolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m) was also observed. The mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitor, cyclosporin A, increased the baseline level of delta psi m in L1210 cells. However, along with bongkrekic acid, it did not influence the changes in delta psi m induced by TS inhibition in either cell line. In both cell lines the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, zVAD.fmk as a single agent, induced a significant downward shift in the baseline of delta psi m. However, only in HL60 cells was this accompanied by a slight increase in cytotoxicity. In L1210 cells zVAD.fmk inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by Thymitaq but did not influence other cell cycle events (S-phase arrest) or the biphasic mitochondrial alterations, indicating caspase involvement downstream but not upstream of the mitochondria following TS inhibition. In HL60 cells, zVAD.fmk reduced the hyperpolarization of delta psi m observed with Thymitaq alone and failed to inhibit the increase in the sub-G1 population induced by Thymitaq. Moreover, zVAD.fmk significantly increased the cell death response of these cells following TS inhibition. In conclusion, cell death induced by TS inhibition is mediated via the apoptotic pathway which clearly involves biphasic alterations in delta psi m. In L1210 cells, but not in HL60 cells, caspases function as the final executioner of apoptosis.","['Sakoff, J A', 'Ackland, S P']","['Sakoff JA', 'Ackland SP']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Newcastle Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Newcastle, NSW, Australia, 2298. mdspa8@cc.newcastle.edu.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K75ZUN743Q (nolatrexed)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'S Phase/*drug effects/genetics', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;46(6):477-87. doi: 10.1007/s002800000164.,,['10.1007/s002800000164 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase III study.,459-66,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of epirubicin to that of the combination of epirubicin and cisplatin in patients with advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 155 patients were randomized to receive either epirubicin (70 mg/m2) days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks or epirubicin (60 mg/m2) days 1 and 8 plus cisplatin (100 mg/m2) day 1 every 4 weeks. Epirubicin was continued until disease progression or to a cumulative dose of 1000 mg/m2. Cisplatin was discontinued after six cycles. In 45 premenopausal women an oophorectomy was performed. None of the evaluable patients had received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. RESULTS: Among evaluable patients (74 in the epirubicin group and 65 in the epirubicin plus cisplatin group) there were 19% vs 29% complete responses, and 42% vs 37% partial responses, with no significant difference. In the epirubicin plus cisplatin group the response rate was significantly higher in previously untreated patients as compared with patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy (74% vs 55%, P = 0.002). Median times to disease progression were 8.4 months in the epirubicin group and 15.3 months in the epirubicin plus cisplatin group (P = 0.045). Median survival times were 15.1 and 21.5 months, respectively (P = 0.41). In the epirubicin plus cisplatin group leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were significantly more frequent, 29% of the patients developed mild to moderate peripheral neurotoxicity, 34% reported tinnitus and hearing changes, 6 patients developed nephrotoxicity (one died due to nephrotic syndrome), and 3 patients developed leukaemia (two died of this cause). Congestive heart failure occurred in six patients in the epirubicin group and three patients in the epirubicin plus cisplatin group. CONCLUSION: Cisplatin plus epirubicin is an active, although highly toxic regimen when used as first-line therapy in advanced breast cancer. The time to disease progression was significantly longer in the cisplatin plus epirubicin group (increased by 82%). Due to toxicity, the combination regimen cannot be recommended. However, the study indicated a very high activity of cisplatin in advanced breast cancer. Studies of first-line therapy in advanced breast cancer including cisplatin or other platin derivatives in combination with, for example, the taxanes are suggested.","['Nielsen, D', 'Dombernowsky, P', 'Larsen, S K', 'Hansen, O P', 'Skovsgaard, T']","['Nielsen D', 'Dombernowsky P', 'Larsen SK', 'Hansen OP', 'Skovsgaard T']","['Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital, DK-2730 Herlev, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;46(6):459-66. doi: 10.1007/s002800000178.,,['10.1007/s002800000178 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Daunorubicin (DNR) efflux was evidenced after 25 additional passages with constant 160 ng ml(-1) of either VCR or DOX, an effect that was inhibited by verapamil, cyclosporin-A (CsA) and PSC 833. The expression of Pgp was not evidenced in the resistant cell lines using anti-human Pgp antibodies. Cell proliferation assay showed that cell lines resistant to VCR (LBR-V160) or DOX (LBR-D160) required higher doses of either drug to produce GI50 compared with control cell line obtained after culture in the absence of VCR or DOX. When resistant cell lines were maintained during 60 days in the absence of either VCR or DOX, MDR phenotype reversal was obtained in LBR-D160 while LBR-V160 remained resistant to the drug, as shown by cell proliferation assays and by drug efflux pump functionality. When VCR or DOX were used together with either CsA or PSC 833, the latter was more effective to produce reversal of resistance than the former, whereas CsA presented greater cytotoxic effect than PSC 833 for sensitive and resistant cells. Cross-resistance was found between VCR, DOX and other antineoplasic agents on murine leukemic cell line. VCR was more effective to induce MDR since the resistant cell lines were more stable to the MDR phenotype.","['Lopes, E C', 'Scolnik, M', 'Alvarez, E', 'Hajos, S E']","['Lopes EC', 'Scolnik M', 'Alvarez E', 'Hajos SE']","['Catedra de Inmunologia, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), IDEHU-CONICET, Junin 956 4 piso, 1113, Buenos Aires, Argentina. meclopes@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Jan;25(1):85-93. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00094-1.,,"['S0145-2126(00)00094-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00094-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

These defects in NAD neutrophils are attributed to moderate over-expression of pp52 (LSP1), the F-actin-binding, leukocyte-specific phosphoprotein. Here we report that pp52 is similarly elevated in HCL patient PBMCs. Established HCL cell lines exhibited characteristic morphological features like those of fresh HCL cells and showed elevated pp52 levels. The excess pp52 in these HCL cell lines was selectively associated with the F-actin-rich cytoskeletal arrays in surface projections. Treatments producing radical changes in HCL cell shape also altered pp52 expression and intracellular distribution. Alpha interferon (IFNalpha, used to treat HCL) reduced pp52 levels, normalized intracellular pp52 distribution and reverted HCL cells to rounded B cell morphology. Phorbol ester stimulation rapidly generated hyper-phosphorylated pp52 isoforms which translocated from the cytoskeleton to the cytosol prior to the further elongation of surface spikes. This indicates a direct role for phosphorylation in controlling pp52 interactions with the cytoskeleton. Overall, these findings strongly suggest that elevated pp52 expression and/or selective cytoskeletal association contributes to the distinctive morphology of HCL cells.","['Miyoshi, E K', 'Stewart, P L', 'Kincade, P W', 'Lee, M B', 'Thompson, A A', 'Wall, R']","['Miyoshi EK', 'Stewart PL', 'Kincade PW', 'Lee MB', 'Thompson AA', 'Wall R']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, UCLA School of Medicine, 9 Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (LSP1 protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Jan;25(1):57-67. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00079-5.,,"['S0145-2126(00)00079-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00079-5 [doi]']",,,"['AI20069/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM40185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Deletions of genetic material can result in loss of tumor suppressor genes or other translation products that are crucial in maintaining an orderly cell cycle sequence or viability of the apoptotic cascade. Chromosome 5 contains many genes that are relevant in hematopoiesis. Deletions of chromosome 5 or parts thereof are found frequently in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemias (AML) where they are associated with a poor prognosis. Although abnormalities of chromosome 5 are not commonly detected by cytogenetic analysis in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemias, we hypothesized that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of microsatellite markers on chromosome 5 may occur more frequently and likewise influence outcome in these patients. Therefore, we analyzed peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 41 adults with a diagnosis of ALL for LOH by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and correlated our findings with overall survival of patients with and without LOH. LOH for at least one microsatellite marker was found in seven of 41 patients (17%). All patients demonstrated LOH on the long arm of chromosome 5. In three patients, LOH was extended to 5p. A region of minimal deletion which overlapped in all seven patients could be localized between markers D5S410 and D5S436 corresponding to chromosomal location 5q31-33 which is similar to the area of minimal deletion seen in AML. None of these patients showed involvement of chromosome 5 by cytogenetic analysis. We conclude that patients with ALL have LOH for gene segments on chromosome 5, especially 5q, more frequently than expected from cytogenetic studies. Although, unlike AML, no significant impact on prognosis could be found between patients with and without LOH on chromosome 5. The current data suggest that 5q abnormalities are not specific for AML and can also occur in patients with ALL.","['Faderl, S', 'Gidel, C', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Manshouri, T', 'Keating, M', 'Albitar, M']","['Faderl S', 'Gidel C', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Manshouri T', 'Keating M', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030-4095, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Jan;25(1):39-43. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00084-9.,,"['S0145-2126(00)00084-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00084-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Reclassification of morphological diagnosis revealed that the proportion of M3 was lower but that of M6 and the incidence of cases with trilineage dysplasia (TLD), known as poor prognostic features, were higher in the elderly than in patients less than 60 years old. Similarly, chromosomal data showed a lower frequency of favorable karyotypes such as t(8;21) and t(15;17) in the elderly. The overall survival of all 112 patients was 10.3% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis indicated that good performance status (PS), low WBC at diagnosis, standard dose multi-drug chemotherapy and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment for M3 patients, and morphological findings without TLD were significantly correlated with longer survival. Most of the long-term survivors were found among those who received standard dose therapy in this series, although no consensus has been established how to treat elderly AML patients. We propose that a prospective controlled trial is necessary to confirm the role of standard dose chemotherapy for elderly patients with de novo AML.","['Yoshida, S', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Miyazaki, Y', 'Taguchi, J', 'Fukushima, T', 'Honda, M', 'Hayashibara, T', 'Nagai, K', 'Atogami, S', 'Toriya, K', 'Soda, H', 'Nonaka, H', 'Momita, S', 'Jinnai, I', 'Amenomori, T', 'Kusano, M', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Ikeda, S', 'Matsuo, T', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Yoshida S', 'Kuriyama K', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Taguchi J', 'Fukushima T', 'Honda M', 'Hayashibara T', 'Nagai K', 'Atogami S', 'Toriya K', 'Soda H', 'Nonaka H', 'Momita S', 'Jinnai I', 'Amenomori T', 'Kusano M', 'Yoshida Y', 'Ikeda S', 'Matsuo T', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Sakamoto 1-12-4, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Jan;25(1):33-38. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00089-8.,,"['S0145-2126(00)00089-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00089-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Abrogation of apoptosis in response to cytotoxic medications is associated with drug resistance in AML, as is expression of bcl-2, an important anti-apoptotic protein. We hypothesized that blasts from elderly (> or = 55 years) and young adult AML patients might have different levels of apoptotic and cell cycle responses to chemotherapeutic agents, as well as different levels of proliferation and of bcl-2 protein expression. Therefore, we cultured bone marrow leukemia samples from previously untreated elderly (n=33) and young (n=21) AML patients for 48 h and then measured apoptosis, bcl-2 protein levels, cell cycle distributions, and expression of a proliferation marker, proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) in multi-parametric flow cytometry assays. In some experiments, leukemia samples were exposed to cytarabine (Ara-C) or daunomycin (DNR) for the last 16-18 h of the culture period. In comparison to samples from young patients, cultured samples from elderly AML patients had a higher fraction of viable cells, as measured by Trypan blue exclusion, higher PCNA expression, and significantly less culture-induced and drug-induced apoptosis. The mean apoptosis after culture was 13% for elderly AML samples, versus 20% for young AML samples (P=0.009). Similarly, the mean apoptosis after Ara-C was lower in elderly than in young AML samples, 13 versus 28% (P=0.001), as was the mean apoptosis after DNR, 15 versus 26% (P=0.012). Diminished apoptotic responses in elderly AML cells were not consistently associated with high bcl-2 levels at thaw or bcl-2 levels increased by culture. These data suggest that new therapies should be developed to overcome abrogated apoptosis, particularly in elderly AML patients.","['Garrido, S M', 'Cooper, J J', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Willman, C L', 'Kopecky, K', 'Banker, D E']","['Garrido SM', 'Cooper JJ', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Willman CL', 'Kopecky K', 'Banker DE']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, 1100 Fairview Avenue N., Seattle, WA 98104-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aging/*pathology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Jan;25(1):23-32. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00083-7.,,"['S0145-2126(00)00083-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00083-7 [doi]']",,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UOI CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

MeHgCl hyperpolarized membranes of thymocytes, followed by depolarization within a few minutes after the application, while MeHg-Cys persistently hyperpolarized them. MeHgCl increased intracellular concentration of Ca(2+), decreased cellular content of glutathione and increased generation of superoxide anion in the cells. The effects of MeHg-Cys were much less than those of MeHgCl. MeHgCl greatly increased both numbers of the cells undergoing apoptosis and dead cells in cell suspension containing thymocytes, while this was not the case for MeHg-Cys. MeHgCl reduced the cell viability of human leukemia K562 cells and completely inhibited the cell growth. The effects of MeHg-Cys on K562 cells were less than those of MeHgCl. It can be concluded that the effects of MeHgCl on rat thymocytes and K562 cells are different from those of MeHg-Cys. The results obtained from the in vitro studies using MeHgCl may be less implicit to elucidate the mechanism of MeHg intoxication in humans and experimental animals because MeHg are present in forms of MeHg-Cys and/or MeHg-S conjugate under the in vivo conditions.","['Oyama', 'Yamazaki', 'Okada', 'Takahama', 'Satoh', 'Hayashi']","['Oyama Y', 'Yamazaki Y', 'Okada Y', 'Takahama K', 'Satoh M', 'Hayashi H']","['Laboratories of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Integrated Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokushima, 770-8502, Tokushima, Japan']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,9612020,,,,,2001/01/04 00:00,2001/01/04 00:01,['2001/01/04 00:00'],"['2001/01/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/01/04 00:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Toxicol Pharmacol. 2000 Dec;9(1-2):49-55. doi: 10.1016/s1382-6689(00)00062-4.,,"['S1382668900000624 [pii]', '10.1016/s1382-6689(00)00062-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

With two-hybrid screening using DREF as a bait, we have obtained a clone encoding a protein homologous to human myelodysplasia/myeloid leukemia factor 1 (hMLF1). We termed the protein Drosophila MLF (dMLF); it consists of a polypeptide of 309 amino acid residues, whose sequence shares 23.1% identity with hMLF1. High conservation of 54.2% identity over 107 amino acids was found in the central region. The dMLF gene was mapped to 52D on the second chromosome by in situ hybridization. Interaction between dMLF and DREF in vitro could be confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, with the conserved central region appearing to play an important role in this. Northern blot hybridization analysis revealed dMLF mRNA levels to be high in unfertilized eggs, early embryos, pupae and adult males, and relatively low in adult females and larvae. This fluctuation of mRNA during Drosophila development is similar to that observed for DREF mRNA, except in the pupa and adult male. Using a specific antibody against the dMLF, we performed immunofluorescent staining of Drosophila Kc cells and showed a primarily cytoplasmic staining, whereas DREF localizes in the nucleus. However, dMLF protein contains a putative 14-3-3 binding motif involved in the subcellular localization of various regulatory molecules, and interaction with DREF could be regulated through this motif. The transgenic fly data suggesting the genetic interaction between DREF and dMLF support this possibility. Characterization of dMLF in the present study provides the molecular basis for analysis of its significance in Drosophila.","['Ohno, K', 'Takahashi, Y', 'Hirose, F', 'Inoue, Y H', 'Taguchi, O', 'Nishida, Y', 'Matsukage, A', 'Yamaguchi, M']","['Ohno K', 'Takahashi Y', 'Hirose F', 'Inoue YH', 'Taguchi O', 'Nishida Y', 'Matsukage A', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Division of Biochemistry, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Chikusa-ku, 464-8681, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dref protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Drosophila melanogaster/embryology/*genetics/growth & development', 'Eye/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Insect/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 2000 Dec 30;260(1-2):133-43. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00447-9.,,"['S0378-1119(00)00447-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00447-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB043986'],

Lyn is necessary for FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell activation. To investigate how the level of Lyn is maintained in mast cell activation, it was studied whether Lyn binds to ubiquitin and is ubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation in cells. In the yeast two hybrid system, Lyn specifically interacted with ubiquitin in vivo. Furthermore, Lyn bound to ubiquitin-conjugated Sepharose beads in vitro and was efficiently competed by soluble ubiquitin. Pulse-chase experiments indicated intracellular degradation of Lyn was associated with the generation of a high molecular weight complex in the presence of proteasome-specific inhibitor, lactacystin. This high molecular weight complex cross-reacted with anti-Lyn and anti-ubiquitin demonstrating the ubiquitination Lyn. Overexpression of Lyn and ubiquitin in COS 7.2 cells also resulted in the ubiquitination of Lyn in the presence of lactacystin, supporting the ubiquitination of Lyn by a proteasome specific pathway.","['Bhattacharyya, S P']",['Bhattacharyya SP'],"['Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, NIH Campus, Building 29, Room 304, 29 Lincoln Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. bhattacharyya@cber.fda.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/immunology/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Mast Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",,2001/01/04 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/04 11:00'],"['2001/01/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/04 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2001 Jan 1;75(2):131-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(00)00289-3.,,"['S0165-2478(00)00289-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(00)00289-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the L5178Y model: two murine lymphoma sublines, which differ in nucleotide excision repair ability and hence, in sensitivity to those platinum complexes that react with DNA. The anti-proliferative effect of the examined compounds mainly depends on the kind of amine ligand. Complexes with the primary amine (ethylenediamine) are more effective than complexes containing the tertiary amine (1-alkylimidazole). The ethylenediaminemalatoplatinum(II) complexes show a differential in vitro anti-proliferative activity in the L5178Y model; hence, it may be expected that they inflict DNA lesions that are repaired by the nucleotide excision system. The cytotoxicity of these complexes is directly correlated with reactivity with glutathione (GSH). The 1-alkylimidazole complexes are of low toxicity and moderate to low reactivity with GSH; in contrast to the ethylenediaminemalatoplatinum(II) complexes, their cytotoxicity is inversely correlated with reactivity with GSH. Two of the 1-alkylimidazole complexes, bis(1-ethylimidazole)(L-malato)platinum(II) and bis(1-propylimidazole (L-malato)platinum(II), show a considerable ability to arrest cells in G2 phase.

Their pathogenesis may differ from primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and is associated with various factors including the virus itself or the antiretroviral therapy. In order to evaluate the differences between HIV-related MDF and MDS, the morphological changes in peripheral blood and bone marrow, cytogenetic analysis and the response to anaemia treatment were studied in 158 HIV+ patients with haemophilia and the results were compared with those of 61 patients with primary MDS (31 with RA, 10 with RARS, 11 with RAEB, three with RAEB-t and six with CMML). The eligibility criteria for patients with MDS were primary MDS, Hb levels < 10 g dL(-1), and no significant organ disease. The peripheral blood and bone marrow examination revealed MDF in 44 HIV-infected haemophilic patients (27.8%). The median time from seroconversion was 12.5 years and the mean time under AZT therapy was 44.1 months. Nineteen of these patients (43.1%) had Hb levels < 10 g dL(-1), while neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 29.5% and 25%, respectively. Every patient of this study with Hb < 10 g dL(-1) received erythropoietin (Epo). There were statistically significant morphological alterations between HIV-related MDF and MDS: hypocellularity, plasmatocytosis and eosinophilia were more pronounced in HIV haemophiliacs with MDF, while dysplasia of erythroblasts, megakaryocytes and granulocytes was more frequent in MDS patients. No HIV haemophilic patient with MDF had more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow nor did any develop RAEB or acute leukaemia during the period of this study. The cytogenetic analysis was normal in HIV-infected patients with haemophilia whereas 42.6% of patients with MDS had an abnormal karyotype. Complete erythroid response was achieved with Epo administration in 84.2% of HIV+ haemophilic patients with anaemia compared to 19.7% of patients with MDS. These data suggest that bone marrow changes in long-term HIV patients have different characteristics from primary MDS and constitute the entity for which the name HIV-myelopathy has been proposed in the literature.","['Katsarou, O', 'Terpos, E', 'Patsouris, E', 'Peristeris, P', 'Viniou, N', 'Kapsimali, V', 'Karafoulidou, A']","['Katsarou O', 'Terpos E', 'Patsouris E', 'Peristeris P', 'Viniou N', 'Kapsimali V', 'Karafoulidou A']","['Second Regional Blood Transfusion and Comprehensive Haemophilia Center, University of Athens Medical School, Laiko General Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Haemophilia,Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,9442916,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*physiopathology', 'Hemophilia A/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*physiopathology']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haemophilia. 2001 Jan;7(1):47-52. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2516.2001.00445.x.,,"['hae445 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2516.2001.00445.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We used this method to identify chromosomal abnormalities in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and assessed their prognostic implications. METHODS: Mononuclear cells from the blood of 325 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for deletions in chromosome bands 6q21, 11q22-23, 13q14, and 17p13; trisomy of bands 3q26, 8q24, and 12q13; and translocations involving band 14q32. Molecular cytogenetic data were correlated with clinical findings. RESULTS: Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 268 of 325 cases (82 percent). The most frequent changes were a deletion in 13q (55 percent), a deletion in 11q (18 percent), trisomy of 12q (16 percent), a deletion in 17p (7 percent), and a deletion in 6q (7 percent). Five categories were defined with a statistical model: 17p deletion, 11q deletion, 12q trisomy, normal karyotype, and 13q deletion as the sole abnormality; the median survival times for patients in these groups were 32, 79, 114, 111, and 133 months, respectively. Patients in the 17p- and 11q-deletion groups had more advanced disease than those in the other three groups. Patients with 17p deletions had the shortest median treatment-free interval (9 months), and those with 13q deletions had the longest (92 months). In multivariate analysis, the presence or absence of a 17p deletion, the presence or absence of an 11q deletion, age, Binet stage, the serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and the white-cell count gave significant prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia are important independent predictors of disease progression and survival. These findings have implications for the design of risk-adapted treatment strategies.","['Dohner, H', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Benner, A', 'Leupolt, E', 'Krober, A', 'Bullinger, L', 'Dohner, K', 'Bentz, M', 'Lichter, P']","['Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Benner A', 'Leupolt E', 'Krober A', 'Bullinger L', 'Dohner K', 'Bentz M', 'Lichter P']","['Department of Internal Medicine III University of Ulm, Germany. hartmut.doehner@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'DNA Probes', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Trisomy']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2000 Dec 28;343(26):1910-6. doi: 10.1056/NEJM200012283432602.,,"['MJBA-432602 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJM200012283432602 [doi]']",,,,['N Engl J Med. 2001 Apr 19;344(16):1254.

The breast has been reported to be an uncommon site for granulocytic sarcoma. We found that 38.8% of granulocytic sarcomas diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration in the English-language literature occurred in the breast. In the absence of clinical history or hematological abnormality, granulocytic sarcoma may be misdiagnosed, depending on the degree of myeloid differentiation present within the tumor. The differential diagnosis includes large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lobular carcinoma of the breast, undifferentiated carcinoma, malignant melanoma, extramedullary hemopoiesis and inflammation.

An example of such an interstitial insertion, which has created an MLL-AF10 fusion in an acute myeloid leukaemia, has been analysed at the genomic level. The genomic fusion, which resulted in the juxtaposition of 3' AF10 sequence to 5' MLL sequence, was identified within MLL and AF10 intronic sequences. It was further established that the remaining 3' MLL sequence, from exon 6 onwards, was fused to novel sequence of unknown origin (named FM3 for fused to MLL 3'). The points of fusion of these 5' and 3' portions of MLL matched to adjacent nucleotides and lay between exons 5 and 6. The FM3 sequence was shown to be from chromosome arm 10p and located close to AF10 in a proximal position. It was subsequently demonstrated that in the leukaemia a third fusion existed between 5' AF10 and the FM3 sequence at a point immediately downstream from its fusion to MLL. It was therefore concluded that the MLL-AF10 gene fusion is the result of a simultaneous transposition of genetic material into the MLL gene and the joining of the remaining free ends on chromosome 10. This kind of event, characterised completely here for the first time, is a means to achieve a fusion when the genes involved lie in opposite orientations and results in three genomic junctions.","['Chaplin, T', 'Jones, L', 'Debernardi, S', 'Hill, A S', 'Lillington, D M', 'Young, B D']","['Chaplin T', 'Jones L', 'Debernardi S', 'Hill AS', 'Lillington DM', 'Young BD']","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Department of Medical Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Feb;30(2):175-80.,,['10.1002/1098-2264(200102)30:2<175::AID-GCC1073>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]'],,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,"['GENBANK/AF242205', 'GENBANK/AF242206', 'GENBANK/AF242207']",

There have been few reports of HCL from oriental countries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective survey of HCL in six major hematology units in Hong Kong over a 12-year period. RESULTS: There were 18 cases of HCL identified. Most patients presented with fever, splenomegaly and monocytopenia. Lymphadenopathy was present in three patients, and open biopsy revealed tuberculosis infection in two cases. Seven cases received interferon and 12 cases received 2-CDA. Four patients died from bronchogenic carcinoma, cerebral vascular accident, fulminant hepatitis B virus reactivation and malignant melanoma. The remaining 14 patients are in clinical remission at a median of 6 years' follow-up; two are also surviving from second malignancies (thyroid papillary carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma). CONCLUSIONS: Parallel to the low incidence of B-LPD in Chinese, the incidence of HCL (0.035/100000 population per year) is much lower than in Western series. Other clinical features such as male dominance, clinical presentation, response to 2-CDA treatment, and association with second malignancy are similar to Western reports.

In one type of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the block in the normal process of differentiation can be circumvented by the addition of a chemical inducer, in this case retinoic acid. This is due to the defect in APL affecting the retinoic acid receptor gene. This type of therapy has become known as differentiation therapy. However, most types of leukemia do not respond to the retinoic acid, and therefore methods of differentiation therapy need to be developed by targeting other genes involved in the leukemia process. This requires the molecular characterizations of the genes that are expressed during differentiation and in particular those genes that show a differential expression in inducer sensitive cells and those resistant to induced differentiation. Therefore, therapeutic agents could be developed to specifically target these genes. This article describes how the technique of differential display, as one of several possible methods of molecular screening, may allow the identification of genes which can be targeted to induce differentiation.","['Mills, K I']",['Mills KI'],"['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, Wales, UK. millski@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",52,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2000 Dec;18(4):129-140. doi: 10.1002/1099-1069(200012)18:4<129::aid-hon664>3.0.co;2-k.,,"['10.1002/1099-1069(200012)18:4<129::AID-HON664>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/1099-1069(200012)18:4<129::aid-hon664>3.0.co;2-k [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of them carry O-linked oligosaccharides (O-glycans), which are conjugated through serine or threonine residues. During various biological processes, including T-cell activation, a tetrasaccharide on the T-cell surface is dramatically converted to a branched hexasaccharide, called core2 O-glycan. The same structural change in O-glycans is also found on the lymphocytes from patients with immunodeficiency conditions such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and AIDS. Several studies revealing the roles of core2 O-glycans in immune responses show that this is a biologically significant change. In particular, core2 O-glycans expressed on the cell surface reduce cell-cell interactions, thereby regulating immune responses. Furthermore, core2 O-glycan is a key backbone structure in forming selectin ligands. Thus, O-linked oligosaccharides, in particular those containing core2 branches, play vital roles in immune responses and may play dual roles in certain situations. This review will summarize the results obtained from various studies investigating the roles of O-glycans in immunological processes.

Earlier studies have shown that various functions, such as chemotaxis, fluid phase pinocytosis, phagocytosis, and degranulation in response to chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), were defective in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) from CML patients. These functions depend on actin microfilaments (MF). Further studies showed that fMLP-induced actin polymerization was lower in CML PMNL. To see if this defect is specific to stimulation by fMLP alone or is a global phenomenon involving other chemoattractant receptors, chemotaxis and actin polymerization were studied in response to fMLP, an analog of fMLP, formyl-methionine-1 aminocyclooctane 1 carboxylic acid-phenyalanine-O-methionine (FACC8), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). These compounds bind to different chemoattractant receptors. Chemotaxis and actin polymerization in response to all four chemoattractants were significantly lower in CML PMNL compared with PMNL from normal subjects and were differentially affected for the different chemoattractants. These results suggest a global phenomenon involving all four chemoattractant-stimulated pathways. This lower amount of F-actin may be responsible for the defective chemotaxis seen in these cells.","['Radhika, V', 'Naik, N R', 'Advani, S H', 'Bhisey, A N']","['Radhika V', 'Naik NR', 'Advani SH', 'Bhisey AN']","['Cancer Research Institute, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Actins/*metabolism', 'Chemotactic Factors/*pharmacology', '*Chemotaxis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/agonists/pharmacology']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Dec 15;42(6):379-86. doi: 10.1002/1097-0320(20001215)42:6<379::aid-cyto1005>3.0.co;2-q.,,"['10.1002/1097-0320(20001215)42:6<379::AID-CYTO1005>3.0.CO;2-Q [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0320(20001215)42:6<379::aid-cyto1005>3.0.co;2-q [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To elevate the efficiency of viral transduction, several restrictions, such as low virus-cell encounters and the necessity for cell division, must be improved. In this study, we focused on the possibility of accelerating cell division and the ensuing increment of viral transduction on flexible substrata. Perfluorocarbon FC-40 was harnessed to form a liquid-liquid interface with culture medium. Enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was employed as the marker gene to quickly illustrate the percentage of viral infection. The results indicate that the gene transfer efficiency to 293 cells cultured on protein-precoated liquid-liquid interfaces was higher than in cells cultured on rigid polystyrene surfaces. This increased transduction rate on the liquid-liquid interface is consistent with the acceleration of division of 293 cells on a flexible interface, which exhibited less adhesiveness. The effect of cell-cell contact inhibition on the rate of gene transduction is also addressed in this study.","['Kwon, Y J', 'Yu, H', 'Peng, C A']","['Kwon YJ', 'Yu H', 'Peng CA']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Southern California, 925 West 37th Street, Los Angeles, California 90089-1211, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fluorocarbons)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Fluorocarbons/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polystyrenes/metabolism', 'Surface Properties', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2001 Feb 5;72(3):331-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0290(20010205)72:3<331::aid-bit10>3.0.co;2-a.,,"['10.1002/1097-0290(20010205)72:3<331::AID-BIT10>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0290(20010205)72:3<331::aid-bit10>3.0.co;2-a [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']",,,,

Stable disappearance of viral expression occurs at 2 to 3 weeks after inoculation. This coincides with the development of the anti-HTLV-1 immune response and persistent detection of the provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this study, the HTLV-1 replication pattern was analyzed over time in PBMCs and various organs from two HTLV-1-infected squirrel monkeys. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that PBMCs and lymphoid organs constitute the major reservoirs for HTLV-1. The PCR amplification of HTLV-1 flanking sequences from PBMCs evidenced a pattern of clonal expansion of infected cells identical to that observed in humans. Dissemination of the virus in body compartments appeared to result from cellular transport of the integrated provirus. The circulating proviral burden increased as a function of time in one animal studied over a period of 4 years. The high proviral loads observed in the last samples resulted from the accumulation of infected cells via the extensive proliferation of a restricted number of persistent clones on a background of polyclonally expanded HTLV-1-positive cells. Therefore, HTLV-1 primary infection in squirrel monkeys is a two-step process involving a transient phase of reverse transcription followed by persistent multiplication of infected cells. This suggests that the choice of the target for blocking HTLV-1 replication might depend on the stage of infection.","['Mortreux, F', 'Kazanji, M', 'Gabet, A S', 'de Thoisy, B', 'Wattel, E']","['Mortreux F', 'Kazanji M', 'Gabet AS', 'de Thoisy B', 'Wattel E']","['Unite 524 INSERM, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/physiopathology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoid Tissue/virology', 'Male', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Saimiri', 'Viral Load', '*Virus Replication']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jan;75(2):1083-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.2.1083-1089.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.2.1083-1089.2001 [doi]'],PMC114008,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to define the effects of R homology lengths on minus-strand DNA transfer. We generated five murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors that contained identical sequences but different lengths of the 3' R (3, 6, 12, 24 and 69 nucleotides [nt]); 69 nt is the full-length MLV R. After one round of replication, viral titers from the vector with a full-length downstream R were compared with viral titers generated from the other four vectors with reduced R lengths. Viral titers generated from vectors with R lengths reduced to one-third (24 nt) or one-sixth (12 nt) that of the wild type were not significantly affected; however, viral titers generated from vectors with only 3- or 6-nt homology in the R region were significantly lower. Because expression and packaging of the RNA were similar among all the vectors, the differences in the viral titers most likely reflected the impact of the homology lengths on the efficiency of minus-strand DNA transfer. The molecular nature of minus-strand DNA transfer was characterized in 63 proviruses. Precise R-to-R transfer was observed in most proviruses generated from vectors with 12-, 24-, or 69-nt homology in R, whereas aberrant transfers were predominantly used to generate proviruses from vectors with 3- or 6-nt homology. Reverse transcription using RNA transcribed from an upstream promoter, termed read-in RNA transcripts, resulted in most of the aberrant transfers. These data demonstrate that minus-strand DNA transfer is homology driven and a minimum homology length is required for accurate and efficient minus-strand DNA transfer.","['Dang, Q', 'Hu, W S']","['Dang Q', 'Hu WS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Virus Replication']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jan;75(2):809-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.2.809-820.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.2.809-820.2001 [doi]'],PMC113977,,['R29CA58345-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown that soluble forms of the chicken and quail Tva receptor (sTva), expressed from genes delivered by retroviral vectors, block ALV(A) infection of cultured chicken cells ( approximately 200-fold antiviral effect) and chickens (>98% of the birds were not infected). We hypothesized that inhibition of viral replication by sTva would select virus variants with mutations in the surface glycoprotein (SU) that altered the binding affinity of the subgroup A SU for the sTva protein and/or altered the normal receptor usage of the virus. Virus propagation in the presence of quail sTva-mIgG, the quail Tva extracellular region fused to the constant region of the mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) protein, identified viruses with three mutations in the subgroup A hr1 region of SU, E149K, Y142N, and Y142N/E149K. These mutations reduced the binding affinity of the subgroup A envelope glycoproteins for quail sTva-mIgG (32-, 324-, and 4,739-fold, respectively) but did not alter their binding affinity for chicken sTva-mIgG. The ALV(A) mutants efficiently infected cells expressing the chicken Tva receptor but were 2-fold (E149K), 10-fold (Y142N), and 600-fold (Y142N/E149K) less efficient at infecting cells expressing the quail Tva receptor. These mutations identify key determinants of the interaction between the ALV(A) glycoproteins and the Tva receptor. We also conclude from these results that, at least for the wild-type and variant ALV(A)s tested, the receptor binding affinity was directly related to infection efficiency.","['Holmen, S L', 'Melder, D C', 'Federspiel, M J']","['Holmen SL', 'Melder DC', 'Federspiel MJ']","['Molecular Medicine Program, Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Tva receptor)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Avian Leukosis/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Avian Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Quail', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jan;75(2):726-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.2.726-737.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.2.726-737.2001 [doi]'],PMC113969,,"['T32 CA075926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA75926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Immunization with a live attenuated vaccine virus prior to challenge protected all three types of cytokine-deficient mice from viremia and high levels of spleen virus despite the finding that the vaccinated IFN-gamma-deficient mice were unable to class switch from immunoglobulin M (IgM) to IgG virus-neutralizing antibodies.

The lipase contains two cysteine residues which form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Variant lipases with either one or both cysteines replaced by serines showed severely reduced levels of extracellular lipase activity, indicating the importance of the disulfide bond for secretion of lipase through the outer membrane. Wild-type and variant lipase genes fused to the signal sequence of pectate lyase from Erwinia carotovora were expressed in Escherichia coli, denatured by treatment with urea, and subsequently refolded in vitro. Enzymatically active lipase was obtained irrespective of the presence or absence of the disulfide bond, suggesting that the disulfide bond is required neither for correct folding nor for the interaction with the lipase-specific foldase. However, cysteine-to-serine variants were more readily denatured by treatment at elevated temperatures and more susceptible to proteolytic degradation by cell lysates of P. aeruginosa. These results indicate a stabilizing function of the disulfide bond for the active conformation of lipase. This conclusion was supported by the finding that the disulfide bond function could partly be substituted by a salt bridge constructed by changing the two cysteine residues to arginine and aspartate, respectively.","['Liebeton, K', 'Zacharias, A', 'Jaeger, K E']","['Liebeton K', 'Zacharias A', 'Jaeger KE']","['Lehrstuhl fur Biologie der Mikroorganismen, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Bacteriol,Journal of bacteriology,2985120R,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 3.1.1.3 (Lipase)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cysteine/genetics', '*Disulfides', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipase/*metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', '*Proteins', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*enzymology', 'Serine/genetics']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Bacteriol. 2001 Jan;183(2):597-603. doi: 10.1128/JB.183.2.597-603.2001.,,['10.1128/JB.183.2.597-603.2001 [doi]'],PMC94915,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Lacrimal gland specimens from five patients who had dry eye as part of the symptoms of chronic GVHD were examined by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. Lacrimal gland specimens from five patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) were used as control samples. RESULTS: Lymphocytes, predominantly T cells, were found primarily in the periductal areas of the lacrimal gland from patients with chronic GVHD, whereas B cells were the dominant infiltrating cells in the acinar areas of the lacrimal gland from patients with SS. Notable findings in the lacrimal gland from patients with chronic GVHD were marked fibrosis of the glandular interstitium and an increase in the number of CD34(+) stromal fibroblasts. These findings were more prominent in patients with severe dry eye than in those with mild dry eye. Electron microscopic observations of the lacrimal gland from patients with chronic GVHD revealed that stromal fibroblasts were attached to various inflammatory cells, especially T cells, through primitive or rudimentary contacts. In addition, the presence of a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum in the fibroblasts and newly synthesized collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix indicated an active production of extracellular matrix components. Electron micrographs revealed multilayered and thickened basal laminae of blood vessels, ducts, and lobules in the lacrimal gland of patients with chronic GVHD; however, these observations were infrequently observed in the lacrimal glands of patients with SS. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest substantial differences in the lacrimal gland histopathology of patients with chronic GVHD and SS. In addition, it is likely that stromal fibroblasts are actively involved in the pathogenic process of chronic GVHD in the lacrimal gland by producing excessive extracellular matrix components.","['Ogawa, Y', 'Yamazaki, K', 'Kuwana, M', 'Mashima, Y', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Ishida, S', 'Toda, I', 'Oguchi, Y', 'Tsubota, K', 'Okamoto, S', 'Kawakami, Y']","['Ogawa Y', 'Yamazaki K', 'Kuwana M', 'Mashima Y', 'Nakamura Y', 'Ishida S', 'Toda I', 'Oguchi Y', 'Tsubota K', 'Okamoto S', 'Kawakami Y']","['Departments of Ophthalmology and.

It was previously shown that expression of Bcr-Abl in bone marrow cells by retroviral transduction efficiently induces a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) in mice resembling human CML. This in vivo experimental system allows the direct determination of the effect of specific domains of Bcr-Abl, or specific signaling pathways, on the complex in vivo pathogenesis of CML. In this report, the function of the SH2 domain of Bcr-Abl in the pathogenesis of CML is examined using this murine model. It was found that the Bcr-Abl SH2 mutants retain the ability to induce a fatal MPD but with an extended latency compared with wild type (wt) Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, in contrast to wt Bcr-Abl-induced disease, which is rapid and monophasic, the disease caused by the Bcr-Abl SH2 mutants is biphasic, consisting of an initial B-lymphocyte expansion followed by a fatal myeloid proliferation. The B-lymphoid expansion was diminished in mixing experiments with bcr-abl/DeltaSH2 and wt bcr-abl cells, suggesting that the Bcr-Abl-induced MPD suppresses B-lymphoid expansion.","['Zhang, X', 'Wong, R', 'Hao, S X', 'Pear, W S', 'Ren, R']","['Zhang X', 'Wong R', 'Hao SX', 'Pear WS', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Department of Biochemistry, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/chemically induced/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/chemically induced/etiology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/chemically induced/*etiology/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/methods', 'Retroviridae', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'src Homology Domains/genetics/*physiology']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jan 1;97(1):277-87. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.1.277.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.1.277 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)48138-8 [pii]']",,,['R01CA7757001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We examined 8 precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas (T-LBLs) and found significant BCL-6 expression in 4 cases. Three of the BCL-6(+) cases expressed a common thymocyte phenotype (CD4(+), CD8(+)), and one expressed a precursor thymocyte phenotype (CD4(-), CD8(-)). In 6 cases evaluated, including those expressing BCL-6, molecular analyses demonstrated a germline configuration of the BCL-6 gene and a wild-type BCL-6 gene first exon-intron boundary region. We also evaluated 12 normal prenatal and postnatal thymuses for BCL-6 protein. BCL-6 was expressed by most cortical thymocytes and by scattered medullary thymocytes. BCL-6(+) cortical and medullary thymocytes also expressed CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, or CD8. We further analyzed the pattern of BCL-2 and BCL-X(L) expression and their coexpression with BCL-6 in normal thymus and T-LBL and compared it to that of follicle centers of reactive lymph nodes and follicular lymphoma. BCL-6(+) cortical thymocytes coexpressed BCL-X(L) but not BCL-2. All 4 BCL-6(+) T-LBLs and 4 BCL-6(-) T-LBLs coexpressed BCL-2 and BCL-X(L). Conceivably, T-LBLs may arise through clonal expansion of cortical thymocytes normally expressing the BCL-6 protein. The pattern of BCL-6, BCL-2, and BCL-X(L) expression in cortical thymocytes is highly reminiscent of germinal centers, and the abnormal coexpression of BCL-2, BCL-X(L), and BCL-6 in T-LBL is analogous to coexpression in follicle center cell lymphomas, suggesting that coexpression of these anti-apoptotic genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of T-LBL.","['Hyjek, E', 'Chadburn, A', 'Liu, Y F', 'Cesarman, E', 'Knowles, D M']","['Hyjek E', 'Chadburn A', 'Liu YF', 'Cesarman E', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Pathology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetus/chemistry/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/etiology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Thymus Gland/chemistry/*embryology/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jan 1;97(1):270-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.1.270.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.1.270 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)48137-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate this possibility, this study examined the effect of As(2)O(3) on tRA-induced differentiation and, conversely, the effect of tRA on As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. As(2)O(3) at subapoptotic concentrations (0.5 microM) decreased tRA-induced differentiation in NB4 cells but synergized with atRA to induce differentiation in tRA-resistant NB4 subclones MR-2 and R4 cells as measured by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and tRA-inducible genes (TTGII, RARbeta, RIG-E). tRA cleaved PML-RARalpha into distinct fragments in NB4 but not in tRA-resistant MR-2 or R4 cells, whereas As(2)O(3) completely degraded PML-RARalpha in all 3 cell lines. As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis was decreased by tRA pretreatment of NB4 cells but not of R4 cells and was associated with a strong induction of Bfl-1/A1 expression, a Bcl-2 protein family member. Severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing NB4 cells showed an additive survival effect after sequential treatment, but a toxic effect was observed after simultaneous treatment with tRA and As(2)O(3). These data suggest that combined As(2)O(3) and tRA treatment may be more effective than single agents in tRA-resistant patients. Although in vitro data do not always translate to in vivo response, toxicity and potential drug antagonism may be diminished by decreasing the concentration of As(2)O(3) when given at the same time with therapeutic levels of tRA.","['Jing, Y', 'Wang, L', 'Xia, L', 'Chen, G Q', 'Chen, Z', 'Miller, W H', 'Waxman, S']","['Jing Y', 'Wang L', 'Xia L', 'Chen GQ', 'Chen Z', 'Miller WH', 'Waxman S']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029-6547, USA. jing@msvax.mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jan 1;97(1):264-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.1.264.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.1.264 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)48136-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays from 159 and 151 CLL patients, respectively, and from healthy control subjects (n = 55 [IL-6]; n = 37 [IL-10]). Cytokine levels were correlated with clinical features and survival. Serum IL-6 levels were higher in CLL patients (median, 1.45 pg/mL; range, undetectable to 110 pg/mL) than in control subjects (median, undetectable; range, undetectable to 4. 30 pg/mL) (P <.0001). Serum IL-10 levels were higher in CLL patients (median, 5.04 pg/mL; range, undetectable to 74 pg/mL) than in normal volunteers (median, undetectable; range, undetectable to 13.68 pg/mL) (P <.00001). Assays measuring both Epstein-Barr virus-derived and human IL-10 yielded higher values than assays measuring primarily human IL-10 (P <.05). Patients with elevation of serum IL-6 or IL-10 levels, or both, had worse median and 3-year survival (log rank P <.001) and unfavorable characteristics (prior treatment, elevated beta(2)-microglobulin or lactate dehydrogenase, or Rai stage III or IV). Elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels were independent prognostic factors for survival when analyzed individually or in combination (Cox regression analysis). However, if beta(2)-microglobulin was incorporated into the analysis, it was selected as an independent prognostic feature, and IL-6/IL-10 were no longer selected. In patients with CLL, serum IL-6 and IL-10 (viral and human) levels are elevated and correlate with adverse disease features and short survival. In multivariate analysis, however, beta(2)-microglobulin is the most important prognostic factor.","['Fayad, L', 'Keating, M J', 'Reuben, J M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Lee, B N', 'Lerner, S', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Fayad L', 'Keating MJ', 'Reuben JM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Lee BN', 'Lerner S', 'Kurzrock R']","['Departments of Leukemia, Laboratory Medicine, and Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.

Here, it is reported that endothelial cells (ECs) inhibit the apoptosis of B-CLL cells, as determined by 4 different flow cytometric methods, and that this antiapoptotic effect is mediated mainly by soluble factor(s), as can be deduced from the following findings. First, EC-conditioned medium (ECCM) inhibited the apoptotic rate in B-CLL to approximately 50% of control. Second, the antiapoptotic effect mediated by EC/B-CLL cell contact was more apparent than real; using a fluorescence-based phagocytosis assay, it was demonstrated that this effect was due to the phagocytic capacity of ECs, which internalized apoptotic cells. Third, the protective effect of ECCM was associated neither with proliferation nor differentiation signals. Fourth, the survival factor was a dimeric form of IL-6 because anti-IL-6 antibodies completely neutralized the antiapoptotic effect mediated not only by the crude ECCM but also by the 45- to 55-kd active fractions obtained after gel filtration, which contained high levels of IL-6. These IL-6 dimers (IL-6(D)) were noncovalently associated. Sixth, human recombinant IL-6(D) (hrIL-6(D)) inhibited B-CLL apoptosis, whereas hrIL-6 monomers (hrIL-6(M)) did not. Binding and functional competition experiments showed not only that monomers and dimers had similar affinity for the IL-6R, but also that hrIL-6(M) inhibited the antiapoptotic activity of hrIL-6(D). These data suggest that IL-6(D) derived from ECs promote the survival of B-CLL cells.","['Moreno, A', 'Villar, M L', 'Camara, C', 'Luque, R', 'Cespon, C', 'Gonzalez-Porque, P', 'Roy, G', 'Lopez-Jimenez, J', 'Bootello, A', 'Santiago, E R']","['Moreno A', 'Villar ML', 'Camara C', 'Luque R', 'Cespon C', 'Gonzalez-Porque P', 'Roy G', 'Lopez-Jimenez J', 'Bootello A', 'Santiago ER']","['Servicios de Inmunologia y Hematologia, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Dimerization', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jan 1;97(1):242-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.1.242.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.1.242 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)48133-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Liposomal ATRA (90 mg/m(2)) was administered every other day until complete remission (CR) or a maximum of 56 days. Treatment following CR was liposomal ATRA with or without chemotherapy. In an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients, CR rates were 62%, 70%, and 20% in newly diagnosed, group 1 first relapses (ATRA naive or off oral ATRA more than or equal to 1 year), or group 2 relapses (second or subsequent relapse or first relapses off oral ATRA less than 1 year), respectively. In 56 evaluable patients (receiving 4 or more doses), CR rates for the same groups were 87% (20 of 23), 78% (14 of 18), and 23% (3 of 13). Remission failure in newly diagnosed patients was not from resistant disease. Several patients in CR became polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative for promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML/RARalpha) after liposomal ATRA alone. Toxicity was generally mild, most commonly headaches (67. 5%). Eighteen patients (26%) had ATRA syndrome develop during induction. One-year survival of ITT patients was 62%, 56%, and 20% for newly diagnosed, group 1, and group 2, respectively.

A comparison was made of 3 aggressive postremission approaches for children and adolescents with AML in a randomized trial, CCG-2891. A total of 652 children and adolescents with AML who achieved remission on 2 induction regimens using identical drugs and doses (standard and intensive timing) were eligible for allocation to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) based on matched related donor status (n = 181) or randomization to autologous BMT (n = 177) or to aggressive high-dose cytarabine-based chemotherapy (n = 179). Only 115 patients (18%) refused to participate in the postremission phase of this study. Overall compliance with the 3 allocated regimens was 90%. At 8 years actuarial, 54% +/- 4% (95% confidence interval) of all remission patients remain alive. Survival by assigned regimen (""intent to treat"") is as follows: allogeneic BMT, 60% +/- 9%; autologous BMT, 48% +/- 8%; and chemotherapy, 53% +/- 8%. Survival in the allogeneic BMT group is significantly superior to autologous BMT (P =.002) and chemotherapy (P =.05); differences between chemotherapy and autologous BMT are not significant (P =.21). No potential confounding factors affected results. Patients receiving intensive-timing induction therapy had superior long-term survival irrespective of postremission regimen received (allogeneic BMT, 70% +/- 9%; autologous BMT, 54% +/- 9%; chemotherapy, 57% +/- 10%). Allogeneic BMT remains the treatment of choice for children and adolescents with AML in remission, when a matched related donor is available. For all others, there is no advantage to autologous BMT; hence, aggressive nonablative chemotherapy should be used.","['Woods, W G', 'Neudorf, S', 'Gold, S', 'Sanders, J', 'Buckley, J D', 'Barnard, D R', 'Dusenbery, K', 'DeSwarte, J', 'Arthur, D C', 'Lange, B J', 'Kobrinsky, N L']","['Woods WG', 'Neudorf S', 'Gold S', 'Sanders J', 'Buckley JD', 'Barnard DR', 'Dusenbery K', 'DeSwarte J', 'Arthur DC', 'Lange BJ', 'Kobrinsky NL']","['South Carolina Cancer Center, Columbia, SC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*standards', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous/standards', 'Transplantation, Homologous/standards', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Jan 1;97(1):56-62. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.1.56.,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.1.56 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)48108-X [pii]']",,,,"['Blood. 2001 Jun 1;97(11):3671-2; author reply 3674-5.

The SH2 domain was not required for induction of B-lymphoid leukemia in mice by BCR/ABL. Under conditions where the p190 and p210 forms of BCR/ABL induce fatal CML-like myeloproliferative disease within 4 weeks, p210 SH2 mutants induced CML-like disease in some mice only after a significant delay, with other recipients succumbing to B-lymphoid leukemia instead. In contrast, p190 BCR/ABL SH2 point and deletion mutants rapidly induced CML-like disease. These results provide the first direct evidence of significant differences in cell signaling by the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase between these distinct leukemias. Contrary to previous observations, high levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity in primary malignant lymphoblasts and myeloid cells from recipients of marrow transduced with the BCR/ABL SH2 mutants were found.

These drugs were rationally designed to bypass the thymidine kinase (TK) dependency of ZDV activation as well as to achieve spermicidal activity. We investigated the TK activity and intracellular metabolism of WHI-05 and WHI-07 in normal human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells as well as sperm. The time- and concentration-dependent intracellular formation of ZDV metabolites following addition of WHI-05 and WHI-07 to normal human vaginal, ectocervical, and endocervical epithelial cells as well as motile sperm was studied by analytical HPLC. Thymidine kinase activity in these cells was determined by the flow cytometric method based on intracellular phosphorylation of the fluorescent nucleoside, 5-amino-2-deoxyuridine-dansyl chloride and by the ability of cell-free extracts to convert [(3)H]thymidine to thymidine monophosphate in comparison to NALM-6, a pre-B leukemia cell line. TK activity of genital tract epithelial cells and sperm was found to be relatively low or lacking. Addition of WHI-05 and WHI-07 to vaginal and cervical epithelial cells resulted in their concentration- and time-dependent conversion to alaninyl ZDV monophosphate (Ala-ZDV-MP) and 5'-ZDV monophosphate as the major metabolites. Studies using motile human sperm also demonstrated the conversion of WHI-05 and WHI-07 to Ala-ZDV-MP. These results demonstrate that human female genital tract epithelial cells and sperm efficiently convert WHI-05 and WHI-07 to bioactive ZDV metabolites despite their TK deficiency.","[""D'Cruz, O J"", 'Venkatachalam, T K', 'Uckun, F M']","[""D'Cruz OJ"", 'Venkatachalam TK', 'Uckun FM']","['Drug Discovery Program, Departments of Reproductive Biology, Chemistry, and Virology, Parker Hughes Institute, St. Paul, Minnesota 55113, USA. odcruz@ih.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0', ""(5-Bromo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro-3'-azidothymidine-5'-(p-methoxyphenyl)methoxyalani"", 'nyl phosphate)', ""0 (5-bromo-6-methoxy-5, 6-dihydro-3'-azidothymidine-5'-(p-bromophenyl)"", 'methoxyalaninyl phosphate)', '0 (Dideoxynucleotides)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '365-07-1 (Thymidine Monophosphate)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cervix Uteri/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dideoxynucleotides', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genitalia, Female/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sperm Motility', 'Spermatozoa/*metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thymidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Thymidine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Vagina/metabolism', 'Zidovudine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism']",,2001/01/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/01/03 11:00'],"['2001/01/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/01/03 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2001 Jan;64(1):51-9. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod64.1.51.,,['10.1095/biolreprod64.1.51 [doi]'],,,['R01 HD37357/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 443 children treated for cancer between 1995 and 1998 at two centers in San Salvador, El Salvador, and Recife, Brazil. Median age at diagnosis was 4.9 years; 283 children had leukemia and 160 had solid tumors. Z-scores were calculated for weight for age (WAZ), height for age (HAZ), and weight for height (WHZ) at diagnosis. Z scores <-2 indicated malnutrition. Patients were also stratified by low-risk disease (solid tumors: stage I, stage II, or localized; acute lymphocytic leukemia: white blood cell count <25,000/microL, no central nervous system involvement, no mediastinal mass and age >1 and <10 yrs) and high-risk disease (all other patients, including those with acute or chronic myelocytic leukemia). RESULTS: Z-scores indicated malnutrition in 23.5% (WAZ), 22.8% (HAZ), and 15.7% (WHZ) of patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1994 and December 1996, 153 children of El Salvador had newly diagnosed ALL treated in a collaborative program between Hospital Benjamin Bloom and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH). Therapy was based on a modified SJCRH protocol, with uniform remission induction (prednisone, vincristine, L-asparaginase) followed-up by consolidation with teniposide/cytarabine and/or high-dose methotrexate. Continuation treatment was risk-stratified: 123 patients assigned to the high-risk group received weekly rotational drug pairs, and 16 assigned to the standard-risk group received daily 6-mercaptopurine, weekly methotrexate, and monthly pulses of vincristine plus dexamethasone. High risk was defined as: DNA index < 1.16, age 12 months or younger, white blood cell count > or = 50 x 10(9)/L, T-cell immunophenotype, anterior mediastinal mass, central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, or t(4;11), t(1;19), or t(9;22). Duration of the continuation treatment was 2.5 years in both groups. The median age at diagnosis of all patients was 4.8 (range I d-17 yrs), median leukocyte count was 15 (range 1-766) x 10(9)/L, and sex distribution was equal. RESULTS: Immunophenotypes were early beta-progenitor in 79%, T-cell in 3.9%, and inconclusive in 17% of cases. DNA index was <1.16 in 80.5% and was > or = 1.16 in 19.5% of the 123 known cases. For the analyzes, patients who refused therapy (abandoned treatment) were considered to have treatment failure as of their last follow-up dates. Complete remission was achieved in 126 of 151 (82.4%) patients (11 abandoned therapy during induction). The overall 4-year event-free survival (EFS) rate +/- 1 standard error was 48 +/- 6%. The 4-year EFS rates in patients at high-risk and standard-risk were 46 +/- 7% (n = 121) and 69 +/- 15% (n = 16), respectively (P = 0.20). When patients who refused further treatment are censored, the corresponding 4-year estimates of EFS are 51 +/- 8% and 75 +/- 14%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the biology of childhood ALL in El Salvador appears to be similar to that seen in the United States. Risk-directed chemotherapy can successfully be used in developing countries, but risk factors must be carefully determined and applied.","['Bonilla, M', 'Moreno, N', 'Marina, N', 'deReyes, G', 'Shurtleff, S A', 'Downing, J R', 'Behm, F G', 'Harrison, P L', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Pena, O', 'Crist, W M', 'Antillon, F G']","['Bonilla M', 'Moreno N', 'Marina N', 'deReyes G', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Downing JR', 'Behm FG', 'Harrison PL', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Pena O', 'Crist WM', 'Antillon FG']","['Department of Hematologia, Hospital de Ninos Benjamin Bloom, San Salvador, El Salvador.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'El Salvador', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'International Cooperation', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Survival Analysis', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Nov-Dec;22(6):495-501. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200011000-00004.,,['10.1097/00043426-200011000-00004 [doi]'],,,['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Nov-Dec;22(6):490-1.

There exists a small group of T-cell lymphomas additionally coexpressing cytotoxic or natural killer (NK)-cell markers, supporting the hypothesis of a common T/NK-cell precursor and respective neoplasms. Clinically, lymphatic neoplasms of T/NK-cell phenotype are either extranodal lymphomas or acute leukemias. The clinical course of these T/NK neoplasms cannot be predicted by morphology and/or phenotype alone. However, the expression of a heterogeneous (T + NK or myeloid) marker profile or of ""early"" antigens (such as TdT, CD10, RAG1, RAG2) render them more likely to be in the acute leukemia group. We present a case of a 63-year-old woman with a bone marrow infiltrate, enlarged lymph nodes, and B-symptoms. A cervical lymph node biopsy showed a monomorphic blastic infiltrate with a T-cell phenotype, coexpressing NK markers (CD56, CD57, NK1) and B-cell antigens (CD20, CD79). To the best of our knowledge, this is a newly recognized phenotype that has not been reported before. T/NK-cell lymphomas, including blastic NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma and T-lymphoblastic lymphomas, have to be included in the differential diagnosis.

The dual-color XY, major Bcr-Abl (M-Bcr-Abl), and specific alpha-satellite probes were used for sex-mismatched HCT, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases with karyotypic abnormalities before HCT, respectively. Donor cells were found using FISH analysis in all 32 cases examined within 2 months following HCT, confirming engraftment. In six cases, however, cytogenetic analysis failed to detect donor cells due to lack of metaphases. Relapse occurred in four of the six cases in which mixed chimerism was detected using FISH analysis after 6 months of HCT. In contrast, after 12 months of HCT, no relapse was found in 24 patients without host cells. For two patients with mixed chimerism, gradual reduction of immunosuppressants or donor lymphocyte infusion resulted in the disappearance of host cells as analyzed using FISH analysis. In three extramedullary relapse cases, however, cytogenetic relapse preceded morphological and FISH relapse. These findings suggest that FISH analysis is more useful for detecting residual host cells after HCT, and the combination of FISH and cytogenetic analyses provide a more detailed evaluation for HCT patients. The results also indicate that monitoring of mixed chimerism using FISH analysis after 6 months of HCT is important for allowing the early detection of hematological relapse.","['Tamura, S', 'Saheki, K', 'Takatsuka, H', 'Wada, H', 'Fujimori, Y', 'Okamoto, T', 'Takemoto, Y', 'Hashimoto-Tamaoki, T', 'Furuyama, J', 'Kakishita, E']","['Tamura S', 'Saheki K', 'Takatsuka H', 'Wada H', 'Fujimori Y', 'Okamoto T', 'Takemoto Y', 'Hashimoto-Tamaoki T', 'Furuyama J', 'Kakishita E']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan. samtam@med.email.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Recurrence', '*Transplantation Chimera']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2000 Nov;79(11):622-6. doi: 10.1007/s002770000204.,,['10.1007/s002770000204 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These proteins are also expressed in normal tissues, where their physiological role is related to the extrusion of endogenous toxins or to secretory function in liver and kidney. The LLC-PK1 cell line is derived from normal pig proximal renal tubule and physiologically expresses low levels of P-gp and MRP. A resistant cell line (LLC-PK1/ADR) has been established in our laboratory by chronic exposure to increasing doses of doxorubicin. Cytofluorimetric analysis of P-gp and MRP expression performed by C219 and MRPm6 immunofluorescence detection showed that these cells overexpress P-gp but not MRP. The uptake of doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 has been quantified in LLC-PK1 and LLC-PK1/ADR cells and compared with data obtained using other tumor cell lines commonly used as reference for studying P-gp or MRP overexpression. P388 sensitive cells and its resistant counterpart P388/ADR cells, which overexpress P-gp and PANC-1 cells, which express high levels of MRP were used. A lower fluorescence intensity was evident with both doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 in LLC-PK1/ADR as well as in P388/ADR cells, that overexpresses P-gp, in comparison with the parental lines. The uptake was increased by a pretreatment with verapamil. Verapamil was completely ineffective on PANC-1 cells, confirming a selective effect of this inhibitor on P-gp. Propidium iodide staining, performed after doxorubicin treatment, confirmed a higher cytotoxicity of the antineoplastic drug in the LLC-PK1 cells compared with the resistant counterpart.","['Rosati, A', 'Decorti, G', 'Klugmann, F B', 'Candussio, L', 'Granzotto, M', 'Melato, M', 'Giraldi, T']","['Rosati A', 'Decorti G', 'Klugmann FB', 'Candussio L', 'Granzotto M', 'Melato M', 'Giraldi T']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Trieste, Via L.

One of these changes is that the Y8 cells do not express p53. In response to DNA damaging agents, x-irradiation and doxorubicin, both the parental wild-type L1210 (WT) and Y8 cells undergo G2/M arrest, which is consistent with cells lacking wild-type p53 function. However, Y8 cells are much more sensitive to apoptosis induced by these agents than WT cells. Previous studies have also shown that expression of certain genes involved in cell cycle regulation is different between WT and Y8 cells. Recent evidence suggests that a serine/threonine kinase is involved in the divergent cellular responses of these cells. In the present study, the effects of roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, were examined on the WT and Y8 cells. The WT cells blocked in G2/M, whereas Y8 cells became apoptotic. Apoptosis induced by roscovitine in the Y8 cells was mediated by a caspase-3-like activity. NF kappa B was activated to a much greater extent by roscovitine in the WT cells than in Y8 cells.

Chlorambucil and phenylacetic acid mustard concentrations were measured with HPLC on Day 1 and on Day 4 in 15 timed blood samples from 11 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients receiving chlorambucil therapy cycles. Bioavailability was evaluated also after the first chlorambucil doses of six consecutive treatment cycles repeated every 4 weeks with increasing chlorambucil doses starting with 0.8 mg/kg/4 days, and increased by 0.1 mg/kg/4 days cycle. Area under the concentration-time-curve (AUC) from t=0 to infinite was in average 3.2 hr* microg/ml for the first cycle, and decreased by 17% in four days (P<0.05). The mean distribution half-life of chlorambucil was 0.49 hr and the terminal elimination half-life 2.45 hr. The bioavailability of chlorambucil decreased further when 4-day treatment cycles were repeated. For the fifth cycle, dose-corrected AUC for the first 2 hr was 33% smaller than that for the first cycle (P for trend <0.01). Data suggest accelerated metabolism and elimination of chlorambucil and phenylacetic acid mustard, but reduced oral bioavailability of chlorambucil cannot be excluded. However, except for AUC, none of the pharmacokinetic parameters of chlorambucil changed significantly during the first 4-day treatment period. The maximal plasma concentration and AUC of phenylacetic acid mustard did not change significantly during repeated treatment cycles. According to this trial a dose adjustment of chlorambucil is not necessary during a short-term course, but may be necessary when treatment cycles are repeated. An average increase in the chlorambucil dose of 10% per cycle maintains similar plasma concentration of chlorambucil.","['Silvennoinen, R', 'Malminiemi, K', 'Malminiemi, O', 'Seppala, E', 'Vilpo, J']","['Silvennoinen R', 'Malminiemi K', 'Malminiemi O', 'Seppala E', 'Vilpo J']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Tampere University Hospital and University of Tampere Medical School, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Pharmacol Toxicol,Pharmacology & toxicology,8702180,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Phenylacetates)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'ER5I1W795A (phenylacetic acid)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Availability', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenylacetates/pharmacokinetics']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Toxicol. 2000 Nov;87(5):223-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0773.2000.d01-78.x.,,['10.1034/j.1600-0773.2000.d01-78.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

For the 27 samples studied after AlloBMT (26 CML and 1 Ph1-positive ALL) the time after transplantation ranged from 1 to 107 months (median 47.5 months). In 8 (22%) of the 37 samples there were discrepant results among methods. The discrepancy rates relative to other techniques were: karyotyping 17% (5 of 29), Southern blotting 18% (6 of 33), multiplex RT-PCR 8% (3 of 37), and FISH 8% (3 of 37).

The authors have developed a similar PCR heteroduplex assay for detection of clonal VDJ immunoglobulin gene rearrangements using two sets of primers based on relatively conserved consensus regions in the J(H) and framework I and 2 regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain V region gene. This method is able to detect a clonal rearrangement when the clone comprises as little as 1% of the population in a polyclonal B-cell background. It may be used on fresh, frozen, or paraffin-embedded tissue and detects a clonal population in a majority of lymphoma subtypes. Compared with conventional PCR analysis, this method requires only a short additional cycle of denaturation and slow renaturation before PAGE.

Conditioning was mainly with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (TBI) (14.4 Gy), but 5 patients received busulfan in place of TBI and 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. All patients received cyclosporin, and short-course methotrexate was given to recipients of mismatched grafts. The patient population was predominantly pediatric (median age, 10 years), but one third of the patients was aged 15 years or above. Twenty-five patients were in second complete remission (CR2), and 14 had high-risk CR1 disease (primarily failed remission induction or antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome, often with complex cytogenetic abnormalities). Both recipient and donor were cytomegalovirus seronegative in 15 of 37 cases (38%); 51% of patients were matched for HLA class I and II. Grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 24% of patients; chronic GVHD occurred in 5 of 31 evaluable patients (16%), 4 extensive and 1 limited. Relapse occurred in 5 cases (13%); 1 of these 5 patients survives, 24 months after a second unrelated donor transplantation. Two of these relapses were associated with secondary graft failure (incidence rate, 5%). All patients engrafted primarily. Severe viral infection was the major transplant-associated complication, with 12 episodes in 9 patients, 5 of them lethal. Twenty-five patients survive at a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 2-102 months), with estimated actuarial overall and disease-free survival rates at 44 months of 61% (SE 8%) and 57% (SE 8%), respectively. Nineteen patients are more than 2 years post-BMT and may be cured. The functional status of long-term survivors is excellent, with 19 of 21 patients who survive 6 months or more in full-time employment or full-time students. These encouraging results suggest that in patients lacking a sibling donor, unrelated donor BMT for AML in remission achieves survival figures as good as or better than those reported on patients with autologous stem cell transplantation, and that T-cell depletion of grafts is associated with a low relapse rate and an excellent functional status. However, only a randomized study comparing unrelated donor BMT and auto-grafting will resolve which of these treatment strategies is better for patients with AML.","['Marks, D I', 'Bird, J M', 'Vettenranta, K', 'Hunt, L', 'Green, A', 'Cornish, J M', 'Goulden, N', 'Pamphilon, D H', 'Steward, C G', 'Oakhill, A']","['Marks DI', 'Bird JM', 'Vettenranta K', 'Hunt L', 'Green A', 'Cornish JM', 'Goulden N', 'Pamphilon DH', 'Steward CG', 'Oakhill A']","[""Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Oncology Day Beds, Bristol Children's Hospital, United Bristol Healthcare Trust, UK. dmarks@nildram.co.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2000;6(6):646-53. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70031-0.,,"['S1083-8791(00)70031-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70031-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two groups were examined: 30 normal healthy volunteers and 19 patients with primary diffuse bone marrow disease (aplastic anemia [n=8], myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [n=5], chronic myelogenic leukemia (CML) [n=4], polycythemia vera [n=2]). Isolation of the signal of hematopoietic tissue was done by the chemical-shift misregistration effect. Twenty consecutive T1-weighted midsagittal lumbar vertebral images were obtained immediately after the intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight, and the pattern of the time-intensity curve, the peak contrast-enhancement (CE) ratio, and the washout rate (%/min) of bone marrow in normal volunteers were compared with those in patients suffering from primary diffuse bone marrow disease. RESULTS: The pattern of the time-intensity curve of patients with aplastic anemia showed a low peak value followed by a slow washout. However, the pattern of time-intensity curves in patients with MDS, CML, and polycythemia vera was similar to that of normal volunteers. The peak CE ratio of the water fraction in normal marrow ranged from 0.45 to 1.26 (mean +/- S.D.: 0.87 +/- 0.18). Patients with aplastic anemia showed an abnormally lower peak CE ratio of the water fraction (mean +/- S.D.: 0.34 +/- 0.19, p<0.0001). On the other hand, the peak CE ratio of the water fraction in patients with MDS was significantly higher than that of normal volunteers (mean +/- S.D. 1.35 +/- 0.39, p<0.05). In contrast, the peak CE ratio of patients with CML or polycythemia vera did not differ significantly from that of normal volunteers. The mean washout rate of patients with aplastic anemia was significantly lower than that of normal volunteers (mean +/- S.D.: 3.50 +/- 2.51%/min vs. 7.13 +/- 1.74%/min, p<0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the washout rate among patients with MDS, CML, polycythemia vera, and normal volunteers. CONCLUSION: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the water fraction provides additional valuable qualitative information about structural changes of the hematopoietic element.","['Katsuya, T', 'Inoue, T', 'Ishizaka, H', 'Aoki, J', 'Endo, K']","['Katsuya T', 'Inoue T', 'Ishizaka H', 'Aoki J', 'Endo K']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Radiat Med,Radiation medicine,8412264,"['0 (Contrast Media)', 'K2I13DR72L (Gadolinium DTPA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/pathology', '*Body Water', 'Bone Marrow/*anatomy & histology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*pathology', 'Child', '*Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Gadolinium DTPA', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/pathology', 'Spinal Diseases/*pathology', 'Spine/*anatomy & histology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Med. 2000 Sep-Oct;18(5):291-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The small lymphocytic lymphoma component exhibited a typical CD20+, CD5+, and CD23+ immunophenotype. The dendritic cell neoplasm exhibited reactivity with CNA-42, but nonreactivity for CD21, CD35, smooth muscle actin, desmin, and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Equivocal cytoplasmic staining was seen for S100p, CD68, and Factor XIIIa. Ultrastructurally, the dendritic cell neoplasm exhibited desmosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, and intercellular collagen. Because the immunophenotype and ultrastructure did not correspond to one of the five recognizable dendritic cell subtypes, the neoplasm was designated dendritic cell neoplasm, not otherwise specified (NOS). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements performed on individual components of the composite tumor demonstrated rearrangement within the small lymphocytic lymphoma component, but none in the dendritic cell component. The lack of an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement within the dendritic cell component argues against a transformational event and supports the concept that these separate neoplasms represent a true ""collision"" or composite lesion.","['Harvell, J D', 'Fulton, R', 'Jones, C D', 'Terris, D J', 'Warnke, R A']","['Harvell JD', 'Fulton R', 'Jones CD', 'Terris DJ', 'Warnke RA']","['Department of Surgical Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305, USA. jharvell@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,,IM,"['Aged', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2000 Dec;8(4):322-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its homogeneous morphology is easily confused with lymphoma, leukemia, metastatic small cell carcinoma, and poorly differentiated cutaneous malignancies. Histopathologic diagnosis frequently requires support by immunohistochemistry. The authors investigated cytokeratins (CKs) 5/6, 7, 17, and 20 staining in paraffin sections of 26 Merkel cell carcinomas to expand the knowledge of the CK staining profile of this entity. Reactivity with anti-CK 20 was demonstrated in 23 of 26 Merkel cell carcinomas (88%). All three CK 20-negative tumors showed punctate staining with anti-keratin CAM5.2. Six of 26 tumors (23%) were positive for CK 7, a finding not previously reported. The staining patterns for both CKs 20 and 7 ranged from punctate (perinuclear) to localized (confined to half of the cytoplasm) to diffuse. Punctate CK 20 staining was seen in 17 of 26 cases but was the predominant pattern in only 10 cases. Antibodies to CKs 5/6 and 17 were each negative in the 13 cases for which these stains were performed. Both the positive and negative elements of the CK profile of this distinctive neoplasm provide additional useful diagnostic information for the differential diagnosis between Merkel cell carcinoma and other carcinomas that may simulate it. The authors note that the classically described perinuclear dotlike keratin staining pattern is not universally seen with CK 20 and that CK 7 staining may be seen in a subset of Merkel cell carcinomas.","['Jensen, K', 'Kohler, S', 'Rouse, R V']","['Jensen K', 'Kohler S', 'Rouse RV']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (KRT20 protein, human)', '0 (KRT7 protein, human)', '0 (Keratin-20)', '0 (Keratin-7)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Keratin-20', 'Keratin-7', 'Keratins/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2000 Dec;8(4):310-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to investigate the utility of CD10 in the differentiation of RFH from FL in paraffin-embedded tissue. Twenty-three cases of FL and 19 cases of RFH were evaluated after immunostaining with antibodies to CD3, CD20, BCL2, and CD10 antigens. Intensity of CD10 expression was graded. CD10 expression was present in 87% of cases of FL. Follicles demonstrated strong positivity in 70%. One CD10-positive case of FL showed equivocal staining for BCL2 and one an absence of staining for BCL2. Weaker but definite staining was present in 17%, and 13% were negative for CD10. In contrast, none of the cases of RFH was strongly positive for CD10 expression, with 26% demonstrating weak immunostaining, one case showing equivocal staining, and 68% being entirely negative. CD3, CD20, and BCL2 stained appropriately in all cases. These findings indicate that immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections for CD10 may help differentiate reactive from neoplastic follicular lesions.","['Barcus, M E', 'Karageorge, L S', 'Veloso, Y L', 'Kornstein, M J']","['Barcus ME', 'Karageorge LS', 'Veloso YL', 'Kornstein MJ']","['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Virginia at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, 23219, USA. mebarcus@hsc.vcu.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '8002-74-2 (Paraffin)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD20/biosynthesis', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism', 'Neprilysin/*biosynthesis', 'Paraffin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2000 Dec;8(4):263-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-seven CD10 immunohistochemistry positive cases showed a diffuse membranous staining pattern and two cases demonstrated a Golgi staining pattern. The fixation methods (10% neutral buffered formalin versus B5) and decalcification did not affect the CD10 immunostaining results.

A possible way for medical quality assurance.,679-85,"The Hungarian Pediatric Oncology Working Group intended to change the practice of prescribing diagnostic tests as well as to examine the possibility of introducing indicators about the time factors of medical care. A nationwide accepted protocol was established for these tests. The examined time factors were the length of elapsed time from admittance to treatment and the length of hospital stay for different reasons (diagnosis, treatment, complications). Included into this study are the new cases of 5 common groups of malignancies (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma) for a study period of 1 year. The follow-up data of 152 patients were examined; the length of survey was 1-12 months, depending on when the patients entered the study. As a continuous clinical audit, a system of survey was set up for each follow-up test, using a questionnaire about the conformity of physicians to the protocol, evaluating the principal reasons of deviation from the protocol. Using the data provided by this questionnaire, a renewal of the protocols for each disease was made three times during the whole study period. The principal reasons of nonconformity to the protocol were (1) complications, (2) the nonuse of the protocol, (3) nonacceptance of the protocol, and (4) technical problems. The authors intended to use their time indicators for benchmarking, to make a comparison possible between centers concerning the length of treatment, occurrence of complications, and delays in chemotherapy. However, the examination of the time indicators in the most frequent disease (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 73) showed inverse correlation between the number of admissions per year per center and the length of time elapsed up to the beginning of treatment. This points to a need for better cooperation in small centers at the initial phase of the diagnosis.

The first step was the establishment of an optimized and reliable mouse model. The second step was the induction of a GvL effect in an allogeneic approach to serve as a basis for further GvL experiments in an autologous approach in this mouse model.

The antileukemic activity of allogeneic human MNC as a GvL reaction and an accompanying GvHD in the mouse model was shown. Xenotransplanted ALL can be considered a clinically relevant model mimicking the human conditions and as a useful preclinical tool for the evaluation of novel immuno- or genetherapeutic approaches.","['Borgmann, A', 'Baldy, C', 'von Stackelberg, A', 'Beyermann, B', 'Fichtner, I', 'Nurnberg, P', 'Henze, G']","['Borgmann A', 'Baldy C', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Beyermann B', 'Fichtner I', 'Nurnberg P', 'Henze G']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/*methods', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Dec;17(8):635-50. doi: 10.1080/08880010050211349.,,['10.1080/08880010050211349 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A decline in the long-term sequalae from therapy is a challenge at present. Due to the high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapse in ALL patients, cranial irradiation was introduced as a prophylactic measure in the beginning of the 1970s. Cranial irradiation, however, may cause secondary malignancies in the CNS. In recent years neurotoxicities have been demonstrated to follow cranial irradiation in a large proportion of ALL patients. Because of these deleterious effects, most ALL protocols are limited to the combination intrathecal and intravenous methotrexate as the standard for CNS prophylaxis. In the 1970s, an intermediate dose was administered, while from the 1980s a high dose of methotrexate was combined with intrathecal methotrexate. The regular methotrexate dose of later years has been in the range of 5-8 g/m2. The intravenous methotrexate dose has actually varied from 2 to 33.6 g/m2. The highest dose, 33.6 g/m2, has been without intrathecal instillation. In a study from Norway, high-dose methotrexate (6-8 g/m2) was used, and only two (2.2%) of 89 ALL cases showed CNS relapse, both of reversible kind. In the United Kingdom, a randomized controlled study was started in 1990. Results published so far are based on a segment of cases characterized by standard risk and white blood cell count below 50 x 10(9); a 4% reduction in CNS relapse was found for high-dose methotrexate in comparison to those treated only with long-term intrathecal methotrexate. The use of methotrexate unalterably warrants some precautions. Rescue therapy with folinic acid is usually started 36 h after initiating the methotrexate infusion. Steps are also taken to secure adequate intake of fluids and alkalinization of the urine. Provided irradiation is avoided, neurotoxicities rarely occur. For regular high-dose methotrexate adverse effects mostly involve mucositis and myelosuppresion.","['Moe, P J', 'Holen, A']","['Moe PJ', 'Holen A']","['Children Hospital, Regionsykehuset i Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Quality of Life', 'Time Factors']",21,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Dec;17(8):615-22. doi: 10.1080/08880010050211321.,,"['10.1080/08880010050211321 [doi]', '8MFKTR2K7RXEQQPK [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum protein apoH can bind to negatively charged phospholipids and can also inhibit blood coagulation in vitro. We hypothesised that, because of its affinity for phosphatidyl serine, apoH might bind to ""flip flopped"" cells and would therefore be useful as a marker for membrane flip flop in vivo. METHODS: Myocardial tissue specimens were obtained from patients who had died within 14 days of acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of these specimens revealed that apoH was selectively deposited in infarcted areas of human myocardium of at least one day's duration. Depositions of apoH were not found in non-ischaemic myocardial tissue samples obtained from patients who died from other (extracardial) causes. In vitro experiments with the human leukaemia T cell line Jurkat, subjected to apoptosis by etoposide, showed that apoH was bound to the membrane of apoptotic cells. However, these experiments also indicated that flip flop itself is not sufficient for apoH binding. In addition, Jurkat cells that bound apoH were positive for activated complement complexes, as was also found in the human heart. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that apoH is involved in the inflammatory processes that occur in ischaemic myocardium.","['Niessen, H W', 'Lagrand, W K', 'Rensink, H J', 'Meijer, C J', 'Aarden, L', 'Hack, C E', 'Visser, C']","['Niessen HW', 'Lagrand WK', 'Rensink HJ', 'Meijer CJ', 'Aarden L', 'Hack CE', 'Visser C']","['Department of Pathology, Free University Hospital, PO Box 7057, De Boelelaaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jwm.niessen@azvu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Apolipoproteins)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (beta 2-Glycoprotein I)']",IM,"['Apolipoproteins/analysis', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement C3/analysis', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Myocardial Infarction/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'beta 2-Glycoprotein I']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2000 Nov;53(11):863-7. doi: 10.1136/jcp.53.11.863.,,['10.1136/jcp.53.11.863 [doi]'],PMC1731112,,,,,['J Clin Pathol 2001 Apr;54(4):336'],,,,,,

DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Longitudinal study of changes in body mass index (BMI) in all 98 patients treated in Scotland on treatment protocol MRC UKALL-XI who had reached at least 3y post-diagnosis in first remission. MEASUREMENTS: The influence of the following variables on changes in BMI, expressed as a standard deviation score (SDS), was tested using variable selection techniques and classification and regression trees: BMI SDS at diagnosis; age at diagnosis; gender; socioeconomic status; treatment. RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity (BMI SDS>2.0) was <2% at diagnosis, but increased to 16% at 3y. Gain in BMI SDS was significantly inversely influenced by BMI SDS at diagnosis (P<0.01) and age at diagnosis (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Obesity is common in ALL by the end of therapy, and is more likely in children who are younger and thinner at diagnosis. Excess weight gain was not readily predictable from routinely collected information available at diagnosis and so all children treated for ALL should be considered 'at risk' of excess weight gain and the target of obesity prevention.","['Reilly, J J', 'Ventham, J C', 'Newell, J', 'Aitchison, T', 'Wallace, W H', 'Gibson, B E']","['Reilly JJ', 'Ventham JC', 'Newell J', 'Aitchison T', 'Wallace WH', 'Gibson BE']","['Department of Human Nutrition, University of Glasgow, Yorkhill Hospitals, UK. jjr2y@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,9313169,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Obesity/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*metabolism/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Scotland/epidemiology', '*Weight Gain']",,2000/01/11 19:15,2001/10/05 10:01,['2000/01/11 19:15'],"['2000/01/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2000/01/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 2000 Nov;24(11):1537-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.ijo.0801403.,,['10.1038/sj.ijo.0801403 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However the precise nature of Bcr-Abl effects in primitive CML stem cells remains a matter of active debate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extremely primitive Bcr-Abl fusion positive cells were purified from patients with CML using multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of CD34, Thy, and lineage marker (Lin) expression, plus rhodamine-123 (Rh-123) brightness. Progenitor cells of increasing maturity were examined for cycling status by flow cytometry and their proliferative status directly correlated with cell phenotype. The activation status of a key transcription factor, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT-5), was also analyzed by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: The most primitive stem cells currently defined (CD34+Lin-Thy+ Rh-1231o) were present as a lower proportion of the stem cell compartment (CD34+Lin-) of CML patients at presentation than of normal individuals (2.3% +/- 0.4 compared with 5.1% +/- 0.6 respectively). Conversely there was a significantly higher proportion of the more mature cells (CD34+Lin-Thy-Rh-123 hi) in CML patients than in normal individuals (79.3 +/- 1.8 compared with 70.9 +/- 3.3). No primitive subpopulation of CML CD34+Lin- cells was cycling to a significantly greater degree than cells from normal donors, in fact, late progenitor cells (CD34+Lin+) were cycling significantly less in CML samples than normal samples. STAT5, however, was observed to be activated in CML cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no subpopulation of CML stem cells displays significantly increased cell cycling. Thus, increased cycling cannot be a direct consequence of Bcr-Abl PTK acquisition in highly enriched stem cells from patients with CML. In vivo CML need not be considered a disease of unbridled stem cell proliferation, but a subtle defect in the balance between self renewal and maturation.","['Buckle, A M', 'Mottram, R', 'Pierce, A', 'Lucas, G S', 'Russell, N', 'Miyan, J A', 'Whetton, A D']","['Buckle AM', 'Mottram R', 'Pierce A', 'Lucas GS', 'Russell N', 'Miyan JA', 'Whetton AD']","['Leukaemia Research Fund, Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, UK. a.buckle@umist.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Division/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",,2000/12/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/29 11:00'],"['2000/12/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/29 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2000 Oct;6(10):892-902.,,,PMC1949915,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive longitudinal study conducted at six hospitals that care for nearly 97.5% of all cancer cases among children in Mexico City. Study data were collected in 1995 and 1996, and were analyzed in 1999, at the National Medical Center ""Siglo XXI"" Children's Hospital, of the Mexican Institute for Social Security. Calculations of acute leukemia annual incidence rates, standardized rates, and standardized morbidity rates (SMR) with 95% confidence intervals, were obtained for each district. Morbidity trends were assessed through average change rates. RESULTS: In this study we observed an increasing trend of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) incidence in five districts: Alvaro Obregon, Cuauhtemoc, Gustavo A. Madero, Iztacalco, and Venustiano Carranza. Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) showed no significantly statistic increase of incidence in any district. AML did show a significant SMR in Alvaro Obregon district (SMR = 2.91, 95% CI 1.63-4.80). Higher SMRs were found in the south and southwest areas of the city. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing incidence of ALL was observed in five districts of Mexico City. AML incidence was the highest in Alvaro Obregon district.","['Mejia-Arangure, J M', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, A', 'Bernaldez-Rios, R', 'Paredes-Aguilera, R', 'Flores-Aguilar, H', 'Martinez-Garcia, M C']","['Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Bernaldez-Rios R', 'Paredes-Aguilera R', 'Flores-Aguilar H', 'Martinez-Garcia MC']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI (CMN SXXI), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, (IMSS), Mexico. arangurejm@hotmail.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Mexico,Salud Publica Mex,Salud publica de Mexico,0404371,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology']",,2000/12/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/28 11:00'],"['2000/12/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/28 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Salud Publica Mex. 2000 Sep-Oct;42(5):431-7.,"Incidencia de las leucemias agudas en ninos de la ciudad de Mexico, de 1982 a 1991.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A randomized, prospective clinical trial was carried out to compare the incidence of catheter-related colonization and catheter-related bacteremia using an antiseptic-impregnated CVC (n = 25) with that using a standard triple-lumen CVC (n = 25). RESULTS: All patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia (n = 28), lymphoma (n = 17) or solid tumors (n = 5). Both study groups presented with similar data in regards to age, insertion site, duration of catheterization and neutropenia period during catheterization, demonstrating a comparable risk for catheter-related colonization. Suspicion of infection led to explantation in 14 versus 15 cases. Catheter-related colonization was proven in 4 cases (16%) and catheter-related bacteremia was observed only once (4%) in both groups. Statistical testing showed no significant differences between the study and control group. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of catheter-related colonization was lower than suspected in this high-risk patient group. The use of benzalkonium chloride-impregnated CVC failed to decrease the incidence of catheter-related colonization and bacteremia in patients with a high risk of infectious complications.","['Jaeger, K', 'Osthaus, A', 'Heine, J', 'Ruschulte, H', 'Kuhlmann, C', 'Weissbrodt, H', 'Ganser, A', 'Karthaus, M']","['Jaeger K', 'Osthaus A', 'Heine J', 'Ruschulte H', 'Kuhlmann C', 'Weissbrodt H', 'Ganser A', 'Karthaus M']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents, Local)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzalkonium Compounds)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Benzalkonium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Equipment Contamination', 'Equipment Design', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,2000/12/23 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/23 11:00'],"['2000/12/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/23 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2001 Jan-Feb;47(1):50-5. doi: 10.1159/000048501.,,"['48501 [pii]', '10.1159/000048501 [doi]']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright 1999 S.

Here we show that stimulation of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast-like cells with the A3 AR agonists N6-(3-iodo)benzyl-5'-N-methylcarboxamidodoadenosine (IB-MECA; 10 nM) or inosine (10 microM) stimulates phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). IB-MECA (1 microM) also causes a >50% reduction in apoptosis caused by exposure of RBL-2H3 cells to UV light. Akt phosphorylation is not stimulated by 100 nM N6-cyclopentyladenosine (A1-selective) or CGS21680 (A2A-selective) and is absent in cells pretreated with wortmannin or pertussis toxin. The KI values of the AR antagonists BW-1433 and 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (8-SPT) were determined in radioligand binding assays for all four subtypes of rat ARs: BW-1433 (A1, 5.8 +/- 1.0 nM; A2A, 240 +/- 37; A2B, 30 +/- 10; A3, 12,300 +/- 3, 700); 8-SPT (A1, 3.2 +/- 1.2 microM; A2A, 57 +/- 4; A2), 2.2 +/- 0.8; A3, >100). BW-1433 and the A3-selective antagonist MRS1523 (5 microM), but not 8-SPT (100 microM), block IB-MECA-induced protection from apoptosis, confirming the A3 AR as the mediator of the antiapoptotic response. The data suggest that adenosine and inosine activate Gi-coupled A3 ARs to protect mast cells from apoptosis by a pathway involving the betagamma subunits of Gi, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase beta, and Akt. We speculate that activation of A3 ARs on mast cells or other cells that express A3 ARs (e.g., eosinophils) may facilitate their survival and accumulation in inflamed tissues.","['Gao, Z', 'Li, B S', 'Day, Y J', 'Linden, J']","['Gao Z', 'Li BS', 'Day YJ', 'Linden J']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908-0466, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A3)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', ""152918-18-8 (N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)-5'-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosine)"", 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Akt1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', ""Z07JR07J6C (2-chloro-N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide)""]",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Adenosine A3', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/*metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,2000/12/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/23 11:00'],"['2000/12/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/23 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2001 Jan;59(1):76-82. doi: 10.1124/mol.59.1.76.,,['10.1124/mol.59.1.76 [doi]'],,,['R01-HL37942/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Substitution of Ala for either Asp114 or Arg116, two highly conserved residues in the fingers domain of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, results in enzymes (D114A or R116A) with significant defects in their abilities to processively synthesize DNA using RNA or DNA as a template. D114A and R116A enzymes also bind more weakly to template-primer in the presence of added deoxyribonucleotides, as seen by gel-shift analysis, but retain the ability to strand transfer and accumulate smaller RNase H cleavage products when compared to the wild-type enzyme. In addition, mutant proviruses, including D114A and R116A substitutions in Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, are not viable despite the presence of processed reverse transcriptase in the viral particles.

For patients lacking a suitable sibling donor autologous stem cell transplantation may constitute an alternative. The presence of sufficient residual polyclonal stem cells and achieving a complete remission after chemotherapy forms a prerequisite for a successful transplantation. Further development of accurate prognostic classification systems will allow a risk-adapted strategy for an individual patient.","['Oosterveld, M', 'de Witte, T']","['Oosterveld M', 'de Witte T']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Centre St Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",65,2000/12/22 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/22 11:00'],"['2000/12/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/22 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2000 Dec;14(4):182-9. doi: 10.1054/blre.2000.0139.,,"['10.1054/blre.2000.0139 [doi]', 'S0268-960X(00)90139-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,

We present data on transduction efficacy and expression of the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene in human CD34(+) cells from mobilized peripheral blood (PB) mediated by a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-pseudotyped retroviral vector. Using a 1-day cytokine-mediated prestimulation, consisting of human interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, stem cell factor (SCF), Flt-3 ligand (FL), and thrombopoietin (TPO), followed by a 3-day transduction procedure, we were able to detect up to 51% CD34(+) cells expressing MDR1. Xenotransplantation of transduced cells into NOD/LtSz-scid/scid (NOD/SCID) mice resulted in a mean engraftment level of 23% (0.1 to 87%). As shown by quantitative PCR analysis, a mean of 12.7% (range 0.3 to 55%) of the engrafted human cells in the bone marrow of chimeric mice contained the MDR1 cDNA. Furthermore, enhanced expression of MDR1 above control levels was detected in up to 15% of the engrafted human cell population. Our data suggest that NOD/SCID repopulating cells derived from mobilized PB can be transduced efficiently with existing retroviral vector systems under clinically applicable conditions.","['Schilz, A J', 'Schiedlmeier, B', 'Kuhlcke, K', 'Fruehauf, S', 'Lindemann, C', 'Zeller, W J', 'Grez, M', 'Fauser, A A', 'Baum, C', 'Eckert, H G']","['Schilz AJ', 'Schiedlmeier B', 'Kuhlcke K', 'Fruehauf S', 'Lindemann C', 'Zeller WJ', 'Grez M', 'Fauser AA', 'Baum C', 'Eckert HG']","['EUFETS GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, D0200, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",,2000/12/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/22 11:00'],"['2000/12/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/22 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2000 Dec;2(6):609-18. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2000.0216.,,"['10.1006/mthe.2000.0216 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(00)90216-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoproliferative disease may present as four subtypes, including an acute adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), an aggressive HTLV-1 lymphoma, chronic ATLL, and smoldering ATLL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 72-year-old HTLV-1+ Haitian woman presented with a 2-year history of a cutaneous eruption localized to the right arm. The eruption had evolved into multinodular lesions over the past 6-7 months. Peripheral blood and cutaneous biopsy specimens were evaluated. Immunohistochemical studies for lymphoid markers were performed on the cutaneous biopsy material, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot assay were evaluated for the presence and integration of HTLV-1 within the genome. RESULTS: The biopsy specimen showed a pleomorphic T-cell infiltrate with epidermotrophism, and an immunohistochemical phenotype showing CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, CD25, CD30-, HLDA-DR+ cells. PCR and Southern blot assay evaluation showed a single clonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus within a monoclonal tumor cell population. The patient had no abnormal lymphoid forms on peripheral smear at presentation, and no evidence of other organ involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Smoldering HTLV-1-induced lymphoma is uncommon even in endemic areas. In previously reported cases, the smoldering variant was accompanied by abnormal forms in the peripheral blood and/or by other signs of systemic disease. This case illustrates that smoldering disease may be localized to the skin with no detected morphologic abnormalities on peripheral smear.","['Germain, M', 'Williams, J', 'Skelton, H G', 'Smith, K J']","['Germain M', 'Williams J', 'Skelton HG', 'Smith KJ']","['Department of Dermatology, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Skin/chemistry/pathology/radiation effects', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2000 Nov;39(11):815-21. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-4362.2000.00937.x.,,"['ijd937 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-4362.2000.00937.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The conjugate exhibited higher antitumor efficacy against Lewis lung carcinoma than DXR. Complete tumor regression followed by long-term tumor-free survival was frequently observed when CMPul-FG-DXR was administered i.v. three times at a dose equivalent to 10 mg / kg of DXR. The superior survival as well as anti-metastatic effect of CMPul-FG-DXR in comparison with DXR was also demonstrated with the M5076 murine reticulosarcoma model. Body weight loss in mice treated with the conjugate was less than that in the DXR-treated group, indicating lower systemic toxicity of CMPul-FG-DXR. Simply mixing CMPul with DXR did not enhance the antitumor activity of DXR, showing that the conjugation of DXR with CMPul is necessary for improved antitumor activity. However, no enhanced antitumor efficacy of the conjugates was observed against a non-solid tumor model such as P388 leukemia. In summary, improved antitumor efficacy with reduced systemic toxicity of CMPul-FG-DXR was demonstrated in the present study. CMPul-FG-DXR may be useful as a cancer chemotherapy agent against solid tumors and metastases.","['Nogusa, H', 'Hamana, H', 'Uchida, N', 'Maekawa, R', 'Yoshioka, T']","['Nogusa H', 'Hamana H', 'Uchida N', 'Maekawa R', 'Yoshioka T']","['Shionogi Research Laboratories, Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Fukushima-ku, Osaka 553-0002, Japan. takayuki.yoshioka@shionogi.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucans)', '0 (carboxymethylpullulan-phenylglycyl-doxorubicin conjugate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Glucans/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/prevention & control/*secondary', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy/*secondary', 'Survival']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2000 Dec;91(12):1333-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2000.tb00922.x.,,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2000.tb00922.x [doi]'],PMC5926308,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently several relevant genes have been cloned, including those encoding three major components of human telomerase: human telomerase RNA component (hTR), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), and telomerase-associated protein-1 (TEP1). Also important are genes encoding human telomeric-repeat binding factor proteins (TRF) 1 and 2. We compared 10 human malignant hematopoietic cell lines, 19 samples from patients with acute leukemia and normal granulocytes and monocytes to study telomerase activity and expression of these various genes using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In all 10 malignant cell lines with telomerase activity, hTR, hTERT mRNA, and TEP1 mRNA were expressed, while in normal monocytes and granulocytes without telomerase activity, expression of hTR, but not hTERT mRNA was detected. TEP1 mRNA was expressed in normal monocytes, but not granulocytes. Expression of TRF1 and TRF2 mRNAs was greater in the normal cells than in human malignant hematopoietic cell lines and in 16 samples of patients with acute leukemia. When differentiation of the malignant hematopoietic cell line HL-60 was induced using tumor-necrosis-factor 471 and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), telomerase activity decreased gradually during differentiation. Of the three telomerase components, only hTERT mRNA expression showed changes paralleling telomerase activity, becoming undetectable with differentiation. In contrast, initially low expression of TRF1 and TRF2 mRNAs increased during differentiation. Not only hTERT, but also TRF1 and TRF2 are important regulators of telomerase activity that represent potential targets for gene therapy against cancer.","['Yamada, K', 'Yajima, T', 'Yagihashi, A', 'Kobayashi, D', 'Koyanagi, Y', 'Asanuma, K', 'Yamada, M', 'Moriai, R', 'Kameshima, H', 'Watanabe, N']","['Yamada K', 'Yajima T', 'Yagihashi A', 'Kobayashi D', 'Koyanagi Y', 'Asanuma K', 'Yamada M', 'Moriai R', 'Kameshima H', 'Watanabe N']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Diagnosis, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan. watanabn@sapmed.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/*physiology', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2000 Dec;91(12):1278-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2000.tb00915.x.,,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2000.tb00915.x [doi]'],PMC5926307,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study some members of a series of novel pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepines potently induce apoptosis, as shown by cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, in three CML cell lines, K562, KYO.1, and LAMA 84. Induction of apoptosis by a representative member of this series, PBOX-6, was not accompanied by either the down-regulation of Bcr-Abl or by the attenuation of its protein tyrosine kinase activity up to 24 h after treatment, when approximately 50% of the cells had undergone apoptosis. These results suggest that down-regulation of Bcr-Abl is not part of the upstream apoptotic death program activated by PBOX-6. By characterizing the mechanism in which this novel agent executes apoptosis, this study has revealed that PBOX-6 caused activation of caspase 3-like proteases in only two of the three CML cell lines. In addition, inhibition of caspase 3-like protease activity using the inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk blocked caspase 3-like protease activity but did not prevent the induction of apoptosis, suggesting that caspase 3-like proteases are not essential in the mechanism by which PBOX-6 induces apoptosis in CML cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that PBOX-6 can bypass Bcr-Abl-mediated suppression of apoptosis, suggesting an important potential use of these compounds in the treatment of CML.","['Mc Gee, M M', 'Campiani, G', 'Ramunno, A', 'Fattorusso, C', 'Nacci, V', 'Lawler, M', 'Williams, D C', 'Zisterer, D M']","['Mc Gee MM', 'Campiani G', 'Ramunno A', 'Fattorusso C', 'Nacci V', 'Lawler M', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Oxazepines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2001 Jan;296(1):31-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it has been reported the biological functions of the membrane TNF-alpha as a ligand, the outside-to-inside (reverse) signal transmitted through membrane TNF-alpha is poorly understood. Here we report a novel function mediated by outside-to-inside signal via membrane TNF-alpha into the cells expressing membrane TNF-alpha. Activation by anti-TNF-alpha Ab against membrane TNF-alpha on human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) I-infected T cell line, MT-2, or PHA-activated normal human CD4(+) T cells resulted in the induction of an adhesion molecule, E-selectin (CD62E), on the cells with the peak of 12-24 h, which completely disappeared by 48 h. When wild-type or mutant membrane TNF-alpha (R78T/S79T) resistant to proteolytic cleavage was introduced into Jurkat or HeLa cells, E-selectin was induced by the treatment with anti-TNF-alpha Ab with the similar kinetics. Membrane TNF-alpha-expressing Jurkat cells also up-regulated E-selectin when brought into cell-to-cell contact with TNF receptor-expressing HeLa cells. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR analysis showed that the membrane TNF-alpha-mediated E-selectin expression was up-regulated at the level of transcription.

The rearranged 51p1 genes expressed by CLL B cells have a distinctive use of D segments D3-3/DXP4 and D3-10/DXP'1, a favored use of J(H)6, and a longer third complementarity-determining region than the rearranged Ig genes used by CLL B cells that express V(H)1 genes other than V(H)1-69. We examined the 51p1-encoded Ig expressed by blood B cells of healthy donors. In contrast to the infrequent use of J(H)4 by 51p1-expressing CLL (e.g., 4%), 36% of the rearranged 51p1 sequences from normal blood B cells used J(H)4. Furthermore, the D segment use of the rearranged 51p1 sequences from normal blood B cells was not restricted, but reflected the D segment use of nonselected IgH of normal B cells. Finally, the mean length of the third complementarity-determining region for the 51p1 genes of normal blood B cells was 14.6 +/- 4.3 (SD) codons. This is significantly shorter than that noted for 51p1-expressing CLL B cells (18.8 +/- 3.2; p < 0.0001, n = 51). This study demonstrates that the 51p1-encoded IgH expressed in CLL are not representative of the 51p1-encoded IgH expressed by normal blood B cells, indicating that CLL B cells express IgH that are distinctive from those found in the normal adult blood B cell repertoire.","['Widhopf, G F 2nd', 'Kipps, T J']","['Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Kipps TJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Palatine Tonsil', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Jan 1;166(1):95-102. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.1.95.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.1.95 [doi]'],,,"['AI07384/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

There is an exodus of normal hematopoietic cells from bone marrow at the beginning of leukemic invasion. Normal early hematopoietic progenitors (LTC-IC) are preserved at diagnosis and are much more frequent than the Ph-positive counterpart; however, PH-negative LTC-IC rapidly decline with time without a parallel increase of PH-positive LTC-IC. Therefore, probably leukemic stem cells are much fewer than previously thought. Nevertheless, a frequency of Ph-positive KTC-IC of 1/5 10(6) mononuclear cells corresponds with a remarkable tumor burden. Interferon preserves Ph-progenitors in cytogenic remitters. From these studies a new strategy for autografting patients with CML has been developed and is described here.

Expression of GMR alpha was significantly decreased on the neutrophils of five out of 26 patients and was not specific for any FAB subtype.

Decreased beta c also correlated with the degree of hypogranular neutrophil morphology and increased infection. Expression of both subunits on T cells and monocytes in MDS was similar to normal controls.

In this study, IL-10 production was observed in three out of seven human myeloma cell lines examined and five (including three producing lines) out of 10 lines exhibited mRNA expression of IL-10. The IL-10 mRNA expression was also enhanced in approximately one third of primary specimens, whereas the IL-10 receptor (R) expression was not changed compared with that of normal component marrow controls. However, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of various cytokines and their receptors showed no particular association with IL-10-producing myeloma lines compared with non-producing lines. Supplementing exogenous IL-10 or neutralization of the IL-10 signal by anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in a culture conditions did not significantly affect myeloma cell growth regardless of expression of IL-10 or its receptor (IL-10R). However, supplement of anti-IL-10 mAb caused upregulation of certain genes such as IL-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and syndecan-1 in IL-10R-expressing cell lines.

Such immune dysfunction, as demonstrated in many patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), may, at least in part, be due to altered expression of the CD3-zeta chain, which is an important component of the T-cell receptor (TCR). We speculated that impaired expression of the TCR-zeta chain would be evident in peripheral blood T cells of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and that such an abnormality would result in an increased ex vivo susceptibility to apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that, compared with normal controls, zeta chain expression was significantly downregulated in all of the T-cell subsets (P < 0.009) in more than 90% of CML patients. In addition, there was a significantly lower expression of the CD3-epsilon chain (P < 0.001) in patients than in controls. In those patients with abnormal zeta chain expression, the proportion of lymphocytes with spontaneous DNA fragmentation, as determined by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assays, was also significantly higher (P < 0.002) than controls. From all of the patients tested, it was possible to upregulate partially zeta chain expression and hence to reduce the susceptibility to apoptosis by cross-linking the T cells with interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-alpha or immobilized CD3. In addition, such cross-linked T cells showed a significantly higher capacity to proliferate than the native CML T cells.","['Chen, X', 'Woiciechowsky, A', 'Raffegerst, S', 'Schendel, D', 'Kolb, H J', 'Roskrow, M']","['Chen X', 'Woiciechowsky A', 'Raffegerst S', 'Schendel D', 'Kolb HJ', 'Roskrow M']","['Klinische Kooperationsgruppe Hamatopoetische Zelltransplantation, Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwigs-Maximilians-Universitat, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin epsilon-Chains)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin epsilon-Chains/genetics', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Dec;111(3):817-25.,,['bjh2415 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The steroids dexamethasone (Dex) and 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) both render U937 leukaemic cells resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis. In this study, we found that Dex inhibited both spontaneous and TNF-induced activation of cPLA(2). Dex had no direct effect on cellular cPLA(2) levels, but facilitated cPLA(2) degradation upon subsequent stimulation of cells with TNF. In addition, Dex increased synthesis of the endogenous cPLA(2) inhibitor lipocortin 1 (LC1). An antisense oligonucleotide to LC1 could completely abrogate Dex-induced resistance to the cytotoxic action of TNF. Constitutive LC1 levels were relatively higher in myeloid leukaemic blasts showing resistance to TNF than TNF-sensitive myeloid leukaemic cell lines. Our data suggest that Dex confers the resistance of U937 cells to TNF-induced apoptosis by upregulating intracellular levels of LC1 and by facilitating a negative-feedback loop, which is activated upon stimulation with TNF. High constitutive levels of LC1 in leukaemic blasts may protect them against immune-mediated killing.","['Wu, Y L', 'Jiang, X R', 'Lillington, D M', 'Newland, A C', 'Kelsey, S M']","['Wu YL', 'Jiang XR', 'Lillington DM', 'Newland AC', 'Kelsey SM']","[""Department of Haematology, St. Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Annexin A1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Feedback', 'Humans', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Dec;111(3):807-16.,,['bjh2397 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the prognostic significance of secondary chromosomal changes in 292 patients included in a European trial who were treated with ATRA and CT. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in addition to t(15;17) was 26% and trisomy 8 was the most frequent secondary change (46% of the cases with secondary changes). No significant differences were seen with regard to age, sex, initial white blood cell count, % of circulating blasts, platelet count, fibrinogen level and incidence of microgranular variants between patients with or without additional rearrangements. Outcome was also similar between patients with t(15;17) alone and patients with t(15;17) and other clonal abnormalities for complete remission (92% vs. 93% respectively), event-free survival at 2 years (76.1% vs. 78.1% respectively), relapse at 2 years (16.7% vs. 11.6% respectively) and overall survival at 2 years (79.9% vs. 79.5% respectively). Analysis according to the type of induction treatment (ATRA followed by CT or ATRA plus CT) or the type of maintenance treatment (with ATRA, low-dose CT or both) also failed to show any difference between the two groups.

However, the use of ganciclovir has been associated with delays in immune reconstitution and an increased incidence of late CMV disease after day +100. In the present study, 81 patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation received polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-guided pre-emptive therapy based on detection of CMV DNA by PCR on 2 consecutive weeks up to day +180. Thirty-three of the 52 high-risk patients (CMV-seropositive donor or recipient) received a total of 45 treatment episodes up to day +100. Three of these patients (5.7%) developed CMV disease, with one fatality. Twelve of the surviving 44 high-risk patients (27%) required pre-emptive treatment between days +101 and +192, but none of these patients developed late CMV disease with a median follow-up of 402 d (range 117-952 d). Antiviral therapy was stopped after a single negative PCR result with no subsequent episodes of CMV disease while patients remained off antiviral treatment. As all initial episodes of CMV DNA detection occurred within 60 d of transplantation, it may be possible to discontinue monitoring beyond day +100 in patients who have remained CMV PCR negative before this. Thus, we have confirmed that PCR-guided pre-emptive therapy results in a low incidence of CMV disease before day +100 and that discontinuing treatment on the basis of viral clearance as determined by CMV PCR appears to be safe practice.

This syndrome, termed autologous GVHD has notable anti-tumour activity in animal studies. We intended to induce autologous GVHD with CyA in patients undergoing an autologous HSCT. We prospectively studied 118 patients with miscellaneous malignancies undergoing an autologous HSCT with low-dose CyA to characterize the clinical syndrome, its frequency and clinical course, and to determine the factors affecting its incidence. Patients received CyA from d -1 through to d 28, first starting at 2 mg/kg intravenously and then orally as soon as feasible. The dose was adjusted to achieve pre-dose blood levels around 100 ng/ml. A skin biopsy was performed when a skin rash was observed. Thirty-three percent of the patients developed clinical GVHD: clinical stage 1 in 21 patients, stage 2 in seven patients, and stage 3 in three patients. Although total body irradiation (TBI) or high-dose cyclophosphamide were previously thought to be needed, autologous GVHD occurred in five out of 12 patients (42%) after a preparative regimen with high-dose melphalan alone. Autologous GVHD was significantly more frequent in patients older than 33 years, in patients who had received high doses of granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM) and in those with a diagnosis of myeloid malignancy, compared with those with lymphoid malignancies or solid tumours. A significant negative association was also found with HLA-DR6. In lymphoma patients, GVHD occurred more frequently in advanced disease than in first or second complete remission (CR1-2) patients. All other factors studied were not predictive for GVHD. In conclusion, CyA-induced GVHD is reproducibly and safely induced with doses of CyA adapted to achieve blood levels around 100 ng/ml. In retrospective analysis, there was no survival advantage for patients with GVHD.

Management of early graft failure has been problematic, as the risk of fatal infectious complications increases with the time of pancytopenia and as a second transplant preceded by a conventional myeloablative conditioning regimen has been associated with high rates of cumulative organ toxicity. For paediatric patients with early graft failure following the transplantation of highly purified major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-disparate haematopoietic stem cells, we have evaluated an immunosuppressive OKT-3/methylprednisolone-based reconditioning regimen with low toxicity in preparation for a secondary transplant of purified haematopoietic stem cells from the same donor. This report presents the results from a 4-year pilot study including six patients with early graft failure. The results demonstrate that this antibody-based regimen can be used effectively to prepare patients for secondary transplantation. Successful engraftment after a second transplant procedure was achieved in five of these six high-risk patients. The median interval between first and second transplant was 27 d (range 22-51 d), and the median time for engraftment was 10 d (range 9-13 d).

Five out of eight patients had blood T lymphocytes able to recognize spontaneously and specifically the autologous tumour B cells (proliferation assay). In these five patients, detection of cytokines by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was the most abundant cytokine gene expressed by the T cells that recognized the autologous tumour B cells. Other activated cytokine genes were gamma-interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL)-2 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, but not IL-4. This profile suggests a type 1 anti-B-CLL T-cell response. CD80 and CD54 were relatively downregulated on the native tumour B cells compared with control normal B cells. Upregulation of CD80 on the leukaemic cells was mandatory for the induction of such a specific T-cell response. CD80 and CD54 monoclonal antibodies inhibited the specific T-cell DNA synthesis proliferation. The proliferative T-cell response was either MHC class I or class II restricted (inhibition by monoclonal antibodies). The specific cytokine gene expression could be found in isolated CD4, as well as CD8, T-cell subsets. This study demonstrated the presence of a potential natural specific CD4, as well as a CD8 type 1 T-cell immunity against the leukaemic CLL tumour B cells in CLL. A further detailed analysis of the spontaneous anti-CLL T-cell immunity is warranted that may facilitate the development of effective anti-tumour vaccines in CLL.","['Rezvany, M R', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, M', 'Rabbani, H', 'Lewin, N', 'Avila-Carino, J', 'Osterborg, A', 'Wigzell, H', 'Mellstedt, H']","['Rezvany MR', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Rabbani H', 'Lewin N', 'Avila-Carino J', 'Osterborg A', 'Wigzell H', 'Mellstedt H']","['Immune and Gene Therapy Laboratory, Cancer Centre Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Nov;111(2):608-17. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02383.x.,,"['bjh2383 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02383.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent clinical data suggest that the addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to IFN-alpha therapy can significantly improve the cytogenetic response in some patients, although the mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesized that the combination of GM-CSF and IFN-alpha induces the differentiation of dendritic cells, which subsequently stimulates a specific anti-leukaemic response. Monocytes from CML patients were cultured in GM-CSF and interleukin (IL)-4 (GM/IL-4)or in GM-CSF and IFN-alpha (GM/IFN-alpha). After 7 d, the number of cells exhibiting typical antigen-presenting cell (APC) morphology was equal in both groups, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis confirmed that the APCs generated with GM/IFN-alpha were of leukaemic origin. Phenotypically, both sets of APCs expressed typical surface markers; however, CD86, CD83, CD11c, HLA-ABC and HLA-DR expression was significantly higher in the GM/IFN-alpha APCs, whereas CD1a expression was significantly lower. In mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), GM/IFN-alpha APCs stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic T cells significantly better than GM/IL-4 APCs. However, both groups of APCs stimulated autologous T-cell proliferation equally. Finally, we assessed the ability of GM/IFN-alpha APCs to induce a leukaemia-specific cytotoxic T-cell response. Some samples generated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that specifically lysed bcr-abl-positive target cells. These data show that the combination of GM-CSF and IFN-alpha, when used in vitro, induces the differentiation of malignant APCs with potent T-cell stimulatory capacity. Although there is no in vivo evidence to support these findings, it is possible that, when administered to CML patients, GM-CSF in combination with IFN-alpha results in the generation of highly stimulatory leukaemic APCs.","['Chen, X', 'Regn, S', 'Raffegerst, S', 'Kolb, H J', 'Roskrow, M']","['Chen X', 'Regn S', 'Raffegerst S', 'Kolb HJ', 'Roskrow M']","['Klinische Kooperationsgruppe Hamatopoetische Zelltransplantation, Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Universitat Munchen and GSF (National Research Centre for Environment and Health), Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-18/analysis', 'Interleukin-4/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Nov;111(2):596-607. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02361.x.,,"['bjh2361 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02361.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Italian Cooperative Study Group on Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia.,587-95,"As it has been shown that alpha-interferon (alphaIFN) treatment modifies the survival of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients in comparison with conventional chemotherapy, a new prognostic score was devised with the aim of providing a treatment-adapted risk evaluation. We have tested the new prognostic score (the Euro score) in an independent series of 272 patients less than 56 years old with previously untreated, chronic phase, Philadelphia (Ph)-positive CML who had been assigned prospectively to alphaIFN treatment between 1989 and 1991. The Sokal score system was used as a reference. The new Euro score predicted the response to alphaIFN as the Sokal score. The median survival of low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk patients was similar using the Euro score (105, 65 and 45 months) and Sokal score (105, 76 and 45 months) but, by multivariate analysis, the Euro was more potent than Sokal for predicting survival time. The new Euro score identified more low-risk cases (59% vs. 48%) and fewer high-risk cases (9% vs. 23%) than the Sokal score. The main differences between the Euro and Sokal scores concerned age (it is more important in the Euro than in Sokal), spleen size and the percentage of myeloblasts in peripheral blood (more important in Sokal than in Euro). We conclude that the new Euro score marks an improvement in the prognostic evaluation of CML treated with alphaIFN. By comparison with the Sokal score, the Euro was more potent and identified more low-risk patients but left only a small number of cases in the high-risk group.","['Bonifazi, F', 'De Vivo, A', 'Rosti, G', 'Tiribelli, M', 'Russo, D', 'Trabacchi, E', 'Fiacchini, M', 'Montefusco, E', 'Baccarani, M']","['Bonifazi F', 'De Vivo A', 'Rosti G', 'Tiribelli M', 'Russo D', 'Trabacchi E', 'Fiacchini M', 'Montefusco E', 'Baccarani M']","[""Institute of Haematology and Clinical Oncology 'L. and A.

Although the activity of TRAIL has been studied in tumour cell lines and in a limited number of different primary tumours, its overall activity in a large number of uniform cases of primary tumours is not known. We therefore studied the activity of TRAIL in 29 primary precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) samples. TRAIL was found to have a modest activity as it killed a maximum of 29% of ALL cells within 18 h compared with killing 75% of Jurkat cells. The sensitivity to TRAIL did not correlate with the pattern of TRAIL receptor expression or FLIP expression, as determined by Western blot analysis. The CD40 receptor, which can transduce survival signals in mature malignant B cells, was less frequently expressed on ALL cells, but incubation with an exogenous soluble CD40 ligand trimer did not rescue them from spontaneous apoptosis and did not mediate their resistance to TRAIL. Further, although ALL cells expressed TRAIL protein, they failed to kill target Jurkat cells in a TRAIL-dependent manner. Our data delineate major biological differences between mature and precursor malignant B cells and suggest a limited therapeutic role for TRAIL as a single agent in primary B-cell ALL.","['Clodi, K', 'Wimmer, D', 'Li, Y', 'Goodwin, R', 'Jaeger, U', 'Mann, G', 'Gadner, H', 'Younes, A']","['Clodi K', 'Wimmer D', 'Li Y', 'Goodwin R', 'Jaeger U', 'Mann G', 'Gadner H', 'Younes A']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. clodi@ccri.uniwie.ac.at""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'fas Receptor']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Nov;111(2):580-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02404.x.,,"['bjh2404 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02404.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

MTG8 expression in normal adult tissues is limited to the brain or heart in which human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I cell-surface antigens are either not or are only faintly detectable. We hypothesized that the overexpression of the MTG8 gene in t(8;21) AML cells could act as a possible tumour antigen, which might be able to induce the immune-mediated suppression of the expansion of MRD.

We have investigated the in vitro response of P-gp-positive and -negative AML clones to FLAG and compared this with their response to treatment with Ara-C and daunorubicin (DNR). Twenty-four cryopreserved samples from patients with AML were studied using a flow cytometric technique for the enumeration of viable (7-amino actinomycin D negative) cells. Samples consisted of 12 P-gp-positive and 12 P-gp-negative cases, as measured by the MRK16 antibody. The results were analysed by calculating the comparative drug resistance (CDR), i.e. the percentage cell death caused by Ara-C + DNR subtracted from the percentage cell death, caused by FLAG after 48 h incubation in suspension culture. P-gp-positive clones were shown to have a significantly higher CDR than P-gp-negative clones (P = 0. 001). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation (r2 = 0.40, P < 0.01) was found between P-gp protein expression and CDR. However, P-gp function, measured using cyclosporin modulation of rhodamine 123 (R123) uptake, was not associated with the CDR, demonstrating that there are other properties of P-gp, besides its role in drug efflux, that modulate the responsiveness of AML blasts to chemotherapy. These results are consistent with a potential benefit for FLAG in P-gp-positive AML, but not P-gp-negative AML, compared with standard anthracycline and Ara-C therapy.","['Higashi, Y', 'Turzanski, J', 'Pallis, M', 'Russell, N H']","['Higashi Y', 'Turzanski J', 'Pallis M', 'Russell NH']","['Division of Haematology, University of Nottingham and Nottingham City Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'FLAG protocol']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Death', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Nov;111(2):565-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02354.x.,,"['bjh2354 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02354.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it has been suggested that exogenous ceramide induces apoptosis of keratinocytes, which is similar to their effect on other cell types, such as leukaemia cells, only a few studies have reported ceramide-induced apoptosis of keratinocytes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ceramide induces apoptosis of keratinocytes, we used the synthetic ceramide analogue, C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine) and a human squamous cell carcinoma cell line, HSC-I. METHODS: We treated HSC-I cells with C2-ceramide, followed by a viability assay, morphological observations, nick end-labelling (TUNEL), DNA electrophoresis, and electron microscopy. RESULTS: In the viability assay, C2-ceramide was toxic to HSC-I cells in a dose-dependent manner. Manifestations of apoptotic morphology occurred in the ceramide-treated cells, whereas these morphological changes did not occur in cells treated with dihydroceramide (N-acetylsphinganine). TUNEL revealed that many of the ceramide-treated cells showed positive reactivity. DNA electrophoresis demonstrated that C2-ceramide caused internucleosomal fragmentation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Electron microscopy revealed that the ceramide-treated cells manifested morphological characteristics typical of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrate that C2-ceramide induces apoptosis of transformed human keratinocytes, whereas C2-dihydroceramide does not have such an effect. The fact that ceramide induces apoptosis of keratinocyctes raises the possibility that intracellular ceramide, which is increased with differentiation of the epidermis, might be involved in terminal differentiation, a specialized form of apoptosis of keratinocytes.","['Sugiki, H', 'Hozumi, Y', 'Maeshima, H', 'Katagata, Y', 'Mitsuhashi, Y', 'Kondo, S']","['Sugiki H', 'Hozumi Y', 'Maeshima H', 'Katagata Y', 'Mitsuhashi Y', 'Kondo S']","['Department of Dermatology, Yamagata University School of Medicine, Yamagata 990-9585, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (dihydroceramide)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2000 Dec;143(6):1154-63. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2000.03882.x.,,"['bjd3882 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2133.2000.03882.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study determined the presence of SV40, by amplification followed by hybridization, in 266 normal and neoplastic blood and lymphoid samples. Amplification detected SV40 in 14% of non-autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) lymphomas, 28% of AIDS related lymphoma and 16% of peripheral blood lymphocytes from non-cancerous patients. No SV40 was detected in leukemia samples. Direct Southern blotting of SV40+ samples detected no virus, consistent with less than one viral genome in ten cells. Sequence analysis of SV40 in blood and lymphoid samples found sequences distinct from laboratory strains of SV40. The presence of limited quantities of SV40 in a small proportion of both normal and neoplastic tissues is suggestive of an adventitious presence with no apparent direct role in blood and lymphoid cancers.","['David, H', 'Mendoza, S', 'Konishi, T', 'Miller, C W']","['David H', 'Mendoza S', 'Konishi T', 'Miller CW']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, 8700 Beverly Boulevard, Davis 5019, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/chemistry', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Simian virus 40/classification/*isolation & purification', 'Viremia/*virology']",,2000/12/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/21 11:00'],"['2000/12/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/21 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2001 Jan 10;162(1):57-64. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(00)00628-5.,,"['S0304-3835(00)00628-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(00)00628-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To study these mechanisms we have developed assays to measure mRNA levels in single erythroid cells. The assay involved the use of globin-specific probes, with no detectable cross-reactivity, in real-time, fluorescence-based quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). We had previously used this Q-PCR method to measure globin mRNA levels in cultures of primary erythroid cells demonstrating that drugs like hydroxyurea, 5-azacytidine and butyric acid each yielded increases in gamma/( gamma + ss) mRNA ratios, with differential effects on ss-globin levels. We have now extended this approach to measure globin mRNA levels in single K562 cells, a human erythroleukemic cell line, with and without 30 microM hemin treatment. Hemin exposure increases total hemoglobin levels by approximately 9-fold and total alpha-, epsilon- and gamma-globin mRNA levels by 1.5-2.3-fold. Single cell analyses showed initial wide distributions of each of the three individual globin mRNA levels with most cells having detectable but very low levels of each globin transcript. Hemin induction shifted the distributions to higher levels, with a tendency to residual left skewing as some cells remained with very low expression levels despite the effect of hemin in increasing expression in most of these low expressing cells. Thus transcriptional heterogeneity remains a crucial variable, even in this extensively used model of human erythroid biology, and clearly influences strongly the response to inducing agents. These methods may enable us to define better possible molecular and/or cellular models of globin gene modulation.","['Smith, R D', 'Malley, J D', 'Schechter, A N']","['Smith RD', 'Malley JD', 'Schechter AN']","['Laboratory of Chemical Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and Computational Bioscience and Engineering Laboratory, Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Cell Count', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2000/01/11 19:15,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/01/11 19:15'],"['2000/01/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/01/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2000 Dec 15;28(24):4998-5004. doi: 10.1093/nar/28.24.4998.,,['10.1093/nar/28.24.4998 [doi]'],PMC115244,,,,,,,,,,,

The complex of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) triggers dimerization of gp130 and induces responses on cells that do not express membrane bound IL-6R. Naturally occurring soluble gp130 (sgp130) can be found in a ternary complex with IL-6 and sIL-6R. We created recombinant sgp130 proteins that showed binding to IL-6 in complex with sIL-6R and inhibited IL-6/sIL-6R induced proliferation of BAF/3 cells expressing gp130. Surprisingly, sgp130 proteins did not affect IL-6 stimulated proliferation of BAF/3 cells expressing gp130 and membrane bound IL-6R, indicating that sgp130 did not interfere with IL-6 bound to IL-6R on the cell surface. Additionally, sgp130 partially inhibited proliferation induced by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM) albeit at higher concentrations. Recombinant sgp130 protein could be used to block the anti-apoptotic effect of sIL-6R on lamina propria cells from Crohn disease patients. We conclude that sgp130 is the natural inhibitor of IL-6 responses dependent on sIL-6R.

A mechanism-based strategy to sensitize such cells to this class of potent small molecule cytotoxic agents is presented. These natural products inhibit oxidative phosphorylation by targeting the mitochondrial F(0)F(1) ATP synthase. Evaluation of gene expression profiles in a panel of leukemias revealed a strong correlation between the expression level of the gene encoding subunit 6 of the mitochondrial F(0)F(1) ATP synthase (known to be the binding site of members of this class of macrolides) and their sensitivity to these natural products. Within the same set of leukemia cell lines, comparably strong drug-gene correlations were also observed for the genes encoding two key enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism, pyruvate kinase, and aspartate aminotransferase. We propose a simple model in which the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is activated in response to a shift in balance between aerobic and anaerobic ATP biosynthesis. Inhibitors of both lactate formation and carbon flux through the Embden-Meyerhof pathway significantly sensitized apoptolidin-resistant tumors to this drug. Nine different cell lines derived from human leukemias and melanomas, and colon, renal, central nervous system, and ovarian tumors are also sensitized to killing by apoptolidin.","['Salomon, A R', 'Voehringer, D W', 'Herzenberg, L A', 'Khosla, C']","['Salomon AR', 'Voehringer DW', 'Herzenberg LA', 'Khosla C']","['Departments of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, and Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligomycins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11015-84-2 (ossamycin)', '79553-45-0 (cytovaricin)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)', 'SAO6WVQ23I (apoptolidin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', '*Macrolides', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Oligomycins/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/20 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/20 11:00'],"['2000/12/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/20 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Dec 19;97(26):14766-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.97.26.14766.,,"['10.1073/pnas.97.26.14766 [doi]', '97/26/14766 [pii]']",PMC18993,,"['R01 CA066736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-0729015/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 66736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits complex IV in the respiratory chain and is reported to possess both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic actions. We investigated the effects of continuous inhibition of respiration by NO on mitochondrial energy status and cell viability. Serum-deprived human T cell leukemia (Jurkat) cells were exposed to NO at a concentration that caused continuous and complete (approximately 85%) inhibition of respiration. Serum deprivation caused progressive loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) and apoptotic cell death. In the presence of NO, Deltapsi(m) was maintained compared to controls, and cells were protected from apoptosis. Similar results were obtained by using staurosporin as the apoptotic stimulus. As exposure of serum-deprived cells to NO progressed (>5 h), however, Deltapsi(m) fell, correlating with the appearance of early apoptotic features and a decrease in cell viability. Glucose deprivation or iodoacetate treatment of cells in the presence of NO resulted in a collapse of Deltapsi(m), demonstrating involvement of glycolytic ATP in its maintenance. Under these conditions cell viability also was decreased. Treatment with oligomycin and/or bongkrekic acid indicated that the maintenance of Deltapsi(m) during exposure to NO is caused by reversal of the ATP synthase and other electrogenic pumps. Thus, blockade of complex IV by NO initiates a protective action in the mitochondrion to maintain Deltapsi(m) this results in prevention of apoptosis. It is likely that during cellular stress involving increased generation of NO this compound will trigger a similar sequence of events, depending on its concentration and duration of release.","['Beltran, B', 'Mathur, A', 'Duchen, M R', 'Erusalimsky, J D', 'Moncada, S']","['Beltran B', 'Mathur A', 'Duchen MR', 'Erusalimsky JD', 'Moncada S']","['The Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, The Cruciform Building, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology']",,2000/12/20 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/20 11:00'],"['2000/12/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/20 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Dec 19;97(26):14602-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.97.26.14602.,,"['10.1073/pnas.97.26.14602 [doi]', '97/26/14602 [pii]']",PMC18965,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequences farther 5' of these HSs are conserved in mouse and human, and both loci are embedded within a cluster of functional odorant receptor genes. In humans, distant upstream sequences have been implicated in regulation of the beta-globin genes. In this study, the role of the 5'-most HSs and their adjacent sequence was investigated by deletion of an 11-kb region from the mouse locus, including 5'HS 4.2, 5'HS 5, 5'HS 6, and the 5'beta1 odorant receptor gene. Mice that were homozygous for this deletion were fully viable, and no significant effect on adult beta-globin gene expression was seen. 5'HSs 1-4, which are located downstream of the deletion, were still present in the mutant mice. In addition, two new upstream HSs, HS -60.7 and HS -62.5, were found in erythroid tissue of both wild-type and mutant mice. Therefore, although the possibility of a minor role still exists, neither the HSs nor the other regions deleted in this study are essential for beta-globin gene expression, and it is unlikely that chromatin structure is affected either upstream or downstream of the deletion. This is the largest deletion at the mouse locus control region to show no apparent phenotype, and focuses attention on the possible contribution of sequences even farther upstream.","['Farrell, C M', 'Grinberg, A', 'Huang, S P', 'Chen, D', 'Pichel, J G', 'Westphal, H', 'Felsenfeld, G']","['Farrell CM', 'Grinberg A', 'Huang SP', 'Chen D', 'Pichel JG', 'Westphal H', 'Felsenfeld G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-0540, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromatin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Locus Control Region', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/20 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/20 11:00'],"['2000/12/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/20 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Dec 19;97(26):14554-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.97.26.14554.,,"['10.1073/pnas.97.26.14554 [doi]', '97/26/14554 [pii]']",PMC18957,,,,,,,,,,,

The beta-globin locus control region (LCR) and transcriptionally active promoters were enriched in acetylated histones in fetal liver relative to fetal brain, whereas the inactive promoters were hypoacetylated. In contrast, the LCR and both active and inactive promoters were hyperacetylated in yolk sac. Hypersensitive site two of the LCR was also hyperacetylated in murine embryonic stem cells, whereas beta-globin promoters were hypoacetylated. Thus, the acetylation pattern varied at different developmental stages. Histone deacetylase inhibition selectively increased acetylation at a hypoacetylated promoter in fetal liver, suggesting that active deacetylation contributes to silencing of promoters.

Recent clinical trials showed that LMB-2 is a promising agent for the treatment of patients with Tac-positive leukemia or lymphoma. One major side effect that needs to be overcome is nonspecific liver toxicity. In the current study, we have analyzed the mechanism of this toxicity using a mouse model. Mice that were injected with a lethal dose of LMB-2 showed severe hepatic necrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that LMB-2 accumulated in Kupffer cells in the liver, suggesting that the damage to the hepatocytes was indirect. When we examined the effects of LMB-2 on peritoneal macrophages, cells in the same lineage as Kupffer cells, we found that LMB-2 induced the production of TNF-alpha by these cells. Following LMB-2 administration to mice, the levels of TNF-alpha in the liver increased to very high levels, whereas the rise in serum levels was modest. In addition, the LMB-2-induced liver toxicity was blocked by a specific TNF binding protein (TNFsRp55). Liver toxicity was also blocked by indomethacin, which also blocked the rise of TNF-alpha in the liver. Both TNFsRp55 and indomethacin treatment protected mice against a lethal dose of LMB-2. These data indicate that TNF-alpha produced in the liver by Kupffer cells has an important causal role in the nonspecific liver toxicity of LMB-2. These findings have important clinical implications for the use of immunotoxins in the therapy of patients with cancer.","['Onda, M', 'Willingham, M', 'Wang, Q C', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Tsutsumi, Y', 'Nagata, S', 'Pastan, I']","['Onda M', 'Willingham M', 'Wang QC', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Tsutsumi Y', 'Nagata S', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B3(Fv)-PE38KDEL recombinant immunotoxin)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/metabolism/toxicity', 'Antigens, CD/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/blood', 'Exotoxins/administration & dosage/metabolism/toxicity', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/administration & dosage/metabolism/toxicity', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kupffer Cells/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pseudomonas/immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/immunology/metabolism/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/physiology']",,2000/12/20 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/20 11:00'],"['2000/12/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/20 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Dec 15;165(12):7150-6. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.12.7150.,,['10.4049/jimmunol.165.12.7150 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

More intensive treatment after CR seems to be necessary in order to maintain CR and obtain a definitive cure. In Brazil, few reports have been published on this important subject. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe a Brazilian experience in the treatment of ""de novo"" acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in younger adult patients (age < 60 years). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: University Hospital, Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, State University of Campinas, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Newly diagnosed cases of ""de novo"" AML in the period from January 1994 to December 1998 were evaluated retrospectively, in relation to response to treatment, overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). Cases with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were also included in this analysis. RESULTS: On the basis of an intention to treat, 78 cases of AML, including 17 cases of APL, were evaluated. The overall median follow-up was 272 days. The complete remission (CR) rate was 63.6% in the AML group (excluding APL) and 78% in the APL group. The 5-year estimated disease-free survival (DFS) was 80% for the APL group and 34% for the AML group (P = 0.02). The 5-year estimated overall survival (OS) was 52% for the APL group and 20.5% for the AML group, respectively (P = NS). Relapse was observed in 12/39 (30.7%) patients with AML and 1/11 (9%) with APL. CONCLUSIONS: These results are similar to those reported in the literature. However, relapse and mortality rates remain high, and a search for more aggressive strategies in order to prevent relapse is recommended.","['Pagnano, K B', 'Traina, F', 'Takahashi, T', 'Oliveira, G B', 'Rossini, M S', 'Lorand-Metze, I', 'Vigorito, A C', 'Miranda, E C', 'De Souza, C A']","['Pagnano KB', 'Traina F', 'Takahashi T', 'Oliveira GB', 'Rossini MS', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Vigorito AC', 'Miranda EC', 'De Souza CA']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Brazil', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate']",,2000/12/20 11:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2000/12/20 11:00'],"['2000/12/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/20 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2000 Nov 9;118(6):173-8. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802000000600005.,,"['S1516-31802000000600005 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802000000600005 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age of the patients is 65 years, and more men than women are affected. The overwhelming majority of CLLs are of B-cell origin. Chromosomal aberrations have been detected in more than 50% of the B-cells obtained from peripheral blood samples after appropriate stimulation with polyclonal B-cell mitogens. The analysis of sister chromatid exchange is a cytogenetic technique used to show DNA damage due to an exchange of DNA fragments between sister chromatids. In this study, lymphocytes from 22 patients with CLL-B (7 female, 15 male; mean age 64.09 +/- 7.56 years) were stimulated by a B-cell mitogen (TPA) and BrdU added at the 24 h of the culture. Metaphase chromosomes were stained with a fluorescence plus Giemsa technique after a standard harvest procedure. The frequency of sister chromatid exchange was found to be increased significantly P =.02) in patients with CLL-B (8.24 +/- 1.36 per metaphase) compared to controls (7.25 +/- 1.42 per metaphase). We conclude that the increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange in chronic lymphocytic leukemia after stimulation with a B-cell mitogen (TPA) may reflect DNA instability and defective DNA repair in these patients.","['Ozturk, S', 'Palanduz, S', 'Aktan, M', 'Cefle, K', 'Serakinci, N', 'Perkcelen, Y']","['Ozturk S', 'Palanduz S', 'Aktan M', 'Cefle K', 'Serakinci N', 'Perkcelen Y']","['Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Internal Medicine, Branch of Medical Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",,2000/12/20 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/20 11:00'],"['2000/12/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/20 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2000 Nov;123(1):49-51. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00300-9.,,"['S0165460800003009 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00300-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents an overview of the current knowledge about human exposure to benzene in the United Kingdom population based on recently published data, summarises the known human health effects, and uses this information to provide a risk evaluation for sections of the general United Kingdom population. METHOD: Given the minor contribution that non-inhalation sources make to the overall daily intake of benzene to humans, only exposure from inhalation has been considered when estimating the daily exposure of the general population to benzene. Exposure of adults, children, and infants to benzene has been estimated for different exposure scenarios with time-activity patterns and inhalation and absorption rates in conjunction with measured benzene concentrations for a range of relevant microenvironments. Exposures during refuelling and driving, as well as the contribution of active and passive tobacco smoke, have been considered as part of the characterisation of risk of the general population. RESULTS: Infants (<1 years old), the average child (11 years old), and non-occupationally exposed adults, receive average daily doses in the range of 15-26, 29-50, and 75-522 microg of benzene, respectively, which correspond to average ranges to benzene in air of 3.40-5.76 microg/m(3), 3.37-5.67 microg/m(3), and 3.7-41 microg/m(3) for infants, children, and adults, respectively. Infants and children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke have concentrations of exposure to benzene comparable with those of an adult passive smoker. This is a significant source of exposure as a 1995 United Kingdom survey has shown that 47% of children aged 2-15 years live in households where at least one person smokes. The consequence of exposure to benzene in infants is more significant than for children or adults owing to their lower body weight, resulting in a higher daily intake for infants compared with children or non-smoking adults. A worst case scenario for exposure to benzene in the general population is that of an urban smoker who works adjacent to a busy road for 8 hours/day-for example, a maintenance worker-who can receive a mean daily exposure of about 820 microg (equal to an estimated exposure of 41 microg/m(3)). The major health risk associated with low concentrations of exposure to benzene has been shown to be leukaemia, in particular acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. The lowest concentration of exposure at which an increased incidence of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia among occupationally exposed workers has been reliably detected, has been estimated to be in the range of 32-80 mg/m(3). Although some studies have suggested that effects may occur at lower concentrations, clear estimates of risk have not been determined, partly because of the inadequacy of exposure data and the few cases. CONCLUSIONS: Overall the evidence from human studies suggests that any risk of leukaemia at concentrations of exposure in the general population of 3.7-42 microg/m(3)-that is at concentrations three orders of magnitude less than the occupational lowest observed effect level-is likely to be exceedingly small and probably not detectable with current methods. This is also likely to be true for infants and children who may be exposed continuously to concentrations of 3.4-5.7 microg/m(3). As yet there is no evidence to suggest that continuous exposures to these environmental concentrations of benzene manifest as any other adverse health effect.","['Duarte-Davidson, R', 'Courage, C', 'Rushton, L', 'Levy, L']","['Duarte-Davidson R', 'Courage C', 'Rushton L', 'Levy L']","['National Centre for Risk Analysis and Opotions Appraisal, Steel House, 11 Tothill Street, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Vehicle Emissions)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Benzene/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/adverse effects/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Assessment', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Vehicle Emissions/adverse effects/analysis']",86,2000/12/19 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/12/19 11:00'],"['2000/12/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/19 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2001 Jan;58(1):2-13. doi: 10.1136/oem.58.1.2.,,['10.1136/oem.58.1.2 [doi]'],PMC1740026,,,,,,,,,,,

First, IFN-gamma had a direct inhibitory effect on virus production. This inhibitory effect was noncytolytic and, interestingly, was not associated with decreased cell surface expression of viral antigens. The second mechanism of IFN-gamma-mediated antiviral activity was an enhancement of CD4(+) T-cell-mediated cytolytic activity. We also found an in vivo role for IFN-gamma in the control of persistent Friend virus infections. Neutralization of IFN-gamma in persistently infected mice resulted in significantly increased levels of virus in the spleen, and a significant percentage of IFN-gamma-deficient mice were unable to maintain long-term control over Friend virus infections.","['Iwashiro, M', 'Peterson, K', 'Messer, R J', 'Stromnes, I M', 'Hasenkrug, K J']","['Iwashiro M', 'Peterson K', 'Messer RJ', 'Stromnes IM', 'Hasenkrug KJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferon-gamma/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",,2000/12/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/19 11:00'],"['2000/12/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/19 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jan;75(1):52-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.1.52-60.2001.,,['10.1128/JVI.75.1.52-60.2001 [doi]'],PMC113897,,,,,,,,,,,

Since PMVEC coculture induces a high level of cell cycling in human bone marrow CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and expands hematopoietic cells capable of in vivo repopulation, this system offers potential advantages for application in clinical gene therapy protocols.","['Chute, J P', 'Saini, A', 'Wells, M', 'Clark, W', 'Wu, A', 'St Louis, D', 'Blair, P', 'Harlan, D', 'Kaushal, S']","['Chute JP', 'Saini A', 'Wells M', 'Clark W', 'Wu A', 'St Louis D', 'Blair P', 'Harlan D', 'Kaushal S']","['NIDDK-Navy Transplantation and Autoimmunity Branch, Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, MD 20889, USA. chutej@nmripo.nmri.nnmc.navy.mil']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Endothelium/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2000/12/19 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/19 11:00'],"['2000/12/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/19 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Dec 10;11(18):2515-28. doi: 10.1089/10430340050207993.,,['10.1089/10430340050207993 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate extensive expression of Pbx1b throughout post-implantation development, with highest levels observed during early to mid-gestation. Its initial distribution is predominantly associated with condensing mesoderm, however, Pbx1b displays dynamic expression patterns in derivatives of all principal germ layers. In particular, Pbx1b localizes to sites of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during periods of active morphogenesis in tissues such as the lung, kidney, tooth buds and vibrissae follicles. Furthermore, BrdU labeling studies reveal that Pbx1b expression domains partially overlap with regions of cellular proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that Pbx1b contributes to multiple cellular processes during embryogenesis, which may include roles in cell-autonomous regulation as well as in the mediation of tissue interactions.","['Schnabel, C A', 'Selleri, L', 'Jacobs, Y', 'Warnke, R', 'Cleary, M L']","['Schnabel CA', 'Selleri L', 'Jacobs Y', 'Warnke R', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Mech Dev,Mechanisms of development,9101218,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Epithelium/embryology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mesoderm/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Time Factors']",,2000/12/19 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2000/12/19 11:00'],"['2000/12/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/19 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mech Dev. 2001 Jan;100(1):131-5. doi: 10.1016/s0925-4773(00)00516-5.,,"['S0925-4773(00)00516-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-4773(00)00516-5 [doi]']",,,"['CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In addition, pharmacologic amounts of retinoids have been used with some success in the treatment of a few human tumors. The chemoprevention effect of retinoids is most likely exerted at the tumor-promotion phase of carcinogenesis. Retinoids block tumor promotion by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, inducing differentiation, or a combination of these actions. Clinically, isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) significantly decreases the incidence of second primary tumors in patients with head-and-neck cancer and reduces appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. Retinoic acid has proved to be an effective treatment for promyelocytic leukemia. However, retinoid resistance limits its use as a single agent. Clinical trials are in progress to determine the efficacy of retinoids in treating other types of cancer such as neuroblastoma and breast carcinoma. The development of receptor-selective retinoids and selective inhibitors of retinoid metabolism may lead to further use of retinoids in both chemoprevention and treatment of cancer.","['Niles, R M']",['Niles RM'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, West Virginia 25754, USA. niles@marshall.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Nutrition,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",8802712,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Retinoids)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Retinoids/*therapeutic use']",113,2000/01/11 19:15,2001/10/05 10:01,['2000/01/11 19:15'],"['2000/01/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2000/01/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nutrition. 2000 Nov-Dec;16(11-12):1084-9. doi: 10.1016/s0899-9007(00)00436-6.,,"['S0899900700004366 [pii]', '10.1016/s0899-9007(00)00436-6 [doi]']",,,,['Nutrition. 2000 Nov-Dec;16(11-12):1100-1.

Both in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that apoptosis is an important mode of fludarabine-induced cell death. However, the apoptotic pathways activated are not known. The effects of apoptotic doses of fludarabine on sphingomyelin, ceramide and the production of reactive oxygen species were investigated in the chronic B-cell leukemia lines WSU and JVM-2. Apoptosis, as assessed by an increase in phosphatidylserine externalization, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase-3-like activity, was evident by 18 h after fludarabine in both cell lines. The general caspase inhibitor t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (OMe, methyl ester) significantly inhibited apoptosis supporting a role for caspases in fludarabine-induced cell death. A 2.5- to threefold elevation in ceramide levels was observed 6 h after fludarabine treatment. Concomitantly, a decrease in sphingomyelin levels was observed. Fumonisin B1 (an inhibitor of ceramide synthase) pretreatment significantly prevented fludarabine-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis. Conversely, C6-ceramide induced apoptosis in both cell lines. No effect of fludarabine on indices of oxidative stress (dichlorofluorescin oxidation and glutathione disulfide formation) were detected, although partial protection from apoptosis, and prevention of ceramide generation and caspase-3 activation, were achieved with N-acetylcysteine. These findings are consistent with the involvement of caspases and ceramide in fludarabine-induced apoptosis in WSU and JVM-2 cells. Oxidative stress does not appear to be induced by fludarabine, although the protective effects of N-acetylcysteine suggest that thiol redox balance may play a role in the apoptotic pathway.","['Biswal, S S', 'Datta, K', 'Acquaah-Mensah, G K', 'Kehrer, J P']","['Biswal SS', 'Datta K', 'Acquaah-Mensah GK', 'Kehrer JP']","['Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712-1074, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fumonisins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '3ZZM97XZ32 (fumonisin B1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carboxylic Acids/chemistry', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/analysis', 'Ceramides/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Fumonisins', 'Glutathione/analysis', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Phosphatidylserines/physiology', 'Sphingomyelins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2000/12/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/19 11:00'],"['2000/12/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/19 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2000 Nov 23;154(1-3):45-53. doi: 10.1016/s0300-483x(00)00296-1.,,"['S0300-483X(00)00296-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-483x(00)00296-1 [doi]']",,,"['ES09791/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL48035/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Transmission electron microscopy of insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus carrying the entire gag gene revealed that Pr53(Gag) is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it extensively accumulates and forms electron-dense evaginations. However, no particles could be detected either inside the cells or in the culture supernatants. With the Gag-Pro-expressing construct, we observed HTLV-I-specific cytoplasmic proteolysis of the Gag precursor, but again no particle released in the culture supernatants. Transmission electron microscopic analysis of insect cells expressing Gag-Pro polyprotein revealed large vacuoles in the cytoplasm and no budding particles at the plasma membrane. In contrast, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag polyprotein expressed in insect cells is able to release VLPs. These data showed that unlike other retroviruses, Pr53(Gag) is unable to be released as immature VLPs from insect cells. To determine whether the block in particle budding and release is due to an intrinsic property of Pr53(Gag) or the absence of essential cellular factors in insect cells, we expressed Gag and Gag-Pro polyproteins in human 293 cells. The results indicate that Pr53(Gag) and p24 capsid are released within particles into the culture supernatants of human 293 cells. We found that the myristylation of the N-terminal glycine residue is essential for Gag release. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the proper assembly of HTLV-I particles is dependent on mammalian host cell factors.","['Bouamr, F', 'Garnier, L', 'Rayne, F', 'Verna, A', 'Rebeyrotte, N', 'Cerutti, M', 'Mamoun, R Z']","['Bouamr F', 'Garnier L', 'Rayne F', 'Verna A', 'Rebeyrotte N', 'Cerutti M', 'Mamoun RZ']","['INSERM U443, Equipe Retrovirus et Transfert genique, Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux Cedex, F-33076, France. fbouamr@ms.cc.sunysb.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Baculoviridae', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure/virology', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Genes, gag', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Mammals', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Spodoptera', 'Transfection']",,2000/12/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/19 11:00'],"['2000/12/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/19 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 Dec 20;278(2):597-609. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0663.,,"['10.1006/viro.2000.0663 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90663-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,

In this study we investigated whether human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), another human retrovirus that is prevalent among certain HIV-infected populations, can induce HIV-1 replication in patients who had been successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. We demonstrate that supernatants from HTLV-I-producing MT-2 cells can induce in vitro replication of HIV-1 from highly purified, resting CD4(+) T cells obtained from individuals with undetectable plasma viremia. Depletion of proinflammatory cytokines from the supernatants reduced, but did not abrogate, the ability to induce HIV-1 replication, indicating that other factors such as HTLV-I Tax or Env also have a role. The HTLV-I-mediated effect does not require productive infection: exposure to heat-inactivated HTLV-I virions, purified Tax protein, or HTLV-I Env glycoprotein also induced expression of HIV-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coculture of resting CD4(+) T cells with autologous CD8(+) T cells markedly inhibits the HTLV-I-induced virus replication.

Antiviral drug treatment did not influence the rapid development of acute disease. In contrast, the presence of the HSV tk gene resulted in a faster disease progression. In addition, HSV TK-expressing viruses showed faster replication than wild-type virus in culture at low serum concentrations. Thus, HSV TK accelerates the replication of herpesvirus saimiri and enhances its pathogenicity.

We further show symmetry between PBS and the primer by the ability of the synthetic tRNA(B2) to confer escape from EC repression of a PBS-Pro vector. Of a panel of vectors with the repressed pro PBS substituted for other natural or artificial PBS sequences, all except one efficiently expressed the neo marker gene when transferred to NIH/3T3 and EC cells, hence avoiding PBS-mediated silencing in EC cells. A non-natural PBS matching an artificially designed tRNA molecule conferred no further relief from repression than that attained with the B2 escape mutant or the natural alternative PBSs. Interestingly, a vector harboring a PBS matching tRNA(Lys1.2) suffered repression similar to the wild-type PBS-Pro but was partially rescued by a single point mutation of the PBS.","['Modin, C', 'Lund, A H', 'Schmitz, A', 'Duch, M', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Modin C', 'Lund AH', 'Schmitz A', 'Duch M', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, Aarhus C, DK-8000, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Lys)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA', 'RNA, Transfer/*genetics', 'RNA, Transfer, Lys/genetics', 'Teratoma/*virology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virus Replication']",,2000/12/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/19 11:00'],"['2000/12/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/19 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 Dec 20;278(2):368-79. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0683.,,"['10.1006/viro.2000.0683 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90683-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,

To elucidate the embryonic roles of Bcl-2 family proteins, we cloned and characterized the first zebrafish Bcl-2 family protein, zfMcl-1a. Zebrafish Mcl-1a shows the highest homology to rat Mcl-1 and contains several conserved BH domains of the Bcl-2 family proteins. It also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Using EGFP reporter analysis, we verified the nuclear localization of zfMcl-1a. Deletion of the NLS resulted in distribution of the fusion protein in the cytoplasm. Northern blot analysis indicated that zfMcl-1a mRNA is 1.5 kb and was expressed in oocytes and throughout embryonic development. Notably, the expression of zfMcl-1a transcript was significantly downregulated during gastrulation. These results suggest that zfMcl-1a is a novel nuclear Bcl-2 family protein and is likely to play an important role in zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis.","['Chen, M C', 'Gong, H Y', 'Cheng, C Y', 'Wang, J P', 'Hong, J R', 'Wu, J L']","['Chen MC', 'Gong HY', 'Cheng CY', 'Wang JP', 'Hong JR', 'Wu JL']","['Laboratory of Marine Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Institute of Zoology, Taipei, Taiwan, 115, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (mcl1a protein, zebrafish)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transfection', 'Zebrafish/*embryology/genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins']",,2000/12/19 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/19 11:00'],"['2000/12/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/19 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Dec 20;279(2):725-31. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3977.,,"['10.1006/bbrc.2000.3977 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)93977-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,['GENBANK/AF302805'],

RANK was detectable in FLG 29.1 and the number of positive cells was increased by OPGL/CSF-1 treatment while reduced by calcitonin.

However, the clinical significance of CT-1 is poorly understood, mainly because there is no widely applicable specific and sensitive assay system for measuring plasma levels of circulating CT-1. We therefore developed a competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) for human CT-1 with rabbit antiserum recognizing the N-terminus region of human CT-1 and using recombinant human CT-1 as a calibrator. The assay displays no cross-reactivities with any of the IL-6 family of cytokines including IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and oncostatin M. The lower detection limit in buffer was found to be 43 fmol/ml, and the working range was 120-8300 fmol/ml (CV < 15%). This RIA directly recognizes CT-1-like immunoreactivity in human plasma with a mean value of 571 +/- 75 fmol/ml (mean +/- SD) in healthy volunteers. The RIA coupled with gel filtration chromatographic analyses showed that the major molecular form of circulating CT-1 corresponds to recombinant full-length human CT-1. Moreover, there is a significant increase in the plasma CT-1 concentration from the aorta and coronary sinus, which clearly indicates that the heart secretes CT-1 via the coronary sinus into the peripheral circulation.

We found previously that TAL1 could interact with transcriptional co-activator and co-repressor complexes possessing histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities, respectively. Here, we report that TAL1 is subject to acetylation in vivo and can be acetylated by p300 and the p300/CBP-associated factor P/CAF in vitro. P/CAF-mediated acetylation, which mapped to a lysine-rich motif in the loop region, increased TAL1 binding to DNA while selectively inhibiting its interaction with the transcriptional co-repressor mSin3A. Furthermore, P/CAF protein, TAL1-P/CAF interaction and TAL1 acetylation increased significantly in murine erythroleukemia cells induced to differentiate in culture, while enforced expression of an acetylation-defective P/CAF mutant inhibited endogenous TAL1 acetylation, TAL1 DNA-binding activity, TAL1-directed transcription and terminal differentiation of these cells.

Therefore, inhibiting CDK4/6 may be an ideal therapeutic approach for p16 (-) T-ALL. UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) is a potent antitumor agent that exerts its effects through the inhibition of CDKs. We now report that p16 protein expression status of T-ALL cells influences their sensitivity to UCN-01. In 36 primary T-ALL cells, the IC50s of UCN-01 in the 27 p16 (-) cells (43+/-52 nM) was significantly lower than that in the 9 p16 (+) cells (258+/-260 nM). Our results suggest that agents like UCN-01 may be useful as a p16-selective therapy for T-ALL.","['Omura-Minamisawa, M', 'Diccianni, M B', 'Batova, A', 'Chang, R C', 'Bridgeman, L J', 'Yu, J', 'de Wit, E', 'Kung, F H', 'Pullen, J D', 'Yu, A L']","['Omura-Minamisawa M', 'Diccianni MB', 'Batova A', 'Chang RC', 'Bridgeman LJ', 'Yu J', 'de Wit E', 'Kung FH', 'Pullen JD', 'Yu AL']","['Department of Pediatrics/Hematology-Oncology, University of California, San Diego 92103-8447, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/12/16 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/16 11:00'],"['2000/12/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/16 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Dec 1;60(23):6573-6.,,,,,"['CA28439-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79951/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

There were four silent mutations at codon 93, codon 735, codon 430 and codon 98 in KYSE190, TE8 esophageal carcinoma cells, KATOIII gastric carcinoma cells and 697 B cell leukemia cells, respectively. Two candidates of mutation were identified in TE3 esophageal carcinoma cells and 697 B cell leukemia cell line at codon 9 and codon 285, respectively.

Int-6/eIF3-p48 is expressed in all adult tissues which have been tested and early in embryonic development. Int-6/eIF3-p48 has been highly conserved throughout evolution and the deduced amino acid sequence of the human gene product is identical to the mouse protein. Viral insertions at the Int-6/eIF3-p48 locus in mouse mammary tumors result in production of chimeric Int-6/eIF3-p48/MMTV products that may act as dominant negative oncoproteins. Int-6/eIF3-p48 has also been identified as a human protein that binds to the human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax oncoprotein. The role of Int-6/eIF3-p48 in human carcinogenesis is unknown at the present time. In this study we have examined Int-6/eIF3-p48 gene status and expression in two of the most common forms of cancer in humans, breast and lung tumors. Sixty-two breast carcinomas and 78 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) were investigated. LOH at the Int-6/eIF3-p48 locus was observed in 5 (21%) of 24 informative breast tumors and 10 (29%) of 34 informative lung tumors. A reduced expression of Int-6/eIF3-p48 was seen in 23 (37%) of breast cancer samples and 24 (31%) of NSCLC samples. An association between Int-6/eIF3-p48 expression and LOH at the Int-6/eIF3-p48 locus was observed. Int-6/eIF3-p48 expression was not related to commonly used pathological parameters in breast cancer patients, while in NSCLC patients int-6/eIF3-p48 expression was mainly seen in adenocarcinomas (P<0.0001). In conclusion, our data show for the first time a decreased expression of Int-6/eIF3-p48 in a consistent portion of human breast and lung carcinomas, frequently associated with LOH at the Int-6/eIF3-p48 locus. Additional studies on larger series of tumor specimens with long-term follow-up are needed to determine whether Int-6/eIF3-p48 expression may represent a new prognostic or predictive marker.","['Marchetti, A', 'Buttitta, F', 'Pellegrini, S', 'Bertacca, G', 'Callahan, R']","['Marchetti A', 'Buttitta F', 'Pellegrini S', 'Bertacca G', 'Callahan R']","[""Department of Oncology and Neurosciences, University Gabriele D'Annunzio, Chieti, Italy. amarchetti@unich.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",,2000/12/15 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/15 11:00'],"['2000/12/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Jan;18(1):175-9. doi: 10.3892/ijo.18.1.175.,,['10.3892/ijo.18.1.175 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We studied 140 confused patients with cancer (100 prospectively and 40 retrospectively) between January 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, to determine clinical findings, causes, and outcome. RESULTS: All patients had non-central nervous system cancers. The most common primary cancer types were lung (20%), gastrointestinal tract (18%), leukemia and lymphoma (17%), and breast (11%). Median patient age was 73 years, and 49% were men. Disseminated systemic metastases were present in 50% of patients; 34% were confused at hospital admission and 66% developed confusion during hospitalization. Symptoms included lethargy or coma in 61% of patients, agitation in 44%, disorientation in 83%, lateralizing signs in 41%, delusions or hallucinations in 28%, and seizures in 9%. A single cause of the altered mental status was found in 33% of patients, whereas 67% had multiple causes. Drugs, especially opioids, were associated with altered mental status in 64% of patients, metabolic abnormalities in 53%, infection in 46%, and recent surgery in 32%. A structural brain lesion was the sole cause of encephalopathy in 15% of patients. Although delirium improved in 67% of patients, it was a poor prognostic factor for overall outcome. Thirty-day mortality was 25%, and 44% of patients died within 6 months, usually from progression of the underlying cancer. Prolonged delirium suggested infection or coagulopathy. Younger patients and those with hypoxemia or kidney or liver dysfunction were more likely to die (P<.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer usually have multiple causes of delirium, many of which are treatable, with rapid improvement in their cognitive status.","['Tuma, R', 'DeAngelis, L M']","['Tuma R', 'DeAngelis LM']","['Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Neurol,Archives of neurology,0372436,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Delirium/*etiology/psychology/therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*psychology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2000/12/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/15 11:00'],"['2000/12/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Neurol. 2000 Dec;57(12):1727-31. doi: 10.1001/archneur.57.12.1727.,,"['noc00033 [pii]', '10.1001/archneur.57.12.1727 [doi]']",,,,['Arch Neurol. 2001 Aug;58(8):1310.

We have previously reported that activation of a temperature sensitive Bcr-Abl PTK in the multipotent haemopoietic cell line FDCP-Mix for short periods resulted in subtle changes including, a transient suppression of apoptosis and no inhibition of differentiation. In contrast, activation of the Bcr-Abl PTK for 12 weeks results in cells that display a delay in differentiation at the early granulocyte stage. Flow cytometric analysis also indicates that the expression of cell surface differentiation markers and nuclear morphology are uncoupled. Furthermore, a significant number of the mature neutrophils display abnormal morphological features. Prolonged exposure to Bcr-Abl PTK results in interleukin-3 independent growth and decreased p53 protein levels. FDCP-Mix cells expressing a dominant negative p53 and p53null FDCP-Mix cells demonstrate that the reduction in p53 is causally related to the delay in development. Returning the cells to the restrictive temperature restores the p53 protein levels, the growth factor dependence and largely relieves the effects on development. We conclude that prolonged Bcr-Abl PTK activity within multipotent cells results in a reduction of p53 that drives a delayed and abnormal differentiation.","['Pierce, A', 'Spooncer, E', 'Wooley, S', 'Dive, C', 'Francis, J M', 'Miyan, J', 'Owen-Lynch, P J', 'Dexter, T M', 'Whetton, A D']","['Pierce A', 'Spooncer E', 'Wooley S', 'Dive C', 'Francis JM', 'Miyan J', 'Owen-Lynch PJ', 'Dexter TM', 'Whetton AD']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Cellular Development Unit, UMIST, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",,2000/12/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/15 11:00'],"['2000/12/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Nov 16;19(48):5487-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203940.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203940 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This would facilitate an early treatment intervention with no modification to the chemotherapy schedule.","['Hernandez, R', 'del Canizo, M C', 'Lopez, C', 'Gonzalez, M I', 'Vazquez, M L', 'Caballero, M D', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Hernandez R', 'del Canizo MC', 'Lopez C', 'Gonzalez MI', 'Vazquez ML', 'Caballero MD', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Spain. robert-69@medicosmix.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Abdominal Pain/etiology', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Rupture, Spontaneous', 'Splenic Rupture/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,2000/12/15 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/15 11:00'],"['2000/12/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2000 Nov;17(4):337-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02782201.,,['10.1007/BF02782201 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The pericarditis improved but the veno-occlusive disease continued to worsen (peak bilirubin 353 micromol/l). Tissue plasminogen activator followed by a heparin infusion was therefore administered. However, he proceeded to develop haemorrhagic cardiac tamponade that required drainage. Thrombolysis was therefore discontinued and treatment with defibrotide resumed after an interval of 48 h.

In the presence of optimal concentrations of GM-CSF (50 ng/ml) and IL-4 (40 ng/ml) CML progenitors differentiated on day 7 and 14 of culture to DC, expressing CD1a,HLA-DR and CD86 surface antigens. Mature DCs exhibited on average 12-fold higher allo-stimulatory capacity for CD4+ and CD8+ cells compared to non-cultured PBMC in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Only DCs obtained from CML patients at diagnosis exhibited bcr/abl fusion gene when tested by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). CD34-selection on leukapheresis products from diagnosis (7 patients) resulted in later maturation of DCs (after 14-15 d), compared to the nonselected PBMC. CD34-selection significantly increased the DC growth, and improved the allo-stimulatory capacity in MLR (on average on day 14, 3.5- and 2.3-fold, respectively). Large differences were observed between individual patients and different leukapheresis products from the same patient.

This glycoprotein belonging to the type I subfamily of interferons has been recombinantly manufactured and has been approved for the biotherapy of CML, now becoming the first line of treatment for CML patients in chronic phase who are not candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrowtransplantation. Interferon-alpha action involves binding to its cell membrane receptor and initiation of an intracellular signal transduction cascade. Two major pathways mediate the biologic actions of IFN-alpha. The JAK-STAT pathway leads to phosphorylation and activation of STAT 1 and STAT 2 molecules and transcription of genes like p21 and caspase-1 resulting in cycle arrest and apoptosis. The PKR (protein kinase dsRNA-induced) kinase phosphorylates and inhibits the eukaryotic initiator of translation eIF-2alpha leading again to apoptosis. The PKR kinase cascade also leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The relevance of this activation is unclearand it is possiblethat NF-kappaB has not had the opportunity to transcribe its target genes as it is a substrate of effector caspases and is maybe cleaved by them before exerting any transcription activity. Through the JAK-STAT and the PKR kinase pathways IFN-alpha is able to modify the proliferative and antiapoptotic actions of the constitutively activated kinase bcr-abl, the product of the t(9;22) translocation present in CML, and has therapeutic effects in this disease.","['Voutsadakis, I A']",['Voutsadakis IA'],"['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA. voutsi01@doc.mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology/physiopathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/*etiology/immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic']",80,2000/12/15 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/15 11:00'],"['2000/12/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2000 Nov;17(4):249-57. doi: 10.1007/BF02782189.,,['10.1007/BF02782189 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the efficacy of fludarabine with that of chlorambucil in the primary treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. METHODS: Between 1990 and 1994, we randomly assigned 509 previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia to one of the following treatments: fludarabine (25 mg per square meter of body-surface area, administered intravenously daily for 5 days every 28 days), chlorambucil (40 mg per square meter, given orally every 28 days), or fludarabine (20 mg per square meter per day for 5 days every 28 days) plus chlorambucil (20 mg per square meter every 28 days). Patients with an additional response at each monthly evaluation continued to receive the assigned treatment for a maximum of 12 cycles. RESULTS: Assignment of patients to the fludarabine-plus-chlorambucil group was stopped when a planned interim analysis revealed excessive toxicity and a response rate that was not better than the rate with fludarabine alone. Among the other two groups, the response rate was significantly higher for fludarabine alone than for chlorambucil alone. Among 170 patients treated with fludarabine, 20 percent had a complete remission, and 43 percent had a partial remission. The corresponding values for 181 patients treated with chlorambucil were 4 percent and 33 percent (P< 0.001 for both comparisons). The median duration of remission and the median progression-free survival in the fludarabine group were 25 months and 20 months, respectively, whereas both values were 14 months in the chlorambucil group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The median overall survival among patients treated with fludarabine was 66 months, which was not significantly different from the overall survival in the other two groups (56 months with chlorambucil and 55 months with combined treatment). Severe infections and neutropenia were more frequent with fludarabine than with chlorambucil (P=0.08), although, overall, toxic effects were tolerable with the two single-drug regimens. CONCLUSIONS: When used as the initial treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, fludarabine yields higher response rates and a longer duration of remission and progression-free survival than chlorambucil.","['Rai, K R', 'Peterson, B L', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Kolitz, J', 'Elias, L', 'Shepherd, L', 'Hines, J', 'Threatte, G A', 'Larson, R A', 'Cheson, B D', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Rai KR', 'Peterson BL', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Kolitz J', 'Elias L', 'Shepherd L', 'Hines J', 'Threatte GA', 'Larson RA', 'Cheson BD', 'Schiffer CA']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Chicago, USA. rai@lij.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",,2000/12/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/15 11:00'],"['2000/12/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/15 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2000 Dec 14;343(24):1750-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM200012143432402.,,"['MJBA-432402 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJM200012143432402 [doi]']",,,"['CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['N Engl J Med. 2000 Dec 14;343(24):1799-801.

The in vitro differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells is a dramatic example of tumor-cell reprogramming. We found that reentry of MEL cells into terminal differentiation is accompanied by an early transient decline in the activity of cyclin-dependant kinase (CDK) 2, followed by a decline of CDK6. Later, as cells undergo terminal arrest, CDK2 and CDK4 activities decline. By analyzing stable MEL-cell transfectants containing vectors directing inducible expression of specific CDK inhibitors, we show that only inhibitors that block the combination of CDK2 and CDK6 trigger differentiation. Inhibiting CDK2 and CDK4 does not cause differentiation. Importantly, we also show that reprogramming through inhibition of CDKs is restricted to G(1) phase of the cell cycle. The results imply that abrogation of normal cell-cycle controls in tumor cells contributes to their inability to differentiate fully and that restoration of such controls in G(1) can lead to resumption of differentiation and terminal cell division. The results also indicate that CDK4 and CDK6 are functionally distinct and support our hypothesis that the two CDKs regulate cell division at different stages of erythroid maturation.","['Matushansky, I', 'Radparvar, F', 'Skoultchi, A I']","['Matushansky I', 'Radparvar F', 'Skoultchi AI']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/13 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/13 11:00'],"['2000/12/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Dec 19;97(26):14317-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.250488697.,,"['10.1073/pnas.250488697 [doi]', '250488697 [pii]']",PMC18916,,"['T32 AG000194/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', '2P30CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32AG00194/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', '5T32GM07288-25/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the spr-2 gene in some detail. We show that loss of spr-2 activity suppresses the egg-laying defective phenotype of different sel-12 alleles and requires activity of the hop-1 presenilin gene, suggesting that suppression is accomplished by elevating presenilin activity rather than by bypassing the need for presenilin activity. We also show that SPR-2 is a nuclear protein and is a member of a protein subfamily that includes human SET, which has been identified in numerous different biochemical assays and at translocation breakpoints associated with a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Wen, C', 'Levitan, D', 'Li, X', 'Greenwald, I']","['Wen C', 'Levitan D', 'Li X', 'Greenwald I']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Helminth)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Helminth Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Hop-1 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SEL-12 protein, C elegans)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Spr-2 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Helminth', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Helminth Proteins/classification/*genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/classification/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Oviposition/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors']",,2000/12/13 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/13 11:00'],"['2000/12/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Dec 19;97(26):14524-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.011446498.,,"['10.1073/pnas.011446498 [doi]', '011446498 [pii]']",PMC18952,,['NS35556/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF321546'],

Early response to induction therapy could be an important prognostic factor in this disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the relationship between reduced blasts in bone marrow aspirate on the 14th day (BMA14th) of induction chemotherapy and treatment outcome in 198 adult AML patients of whom 124 were < 60 years old (group A) and 74 > or = 60 years old (group B). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the prognostic performance of BMA14th. Using the percentages of blasts of < or = 22% and < or = 15% as criteria for predicting treatment outcome gave the highest accuracy in terms of sensitivity and specificity in groups A and B, respectively. RESULTS: In group A, of 97 patients with a BMA14th < or = 22%, 77 (79%) achieved complete remission (CR), whereas of 27 patients with a BMA14th > 22%, 22 (81%) were non-responders (NR) (p < 0.0001).

The test sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 80.9%, respectively.

Among the different combination regimens, the association of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide has shown a considerable therapeutic efficacy, although a relevant number of infectious complications have been described, particularly in elderly patients. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy, the toxicity, and the incidence of infectious episodes of a regimen combining lower doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in elderly patients with B-CLL refractory to conventional therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty patients with progressive B-CLL with a median age of 75 years (4 in stage B and 16 in stage C) and refractory to conventional therapy were enrolled in this study. The combination regimen was as follows: fludarabine 15 mg/m2/day i.v. [max 25 mg] and cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2/day i.v. for four days. RESULTS: All patients enrolled were evaluable for response. Three out of 20 (15%) patients achieved a complete remission (CR), 14/20 (70%) a partial response (PR) with an overall response rate (CR+PR) of 85%, according to National Cancer Institute-Working Group response criteria. Three patients were considered resistant. In four out of 20 patients (20%), a severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5x10(9)/L) occurred and one of them developed an infectious complication which required treatment with systemic antibiotics and granulocyte colony- stimulating factor (G-CSF). Non-hematologic toxicity was negligible in all patients but one, who despite a adequate therapy with allopurinol and hydration, experienced a tumor lysis syndrome with transient but severe renal impairment. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The association of low-dose fludarabine and cyclophosphamide appeared to be effective in this subset of B-CLL patients, reproducing a similar overall response rate obtained with other fludarabine-based combination therapies. In addition, in this group of elderly patients, toxic side effects were negligible and infectious complications remarkably low.","['Marotta, G', 'Bigazzi, C', 'Lenoci, M', 'Tozzi, M', 'Bocchia, M', 'Lauria, F']","['Marotta G', 'Bigazzi C', 'Lenoci M', 'Tozzi M', 'Bocchia M', 'Lauria F']","['Department of Hematology, A.

Furthermore, the change of Pgp expression under cytotoxic treatment and its correlation to treatment outcome were studied. DESIGN AND METHODS: In 42 B-CLL patients, of whom 13 were sequentially monitored, expression of extracellular (MRK-16) and intracellular (C-219) Pgp epitopes on peripheral blood lymphocytes was determined by flow cytometry analysis and quantified by ratio of the mean fluorescence (RMF) in flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Median RMF values in B-CLL patients were higher than in age-matched controls. Pgp expression did not correlate with any of the hematologic features or clinical stage of the disease. Patients who received some type of cytoreductive treatment prior to the study had lower Pgp values for both measured epitopes (median RMF for C-219 and MRK-16 of 1.99 and 2.03 in comparison to those of non-treated patients: 3.11 and 2.88, respectively). In 13 patients monitored during treatment the decrease in RMF was noted after treatment with chlorambucil, with RMF values for both Pgp epitopes decreasing in responders. This was in contrast to unchanged or even increased RMF values in those patients who did not respond to therapy. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the importance of quantitative evaluation of Pgp expression by flow cytometry. At the clinical level, cross-sectional, single test evaluation of Pgp is of limited value whereas sequential follow-up values correlate with treatment response.","['Svoboda-Beusan, I', 'Kusec, R', 'Bendelja, K', 'Tudoric-Ghemo, I', 'Jaksic, B', 'Pejsa, V', 'Rabatic, S', 'Vitale, B']","['Svoboda-Beusan I', 'Kusec R', 'Bendelja K', 'Tudoric-Ghemo I', 'Jaksic B', 'Pejsa V', 'Rabatic S', 'Vitale B']","['Cellular Immunology Department, Institute of Immunology, Zagreb, Croatia. ivna.svoboda-beusan@imz.tel.hr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/12/13 11:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2000/12/13 11:00'],"['2000/12/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Dec;85(12):1261-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied all 458 patients affected by acute leukemia receiving an anthracycline-containing induction regimen in the years 1984-1989. RESULTS: Of the 458 patients, 109 (23.8%) developed pneumonia: 91 had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 18 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At univariate analysis, advanced age, AML and total blast count significantly correlated with the risk of pneumonia. At multivariate analysis, only age (p< 0.0001) and total blast count (p=0.002) retained their prognostic significance. Pneumonia responded to treatment in 67 (61.5%) patients, while 42 (38.5%) patients died. Among patients with pneumonia, 51 (46.8%) patients achieved a complete remission: 9/18 ALL and 42/91 AML. At univariate analysis, the most significant determinant of a positive outcome was the achievement of complete remission; a higher absolute neutrophil count at the onset of pneumonia, the absence of rales, a single infiltrate and the absence of microbiological demonstration of infection were also related to a positive outcome. At multivariate analysis, the achievement of complete remission and, with borderline significance, a single infiltrate maintained their prognostic value. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia remains one of the most relevant risks of morbidity and mortality during induction therapy for acute leukemia. A fatal outcome is associated, in most cases, with a failure to achieve remission of leukemia.","['Rossini, F', 'Verga, M', 'Pioltelli, P', 'Giltri, G', 'Sancassani, V', 'Pogliani, E M', 'Corneo, G']","['Rossini F', 'Verga M', 'Pioltelli P', 'Giltri G', 'Sancassani V', 'Pogliani EM', 'Corneo G']","['Hematology Division , New Hospital S.

We have developed a quantitative real-time PCR (QC-PCR) method in the LightCycler, based on the use of fluorescently labeled probes (HybProbes), to estimate BCR-ABL fusion gene transcripts in samples from CML patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-two samples (45 peripheral blood, five bone marrow, and two apheresis product samples) from nine patients with CML were analyzed. Seven patients were studied at diagnosis and during follow-up after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), whereas two were evaluated only after HSCT. The PCR reaction was carried out in capillary tubes in a final volume of 10 microL, using 2 microL cDNA, the Mensik et al. primers, and two HybProbes. The results for BCR-ABL were normalized with reference to ABL. The PCR program is completed in only 45 min. RESULTS: The sensitivity attained allowed the detection of rearrangements at dilutions of between 5-10(-4) and 10(-5) K562 cDNA. The within-assay coefficient of variation was 11% for BCR-ABL, and 9% for ABL. A greater than 2 log reduction in the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio was evident shortly after transplantation in all allografted patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We may conclude that the TaqMan probe technology can be easily adapted to HybProbes with equivalent results. Besides, the results of BCR-ABL quantification in the follow-up of patients clearly confirm that real-time PCR with HybProbes is a reliable and sensitive method for monitoring minimal residual leukemia after HSCT in CML patients.","['Bolufer, P', 'Sanz, G F', 'Barragan, E', 'Sanz, M A', 'Cervera, J', 'Lerma, E', 'Senent, L', 'Moreno, I', 'Planelles, M D']","['Bolufer P', 'Sanz GF', 'Barragan E', 'Sanz MA', 'Cervera J', 'Lerma E', 'Senent L', 'Moreno I', 'Planelles MD']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain. bolufer_pas@gva.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards']",,2000/12/13 11:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2000/12/13 11:00'],"['2000/12/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Dec;85(12):1248-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used in situ fractionation of human fibroblasts to carry out cytologic analysis of Mre11 complex proteins in the double-strand break (DSB) response. In situ fractionation removes most nucleoplasmic protein, permitting immunofluorescent localization of proteins that become more avidly bound to nuclear structures after induction of DNA damage. We found that a fraction of the Mre11 complex was bound to promyelocyte leukemia protein bodies in undamaged cells. Within 10 min after gamma irradiation, nuclear retention of the Mre11 complex in small granular foci was observed and persisted until 2 h postirradiation. In light of the previous demonstration that the Mre11 complex associated with ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DSBs, we infer that the protein retained under these conditions was associated with DNA damage. We also observed increased retention of Rad51 following IR treatment, although IR induced Rad51 foci were distinct from Mre11 foci. The ATM kinase, which phosphorylates Nbs1 during activation of the S-phase checkpoint, was not required for the Mre11 complex to associate with DNA damage. These data suggest that the functions of the Mre11 complex in the DSB response are implicitly dependent upon its ability to detect DNA damage.","['Mirzoeva, O K', 'Petrini, J H']","['Mirzoeva OK', 'Petrini JH']","['Laboratory of Genetics, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (XRCC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology/*genetics/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/genetics/*radiation effects', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Endodeoxyribonucleases', '*Exodeoxyribonucleases', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fungal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Mutagenesis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/radiation effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/radiation effects', 'Rad51 Recombinase', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/12/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/13 11:00'],"['2000/12/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Jan;21(1):281-8. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.1.281-288.2001.,,['10.1128/MCB.21.1.281-288.2001 [doi]'],PMC88801,,"['R37 GM059413/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM59413/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM56888/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM059413/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056888/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Mol Cell Biol 2001 Mar;21(5):1898'],,,,,,

We have previously shown that HOXA9 collaborates with MEIS1 in the induction of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this report, we demonstrate that HOXB3, which is highly divergent from HOXA9, also genetically interacts with MEIS1, but not with PBX1, in generating AML. In addition, we show that the HOXA9 and HOXB3 genes play key roles in establishing all the main characteristics of the leukemias, while MEIS1 functions only to accelerate the onset of the leukemic transformation. Contrasting the reported functional similarities between PREP1 and MEIS1, such as PBX nuclear retention, we also show that PREP1 overexpression is incapable of accelerating the HOXA9-induced AML, suggesting that MEIS1 function in transformation must entail more than PBX nuclear localization. Collectively, these data demonstrate that MEIS1 is a common leukemic collaborator with two structurally and functionally divergent HOX genes and that, in this collaboration, the HOX gene defines the identity of the leukemia.","['Thorsteinsdottir, U', 'Kroon, E', 'Jerome, L', 'Blasi, F', 'Sauvageau, G']","['Thorsteinsdottir U', 'Kroon E', 'Jerome L', 'Blasi F', 'Sauvageau G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Hemopoietic Stem Cells, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H2W 1R7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hox 2.7 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Xenopus Proteins']",,2000/12/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/13 11:00'],"['2000/12/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Jan;21(1):224-34. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.1.224-234.2001.,,['10.1128/MCB.21.1.224-234.2001 [doi]'],PMC88796,,,,,,,,,,,

ETO interacts with nuclear receptor corepressors SMRT and N-CoR, which recruit histone deacetylase to the AML1-ETO oncoprotein. SMRT-N-CoR interaction requires each of two zinc fingers contained in C-terminal Nervy homology region 4 (NHR4) of ETO. However, here we show that polypeptides containing NHR4 are insufficient for interaction with SMRT. NHR2 is also required for SMRT interaction and repression by ETO, as well as for inhibition of hematopoietic differentiation by AML1-ETO. NHR2 mediates oligomerization of ETO as well as AML1-ETO. Fusion of NHR4 polypeptide to a heterologous dimerization domain allows strong interaction with SMRT in vitro. These data support a model in which NHR2 and NHR4 have complementary functions in repression by ETO. NHR2 functions as an oligomerization domain bringing together NHR4 polypeptides that together form the surface required for high-affinity interaction with corepressors. As nuclear receptors also interact with corepressors as dimers, oligomerization may be a common mechanism regulating corepressor interactions.","['Zhang, J', 'Hug, B A', 'Huang, E Y', 'Chen, C W', 'Gelmetti, V', 'Maccarana, M', 'Minucci, S', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Lazar, M A']","['Zhang J', 'Hug BA', 'Huang EY', 'Chen CW', 'Gelmetti V', 'Maccarana M', 'Minucci S', 'Pelicci PG', 'Lazar MA']","['Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Departments of Medicine and Genetics, and The Penn Diabetes Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2000/12/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/13 11:00'],"['2000/12/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Jan;21(1):156-63. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.1.156-163.2001.,,['10.1128/MCB.21.1.156-163.2001 [doi]'],PMC88789,,"['R01 DK045586/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK043806/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK433806/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK45586/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Insertion of F-MuLV at the Fli-2 locus, which was associated with the loss of the second allele, resulted in the inactivation of the erythroid cell- and megakaryocyte-specific gene p45(NFE2). Frequent disruption of p45(NFE2) due to proviral insertion suggests a role for this transcription factor in the progression of Friend virus-induced erythroleukemias. To assess this possibility, erythroleukemia was induced by F-MuLV in p45(NFE2) mutant mice. Since p45(NFE2) homozygous mice mostly die at birth, erythroleukemia was induced in +/- and +/+ mice. We demonstrate that +/- mice succumb to the disease moderately but significantly faster than +/+ mice. In addition, the spleens of +/- mice were significantly larger than those of +/+ mice. Of the 37 tumors generated from the +/- and +/+ mice, 10 gave rise to cell lines, all of which were derived from +/- mice. Establishment in culture was associated with the loss of the remaining wild-type p45(NFE2) allele in 9 of 10 of these cell lines. The loss of a functional p45(NFE2) in these cell lines was associated with a marked reduction in globin gene expression. Expression of wild-type p45(NFE2) in the nonproducer erythroleukemic cells resulted in reduced cell growth and restored the expression of globin genes. Similarly, the expression of p45(NFE2) in these cells also slows tumor growth in vivo. These results indicate that p45(NFE2) functions as an inhibitor of erythroid cell growth and that perturbation of its expression contributes to the progression of Friend erythroleukemia.","['Li, Y J', 'Higgins, R R', 'Pak, B J', 'Shivdasani, R A', 'Ney, P A', 'Archer, M', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Li YJ', 'Higgins RR', 'Pak BJ', 'Shivdasani RA', 'Ney PA', 'Archer M', 'Ben-David Y']","[""Division of Cancer Biology Research, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre and Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4N 3M5.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genotype', 'Globins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/13 11:00'],"['2000/12/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/13 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Jan;21(1):73-80. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.1.73-80.2001.,,['10.1128/MCB.21.1.73-80.2001 [doi]'],PMC88781,,"['CA21762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK53469/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK053469-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK053469-01A2/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK053469-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084214-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK053469-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

An oncogenic form of c-Cbl (Cbl-DeltaY371) was expressed in the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line 32Dcl3 to determine whether it was able to induce growth factor-independent proliferation. We were unable to isolate clones of transfected 32Dcl3 cells expressing Cbl-DeltaY371 that proliferated in the absence of IL-3. In contrast, 32Dcl3/Cbl-DeltaY371 cells did not undergo apoptosis like parental 32Dcl3 cells when cultured in the absence of IL-3. Both 32Dcl3 and 32D/CblDeltaY371 cells arrested in G(1) when cultured in the absence of IL-3. Approximately 18% of the 32Dcl3 cells cultured in the absence of IL-3 for 24 h were present in a sub-G(1) fraction, while only 4% of the 32D/Cbl-DeltaY371 and 2% of the 32D/Bcl-2 cells were found in a sub-G(1) fraction. There was no difference in the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins observed following stimulation of either cell type with IL-3. The phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT5, and endogenous c-Cbl was identical in both cell types. No differences were detected in the activation of Akt, ERK1, or ERK2 in unstimulated or IL-3-stimulated 32D/Cbl-DeltaY371 cells compared with parental 32Dcl3 cells. Likewise, there was no difference in the pattern of phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT5, ERK1, ERK2, or Akt when 32Dcl3 and 32D/CblDY371 cells were withdrawn from medium containing IL-3. The protein levels of various Bcl-2 family members were examined in cells grown in the absence or presence of IL-3. We observed a consistent increased amount of Bcl-2 protein in five different clones of 32D/Cbl-DeltaY317 cells. These data suggest that the Cbl-DeltaY371 mutant may suppress apoptosis by a mechanism that involves the overexpression of Bcl-2. Consistent with this result, activation of caspase-3 was suppressed in 32D/Cbl-DeltaY371 cells cultured in the absence of IL-3 compared with 32Dcl3 cells cultured under the same conditions.","['Hamilton, E', 'Miller, K M', 'Helm, K M', 'Langdon, W Y', 'Anderson, S M']","['Hamilton E', 'Miller KM', 'Helm KM', 'Langdon WY', 'Anderson SM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Colorado Cancer Center, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbl protein, mouse)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Culture Media', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,2000/12/23 19:15,2001/05/05 10:01,['2000/12/23 19:15'],"['2000/12/23 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/23 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Mar 23;276(12):9028-37. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M009386200.

Gynecomastia in boys can be mimicked by general obesity and pectoral hypertrophy; US is helpful in the diagnosis, especially when gynecomastia is asymmetric. Most breast lesions in children and adolescents are benign, and surgery should be avoided to prevent later deformity. US is the ideal imaging modality to evaluate breast lesions and may be used to guide a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Color Doppler US evaluation is helpful; cysts are avascular, fibroadenomas may be avascular or hypovascular, and abscesses show peripheral increased flow. Bloody nipple discharge is more common in prepubertal patients, may occur in infants, and may be secondary to mammary ductal ectasia. Discharge commonly resolves spontaneously, and findings at US are frequently normal.","['Garcia, C J', 'Espinoza, A', 'Dinamarca, V', 'Navarro, O', 'Daneman, A', 'Garcia, H', 'Cattani, A']","['Garcia CJ', 'Espinoza A', 'Dinamarca V', 'Navarro O', 'Daneman A', 'Garcia H', 'Cattani A']","['Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Marcoleta 367, Santiago, Chile. famgarc@entelchile.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Radiographics,"Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",8302501,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Breast Diseases/*diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Ultrasonography, Mammary']",33,2000/12/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/12 11:00'],"['2000/12/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiographics. 2000 Nov-Dec;20(6):1605-12. doi: 10.1148/radiographics.20.6.g00nv171605.,,['10.1148/radiographics.20.6.g00nv171605 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PML is essential in the nucleation and formation of ND10 as well as in the recruitment of other ND10-associated proteins such as Daxx, pRb, BLM and Sp100. In cells induced to overexpress Sp100, ND10 binding of Sp100 was saturable and excess Sp100 formed new aggregation sites devoid of other ND10-associated proteins, suggesting that homo-oligomerization is the basis for aggregation. To determine whether Sp100 binds to ND10 through hetero- or oligomerization, Sp100 deletion variants fused with GFP were transfected into cells with and without endogenous Sp100, and the localization of the GFP-labeled fragments was determined relative to ND10. Amino acids 29-152 were sufficient for deposition of the GFP-labeled fragments at ND10 in the absence of endogenous Sp100 (heterologous binding) and for self-aggregation (formation of new Sp100 deposits). None of the shorter fragments was deposited at ND10 or self-aggregated. The 29-152 amino acid fragment and some larger fragments, but not the full-size Sp100, induced elongation of ND10, which at their ends contain only Sp100, probably due to self-aggregation. By fusing a peptide consisting of the p53-binding domain from hMDM2 to the Sp100(29-152) fragment, this self-aggregation could be blocked while retaining the limited ND10 binding capacity, indicating that the Sp100 self-aggregation domain and the ND10 binding domain are separate entities. This fusion peptide was used to demonstrate the potential of ND10 to recruit p53 as a protein not usually present at this site. Such deposited p53 was protected from turnover. The capacity of ND10 to recruit Sp100 may serve primarily to reduce its availability.","['Negorev, D', 'Ishov, A M', 'Maul, G G']","['Negorev D', 'Ishov AM', 'Maul GG']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",,2000/12/12 11:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2000/12/12 11:00'],"['2000/12/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2001 Jan;114(Pt 1):59-68.,,,,,"['AI 41136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 57599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Under basal conditions in HeLa and Hep2 cells, a portion of nuclear PA28 is concentrated at promyelocytic leukemia oncoprotein (PML)-containing bodies also commonly known as PODs or ND10. IFN(gamma) treatment greatly increased the number and size of the PA28- and PML-containing bodies, and the effect was further enhanced in serum-deprived cells. PML bodies are disrupted in response to certain viral infections and in diseases such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Like PML, PA28 was delocalized from PML bodies by expression of the cytomegalovirus protein, IE1, and in NB4 cells, an APL model line. Moreover, retinoic acid treatment, which causes remission of APL in patients and reformation of PML-containing bodies in NB4 cells, relocalized PA28 to this site. In contrast, the proteasome, the functional target of PA28, was not detected at PML bodies under basal conditions in HeLa and Hep2 cells, but IFN(gamma) promoted accumulation of 'immunoproteasomes' at this site. These results establish PA28 as a novel component of nuclear PML bodies, and suggest that PA28 may assemble or activate immunoproteasomes at this site as part of its role in proteasome-dependent MHC class I antigen presentation.","['Fabunmi, R P', 'Wigley, W C', 'Thomas, P J', 'DeMartino, G N']","['Fabunmi RP', 'Wigley WC', 'Thomas PJ', 'DeMartino GN']","['Department of Physiology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-9040, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PSME1 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', '*Muscle Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Viral Proteins']",,2000/12/12 11:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2000/12/12 11:00'],"['2000/12/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/12 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2001 Jan;114(Pt 1):29-36.,,,,,"['DK 49835/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK46181/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

An analysis incorporating our results and a review of the English-language literature about abscesses in children and adults revealed differences related to age. Abscesses in children were more posterior in epidural location, had greater spinal column extension, and were associated with more favorable clinical outcomes than were abscesses in adults.

To study the importance of the monoubiquitination of Gag, a series of lysine to arginine mutants were constructed that eliminated ubiquitination at one or both of the lysines in HIV-1(NL4-3) p6(Gag) and both lysines in Moloney MuLV p12(Gag). HPLC and immunoblot analysis of the HIV-1 mutants demonstrated that either of the lysines in p6(Gag), K27 or K33, could be monoubiquitinated. However, infectivity assays showed that monoubiquitination of HIV-1 p6(Gag) or MuLV p12(Gag) is not required for viral replication in vitro. Pulse-chase radiolabeling of HIV-1-producing cells revealed that monoubiquitination of p6(Gag) does not affect the short-term release of virus from the cell, the maturation of Pr55(Gag), or the sensitivity of these processes to proteasome inhibitors. Experiments with protease-deficient HIV-1 showed that Pr55(Gag) can be monoubiquitinated, suggesting that p6(Gag) is first modified as a domain within Gag. Examination of the proteins inside an HIV-1 mutant found that free ubiquitin was incorporated into the virions in the absence of the lysines in p6(Gag), showing that the ubiquitin inside the virus is not initially brought in as a p6(Gag) conjugate. Although our results establish that monoubiquitination of p6(Gag) and p12(Gag) is not required for viral replication in vitro, this modification may be a by-product of interactions between Gag and cellular proteins during assembly and budding.","['Ott, D E', 'Coren, L V', 'Chertova, E N', 'Gagliardi, T D', 'Schubert, U']","['Ott DE', 'Coren LV', 'Chertova EN', 'Gagliardi TD', 'Schubert U']","['AIDS Vaccine Program, SAIC Frederick, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA. ott@avpvx1.ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p55 gag precursor protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', '0 (p6 gag protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HIV Protease)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Arginine/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV Protease/deficiency/genetics', 'HIV-1/enzymology/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,2000/12/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/09 11:00'],"['2000/12/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/09 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 Dec 5;278(1):111-21. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0648.,,"['10.1006/viro.2000.0648 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90648-2 [pii]']",,,['N01CO56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,

Myelosuppression, which is caused by many types of cancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy), occurs when the body's population of blood cells is lowered. In contrast, immunosuppression occurs when the body's immune function is compromised. Diseases of either the B or T lymphocytes (e.g., lymphoma, multiple myeloma, CLL) alter the normal functioning of the lymphocytes, rendering them unable to mount an immune response. With CLL, B lymphocytes are unable to mature into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells (delGiglio et al., 1993). Multiple myeloma occurs when the plasma cells become malignant (Mansen et al., 1997). Knowledge of the basic principles of immunology assists nurses in understanding the complexities of the immune system and the effects of common cancer treatments. Patients with CLL require astute assessment of infectious symptoms, comprehensive nursing care and symptom management, and education about the disease and its effects. Hays and McCartney (1998) also noted that the challenges of caring for patients with CLL include patient management in the outpatient setting, quality-of-life issues, and ongoing support because of the chronicity of the disease.","['Goldman, D']",['Goldman D'],"['Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin J Oncol Nurs,Clinical journal of oncology nursing,9705336,,,"['Education, Nursing, Continuing', 'Humans', '*Immune System/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology']",,2000/12/09 00:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2000/12/09 00:00'],"['2000/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Clin J Oncol Nurs. 2000 Sep-Oct;4(5):233-4, 236.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exact regulation of hTERT expression, which is the rate-limiting factor for telomerase activity, is at present unclear. As transformed cells seem to be dependent on a constitutive telomerase activity, the availability of inhibitors would potentially be of great value in antineoplastic therapy. Interferons (IFNs) have been successfully used in the treatment of several forms of malignancies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the antitumor activity are poorly defined. In this study we have investigated the effects of IFNs on hTERT expression and telomerase activity. We found that IFN-alpha rapidly (commonly within 4 hours) and significantly down-regulates the expression of hTERT and telomerase activity in a number of human malignant hematopoietic cell lines, primary leukemic cells from patients with acute leukemia as well as T-lymphocytes from healthy donors. This effect of IFN-alpha did not seem to depend on IFN-alpha-mediated cell growth arrest or alterations in c-myc expression. The finding that IFN induces a repression of hTERT and a decrease in telomerase activity suggests a novel mechanism that may play a significant role in the antitumor action of IFN.

The protein contains an N-terminal PDZ motif, a large intervening sequence, and a C-terminal LIM domain and was identified as the human homolog of rat CLP36. The study showed that CLP36 associates with actin filaments and stress fibers that are formed during shape change and spreading of platelets and during migration and contraction of endothelial cells. CLP36 binds to alpha-actinin-1 as shown by coimmunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments, yeast 2-hybrid analysis, and blot overlay assays and colocalizes with alpha-actinin-1 along endothelial actin stress fibers. In contrast to alpha-actinin-1, CLP36 was absent from focal adhesions in both activated platelets and endothelial cells. The N-terminal part of CLP36 containing the PDZ domain and the intervening region, but not the LIM domain, targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion proteins to stress fibers in endothelial cells. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis demonstrated that the intervening sequence, but not the PDZ or the LIM domain of CLP36, binds to the spectrinlike repeats 2 and 3 of alpha-actinin-1. The study further shows that CLP36 binds to alpha-actinin in resting platelets and translocates as a CLP36/alpha-actinin complex to the newly formed actin cytoskeleton in activated platelets. The results indicate that CLP36 binds via alpha-actinin-1 to actin filaments and stress fibers in activated human platelets and endothelial cells. The study suggests that CLP36 may direct alpha-actinin-1 to specific actin structures and at this position might modulate the function of alpha-actinin-1.

CBFB is associated with human leukemias through a chromosome 16 inversion and is essential for definitive hematopoiesis during mouse embryo development. We have isolated a zebrafish cbfb complementary DNA (cDNA) clone from a zebrafish kidney cDNA library. This cbfb is highly homologous to human and mouse CBFB/Cbfb genes at both the DNA and protein level. In biochemical analyses, cbfbeta binds to human CBF alpha 2 and enhances its DNA binding. During zebrafish development, cbfb is expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm at tail bud stage and in the intermediate cell mass (ICM, the location of embryonic hematopoiesis) between the 21- to 26-somite stages. The cbfb is also expressed in Rohon-Beard cells, cranial nerve ganglia, hindbrain, retina, branchial arches, jaw, and fin buds. Expression of cbfb is decreased or absent in the ICM and Rohon-Beard cells in some hematopoietic mutants and is unaffected in others. We have also analyzed the expression of scl and gata-1 in the same hematopoietic mutants to ascertain the relative order of these transcription factors to cbfb in zebrafish hematopoiesis. Our results indicate that cbfb is expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors and that its expression pattern in the hematopoietic mutants is similar to that of scl.

It has been shown that mature megakaryocytes (MKs) functionally express the stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) receptor, CXCR4. SDF-1-induced migration of mature MKs through endothelial cell layers results in increased platelet production. Because the migration of polyploid MKs from the bone marrow microenvironment requires remodeling of the perivascular extracellular matrix, it was hypothesized that mature polyploid MKs may express matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), facilitating their exit into the bone marrow extravascular space. In this report, it is demonstrated that SDF-1 induces the expression and release of gelatinase B (MMP-9) by purified mature polyploid human MKs and an adeno-CXCR4-infected megakaryocytic cell line. Neutralizing antibody to MMP-9, but not MMP-2, blocked SDF-1-induced migration of MKs through reconstituted basement membrane, suggesting that expression of MMP-9 is critical for MK migration. Incubation of mature MKs with a synthetic MMP inhibitor, 5-phenyl-1,10-phenanthrolene, resulted in the inhibition of platelet formation, suggesting that the expression of MMPs is not only critical for megakaryocyte migration but also for subsequent platelet release. Confirming these results, adeno-SDF-1 injection into normal mice resulted in increased platelet counts, a process that could be blocked by a synthetic MMP inhibitor. These results suggest mobilization of MKs involves sequential expression and activation of chemokine receptors such as CXCR4, MMP-9, followed by transendothelial migration. MMP inhibitors may have potential use in the treatment of thrombotic and myeloproliferative disorders.

Some underlie severe forms of chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) for which there is no definitive treatment. By using retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein that harbor the human G6PD (hG6PD) complementary DNA, stable and lifelong expression of hG6PD was obtained in all the hematopoietic tissues of 16 primary bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipient mice and 14 secondary BMT recipients. These findings demonstrate the integration of a functional gene in totipotent stem cells. The average total G6PD in peripheral blood cells of these transplanted mice, measured as enzyme activity, was twice that of untransplanted control mice. This allowed the inference that the amount of G6PD produced by the transduced gene must be therapeutically effective. With the same vectors both the cloning efficiency and the ability to form embryoid bodies were restored in embryonic stem cells, in which the G6PD gene had been inactivated by targeted homologous recombination, thus effectively rescuing their defective phenotype.

Among patients surviving at least 28 days, 4% had primary graft failure (failure to achieve an absolute neutrophil count > 5 x 10(8)/L before death or second stem-cell infusion). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that engraftment was associated with marrow matched at HLA-A, HLA-B, and DRB1; higher cell dose; younger recipient; male recipient; and recipient from a non-African American ethnic group. More rapid myeloid engraftment was associated with marrow serologically matched at HLA-A and HLA-B, DRB1 match, higher cell dose (in non-T-cell-depleted cases), younger recipient, recipient seronegativity for cytomegalovirus (CMV), male donor, no methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and transplantation done in more recent years. A platelet count higher than 50 x 10(9)/L was achieved by 47% of patients by day 100. Conditional on survival to day 100, survival at 3 years was 61% in those with platelet engraftment at day 30, 58% in those with engraftment between day 30 and day 100, and 33% in those without engraftment at day 100 (P <.0001). Factors favoring platelet engraftment were higher cell dose, DRB1 allele match, recipient seronegativity for CMV, HLA-A and HLA-B serologically matched donor, and male donor. Secondary graft failure occurred in 10% of patients achieving initial engraftment, and 18% of those patients are alive.

European Fanconi Anemia Research Group.,4064-70,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Clinical care is complicated by variable age at onset and severity of hematologic symptoms. Recent advances in the molecular biology of FA have allowed us to investigate the relationship between FA genotype and the nature and severity of the clinical phenotype. Two hundred forty-five patients from all 7 known complementation groups (FA-A to FA-G) were studied. Mutations were detected in one of the cloned FANC genes in 169 patients; in the remainder the complementation group was assigned by cell fusion or Western blotting. A range of qualitative and quantitative clinical parameters was compared for each complementation group and for different classes of mutation. Significant phenotypic differences were found. FA-G patients had more severe cytopenia and a higher incidence of leukemia. Somatic abnormalities were less prevalent in FA-C, but more common in the rare groups FA-D, FA-E, and FA-F. In FA-A, patients homozygous for null mutations had an earlier onset of anemia and a higher incidence of leukemia than those with mutations producing an altered protein. In FA-C, there was a later age of onset of aplastic anemia and fewer somatic abnormalities in patients with the 322delG mutation, but there were more somatic abnormalities in patients with IVS4 + 4A --> T. This study indicates that FA patients with mutations in the FANCG gene and patients homozygous for null mutations in FANCA are high-risk groups with a poor hematologic outcome and should be considered as candidates both for frequent monitoring and early therapeutic intervention.

Conventionally, high-dose chemoradiotherapy-based preparative regimens were considered essential both for tumor eradication and facilitation of donor stem cell engraftment. It is now apparent that an immune-mediated graft-versus-tumor effect has a pivotal role in the curative potential of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This has prompted the development of less toxic, nonmyeloablative but profoundly immunosuppressive preparative regimens, often fludarabine- or radiation-based. Full donor engraftment can be achieved; however, a significant number of patients achieve a mixed chimeric state. Mixed hematopoietic chimerism provides a platform for the use of adoptive immunotherapy using donor lymphocyte infusions to maximize the immune-mediated antitumor effect, but the optimal usage has yet to be determined. Immediate procedure-related mortality with nonmyeloablative regimens has been low, but graft-versus-host disease remains a major clinical concern and treatment challenge. Major tumor responses have been seen in many hematologic malignancies primarily including patients with highly chemorefractory disease. Follow-up data have been short and additional time is needed to determine the efficacy and toxicities of this immunotherapy.

Brain tumors tend to have a more indolent course in NF1 than in the general population, and hence are best managed conservatively. MPNST, in contrast, do not respond to standard chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The most effective treatment of MPNST appears to be early diagnosis and surgery, but early diagnosis is hampered by frequent occurrence within preexisting large tumors, making new growth or change difficult to detect. New insights into pathogenesis now offer hope of development of specific methods of treatment with reduced toxicity and more precise molecular targeting.

Combination therapy with ATRA and chemotherapy should now be regarded as the standard treatment for the acute promyelocytic leukemia variant of AML. Several agents can induce leukemic cell differentiation for other AML subtypes, although these effects differ between patients. Differentiation may then be associated with induction of apoptosis, and differentiation-inducing therapy may therefore become useful in combination with intensive chemotherapy to increase the susceptibility of AML blasts to drug-induced apoptosis. However, it should be emphasized that differentiation and apoptosis can occur as separate events with different regulation in AML cells, and future studies in AML should therefore focus on: A) the identification of new agents with more predictable effects on differentiation and apoptosis; B) the use of clinical and laboratory parameters to define new subsets of AML patients in which differentiation/apoptosis induction has a predictable and beneficial effect, and C) further characterization of how AML blast sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis is modulated by differentiation induction.","['Bruserud, O', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Huang, Ts']","['Bruserud O', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Huang Ts']","['Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",99,2000/12/08 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/08 11:00'],"['2000/12/08 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/08 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2000;5(6):454-62. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.5-6-454.,,['10.1634/theoncologist.5-6-454 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate Cryptococcus neoformans infections in patients with hematological malignancies. METHODS: Six cases have been described of cryptococcosis detected in Nantes, France over the past 10 years in patients with hematological malignancies. RESULTS: This infection has been found particularly in the context of lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), and also following cytotoxic therapy. In four cases, the patients were treated with fludarabine, which rapidly caused long-duration marked lymphocytopenia, notably in CD4 cells. Cell-mediated immunity plays a major role in systemic defense against C. neoformans. It therefore seems that fludarabine favors the spread of cryptococcal infections. CONCLUSION: In the context of lymphoproliferative syndromes treated with cytotoxic drugs, in particular fludarabine, it appears important to take into account the possible presence of cryptococcal infection in the presence of respiratory, neurological or cutaneous disorders, so that a correct diagnosis can be made and the appropriate treatment administered.","['Vigouroux, S', 'Morin, O', 'Milpied, N', 'Mahe, B', 'Rapp, M J', 'Harousseau, J L']","['Vigouroux S', 'Morin O', 'Milpied N', 'Mahe B', 'Rapp MJ', 'Harousseau JL']","[""Service d'hematologie clinique, Hotel-Dieu, CHU, Nantes, France.""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cryptococcosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Cryptococcus neoformans', 'Female', 'France', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",,2000/12/08 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/08 11:00'],"['2000/12/08 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/08 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 2000 Nov;21(11):955-60. doi: 10.1016/s0248-8663(00)00251-4.,Infections a Cryptococcus neoformans dans les hemopathies malignes.,"['S0248866300002514 [pii]', '10.1016/s0248-8663(00)00251-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Buildings, especially their interiors have a very specific microclimate. Within it areas of so called ecological lows are formed in which conditions for settlement, growth and reproduction of these organisms take place. A building, which is a hazard to the health of its residents, is called a ""sick building"" from the term ""sick building syndrome"". The incidence and development of some types of mould fungus is associated with the production of very toxic metabolites which are called secondary metabolites i.e. mycotoxins. Long term human, especially in relation to children, contact with the species producing the most potent mycotoxins like aflatoxin--Apergillus flavus, ochratoxins--Aspergillus ochraceus, rubratoxins--Penicillium rubrum or strachybotrytoxins--Strachybotrys chartarum may even be the cause of death. Mould fungus or just mould is a saprophytic fungus derived from many different systemic groups (Mucor, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarinum). Fungi can produce lethal mycotoxins such as: alternariol, aflatoxins, gliotoxins, ochratoxins, nivalenol, cytinine, dicumarol, rugulosine, trichoviridine and about 200 more which considering their mutagenicity are potentially dangerous to humans, animals, flora and microorganisms. Research which was begun by Prof. Julian Aleksandrowicz and Prof. Boleslaw Smyk in 1970 and 1971 showed that the so called ""leukaemia houses"" of leukaemia victims had an abundance of toxinogenic fungus in them, particularly the most potent fungus which turned out to be Aspergillus flavus. Toxinogenic funguses are abundant in many living spaces and cellars in older and also in new housing. Mycotoxins have been shown to be very toxic and harmful and it is no wonder that many inhabitants of these living spaces are constantly ill, mainly upper respiratory tract infections, lethargy, constant headaches, nausea and a general ill feeling. Inhabiting these living spaces for a considerable period may lead to cancer.","['Ochmanski, W', 'Barabasz, W']","['Ochmanski W', 'Barabasz W']","['I Katedra i Klinika Chorob Wewnetrznych Collegium Medicum, Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego w Krakowie.']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,['0 (Mycotoxins)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Air Microbiology', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Animals', 'Bacteria/classification/isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Fungi/classification/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Mycotoxins/adverse effects/toxicity', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/etiology', 'Sick Building Syndrome/complications/*microbiology']",16,2000/12/08 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/08 11:00'],"['2000/12/08 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/08 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Przegl Lek. 2000;57(7-8):419-23.,Mikrobiologiczne zagrozenia budynkow i pomieszczen mieszakalnych oraz ich wplyw na zdrowie (syndrom chorego budynku).,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies were conducted during the different phases of the normal menstrual cycle and following treatment with different doses of onapristone (2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg every third day for one cycle) in bonnet monkeys. The molecules were analysed collectively to explore the possibility of a correlation between expression of these markers and endometrial receptivity and to investigate whether there exists a regulatory link between expression of these molecules under in vivo conditions. Three types of expression patterns of endometrial factors were observed during the peri-implantation period following onapristone treatment: 1) LIF, alpha(v)beta(3), and alpha(1)beta(1) showed significant (P < 0.02) down regulation in glandular epithelium of endometria in animals treated with all three doses of onapristone as compared to the control group. This was indicative of their critical role in the progesterone-driven cascade leading to implantation. 2) PR, TGFbeta, and TGFbetaR remained unaffected in the endometria from 2.5 mg treated animals and showed down regulation in animals treated with 5 and 10 mg onapristone as compared to the control group, thereby suggesting that the expression of these markers may not truely reflect endometrial receptivity per se. However, their facilitatory role in preparing the endometrium for implantation can not be ruled out since continued perturbation in the expression of these molecules may affect endometrial growth, remodelling, and differentiation, which in turn may render the endometrium nonreceptive; 3) ER remained unaltered in endometria of animals rendered infertile with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg onapristone. This observation indirectly suggests that onapristone-induced endometrial changes are mediated via some specific mechanisms. The present study clearly demonstrates that endometrial non-receptivity induced at low doses of onapristone is associated with changes in the expression pattern of specific molecular markers. However, no direct correlation was observed between in vivo expression of TGFbeta, LIF, and integrins, thereby lending support to the concept that there exists redundancy or multiple pathways which regulate implantation events.","['Puri, C P', 'Katkam, R R', 'Sachdeva, G', 'Patil, V', 'Manjramkar, D D', 'Kholkute, S D']","['Puri CP', 'Katkam RR', 'Sachdeva G', 'Patil V', 'Manjramkar DD', 'Kholkute SD']","['Institute for Research in Reproduction (Indian Council of Medical Research), Jehangir Merwanji Street, Parel, 400 012, Mumbai, India. vichin@bom4.vsnl.net.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Steroids,Steroids,0404536,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Gonanes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)', 'H6H7G23O3N (onapristone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endometrium/chemistry/cytology/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gonanes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Macaca radiata', 'Menstrual Cycle', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factors/drug effects/genetics/metabolism']",,2000/12/08 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2000/12/08 11:00'],"['2000/12/08 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/08 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Steroids. 2000 Oct-Nov;65(10-11):783-94. doi: 10.1016/s0039-128x(00)00192-6.,,"['S0039128X00001926 [pii]', '10.1016/s0039-128x(00)00192-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We synthesized all possible A-ring diastereomers of the 2-methyl-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and its 20-epimer and evaluated their biological activities in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Surprisingly, the potent analogues could be clearly divided into two groups: (i) those bearing the 1alpha- and 3beta-hydroxyl groups on the A-ring were potent inducers of differentiation and growth inhibitors of HL-60 cells and (ii) those bearing the 1beta-hydroxyl group together with either 3alpha- or 3beta-hydroxyl groups on the A-ring were potent stimulators of apoptosis in these cells. We have clearly identified for the first time the structural motifs on the basis of the stereochemistry of both hydroxyl groups at positions 1 and 3 of the A-ring of the 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) molecule responsible for the induction of differentiation and apoptosis of HL-60 cells.

However, we have previously shown that amsacrine and, to a lesser extent, doxorubicin, could induce apoptosis in the doxorubicin-resistant variant of this cell line. In order to elucidate the role of bcr-abl in triggering apoptosis, we investigated the effect of the topoisomerase II inhibitors doxorubicin, amsacrine, and etoposide on the expression of several genes that may be related to apoptosis induction in both cell lines. This was done using a technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction coupled with HPLC of the amplified fragments to obtain semiquantitative evaluations. We showed that amsacrine, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, was able to decrease the expression of bcr-abl down to 20% of the basal value in the doxorubicin-resistant variant only, whereas doxorubicin and etoposide were unable to do so. No effect of these drugs was seen on the expression of the normal abl gene. In addition, there was an effect of amsacrine on the expression of bcl-x(L) in the resistant cell line only, but at concentrations higher than the IC(50) of this drug. Our results emphasize the role of bcr-abl in protecting cells from apoptosis and the possible involvement of specific topoisomerase II inhibitors in overcoming resistance to apoptosis.","['Laroche-Clary, A', 'Larrue, A', 'Robert, J']","['Laroche-Clary A', 'Larrue A', 'Robert J']","['Institut Bergonie and Universite Victor Segalen, 33076 cedex, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2000/12/08 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/08 11:00'],"['2000/12/08 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/08 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Dec 15;60(12):1823-8. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00497-4.,,"['S0006295200004974 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00497-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the HDL formed with undifferentiated THP-1 cells contained only phosphatidylcholine and almost no cholesterol, the cells differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) generated HDL enriched in cholesterol. The extent of cholesterol enrichment related to the cellular cholesterol level in the differentiated cells, but only weakly in the undifferentiated cells. In contrast, the differentiation had no influence on the diffusion-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux. The undifferentiated cells expressed the messages of ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 and caveolin-1, at low levels, and the PMA-induced differentiation resulted in substantial expression of both messages. Caveolin-1 protein expression was also highly induced by the PMA treatment of THP-1 cells. When the cells were treated with the antisense DNA of caveolin-1 and differentiated, both caveolin-1 synthesis and cholesterol incorporation into the HDL were reduced in parallel to generate the cholesterol-poor HDL. We concluded that caveolin-1 is involved in enrichment with cholesterol of the HDL generated by the apolipoprotein-cell interaction. This function is independent of the assembly of HDL particles with cellular phospholipid and of nonspecific, diffusion-mediated efflux of cellular cholesterol.","['Arakawa, R', 'Abe-Dohmae, S', 'Asai, M', 'Ito, J I', 'Yokoyama, S']","['Arakawa R', 'Abe-Dohmae S', 'Asai M', 'Ito JI', 'Yokoyama S']","['Biochemistry 1, Nagoya City University Medical School, Kawasumi 1, Mizuho-cho, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya 467-8601, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)', '0 (CAV1 protein, human)', '0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (Caveolins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Apolipoprotein A-I/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Caveolin 1', 'Caveolins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2000/12/08 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/12/08 11:00'],"['2000/12/08 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/08 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2000 Dec;41(12):1952-62.,,['S0022-2275(20)32356-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The differences in the percentage positivity, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and the product of percentage positivity and MFI were used to assess upregulation. There was a significant upregulation of CD20 expression on B cells seen at both concentrations after 24-hour priming (p < 0.01). B-CLL cells cultured for 72 hours in the presence of IFN-alpha also showed upregulation of CD20 expression; however, the degree of upregulation was much lower than that seen at 24 hours.

These are then coupled with high-dimensional classification methods to assess the classification power of complete expression profiles. We present results of performing leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) experiments on the three data sets, employing nearest neighbor classifier, SVM (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1997) and a novel clustering-based classification technique. As tumor samples can differ from normal samples in their cell-type composition, we also perform LOOCV experiments using appropriately modified sets of genes, attempting to eliminate the resulting bias.

Using a proportional hazards model, the association of hospital experience with early survival at day 100 (D100S), and overall survival (OS) were examined.

At this point, the blastocyst establishes a close interaction with the uterine tissues, a step necessary for its continued embryonic development. In many mammalian species, including man, uterine expression of the cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is coincident with the onset of implantation and in mice LIF is essential to this process. The reasons for implantation failure have not been established. Here we show in LIF-deficient mice that up to the onset of implantation, changes in uterine cell proliferation, hormone levels, blastocyst localization, as well as expression of lactoferrin and Muc-1, do not differ from wild-types. However, the uterus fails to respond to the presence of embryos or to artificial stimuli by decidualizing. In mice, implantation and decidualization are induced by nidatory estrogen. We show that uterine expression of LIF is up-regulated by estrogen and LIF can replace nidatory estrogen at inducing both implantation and decidualization in ovariectomized mice. Implantation of LIF-deficient embryos in the LIF-deficient females, with normal development to term is rescued by i.p. injection of LIF. Transient expression of LIF on D4 of pregnancy is therefore only required to induce a state of receptivity in the uterus permitting embryo implantation and decidualization. LIF is neither required by the embryo for development nor for the maintenance of pregnancy.","['Chen, J R', 'Cheng, J G', 'Shatzer, T', 'Sewell, L', 'Hernandez, L', 'Stewart, C L']","['Chen JR', 'Cheng JG', 'Shatzer T', 'Sewell L', 'Hernandez L', 'Stewart CL']","['Cancer and Developmental Biology Laboratory, ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/physiology', 'Decidua/physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*physiology', 'Estradiol/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*deficiency/genetics/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Lactoferrin/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*deficiency/genetics/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mucin-1/genetics', 'Ovariectomy', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'Uterus/*physiology']",,2000/12/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/07 11:00'],"['2000/12/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2000 Dec;141(12):4365-72. doi: 10.1210/endo.141.12.7855.,,['10.1210/endo.141.12.7855 [doi]'],,,['N01-C0-56000/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The availability of hematopoietic growth factors has made it possible to evaluate the role of reversing the neutropenic state. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been used in an investigator-initiated, open-label clinical trial in approximately 1200 patients. Data collected on each patient was reviewed to identify all patients who had the combination of neutropenia and pneumonia. Sixty-eight patients (5% of the patients for whom GM-CSF was requested) met the criteria for having neutropenic pneumonia. In this patient population there were 45 males and 20 females (gender was not indicated in 3). Ages ranged from 3 to 83 years (mean 39 +/- 18 years). The underlying diseases included: 7 patients who were receiving chemotherapy for solid malignant tumors, 14 for lymphoma, and 22 for leukemia; 15 post bone marrow transplantation primarily for hematologic malignancy; 3 idiosyncratic drug-induced neutropenia; and 7 with other causes of neutropenia. The type of pneumonia was predominantly fungal in 21 patients, bacterial in 23, viral in 2, protozoal in 1, and uncertain in 21 (presumed to be bacterial in 19 and viral in 2). Patients received a mean of 5micro/kg GM-CSF (range 1.3-12.5microg/kg) daily for a mean of 13 +/- 10 (range 2-57) days. The mean leukocyte count at start of treatment was 600 +/- 500 cells/mm(3), and at the end of treatment was 5600+/-9200 cells/mm(3) (P=0.001). The time between start of GM-CSF and a leukocyte level in excess of 1500/mm(3) was a median of 13 days. Hematopoietic recovery was shown in 46/62 (74%), 40/64 (63%) showed good clinical and/ or radiologic improvement, and 41/68 (60%) survived. Four illustrative case reports are provided. By comparing the hematologic responders to non-responders, it is clear that persistent neutropenia contributed significantly to poor clinical outcome and mortality. Only 3/22 (13%) of non-responders survived, whereas 38/46 (83%) of responders survived. There were 7 adverse events (rash 1, fever/chills 2, malaise 1, myalgia/bone pain 2, increased myeloblasts 1) which were considered to be related to use of the cytokine. Aggravation of the pulmonary inflammation or sepsis syndrome was not observed. Tolerability was good or very good in 89% of patients. Based on this open-label study, the use of GM-CSF in combination with appropriate antibiotics is effective and safe for the management of patients with pneumonia and severe hematopoietic dysfunction.","['Dierdorf', 'Kreuter', 'Jones']","['Dierdorf R', 'Kreuter U', 'Jones TC']","['Novartis Ltd, Basle, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Braz J Infect Dis,The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,9812937,,,,,1997/04/01 00:00,2000/12/07 00:00,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/12/07 00:00 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Braz J Infect Dis. 1997 Apr;1(2):68-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that integration of Friend virus into the Fli-2 locus in CB3, an erythroleukemia cell line that harbors a homozygous inactivation of the Fli-2 locus, results in the loss of expression of two genes encoding the 45-kDa subunit of the erythroid-specific nuclear factor p45 NFE2 and the splicing factor HnRNP A1. Here, we report the identification of a third gene, Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1alpha, also known as CBX5), which is located downstream of HnRNP A1, and p45 NFE2. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of HP1alpha, along with p45 NFE2 and HnRNP A1, is either undetectable or substantially reduced in CB3 cells, suggesting that HP1alpha expression is also regulated by proviral insertion within the Fli-2 locus in CB3 cells. Because p45 NFE2 was previously mapped to mouse chromosome 15, our results demonstrate that HP1alpha and HnRNP A1 are also located on mouse chromosome 15 and that the p45 NFE2, HnRNP A1, and HP1alpha genes are arranged contiguously. Contiguous arrangement of these three genes was also detected in man; this consequently localizes HP1alpha to human chromosome band 12q13.","['Li, Y J', 'Pak, B J', 'Higgins, R R', 'Lu, S J', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Li YJ', 'Pak BJ', 'Higgins RR', 'Lu SJ', 'Ben-David Y']","[""Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Division of Cancer Biology Research, Toronto, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (CBX5 protein, human)', '0 (CBX5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Order/genetics', 'Heterochromatin/*genetics', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1', '*Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', '*Suppression, Genetic', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2000/12/07 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/07 11:00'],"['2000/12/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Jan;30(1):91-5.,,['10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::AID-GCC1058>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF216290'],

Hybridization to human metaphases produces color banding patterns specific for each homologous chromosome pair. The technique has been evaluated in a complementary manner with G-banding and chromosome painting in a series of 10 myeloid malignancies with complex or unresolved karyotypes. Color banding detected the majority of chromosomal abnormalities, which had been identified by G-banding and in each case revealed chromosomal changes that G-banding had not identified. Painting was necessary to confirm these abnormalities due to the limitation of only seven colors in the color-banded karyotype. At the same time, painting fortuitously uncovered cryptic abnormalities in 6 of 10 cases that had not been detected by color banding. Insertions were visible by painting only. This study has demonstrated that in the analysis of complex karyotypes, the application of color banding revealed the involvement of the long arm of chromosome 3, indicating a poor risk, in two cases not identified by G-banding. Therefore, these techniques applied together have revealed cryptic chromosomal abnormalities with prognostic significance, which in some cases may have implications for patient management.","['Harrison, C J', 'Yang, F', 'Butler, T', 'Cheung, K L', ""O'Brien, P C"", 'Hennessy, B J', 'Prentice, H G', 'Ferguson-Smith, M']","['Harrison CJ', 'Yang F', 'Butler T', 'Cheung KL', ""O'Brien PC"", 'Hennessy BJ', 'Prentice HG', 'Ferguson-Smith M']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, United Kingdom. cjh@rfc.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (Coloring Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding/*methods', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Coloring Agents', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hylobates', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Species Specificity']",,2000/12/07 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/07 11:00'],"['2000/12/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Jan;30(1):15-24. doi: 10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1061>3.0.co;2-u.,,"['10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::AID-GCC1061>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1061>3.0.co;2-u [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A previously validated questionnaire for use with medical undergraduates is modified and used to survey perceived skills in five aspects of providing palliative care in five different scenarios at two points during the 12-month period of general practice vocational training where no specific teaching intervention is conducted. SETTING: The West Midlands. PARTICIPANTS: 210 GP registrars. RESULTS: Perceived skill ratings were seen to significantly increase during the 12-month period, but anxiety in caring for the dying did not significantly decrease. Ratings of skills were lowest when caring for a child dying with leukaemia or a young adult dying with AIDS. In addition, other important variables which had a statistically significant influence were gender and age, but interestingly not the number of previous senior house officer (SHO) posts undertaken or whether the respondent had had formal teaching on the subject in the past. CONCLUSION: It might therefore be postulated that training as a GP registrar has an important impact on the development of perceived skills in palliative care.","['Charlton, R', 'Field, S', 'Faull, C', 'Campbell, I', 'Harper, C', 'Harper, L']","['Charlton R', 'Field S', 'Faull C', 'Campbell I', 'Harper C', 'Harper L']","['Centre for Primary Health Care Studies, Warwick University, Coventry, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Med Educ,Medical education,7605655,,IM,"['Adult', 'Attitude', 'Clinical Competence/*standards', 'England', 'Family Practice/*education/standards', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Palliative Care/*standards', 'Self Concept', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/standards', 'Vocational Education/organization & administration']",,2000/12/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/07 11:00'],"['2000/12/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Educ. 2000 Nov;34(11):928-35.,,['med683 [pii]'],,,,['Med Educ. 2001 Aug;35(8):809.

Southern blot analysis using the universal BCR (UBCR) probe on BglII-digested DNA samples is the most commonly used technique, while employing the human 3' bcr probe (PR-1) is usually considered a complementary tool. In this study, we tried to develop a simple and economic strategy for molecular characterization of CML using the 3' probe as it has been shown to be the one capable of locating the breakpoint site. Seventy-eight cases of CML were studied. Molecular analysis was performed using the Southern blot technique. DNA was digested with Bam HI, BglII, EcoRI, and XbaI. Hybridization was performed using the human 3' bcr (PR-1) probe. BamHI and BglII could differentiate fragment 1 (F1) showing rearrangement (R) with Bam HI and germline configuration (G) with BglII; F2/3 showing R with both, and F4 showing R with BamHI and G with BglII. F2/3 cases were further divided by HindIII enzyme into F2 showing (G) and F3 showing (R). Fragment 0 showed G with both, but R with EcoRI and/or XbaI, while 3' deletion gave G with all four enzymes. Our results showed a relative incidence of 6.4% for F0, 20.5% for F1, 32.1% for F2, 19.2% for F3, 15.4% for F4, and 6.4% for 3' deletion. Sixty cases were evaluated clinically and hematologically and were followed up for disease evolution and survival.

In 15 cases found to be 100% Ph(+), the respective BCR/ABL gene was absent in 30% of CD34(+) cells, while the respective transcripts could not be identified in 17% of CFU-GM. The mean percentage of BCR/ABL(-) CD34(+) cells and CFU-GM cells was higher (38% and 29%, respectively) in untreated patients than in treated patients (24% and 7%, respectively). In eight cases with cytogenetic response (CgR), the percentage of Ph(-) metaphases correlated with the level of BCR/ABL(-) colonies in BM and PB and with the proportion of BCR/ABL(-) CD34(+) cells in the BM. Immunophenotyping and FISH was fast, easy, always informative, and quantitative for the BCR/ABL(-) CD34(+) cells. Our results show that (a) at early diagnosis a high frequency of BCR/ABL(-) HSC circulate in the PB and that Ph(-) hematopoiesis is not completely suppressed; (b) although normal clonogenic cells decline rapidly within a few months after diagnosis, appreciable numbers of normal CD34(+) cells survive in chronic phase, especially in patients with CgR.","['Akel, S', 'Kolialexi, A', 'Mavrou, A', 'Metaxotou, C', 'Loukopoulos, D', 'Yataganas, X']","['Akel S', 'Kolialexi A', 'Mavrou A', 'Metaxotou C', 'Loukopoulos D', 'Yataganas X']","['First Department of Medicine, University of Athens School of Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, 17 Agiou Thoma, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Count', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2000/12/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/07 11:00'],"['2000/12/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2000 Oct 15;122(2):93-100. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00280-6.,,"['S0165-4608(00)00280-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00280-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A study was conducted to investigate the frequency and prognostic significance of TEL/AML-1 fusion gene resulting from a cryptic t(12;21)(p13;q22). Bone marrow samples from 86 patients diagnosed over the past 5 years at Columbus Children's Hospital were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique for TEL/AML-1 fusion gene, using LSI((R)) DNA probes. The positive cases were analyzed for clinical outcome. Patients in this study received treatment according to Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols. Fifteen of the 86 cases (17%) were positive for the fusion gene. All were B-cell lineage and except for one, all were CD10 positive. TEL/AML-1 was not found in any T-cell ALL. The mean overall survival (OS) following diagnosis for the TEL/AML-1-positive group was significantly longer than for the TEL/AML-1-negative group by log-rank = 7.84, P = 0.005. Similarly, the event-free survival (EFS) after remission for the positive group (median 94.5 months) was longer than the negative group (median 57 months) by log-rank = 7.19, P = 0.007. This study confirms that the TEL/AML-1 fusion gene may be the most common genetic event in childhood ALL, occurring in 17% of the patients. It appears restricted to the B-cell lineage. In this study, the presence of a TEL/AML-1 fusion gene was statistically significant in predicting both OS and EFS, indicating a favorable clinical outcome for these patients. Screening for TEL/AML-1 should become routine at diagnosis and a useful biological variable for risk stratification in future clinical trials.","['Jamil, A', 'Theil, K S', 'Kahwash, S', 'Ruymann, F B', 'Klopfenstein, K J']","['Jamil A', 'Theil KS', 'Kahwash S', 'Ruymann FB', 'Klopfenstein KJ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205, USA. jamila@pediatrics.ohio-state.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/12/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/07 11:00'],"['2000/12/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2000 Oct 15;122(2):73-8. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00272-7.,,"['S0165-4608(00)00272-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00272-7 [doi]']",,,"['P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA03750-39/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The probe was used to screen three chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) derived cell lines and ten CML patient bone marrow samples for aberrations, additional to the Ph rearrangement, that are associated with the onset of blast crisis of CML. This approach was shown to identify karyotype changes commonly seen by conventional karyotyping, and in addition revealed chromosome changes unresolved or undetected by conventional cytogenetic analysis. The seven-color painting probe provides a useful, fast, and reliable complementary tool for chromosome analysis, especially in cases with poor chromosome morphology. This is a simple approach, since the probes can be displayed in a standard red/green/blue format accessible to standard fluorescence microscopes and image-processing software.

Activation of p53 in REH cells by treatment with daunorubicin was accompanied by decreased ( approximately 5-fold) levels of hRFC transcripts and methotrexate transport. Treatment of K562(pTet-on/p53) cells with doxycycline resulted in a dose-dependent expression of p53 protein and transcripts, increased p21 protein, decreased dihydrofolate reductase, and G(1) arrest with decreased numbers of cells in S-phase. p53 induction was accompanied by up to 3-fold decreases in hRFC transcripts transcribed from the upstream hRFC-B promoter and similar losses of hRFC protein and methotrexate uptake capacity. Expression of p15 in an analogous inducible system in K562 cells resulted in a nearly identical decrease of S-phase cells and dihydrofolate reductase without effects on hRFC levels or activity. When the hRFC-B promoter was expressed as full-length and basal promoter-luciferase reporter constructs in K562(pTet-on/p53) cells, induction of p53 with doxycycline resulted in a 3-fold loss of promoter activity, which was reversed by cotransfection with a trans-dominant-negative p53. These studies show that wild type p53 acts as a repressor of hRFC gene expression, via a mechanism that is independent of its effects on cell cycle progression.","['Ding, B C', 'Whetstine, J R', 'Witt, T L', 'Schuetz, J D', 'Matherly, L H']","['Ding BC', 'Whetstine JR', 'Witt TL', 'Schuetz JD', 'Matherly LH']","['Department of Pharmacology and the Experimental and Clinical Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201 , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology']",,2000/12/17 19:15,2001/05/05 10:01,['2000/12/17 19:15'],"['2000/12/17 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/17 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Mar 23;276(12):8713-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M005248200.

To determine the patterns of genetic deletions in these tumors, we performed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis on 15 cases (11 nasal and four nonnasal), and fluorescence in situ hybridization on three cases of aggressive lymphoma/leukemia. A panel of 41 microsatellite loci on chromosomes 6q, 11q, 13q, and 17p were investigated. LOH at chromosomes 6q and 13q was frequently detected in NK cell lymphomas, being found in 80 and 66.7% of cases, respectively. LOH at chromosomes 11q and 17p was less common, being found in 28.6 and 30.8% of cases, respectively. Most tumors showed multiple loci deletions at different chromosomal regions, but several patterns of LOH could be defined. LOH at chromosome 6q was found in 90.9% of nasal NK cell lymphomas, but only in 50% of nonnasal NK cell lymphomas. LOH at chromosome 13q was found in 63.6% of nasal NK cell lymphomas and 75% of nonnasal NK cell lymphomas. For nasal NK cell lymphomas, LOH at 13q was found in 33.3% of cases at presentation, but 100% of cases at relapse. Five tumors showed LOH in only one chromosomal region, involving 6q in three cases (two nasal and one nonnasal), and 13q in two cases (both nonnasal). For the three cases of aggressive NK cell lymphoma/leukemia studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization, DNA loss at 13q14 and 17p13 regions were demonstrated. 17p13 seemed to be more commonly involved in aggressive than nasal and nonnasal NK cell lymphomas. Our results suggested that consistent patterns of LOH could be defined in NK cell malignancies. These deleted loci may contain genes important in the initiation and progression of this lymphoma.","['Siu, L L', 'Chan, V', 'Chan, J K', 'Wong, K F', 'Liang, R', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Siu LL', 'Chan V', 'Chan JK', 'Wong KF', 'Liang R', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and the Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alleles', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2000/12/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/07 11:00'],"['2000/12/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/07 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2000 Dec;157(6):1803-9. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64818-3.,,"['S0002-9440(10)64818-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64818-3 [doi]']",PMC1885756,,,,,,,,,,,

Reductions in liposomal mitoxantrone accumulation in the liver were achieved either by use of poly(ethylene)glycol (PEG)-modified lipids or by methods designed to deplete liver phagocytes, a method referred to as hepatic mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) blockade. A 2-fold reduction in mitoxantrone delivery to the liver was obtained using a mitoxantrone formulation with PEG-modified lipids, and a 3-fold reduction was obtained when liposomal mitoxantrone was given to animals pretreated to induce hepatic MPS blockade. Results demonstrate that the liposomal mitoxantrone formulation prepared with PEG-modified lipids was significantly less active than the formulations that did not contain PEG lipids, with median survival times of 17 days and 100% 60-day survival, respectively. In contrast, hepatic MPS blockade had no effect on the therapeutic activity of 1,2-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (DMPC/Chol) mitoxantrone (100% 60-day survival). These data suggest that the hepatic MPS does not play a role in mediating the therapeutic activity of DMPC/Chol mitoxantrone in the treatment of liver localized disease. Results with formulations prepared with a PEG-stabilized surface, however, suggest that nonspecific methods to decrease liposome cell interactions inhibit the therapeutic activity of DMPC/Chol mitoxantrone.","['Lim, H J', 'Parr, M J', 'Masin, D', 'McIntosh, N L', 'Madden, T D', 'Zhang, G', 'Johnstone, S', 'Bally, M B']","['Lim HJ', 'Parr MJ', 'Masin D', 'McIntosh NL', 'Madden TD', 'Zhang G', 'Johnstone S', 'Bally MB']","['Department of Advanced Therapeutics, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'U86ZGC74V5 (Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cholesterol/administration & dosage', 'Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers', 'Kupffer Cells/*physiology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Phagocytes/physiology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage']",,2000/12/06 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/12/06 11:00'],"['2000/12/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Nov;6(11):4449-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin 2 (IL-2)-activated mononuclear cells from UCBCs showed increased cytotoxicity against K562 and Raji hematopoietic malignant cells compared with PBCs (P < 0.05). After IL-2 activation, both UCBCs and PBCs showed significant cytotoxicity against MDA-231 human breast cancer cells. The UCBC population involved in this antitumor activity appeared to be CD56+ natural killer precursors. The cytotoxicity of UCBCs was inhibited in the absence of Ca2+ (P < 0.05), supporting a perforin/granzyme-mediated target of cell lysis. In addition, antibodies to Fas ligand blocked cytotoxic activity, suggesting that some of the antitumor cytotoxicity was Fas ligand mediated. In vivo antitumor effects of UCBCs and PBCs were studied using a human leukemic cell-bearing severe combined immunodeficient mouse model. There was a significant increase in the survival of K562 leukemia-bearing mice that also received 5 million in vitro IL-2-activated UCBCs or PBCs i.v. on days 3 and day 5 after tumor transplantation compared with untreated mice (P < 0.01). Similar antitumor cytotoxicity of UCBCs and PBCs was also observed against MDA-231 human breast cancer grown in severe combined immunodeficient mice (P < 0.01).

In tumors of epithelial origin, E-cadherin expression frequently is reduced, an event that contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis. The role of E-cadherin in hematopoietic tissues is less clear. In normal bone marrow, E-cadherin is expressed on erythroid progenitors, CD34+ stem cells, and stromal cells, where it likely contributes to intercellular interactions during hematopoiesis. In this study, we used a nested-PCR approach to examine the methylation status of the E-cadherin 5' CpG island in blood and bone marrow samples from normal donors and in bone marrow from patients with acute leukemia. In normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow, E-cadherin was completely unmethylated. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, expression was evident by reverse transcription-PCR. Immunoblotting confirmed E-cadherin protein expression in two lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from normal donors. In contrast, E-cadherin was aberrantly methylated in 4 of 4 (100%) leukemia cell lines, 14 of 44 (32%) acute myelogenous leukemias, and 18 of 33 (53%) acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Genomic bisulfite sequencing of primary leukemias confirmed dense methylation across the CpG island. Methylation was associated with loss of E-cadherin RNA and protein in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemias. Following treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a methylated leukemia cell line expressed both E-cadherin transcript and protein. Our results show that methylation of E-cadherin occurs commonly in acute leukemia and suggests a hypothesis for E-cadherin down-regulation in leukemogenesis.","['Corn, P G', 'Smith, B D', 'Ruckdeschel, E S', 'Douglas, D', 'Baylin, S B', 'Herman, J G']","['Corn PG', 'Smith BD', 'Ruckdeschel ES', 'Douglas D', 'Baylin SB', 'Herman JG']","['The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Cadherins)'],IM,"['Cadherins/*genetics', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,2000/12/06 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/12/06 11:00'],"['2000/12/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Nov;6(11):4243-8.,,,,,"['CA-43318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Selective reduction of glutaminase activity by amino acid replacements at position 248.,2009-17,"The use of Escherichia coli asparaginase II as a drug for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is complicated by the significant glutaminase side activity of the enzyme. To develop enzyme forms with reduced glutaminase activity, a number of variants with amino acid replacements in the vicinity of the substrate binding site were constructed and assayed for their kinetic and stability properties. We found that replacements of Asp248 affected glutamine turnover much more strongly than asparagine hydrolysis. In the wild-type enzyme, N248 modulates substrate binding to a neighboring subunit by hydrogen bonding to side chains that directly interact with the substrate. In variant N248A, the loss of transition state stabilization caused by the mutation was 15 kJ mol(-1) for L-glutamine compared to 4 kJ mol(-1) for L-aspartic beta-hydroxamate and 7 kJ mol(-1) for L-asparagine. Smaller differences were seen with other N248 variants. Modeling studies suggested that the selective reduction of glutaminase activity is the result of small conformational changes that affect active-site residues and catalytically relevant water molecules.","['Derst, C', 'Henseling, J', 'Rohm, K H']","['Derst C', 'Henseling J', 'Rohm KH']","['Philipps University, Institute of Physiological Chemistry, Marburg (Lahn), Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Asparaginase/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Glutaminase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Engineering', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Thermodynamics']",,2000/12/06 11:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2000/12/06 11:00'],"['2000/12/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Protein Sci. 2000 Oct;9(10):2009-17. doi: 10.1110/ps.9.10.2009.,,['10.1110/ps.9.10.2009 [doi]'],PMC2144453,,,,,,,,,,,

A further 3.5 Gy electron boost to the fungating breast tumor was given to the 100%. Forty-eight hours after irradiation he developed hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia and renal failure.

Few reports have been published on patients treated with the anthracenedione mitoxantrone which also targets topoisomerase II. We observed 10 cases of such t-AML over a 7-year-period in breast cancer patients treated with mitoxantrone combined with fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and regional radiotherapy, and in three cases with vindesine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients referred to our hospital for AML with a past history of polychemotherapy for breast cancer, including mitoxantrone, either as adjuvant (8 patients)/neoadjuvant (1 patient) therapy or for metastatic disease (1 patient). We studied the probability of developing t-AML in a prospective series of 350 patients treated with an adjuvant FNC regimen (mitoxantrone, fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide) and radiation therapy. RESULTS: The median age was 45 years (range 35-67). t-AML developed 13-36 months (median 16) after beginning chemotherapy for breast cancer, and 4-28 months (median 10.5) after ending treatment. As described in t-AML following treatment with epipodophyllotoxins or anthracyclines, we found a majority of FAB M4, M5 and M3 phenotypes (7 of 10), and characteristic karyotype abnormalities that also can be found in de novo AML: breakpoint on chromosome 11q23 (3 patients), inv(16)(p13q22) (2 patients), t(15;17)(q22;q11) (1 patient), t(8;21)(q22;q22) (1 patient) and del(20q)(q11) (1 patient). The prognosis was poor. All patients died of AML shortly after diagnosis. Since two patients had been enrolled in a prospective trial for the treatment of breast cancer which included 350 patients, the probability of developing t-AML was calculated to be 0.7% from 25-40 months, using the Kaplan-Meier method (95%, confidence interval (95% CI): 0.1-4.5). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of mitoxantrone with cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy can induce t-AML, as with other topoisomerase II-targeted drugs. Despite a low incidence, the prognosis appears to be poor.","['Linassier, C', 'Barin, C', 'Calais, G', 'Letortorec, S', 'Bremond, J L', 'Delain, M', 'Petit, A', 'Georget, M T', 'Cartron, G', 'Raban, N', 'Benboubker, L', 'Leloup, R', 'Binet, C', 'Lamagnere, J P', 'Colombat, P']","['Linassier C', 'Barin C', 'Calais G', 'Letortorec S', 'Bremond JL', 'Delain M', 'Petit A', 'Georget MT', 'Cartron G', 'Raban N', 'Benboubker L', 'Leloup R', 'Binet C', 'Lamagnere JP', 'Colombat P']","['C.

Primarily large-breed dogs were affected, with an average age at initial diagnosis of 10 years (range 5-14 years). All dogs had persistent (>4 months) LGL lymphocytosis except for three that were euthanized with aggressive disease. Splenomegaly was reported in 12 of 20 dogs in which splenic size was evaluated. The clinical course was heterogeneous and dogs were divided into four groups based on similar clinical and hematologic findings: acute leukemia (3/25), persistent lymphocytosis with anemia (12/25), persistent lymphocytosis without anemia (8/25), and reactive lymphocytosis (2/25). Immunophenotypes varied within groups but were homogeneous among cells from the same patient except in the two dogs classified as reactive LGL lymphocytosis. Analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) usage identified three main LGL lineages. TCRalphabeta was expressed in 15/25 (60%) cases. TCRgammadelta was expressed in 8/25 (32%) cases, and 2/25 (8%) cases were CD3-, compatible with NK cells. beta2 integrin expression was distinctive. CD11a was consistently expressed, while CD11b was absent. CD11c was expressed only weakly in 16/25 (64%) cases. The leukointegrin alphadbeta2 was highly prevalent on all LGL lineages, being expressed in 23/25 (92%) cases. Prominent involvement of the spleen, relative sparing of bone marrow, an unexpectedly large proportion of gammadelta T-cell LGLs, and the distinctive beta2 integrin expression pattern on diverse lineages of LGLs suggest the disease arises from unique populations of lymphocytes that preferentially localize in the splenic red pulp.","['McDonough, S P', 'Moore, P F']","['McDonough SP', 'Moore PF']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, USA. spm13@cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD18 Antigens/analysis', 'Dog Diseases/*immunology/*pathology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Sex Factors', 'Spleen/pathology']",,2000/12/06 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2000/12/06 11:00'],"['2000/12/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2000 Nov;37(6):637-46. doi: 10.1354/vp.37-6-637.,,['10.1354/vp.37-6-637 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

TSP/HAM is characterized by a chronic progressive paraparesis with sphincter disturbances, no/mild sensory loss, the absence of spinal cord compression and seropositivity for HTLV-I antibodies. The pathogenesis of this entity is not completely known and involves a multivariable phenomenon of immune system activation against the presence of HTLV-I antigens, leading to an inflammatory process and demyelination, mainly in the thoracic spinal cord. The current hypothesis about the pathogenesis of TSP/HAM is: 1) presence of HTLV-I antigens in the lumbar spinal cord, noted by an increased DNA HTLV-I load; 2) CTL either with their lytic functions or release/production of soluble factors, such as CC-chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules; 3) the presence of Tax gene expression that activates T-cell proliferation or induces an inflammatory process in the spinal cord; 4) the presence of B cells with neutralizing antibody production, or complement activation by an immune complex phenomenon, and 5) lower IL-2 and IFN-gamma production and increased IL-10, indicating drive to a cytokine type 2 pattern in the TSP/HAM subjects and the existence of a genetic background such as some HLA haplotypes. All of these factors should be implicated in TSP/HAM and further studies are necessary to investigate their role in the development of TSP/HAM.","['Casseb, J', 'Penalva-de-Oliveira, A C']","['Casseb J', 'Penalva-de-Oliveira AC']","['Instituto de Molestias Infecciosas Emilio Ribas, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil. j31@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)']",IM,"['Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Viral/immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Virus Integration']",40,2000/12/06 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2000/12/06 11:00'],"['2000/12/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2000 Dec;33(12):1395-401. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2000001200001.,,"['S0100-879X2000001200001 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2000001200001 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the process of B-1 cell migration and differentiation in vivo. We developed a mouse line by crossing the antierythrocyte antibody Tg mice (HL mice) with TCR-gamma/delta Tg mice specific for a self-thymus leukemia (TL) antigen in the recombination activating gene (RAG)2(-/-) background. In the presence of the self-antigen, Tg gamma/delta T cells increased in number and manifested activated phenotypes. Peritoneal B-1 cells in these mice migrated into mesenteric lymph nodes and differentiated into autoantibody-secreting cells, resulting in strong autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, transfer of RAG2(-/-) x HL bone marrow or peritoneal cells into the peritoneal cavity of RAG2(-/-) x TCR-gamma/delta Tg mice gave rise to donor-derived B-1 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, and these cells produced the autoantibody. Thus, this study demonstrates that the migration of B-1 cells and differentiation into the antibody-secreting cells can be induced by noncognate T cell help and implies the possibility that gamma/delta T cells may induce B-1 cell differentiation in vivo.","['Watanabe, N', 'Ikuta, K', 'Fagarasan, S', 'Yazumi, S', 'Chiba, T', 'Honjo, T']","['Watanabe N', 'Ikuta K', 'Fagarasan S', 'Yazumi S', 'Chiba T', 'Honjo T']","['Department of Medical Chemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Anemia/immunology', 'Animals', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Haplotypes', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mesentery', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",,2000/12/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/06 11:00'],"['2000/12/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2000 Dec 4;192(11):1577-86. doi: 10.1084/jem.192.11.1577.,,['10.1084/jem.192.11.1577 [doi]'],PMC2193102,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that the proinflammatory cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), affects the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) by stimulating in vitro and in vivo pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression and ACTH secretion and by potentiating the action of hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Whereas pathways shown thus far to regulate POMC expression exclusively involve cAMP or calcium, we here describe a direct and indirect STAT3-dependent regulation of POMC transcription by LIF. Using progressive 5'-deletions of POMC promoter, we identified a LIF-responsive -407/-301 region that contains two juxtaposed sequences within -399/-379 related to a STAT3 DNA-binding motif. Each sequence within -399/-379 separately corresponds to a low-affinity and direct binding site for STAT3, but, in combination, these sequences bind STAT3 cooperatively and with high affinity. Moreover, LIF-activated STAT3 indirectly mediates LIF corticotroph action by inducing and potentiating CRH-induced c-fos and JunB expression and binding to the POMC AP-1 element. We therefore conclude that both a direct and indirect route mediate LIF-induced STAT3 activation of POMC transcription. Demonstration of STAT3-dependent regulation of the POMC gene represents a powerful mechanism for immuno-neuroendocrine interfacing and implies a direct stimulation of ACTH secretion by inflammatory and stress-derived STAT3-inducing cytokines.","['Bousquet, C', 'Zatelli, M C', 'Melmed, S']","['Bousquet C', 'Zatelli MC', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nr4a2 protein, rat)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, rat)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Immune System/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Neurosecretory Systems/physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/06 11:00'],"['2000/12/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2000 Dec;106(11):1417-25. doi: 10.1172/JCI11182.,,['10.1172/JCI11182 [doi]'],PMC381469,,['R01-DK50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of protein kinase C (PKC) on RGS proteins in various T cell lines by treating them with PMA. mRNA levels of both RGS16 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) were found to be up-regulated in CEM leukaemia cells in a PKC-dependent manner. Mezerein, a non-phorbol-ester activator of PKC, also elevated RGS16 and TNFalpha mRNA levels, while the specific PKC inhibitor Go6983 abrogated their expression. In view of the slower kinetics of PMA-induced RGS16 expression and the tight correlation between TNFalpha and RGS16 mRNA induction among the cell lines studied, we suggest that activation of PKC up-regulates RGS16 via TNFalpha. Indeed, addition of recombinant TNFalpha to CEM cells rapidly stimulated RGS16 mRNA expression independently of PKC. Furthermore, mobilization of calcium by A23187 and thapsigargin blocked the TNFalpha-mediated induction of RGS16, which was reversed by EGTA and by the immunosuppressants FK506 and cyclosporin A, suggesting that the calcineurin/NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) pathway may repress the up-regulation process. Our results demonstrate for the first time that activation of PKC induces RGS16 expression via TNFalpha in a calcium-sensitive manner, thereby implicating RGS16 in the regulation of T cell responses to inflammation.","['Fong, C W', 'Zhang, Y', 'Neo, S Y', 'Lin, S C']","['Fong CW', 'Zhang Y', 'Neo SY', 'Lin SC']","['Regulatory Biology Group, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 30 Medical Drive, Singapore 117609.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RGS Proteins)', '0 (RGS16 protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcineurin/metabolism', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RGS Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tacrolimus/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Wortmannin']",,2000/12/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/06 11:00'],"['2000/12/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2000 Dec 15;352 Pt 3:747-53.,,,PMC1221513,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of SCID-HSB-2 mice with HB2-SAPORIN led to a significant prolongation in the time to development of signs and symptoms of disease compared with PBS sham-treated controls with 80% of animals surviving disease-free. In contrast treatment with HB2-F(ab)(2)-SAPORIN was significantly less effective in SCID-HSB-2 mice with 80% of animals in this treatment group developing leukaemia over the course of the study. HB2 antibody treatment of SCID-HSB-2 mice also led to a significant prolongation in time to leukaemia development compared with sham-treated controls with 37% of animals in this treatment group disease-free at termination of the study. In contrast HB2 antibody treatment of NOD/SCID-HSB-2 mice had no therapeutic effect in these animals and the therapeutic effectiveness of both HB2-SAPORIN and HB2-F(ab)(2)-SAPORIN ITs was similar and significantly reduced compared to the effect observed in SCID-HSB-2 mice. It was initially thought that the lack of therapeutic effect of antibody and IT in NOD-SCID-HSB-2 mice might relate to their putative lack of NK cells but flow cytometric and functional studies with NOD-SCID mouse splenocytes revealed that these animals do have some functional NK cells though fewer in number and possibly lower in functionality than those of SCID mice. We reason that the complete lack of therapeutic effect of HB2 antibody and the reduced effect of HB2-SAPORIN in NOD/SCID mice is due to the reduced cytolytic activity of NOD/SCID NK cells which is probably below a certain critical threshold value in these animals.

Analysis Of a population of 1545 children treated by the French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Group (FRALLE).",1617-22,"Many cutpoints have been proposed to categorize continuous variables in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (white blood cell count, peripheral blast cell count, haemoglobin level, platelet count and age), and have been used to define therapeutic subgroups. This variation in the choice of cutpoints leads to a bias called the 'Will Rogers phenomenon'. The aim of this study was to analyse variations in the relative risk of relapse or death as a function of continuous prognostic variables in childhood ALL and to discuss the choice of cutpoints. We studied a population of 1545 children with ALL enrolled in three consecutive protocols named FRALLE 83, FRALLE 87 and FRALLE 89. We estimated the risk of relapse or death associated with different values of each continuous prognostic variable by dividing the sample into quintiles of the distribution of the variables. As regards age, a category of children under 1 year of age was distinguished and the rest of the population was divided into quintiles. The floated variance method was used to calculate the confidence interval of each relative risk, including the reference category. The relation between the quantitative prognostic factors and the risk was monotonic for each variable, except for age. For the white blood cell count (WBC), the relation is log linear. The risk associated with WBC values in the upper quintile was 1.9 times higher than that in the lower quintile. The peripheral blast cell count correlated strongly with WBC (correlation coefficient: 0.99). The risk increased with the haemoglobin level, and the risk in the upper quintile was 1.3 times higher than that in the lower quintile. The risk decreased as the platelet count increased: the risk in the lower quintile was 1.2 times higher than that in the upper quintile. The risk increased gradually with increasing age above one year. The small subgroup of patients (2.5% of the population) under 1 year of age at diagnosis had a risk 2.6 times higher than the reference category of patients between 3 and 4.3 years of age. When the risk associated with a quantitative prognostic factor varies monotonously, the selection of a cutpoint is arbitrary and represents a loss of information. Despite this loss of information, such arbitrary categorization may be necessary to define therapeutic stratification. In that case, consensus cutpoints must be defined if one wants to avoid the Will Rogers phenomenon. The cutpoints proposed by the Rome workshop and the NCI are arbitrary, but may represent an acceptable convention.","['Donadieu, J', 'Auclerc, M F', 'Baruchel, A', 'Perel, Y', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Landman-Parker, J', 'Leblanc, T', 'Cornu, G', 'Sommelet, D', 'Leverger, G', 'Schaison, G', 'Hill, C']","['Donadieu J', 'Auclerc MF', 'Baruchel A', 'Perel Y', 'Bordigoni P', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Leblanc T', 'Cornu G', 'Sommelet D', 'Leverger G', 'Schaison G', 'Hill C']","[""Departement de Biostatistique et d'epidemiologie, Institut Gustave Roussy, rue Camille Desmoulins, Villejuif, 94800, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemoglobins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,2000/12/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/06 11:00'],"['2000/12/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/06 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2000 Dec;83(12):1617-22. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1504.,,"['10.1054/bjoc.2000.1504 [doi]', 'S0007092000915040 [pii]']",PMC2363446,,,,['French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Group (FRALLE)'],,,['Copyright 2000 Cancer Research Campaign.'],,,,

W. Taub et al., Blood, 87: 3395-3403, 1996). The cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) gene (localized to chromosome 21q22.3) may have downstream effects on reduced folate and S-adenosylmethionine pathways; ara-C metabolism and folate pools are linked by the known synergistic effect of sequential methotrexate and ara-C therapy. We have shown that relative CBS transcripts were significantly higher in DS compared with non-DS myeloblasts, and CBS transcript levels correlated with in vitro ara-C sensitivity (J. W. Taub et al., Blood, 94: 1393-1400, 1999). A leukemia cell line model to study the relationship of the CBS gene and ara-C metabolism/sensitivity was developed by transfecting CBS-null CCRF-CEM cells with the CBS cDNA. CBS-transfected cells were a median 15-fold more sensitive in vitro to ara-C compared with wild-type cells and generated 8.5-fold higher [3H]ara-C triphosphate levels after in vitro incubation with [3H]ara-C. Severe combined immunodeficient mice implanted with CBS-transfected CEM cells demonstrated greater responsiveness to therapy, reflected in significantly prolonged survivals after ara-C administration compared with mice implanted with wild-type cells and treated with the same dosage schedule. The transfected cells also demonstrated increased in vitro and in vivo sensitivity to gemcitabine. Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) activity was approximately 22-fold higher in transfected CEM cells compared with wild-type cells. However, levels of dCK transcripts on Northern blots and protein levels on Western blots were nearly identical between CBS-transfected and wild-type cells. Collectively, these results suggest a posttranscriptional regulation of dCK in CBS-overexpressing cells that contributes to increased ara-C phosphorylation and drug activity. Further elucidating the mechanisms of increased sensitivity of DS cells to ara-C related to the CBS gene may lead to the application of these novel approaches to acute myeloid leukemia therapy for non-DS patients.","['Taub, J W', 'Huang, X', 'Ge, Y', 'Dutcher, J A', 'Stout, M L', 'Mohammad, R M', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Matherly, L H']","['Taub JW', 'Huang X', 'Ge Y', 'Dutcher JA', 'Stout ML', 'Mohammad RM', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Matherly LH']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit 48201, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 4.2.1.22 (Cystathionine beta-Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/enzymology/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, SCID', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2000/12/05 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/05 11:00'],"['2000/12/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/05 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Nov 15;60(22):6421-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we elucidated the role of this kinase in the programmed cell death induced by the nucleoside analogue 9-beta-D-arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A). Treatment of ML-1 cells with 3 or 10 microM F-ara-A specifically killed cells in the S-phase of the population. Incorporation of F-ara-ATP, the nucleoside triphosphate of F-ara-A, into DNA resulted in the activation of JNK1 in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Activation of JNK1 temporally preceded DNA fragmentation. When incorporation of F-ara-A into DNA was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with aphidicolin to inhibit DNA synthesis, neither JNK1 signaling nor apoptosis was evident. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK1 by treatment of the cells with forskolin or by pretreatment with an antisense oligonucleotide directed against JNK1 mRNA resulted in a decrease in F-ara-A-induced apoptosis. Finally, the JNK1 signaling pathway appeared to be upstream to that of the effector caspases in nucleoside analogue-induced apoptosis. Thus, our data strongly suggest that JNK1 is involved in transduction of F-ara-A-induced distress signals into an apoptotic response.","['Sampath, D', 'Plunkett, W']","['Sampath D', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

Mitochondrial dysfunction occurred in GALV-FMG-induced syncytia prior to loss of viability with loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular ATP depletion, and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c-GFP into the cytosol. The pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, did not prevent cell death. However, glycolytic generation of ATP with fructose effectively increased cellular ATP and preserved syncytial viability. These data suggest that expression of FMG in hepatoma cells results in the formation of multinucleated syncytia, causing mitochondrial failure with ATP depletion, a bioenergetic form of cell death with necrosis. This form of cell death should be effective in vivo and enhance the bystander effect, suggesting that FMG-based gene therapy deserves further study for the treatment of hepatocellular and other cancers.","['Higuchi, H', 'Bronk, S F', 'Bateman, A', 'Harrington, K', 'Vile, R G', 'Gores, G J']","['Higuchi H', 'Bronk SF', 'Bateman A', 'Harrington K', 'Vile RG', 'Gores GJ']","['Center for Basic Research in Digestive Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '30237-26-4 (Fructose)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Cell Fusion/methods', 'Energy Metabolism/physiology', 'Fructose/pharmacology', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Giant Cells/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Mitochondria, Liver/metabolism/physiology', 'Necrosis', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,2000/12/05 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/05 11:00'],"['2000/12/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/05 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Nov 15;60(22):6396-402.,,,,,"['DK41876/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA85931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

However, it is known to have several adverse effects, including acute cardiac toxicities. OBJECTIVE: To determine cardiac toxicities resulting from arsenic trioxide therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia. DESIGN: Phase II clinical prospective cohort study. SETTING: A university hospital in Hamamatsu, Japan. PATIENTS: 8 patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia. INTERVENTION: Arsenic trioxide, 0.15 mg/kg of body weight, administered daily by 2-hour infusion for a maximum of 60 days. MEASUREMENTS: Continuous monitoring with ambulatory electrocardiography. RESULTS: Five patients (63%) achieved complete remission. During induction therapy with arsenic trioxide, prolonged QT intervals were observed in all patients. Ventricular premature contractions were noticed during 8 of 12 courses of therapy. Four patients developed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and required treatment with antiarrhythmic agents. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac toxicity occurs during arsenic trioxide therapy in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Such patients should be monitored for prolonged QT intervals and ventricular arrhythmia.","['Ohnishi, K', 'Yoshida, H', 'Shigeno, K', 'Nakamura, S', 'Fujisawa, S', 'Naito, K', 'Shinjo, K', 'Fujita, Y', 'Matsui, H', 'Takeshita, A', 'Sugiyama, S', 'Satoh, H', 'Terada, H', 'Ohno, R']","['Ohnishi K', 'Yoshida H', 'Shigeno K', 'Nakamura S', 'Fujisawa S', 'Naito K', 'Shinjo K', 'Fujita Y', 'Matsui H', 'Takeshita A', 'Sugiyama S', 'Satoh H', 'Terada H', 'Ohno R']","['Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 3600 Handa-cho, Hamamatsu 431-3192, Japan. kohnishi@hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects', 'Electrocardiography, Ambulatory', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Long QT Syndrome/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tachycardia, Ventricular/*chemically induced']",,2000/12/05 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/05 11:00'],"['2000/12/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/05 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 2000 Dec 5;133(11):881-5. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-133-11-200012050-00012.,,"['200012050-00012 [pii]', '10.7326/0003-4819-133-11-200012050-00012 [doi]']",,,,['Ann Intern Med. 2001 Nov 6;135(9):842-3.

The latter are included in a wide variety of cancer chemotherapy protocols. Due to these biological activities, lignans, and especially cyclolignans, have been the objective of numerous studies focused to prepare better and safer anticancer drugs. The mechanism by which podophyllotoxin blocks cell division is related to its inhibition of microtubule assembly in the mitotic apparatus. However, etoposide and teniposide were shown not to be inhibitors of microtubule assembly which suggested that their antitumor properties were due to another mechanism of action, via their interaction with DNA and inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II. Other podophyllotoxin derivatives has also been reported which retained or even improved the cytotoxic activity, but these were weak inhibitors of topoisomerase II in vitro; the data revealed that such analogs exhibit a different, as yet unknown, mechanism of action. The main deficiency of these compounds is their cytotoxicity for normal cells and hence side effects derived from their lack of selectivity against tumoral cells. In this regard it is necessary to investigate and prepare new more potent and less toxic analogs, that is, with better therapeutic indices. It is well accepted from structure-activity studies in this field that the trans-lactones are more potent as antineoplastics than the cis-lactones. Not only the configuration of the D ring is an important factor for high cytotoxic activity, but also a quasi-axial arrangement of the E ring is necessary. On this basis, studies on lignans have been addressed to modify the lactone moiety and prepare analogs with heteroatoms at different positions of the cyclolignan skeleton. Our group has been working during the last few years on chemical transformations of podophyllotoxin and analogs and we have prepared a large number of cyclolignan derivatives some of which display potent antiviral, immunosuppressive and cytotoxic activities. We have reported several new cytotoxic agents with nitrogen atoms at C-7 or C-9 or at both C-7 and C-9: imine derivatives, oxime derivatives, pyrazoline-, pyrazo- and isoxazoline-fused cyclolignans. At present, we are preparing mainly new compounds by modifications of the A and E cyclolignan-rings. They are being tested on cultures of different tumoral cell lines (P-388 murine leukemia, A-549 human lung carcinoma, HT-29 human colon carcinoma and MEL-28 human melanoma) and some of them have shown an interesting and selective cytotoxicity.","['Gordaliza, M', 'Castro, M A', 'del Corral, J M', 'Feliciano, A S']","['Gordaliza M', 'Castro MA', 'del Corral JM', 'Feliciano AS']","['Departamento de Quimica Farmaceutica, Facultad de Farmacia.

The Canadian Fluconazole Study.,1001-8,"Fungal colonization profiles from four different anatomical sites were evaluated in 266 neutropenic cancer patients receiving intensive cytotoxic therapy for acute leukaemia or for autologous marrow transplantation. At the beginning of chemotherapy patients were allocated randomly to receive oral fluconazole 400 mg daily or an identical placebo until prophylaxis failure or marrow recovery. Candida albicans colonization was reduced from 30 to 10% in the fluconazole recipients while it increased from 32 to 57% in the placebo patients (P<0.001). By the end of prophylaxis, colonization with non-albicans Candida species increased from 7 to 21% and 8 to 18% in the fluconazole and placebo patients, respectively (P = 0.396). Although Candida glabrata was isolated more frequently at the end of the prophylactic period in the fluconazole patients than in the placebo patients (16 versus 7%), only one definite invasive C. glabrata infection was noted. Overall, definite invasive fungal infections were documented in 26 patients [four fluconazole versus 22 placebo patients (P< or =0.001)]. In 23 (92%) patients the infections were caused by persistently colonizing or newly acquired organisms. While probable invasive fungal infections were noted in five fluconazole patients, 10 placebo patients were also affected (P = 0.19). An end-of-prophylaxis colonization index >0.25 was 76% sensitive but only 69% specific for invasive fungal infection. However, a colonization index < or =0.25 at baseline had a negative predictive value of 88% for development of invasive fungal infection.

The Placental Blood Program of the New York Blood Center has developed techniques for collecting, testing, freezing and searching units on behalf of unrelated patients in need of hematopoietic stem cell replacement since 1993 and provided analysis of the outcomes of these transplants identified variables associated with clinical outcomes. In this review, after considering practical and conceptual aspects of the technology, we update information on the clinical outcomes of these transplants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 861 patients transplanted through 1999 with PCB from our Program are included in this report. Two thirds were diagnosed with leukaemia or lymphoma, 25% with inherited conditions and 7% with acquired diseases. Outcome data were provided by the respective Transplant Center and analyses included both univariate and multivariate regression tests and actuarial (Kaplan-Meier) techniques. RESULTS: Engraftment was achieved by over 90% of recipients (Kaplan-Meier estimate). Multivariate analysis confirmed the influence of cell dose, HLA matching, disease diagnosis and transplant center location (US vs. foreign). Patient age and HLA match grade independently affected the frequency and severity of acute graft vs. host disease. Leukaemic relapse was associated with the stage of disease at transplantation and the prior existence of acute graft vs. host disease. The probability of transplant-related events was independently associated with disease diagnosis, cell dose, number of HLA mismatches and transplant center, while the cell dose failed to associate significantly with the relative risk of reaching this endpoint in the subset of patients who achieved engraftment. Overall, event-free survival rates at one year post-transplant were 49 and 30%, respectively for genetic disease and haematologic malignancies and 35% for patients with acquired diseases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm and extend earlier data, particularly establishing the significant association of transplant success with histocompatibility matching grades, and indicatng the urgency of improving the transplant match levels.","['Rubinstein, P', 'Stevens, C E']","['Rubinstein P', 'Stevens CE']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, New York Blood Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Bailliere's best practice & research.

To isolate viruses that are resistant to these manufacturing processes, we performed breeding of six ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) strains by DNA shuffling. The envelope regions were shuffled to generate a recombinant library of 5 x 106 replication-competent retroviruses. This library was subjected to the concentration process three consecutive times, with amplification of the surviving viruses after each cycle. Several viral clones with greatly improved stabilities were isolated, with the best clone exhibiting no loss in titer under conditions that reduced the titers of the parental viruses by 30- to 100-fold. The envelopes of these resistant viruses differed in DNA and protein sequence, and all were complex chimeras derived from multiple parents. These studies demonstrate the utility of DNA shuffling in breeding viral strains with improved characteristics for gene therapy.","['Powell, S K', 'Kaloss, M A', 'Pinkstaff, A', 'McKee, R', 'Burimski, I', 'Pensiero, M', 'Otto, E', 'Stemmer, W P', 'Soong, N W']","['Powell SK', 'Kaloss MA', 'Pinkstaff A', 'McKee R', 'Burimski I', 'Pensiero M', 'Otto E', 'Stemmer WP', 'Soong NW']","['Genetic Therapy Inc.

ICRAC was monitored at -80 mV from fast voltage ramps, spanning 200 mV in 50 ms. At hyperpolarised potentials, the macroscopic CRAC conductance was lower than that seen at depolarised potentials. The conductance increased almost 5-fold over the voltage range -60 to +40 mV and was seen when the stores were depleted either by the combination of IP3 and thapsigargin in high Ca2+ buffer, or passively with 10 mM EGTA or BAPTA. The voltage-dependent conductance of the CRAC channels could not be fully accounted for by Ca2+-dependent fast inactivation, nor by other slower inhibitory mechanisms. It also did not seem to involve intracellular Mg2+ or the polycations spermine and spermidine. Voltage step relaxation experiments revealed that the voltage-dependent conductance changes developed and reversed slowly, with a time constant of several seconds at -60 mV. In the presence of physiological levels of intracellular Ca2+ buffers, ICRAC was barely detectable when cells were clamped at -60 mV and dialysed with IP3 and thapsigargin, but at 0 mV the current in low Ca2+ buffer was as large as that seen in high Ca2+ buffer. Our results suggest that CRAC channels exhibit slow voltage-dependent conductance changes which can triple the current amplitude over the physiological range of voltages normally encountered by these cells. The role of this conductance change and possible underlying mechanisms are discussed.","['Bakowski, D', 'Parekh, A B']","['Bakowski D', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', '*Electric Conductivity', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', '*Membrane Potentials', 'Models, Biological', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/02 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/02 11:00'],"['2000/12/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/02 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 2000 Dec 1;529 Pt 2:295-306. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.00295.x.,,"['PHY_11113 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.00295.x [doi]']",PMC2270208,,,,,,,,,,,

Crosslinking by multivalent antigen results in the aggregation of the bound IgE/alpha-chain complexes at the cell surface, triggering cell activation, and subsequent internalization through coated pits. However, the precise topographical alterations of the signaling beta- and gamma-chains during stimulation remain unclarified despite their importance in ligand binding/signaling coupling. Here we describe the dynamics of FcepsilonRI subunit distribution in rat basophilic leukemia cells during stimulation as revealed by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. Immunolocalization of beta- and gamma-chains was homogeneously distributed on the cell surfaces before stimulation, while crosslinking with multivalent antigen, which elicited optimal degranulation, caused a distinct aggregation of these signaling chains on the cell membrane. Moreover, only gamma- but not beta-chains were aggregated during the stimulation that evoked suboptimal secretion. These findings suggest that high-affinity IgE receptor beta- and gamma-chains do not co-aggregate but for the most part form homogenous aggregates of beta-chains or gamma-chains after crosslinking.","['Asai, K', 'Fujimoto, K', 'Harazaki, M', 'Kusunoki, T', 'Korematsu, S', 'Ide, C', 'Ra, C', 'Hosoi, S']","['Asai K', 'Fujimoto K', 'Harazaki M', 'Kusunoki T', 'Korematsu S', 'Ide C', 'Ra C', 'Hosoi S']","['Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Freeze Fracturing', 'Membranes', 'Microscopy, Electron/methods', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/chemistry/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/02 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/02 11:00'],"['2000/12/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/02 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 2000 Dec;48(12):1705-16. doi: 10.1177/002215540004801213.,,['10.1177/002215540004801213 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,
