PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with established diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia were treated with Imatinib mesylate. Adverse events were documented with regular follow ups. Hematological and cytogenetic responses were assessed according to established criteria. Patients with zero percent Philadelphia positive metaphases were labeled as complete cytogenetic response while patients with 1% to 35% Philadelphia positive metaphases were termed as partial responders. RESULTS: Of 11 cases there were 7 males and 4 females with a mean age of 39.5 years and median age 51 years (range 21-69). Male to female ratio was 7:4. Median follow-up was 34 weeks (range 8-78). Four patients were in blast crisis, 1 in accelerated phase and remaining six patients were in chronic phase. All patients achieved hematological response. Cytogenetic response was present in six patients, 3 were responders and the remaining were non responders. Two patients achieved complete cytogenetic response and one patient had partial cytogenetic response. Both patients with complete cytogenetic response relapsed in twelve weeks time. CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate is a drug with curative potential and can be used as a first line drug in the management of CML, however at present the cure rate is unknown.","['Usman, M', 'Kakepoto, G N', 'Adil, S N', 'Sajid, R', 'Arain, S', 'Khurshid, M']","['Usman M', 'Kakepoto GN', 'Adil SN', 'Sajid R', 'Arain S', 'Khurshid M']","['Department of Pathology, The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Pak Med Assoc,JPMA.

METHODS: Thirty pediatric cancer patients with either leukemia or lymphoma were randomly selected from 3 medical centers. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the difference between pre- and post-oral hygiene care. Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used to analyze the data. The interrater agreement between the nurse and the dentist was calculated using a Kappa score. A paired t test was to examine the difference between pre- and post-oral hygiene care regimen. RESULTS: The OAG scores ranged from 8 to 24. The higher the score, the more severe the oral complications. Ninety-six percent of the participants had a score > or = 9, on the pre-test, 26.7% had an OAG score > or = 12. Oral complications included ulcerated mucous membranes, dry lips, deeper or raspy voice, and oral debris. No scores were > or = 12 on the OAG following the posttest. The oral hygiene care regimen significantly improved oral assessment among patients (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The authors postulate that the OAG and oral hygiene care regimen may be clinically useful in improving oral assessment and hygiene in children with cancer during and after chemotherapy, thus decreasing associated infection and enhancing patient comfort.","['Chen, Chia-Feng', 'Wang, Ru-Hwa', 'Cheng, Shin-Nan', 'Chang, Yue-Cune']","['Chen CF', 'Wang RH', 'Cheng SN', 'Chang YC']","['Department of Nursing, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. chencf33@ms35.hinet.net']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Models, Nursing', 'Mouth Mucosa', ""Nurse's Role"", 'Nursing Assessment/*methods/standards', 'Nursing Evaluation Research', 'Observer Variation', 'Oncology Nursing/methods', '*Oral Hygiene/methods/nursing', 'Oral Hygiene Index', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Pediatric Nursing/methods', '*Stomatitis/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Taiwan']",2004/04/03 05:00,2004/04/29 05:00,['2004/04/03 05:00'],"['2004/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1043454203259947 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2004 Jan;21(1):33-9. doi: 10.1177/1043454203259947.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This information underpins vaccine design and delivery, as well as attempts to immunomodulate autoimmune disease. Results from studies using anticancer DNA vaccines, which include appropriate signals for both the innate and adaptive immune response, were presented in several talks. The vaccines incorporated helper epitopes and cancer target epitopes such as immunoglobulin idiotypes (for lymphomas and myelomas), melanoma-associated antigens (for melanoma and other solid tumors) and minor histocompatibility antigens (for leukemia). The results of using vaccines employing similar principles and designed to reduce viral load in HIV/AIDS patients were also presented. The introduction of suicide genes incorporating the bacterial enzyme nitroreductase gene (ntr) targeted at tumor cells prior to administration of the prodrug CB-1954, converted by ntr into a toxic alkylating agent, was discussed against the background of clinical trials and improved suicide gene design. The introduction into hematopoietic stem cells of missing genes for the common gamma-chain, deficiency of which causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), used similar retroviral transduction. The outcome of treating six SCID patients in the UK, and ten in France was successful immune reconstitution in the majority of patients, but in two of the French cases a complication of lymphoproliferative disease due to insertional mutagenesis was observed. The adoptive transfer of T-cells specific for minor histocompatibility antigens (for leukemia), cytomegalovirus (CMV; for CMV infection following stem cell transplantation) and selected Epstein-Barr virus-encoded antigens (for nasopharyngeal carcinoma) were discussed in relation to the source of specifically primed T-cells or the possibility of transducing recipient T-cells with high-affinity, antigen-specific T-cell receptor genes.","['Simpson, Elizabeth']",['Simpson E'],"['Imperial College, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Hammersmith Hospital, London, W12 ONN, UK. elizabeth.simpson@csc.mrc.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Congress'],England,IDrugs,IDrugs : the investigational drugs journal,100883655,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']","['Animals', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/physiology', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Vaccines, DNA/therapeutic use', 'Virus Diseases/immunology/therapy']",2004/04/02 05:00,2004/05/28 05:00,['2004/04/02 05:00'],"['2004/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IDrugs. 2004 Feb;7(2):105-8.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While analyzing rearranged V(H)DJ(H) and V(L)J(L) genes of 25 non-IgM-producing B-CLL cases, we found five IgG(+) cases that display strikingly similar BCRs (use of the same H- and L-chain V gene segments with unique, shared heavy chain third complementarity-determining region [HCDR3] and light chain third complementarity-determining region [LCDR3] motifs). These H- and L-chain characteristics were not identified in other B-CLL cases or in normal B lymphocytes whose sequences are available in the public databases. Three-dimensional modeling studies suggest that these BCRs could bind the same antigenic epitope.

In 53 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we serially assessed asparagine concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma as well as serum anti-asparaginase antibodies. All patients received native Escherichia coli (Elspar) asparaginase during induction therapy; patients received PEG asparaginase during reinductions when available, and those who developed allergy received Erwinia asparaginase. All eight patients who developed clinical evidence of allergy to asparaginase had anti-asparaginase antibodies. Among patients who had no antibodies, those who received E. coli had lower mean (+/-s.d.) CSF asparagine (0.29+/-0.63, n=9) than those who received PEG (0.77+/-0.82, n=4) (P=0.007). Results were similar for plasma asparagine. There was no situation where asparagine concentrations were more effectively depleted by PEG than by other preparations. None of the five patients who developed thrombosis had an allergy or antibodies to asparaginase at the time of the thrombosis. We conclude that asparagine concentrations were less effectively depleted by PEG than by E. coli asparaginase at the doses commonly used.

In addition, flow cytometric analysis of smenospongine-treated K562 cells with FITC-labeled glycophorin A antibody showed an increase of glycophorin A expression, a marker for erythroid differentiation. Cell-cycle analysis showed G1 arrest in K562 cells after treatment with smenospongine for 24 h. The effect on expression of CIP/KIP family cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors was investigated by Western blotting analysis and the result showed increased expression of p21, which is known to play an important role in differentiation. Furthermore, smenospongine was also found to inhibit the phosphorylation of Crkl, a substrate of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, which is known as a causative protein of CML. In conclusion, our investigation indicated that smenospongine induced the differentiation of K562 cells into erythroblasts along with cell-cycle arrest at G1 phase and the mechanism might be attributed to the increased expression of p21.","['Aoki, Shunji', 'Kong, Dexin', 'Matsui, Kouhei', 'Kobayashi, Motomasa']","['Aoki S', 'Kong D', 'Matsui K', 'Kobayashi M']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (smenospongine)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']","['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Glycophorins/biosynthesis', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Indonesia', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Porifera/*chemistry', 'Quinones/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2004/04/02 05:00,2004/09/11 05:00,['2004/04/02 05:00'],"['2004/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['00001813-200404000-00009 [pii]', '10.1097/00001813-200404000-00009 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2004 Apr;15(4):363-9. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200404000-00009.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A critical review of the integrated data generated in our marine-derived anticancer program seems to confirm such expentancies. ET-743 (Yondelis) represents the first new agent developed against advanced pretreated soft tissue sarcoma in the past 25 years, and also harbors activity in women bearing pretreated ovarian cancer and a solid potential in combination therapy. The lack of cumulative toxicities makes this compound suitable for long-lasting therapies, reversible transaminitis being the most prevalent toxicity. Aplidin has shown a positive therapeutic index in phase I trials and phase II studies are ongoing. In contrast to the lack of bone marrow toxicity, a set of translational results anticipates a potential in leukemia. Kahalalide F has also successfully completed the phase I program in solid tumors with evidence of activity in resistant tumors and phase II studies are under way.

Despite the well established role of STI571 in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, the precise mechanisms by which inhibition of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity results in generation of antileukemic responses remain unknown. In the present study we provide evidence that treatment of CML-derived BCR-ABL-expressing leukemia cells with STI571 results in activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. Our data indicate that STI571 induces phosphorylation of the p38 and activation of its kinase domain, in KT-1 cells and other BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines. We also identify the kinases MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 and Msk1 as two downstream effectors of p38, activated during inhibition of BCR-ABL activity by STI571. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of p38 reverses the growth inhibitory effects of STI571 on primary leukemic colony-forming unit granulocyte/macrophage progenitors from patients with CML. Altogether, our data establish that activation of the p38 MAP kinase signaling cascade plays an important role in the generation of the effects of STI571 on BCR-ABL-expressing cells. They also suggest that, in addition to activation of mitogenic pathways, BCR-ABL promotes leukemogenesis by suppressing the function of growth inhibitory signaling cascades.","['Parmar, Simrit', 'Katsoulidis, Efstratios', 'Verma, Amit', 'Li, Yongzhong', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Lal, Lakhvir', 'Majchrzak, Beata', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Fish, Eleanor N', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Parmar S', 'Katsoulidis E', 'Verma A', 'Li Y', 'Sassano A', 'Lal L', 'Majchrzak B', 'Ravandi F', 'Tallman MS', 'Fish EN', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

The aim is to enhance the development of biomarkers for use in studying the causes of these haematopoeitic cancers in the general population. Two causal models of acute myeloid leukaemia are discussed in detail: chemotherapy-induced and benzene-induced acute myeloid leukaemia. Specific chromosomal changes found in acute myeloid leukaemia may serve as useful biomarkers of early effect in these models, and genetic variants in glutathione S-transferases, NQO1 and DNA-repair enzymes may serve as useful biomarkers of susceptibility. Several causal models of lymphoma exist in which biomarkers could be developed and validated. These include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunosuppression, families with inherited disorders and workers exposed to petroleum products, pesticides or organochlorines. Biomarkers of early effect could include markers of DNA double-strand breaks and aberrant V(D)J recombination, and susceptibility may be related to polymorphisms in genes controlling DNA repair and immunological status. We predict that biomarkers of susceptibility will continue to be studied in the case-control format, perhaps in large pooled studies, but that for biomarkers of early effect, there will be a move away from the study of diseased populations to the study of individuals 'at risk' in the causal models described above.","['Smith, Martyn T', 'Skibola, Christine F', 'Allan, James M', 'Morgan, Gareth J']","['Smith MT', 'Skibola CF', 'Allan JM', 'Morgan GJ']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720-7360, USA. martynts@uclink4.berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']","['Autoimmunity', 'Benzene/toxicity', 'Biomarkers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/04/02 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2004/04/02 05:00'],"['2004/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 2004;(157):373-92.,IM,,,,,"['R01ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA87014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,102,,,,,,,,,,,,

This biological heterogeneity is likely to be associated with a variety of different etiological mechanisms. Correspondingly, a large number of inherited normal allelic variations might be expected to contribute to risk. Leukaemias alone have more than 200 different acquired (non-constitutive) molecular abnormalities but some are much more prevalent than others and are associated with biological subtypes with distinctive clinical or prognostic features. Balanced chromosome translocations are very common, together with simple gains or losses of chromosomes. Gene deletions and mutations are also relatively common, especially in more advanced disease. In several types of leukaemia and lymphoma, a transition from benign to malignant status can be tracked together with concurrent accrual of additional molecular abnormalities (e.g. chronic myeloid leukaemia evolving into blast crisis and follicular lymphoma becoming diffuse). The covert preclinical natural history of paediatric leukaemia has been revealed by 'back-tracking' using chromosomal translocation-gene-rated fusion gene sequences as clone-specific stable, specific and sensitive markers. Studies in identical twins, in archived neonatal blood spots of patients and in normal newborn cord bloods all support the contention that chromosomal translocations often initiate leukaemia in utero. Twin concordance rates (and animal modelling) suggest that further secondary genetic changes and exposures postnatally are, however, critical and this is endorsed by the finding that leukaemic fusion genes are present in normal newborn infants at a rate that far exceeds the cumulative risk of leukaemia. The natural history of leukaemic subtypes provides a useful framework for molecular epidemiological studies and significant advances have been made in this respect with infant and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Greaves, Mel F']",['Greaves MF'],"['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK. m.greaves@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,,"['Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/04/02 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2004/04/02 05:00'],"['2004/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 2004;(157):351-72.,IM,,,,,,,,121,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among our patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia 15% demonstrate predominantly splenic manifestations and are classified as stage II(S). OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether expression of cell surface adhesion molecules can distinguish stage II(S) patients from stage 0 or stage 0 and I CLL patients. METHODS: Expression of adhesion molecules belonging to different families was studied in CD19-positive cells isolated from the blood of 42 patients by dual color flow cytometry. The families included: immunoglobulin superfamily (CD54, CD58), integrin family (beta1, beta2 and beta3 chains, CD11a, CD11c, CD49d), selectin family (L-selectin), and lymphocyte homing receptor family (CD44). RESULTS: The average percentage of leukemic cells expressing CD11c in the 23 patients with stage II(S) was 25.7 compared with 13.2% in the 14 patients with stage 0 disease (P = 0.047). The average percentage of leukemic cells expressing CD44 in patients with stage II(S) was 90.5 compared with 77.2% in patients with stage 0 (P = 0.007) and 80% in patients with stages 0 and I together (n = 19, P = 0.008).

The mechanism of generation of most of the translocations is thought to be aberrant repair following abortive apoptosis, rather than V(D)J recombination or exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors. Folate supplementation may prevent some of the chromosome breakage leading to translocation formation. Translocations t(8;21) and t(12;21) have been shown to occur in the normal population (before birth) at a frequency that is 100-fold greater than the risk of developing the corresponding leukemia. In most instances, additional genetic changes are required for progression to leukemia. Tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) mutations, which give cells a survival/proliferative advantage, are proposed to act cooperatively with fusion genes, leading to transformation. However, translocations and cooperating RTK mutations have not been identified for all leukemia subtypes, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia. The core binding transcriptional pathway is frequently targeted by translocation in utero. We propose that this pathway is highly sensitive during fetal hematopoiesis and may be targeted by mechanisms other than translocation. For each leukemia subtype it is important to characterize the corresponding leukemic stem cell, which is thought to be the initial target for translocation. This would help to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in the progression from preleukemic clone harboring a translocation to fully disseminated leukemia.","['McHale, Cliona M', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['McHale CM', 'Smith MT']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-7360, USA. cmhale@uclink.berkley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']","['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Fetal Diseases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2004/04/01 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/04/01 05:00'],"['2004/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20030 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2004 Apr;75(4):254-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20030.,IM,,,,,"['P42 ES004705-17/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,41,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

We have recently reported that gp130 is endogenously expressed in the polarised epithelial model cell line Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and we have demonstrated a preferential basolateral localisation of this protein. In the present study we show that MDCK cells also express the LIF-R and respond to stimulation with human LIF by activation of tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), both however in an unpolarised fashion. This suggests that MDCK cells may be target cells for LIF. We have furthermore stably expressed the human CNTF-R in MDCK cells and by two different assays we found an apical localisation. Consistent with these findings, stimulation of CNTF-R-positive cells resulted only in an activation of STAT3 when CNTF was added apically. These data demonstrate that each subunit of the CNTF receptor complex has a distinct distribution in polarised cells which may reflect the different roles the respective cytokines play in vivo. Since it is currently believed that lipid rafts are involved in signal transduction as well as protein sorting we studied the association of the three receptor complex components with membrane rafts using different protocols. Whereas the CNTF-R cofractionated quantitatively with lipid rafts independently of the method used, gp130 and the LIF-R were found to associate with lipid rafts only partially when detergents were used for isolation. These findings could indicate that either the three receptor complex subunits are localised to the same kind of raft but with different affinities to the liquid-ordered environment, or that they are localised to different types of rafts. CNTF-, LIF-, and IL-6-dependent STAT3 activation was sensitive to the cholesterol-depleting drug methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD) suggesting that the integrity of lipid rafts is important for IL-6-type cytokine-induced STAT activation.","['Buk, Deborah M', 'Waibel, Michaela', 'Braig, Claudia', 'Martens, Astrid S', 'Heinrich, Peter C', 'Graeve, Lutz']","['Buk DM', 'Waibel M', 'Braig C', 'Martens AS', 'Heinrich PC', 'Graeve L']","['Institut fur Biologische Chemie und Ernahrungswissenschaft, Universitat Hohenheim, Garbenstrasse 30, 70599 Stuttgart, Germany. dbuk@uni-hohenheim.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (Caveolins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Contactins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '0 (portal protein, bacteriophage P22)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']","['Animals', 'Biotinylation', 'Blotting, Western', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Caveolin 1', 'Caveolins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Contactins', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Dogs', 'Genetic Vectors/metabolism', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/chemistry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Membrane Microdomains/*chemistry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'beta-Cyclodextrins/metabolism']",2004/04/01 05:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/04/01 05:00'],"['2004/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/jcs.01049 [doi]', 'jcs.01049 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2004 Apr 15;117(Pt 10):2063-75. doi: 10.1242/jcs.01049.

Here we report that mutation of the 2 conserved tryptophan residues of the WW-like domain has opposing effects on TELPDGFbetaR kinase activation. Alanine substitution of W593, essential for protein-protein interaction in the context of other WW domains, impaired TEL-PDGFbetaR-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells due to inhibition of TEL-PDGFbetaR kinase activity. In contrast, alanine substitution of W566, essential for structural integrity of WW domain in other contexts, had no effect on TEL-PDGFbetaR activation and oncogenic activity. Surprisingly, however, the W566A mutation suppressed the W593A phenotype. Double mutant W566A/W593A was indistinguishable from the wild-type fusion protein with regard to kinase activity, ability to confer factor-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells, or ability to induce a myeloproliferative disease in mice. Additional mutational analysis identified other substitutions within the WW-like domain in addition to W566A that could also suppress the W593A phenotype, including mutations predicted to diminish the autoinhibitory function of the juxtamembrane region. Therefore, the WW-like domain in the context of TELPDGFbetaR may have both positive and negative regulatory roles in kinase activation.","['Chen, Jing', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Duclos, Nicole', 'Anastasiadou, Ema', 'Masters, Shane C', 'Fu, Haian', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Chen J', 'Williams IR', 'Kutok JL', 'Duclos N', 'Anastasiadou E', 'Masters SC', 'Fu H', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2004/04/01 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/04/01 05:00'],"['2004/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-01-0169 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55151-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jul 15;104(2):535-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0169.

As we speculated that an anomalous organ distribution of AML cells could affect cell survival and thus result in an altered fraction surviving chemotherapy, we examined a possible correlation between patient prognosis and CXCR-4 expression in AML patients. We found that patients with a high CXCR-4 expression in the CD34(+) subset had a significantly reduced survival and a higher probability of relapse, resulting in a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of only 8.3 months. CXCR-4 expression was significantly higher in fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3)/internal tandem duplication (ITD) AML than in Flt3/wild-type (wt) AML. Covariate analysis indicated that the prognostic significance of Flt3/ITDs with respect to RFS was no more apparent when analyzed in conjunction with the expression of CXCR-4 in the CD34(+) subset, suggesting that the poor prognosis of Flt3/ITD AML might be subordinate to the increased CXCR-4 expression. Using a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R)-expressing 32D cell line, we observed that SDF-1/CXCR-4 interaction is required for the survival of myeloid differentiating cells, and it also induces a block in G-CSF-induced myeloid differentiation. These data suggest that the SDF-1/CXCR-4 axis may influence therapy responsiveness and defines unfavorable prognosis in AML.","['Rombouts, Elwin J C', 'Pavic, Biljana', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Ploemacher, Rob E']","['Rombouts EJ', 'Pavic B', 'Lowenberg B', 'Ploemacher RE']","['Department of Hematology, Room Ee1391, PO Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands. w.rombouts@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']","['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*mortality/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/04/01 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/04/01 05:00'],"['2004/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-02-0566 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55153-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jul 15;104(2):550-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-02-0566.

It predominantly affects T-cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta-lineage precursors, with a consequent proportional increase in multipotent thymic precursors. We show that T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) demonstrate a similar shift with age from predominantly TCR expressing to an immature (IM0/delta/gamma) stage of maturation arrest. Half demonstrate HOX11, HOX11L2, SIL-TAL1, or CALM-AF10 deregulation, with each being associated with a specific, age-independent stage of maturation arrest. HOX11 and SIL-TAL represent alphabeta-lineage oncogenes, whereas HOX11L2 expression identifies an intermediate alphabeta/gammadelta-lineage stage of maturation arrest. In keeping with preferential alphabeta-lineage involution, the incidence of SIL-TAL1 and HOX11L2 deregulation decreased with age. In contrast, HOX11 deregulation became more frequent, suggesting longer latency. TAL1/LMO1 deregulation is more frequent in alphabeta-lineage T-ALL, when it is predominantly due to SIL-TAL1 rearrangements in children but to currently unknown mechanisms in adolescents and adults. LMO2 was more frequently coexpressed with LYL1, predominantly in IM0/delta/gamma adult cases, than with TAL1.

Because dividing cells are more sensitive to cytotoxic effects than are cells at rest, it has been hypothesized that inhibition of the pituitary-gonadal axis may facilitate the preservation of future gonadal function. The aim of our study was to find a quick, reliable and economic way to suppress the pituitary-gonadal axis by combining GnRH-agonists with GnRH-antagonists in order to preserve future gonadal function. METHODS: A combination of D-Trp6-GnRH-a (3.75 mg) and cetrorelix (3 mg) was used to achieve a quick downregulation in six postmenarchal young women (aged 15.4 +/- 0.7) years with haematological malignancies before the onset of cytotoxic chemotherapy. RESULTS: The combination of D-Trp6-GnRH-a and GnRH-antagonist cetrorelix induced a reliable and long-lasting suppression of gonadotrophin secretion within 96 hours in all patients allowing cytotoxic therapy to be started without any delay. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GnRH-agonist and GnRH-antagonist enables a rapid, reliable and cost-effective suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis to be achieved. Future gonadal function of treated patients will be monitored.","['Mardesic, T', 'Snajderova, M', 'Sramkova, L', 'Keslova, P', 'Sedlacek, P', 'Stary, J']","['Mardesic T', 'Snajderova M', 'Sramkova L', 'Keslova P', 'Sedlacek P', 'Stary J']","['Sonatorium Pronatal, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,Eur J Gynaecol Oncol,European journal of gynaecological oncology,8100357,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '08AN7WA2G0 (Triptorelin Pamoate)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', 'OON1HFZ4BA (cetrorelix)']","['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Prospective Studies', 'Triptorelin Pamoate/administration & dosage']",2004/04/01 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/04/01 05:00'],"['2004/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Gynaecol Oncol. 2004;25(1):90-2.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two cytogenetic aberrations were evaluated: trisomy 12 and TP53 deletion. The clonality was determined when > or = 10% of the cells had of trisomy 12 or deletion TP53 gene. Trisomy 12 in 7 patients was detected, while trisomy 12 and TP53 deletion simultaneously in 6 patients were present. If the first group will be linked to the second one then 13 patients among 75 (17%) will have trisomy 12. In group of patients with trisomy 12 and TP53 deletion percentage of cells with trisomy 12 was almost two time more compare to patients with trisomy 12 as a single aberration. It is possible, that TP53 deletion (""the guardian of the genome"") facilitates proliferation clones with others genomic aberrations. In two patients with trisomy 12 control cytogenetic study was performed. Increase of percentage cells with trisomy 12 for 8% and 30% respectively was detected. However, proliferation of cells with TP53 deletion was observed too. Clinical course of B-CLL in group of patient with trisomy 12, trisomy 12 and TP53 deletion simultaneously is more aggressive compared to the course of disease of patients with no cytogenetic aberrations (patients of Group I from Part I of paper). Frequency of IGHV gain mutation occurrence was not analyzed in both groups of patients. But trisomy 12 together with unmutated IGHV gene is found by some authors.

The studies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were conducted using interphase in situ hybridization technique. Clonality was identified when TP53 deletion or chromosome 12 trisomy was found in at least 10% of cells. From all 75 examined patients 32 individuals without any of the genetic aberrations were analyzed (Group I) and 30 subjects with TP53 deletion (Group II) were chosen. In the other 13 patients, discussed in the next paper, either chromosome 12 trisomy (Group III--seven subjects) or both chromosome 12 trisomy and TP53 deletion (Group IV--six subjects) were found. In the Group I, there has been no further contact with three patients, while in the Group II--with two individuals. In the Group I, one patient of 29 in the study (3%) died after 84 months (seven years) from the diagnosis, whereas in the Group II--nine subjects of 28 in the study (32%) died within 1-36 months from the diagnosis. In three of those patients in the terminal condition, cytogenetic studies were repeated revealing an increase of approximately 5% in the percentage of peripheral blood cells with TP53 deletion.

The genotoxicity test results available on etoposide are either primarily in in vitro test systems or in lower organisms after treatment with unusually high doses, or after chronic exposures, having little extrapolative value to humans. Therefore, a cytogenetic risk assessment study on etoposide in mouse in vivo was undertaken after a low dose (in accordance with the human therapeutic dose) single exposure. The cytogenetic toxicity of etoposide was assessed from bone marrow of mouse at three separate endpoints: chromosomal aberration and mitotic index studies at 24 h post-treatment and the micronucleus test (MNT) at 30 h post-treatment. The flame drying technique using colchicine, hypotonic sodium citrate, methanol-glacial acetic acid and Giemsa was followed for the preparation of slides for the metaphase chromosomal aberration and mitotic index studies and a simple technique was followed for the MNT. Although induction of chromosomal aberrations, excluding gaps, per 100 metaphases by 10 and 15 mg kg(-1) etoposide was not significant statistically, 20 mg kg(-1) of etoposide induced a significantly higher number of chromosomal aberrations in female (P < or = 0.01) and male (P < or = 0.05) mice. There was no significant change in the induced percentages of dividing cells by any of the doses of etoposide tested. The micronucleus induction also was not significant statistically with the lowest dose but it was significant in female (P </= 0.01) and male (P </= 0.05) mice that received 15 mg kg(-1) etoposide and was highly significant (P </= 0.01) in both female and male mice that received 20 mg kg(-1) etoposide. The results indicated the clastogenic action of etoposide in mouse bone marrow after a single treatment with such low doses. However, the drug did not interfere with cell cycle progression. Although it is a DNA-non-intercalating agent, etoposide is known for its interference in the activity of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha enzyme, particularly in the proliferative cells where the concentration and activity of the enzyme are greater. This might be the reason for the induction of leukaemia in post-etoposide-treated cancer survivors. Therefore, it has become absolutely necessary to make etoposide target-specific, i.e. specific to the topoisomerase II enzymes of cancerous cells.","['Choudhury, Ramesh C', 'Palo, Anil K', 'Sahu, Prajyoti']","['Choudhury RC', 'Palo AK', 'Sahu P']","['Department of Zoology, Berhampur University, Berhampur-760 007 Orissa, India. rameshchoudhury@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Mutagens)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mitotic Index', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Risk Assessment']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jat.959 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2004 Mar-Apr;24(2):115-22. doi: 10.1002/jat.959.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old man observed transient green-yellow spots with both eyes. The visual acuity was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.9 in the left. Tiny pigmentary irregularities of the macula were observed by ophthalmoscopy. Fluorescein angiography revealed a cockade formation of the macula. The multifocal ERG showed normal latencies in the periphery, however, in the centre the amplitudes were reduced to approximately half of the normal values. An acute myeloid leukaemia was diagnosed in 1997 which arose from a myelodysplasia, after performance of a peripheral allogenic blood stem cell transplantation. Because of a serious anaemia, the patient received numerous multiple transfusions with packed blood red cells from April 1999 to April 2000 (a total of more than 90 transfusions). In consequence, a haemosiderosis occurred with a ferritin value of 4390 ng/ml (November 1999) which made treatment with deferoxamine necessary. Multiple injections of deferoxamine (one to two grams were given from August 2000 until February 2001, afterwards an intermittent application until November 2002 was carried out) which resulted in the maculopathy. CONCLUSION: Retinal changes, in particular, a maculopathy, should be considered even if visual acuity and visual fields are not remarkably changed. Dependent on the extent of the disease, deferoxamine treatment should be discontinued in case of distinct visual deterioration.","['Schmidt, D', 'Finke, J']","['Schmidt D', 'Finke J']","['Univ.-Augenklinik, Freiburg. schmidtd@aug.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']","['Aged', 'Anemia/therapy', 'Deferoxamine/*therapeutic use', 'Electroretinography', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hemosiderosis/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*therapy', '*Macula Lutea', 'Male', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Retinal Diseases/diagnosis/*drug therapy']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/09/09 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-812850 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 2004 Mar;221(3):204-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-812850.,IM,Schiessscheiben-Makula durch Deferoxamin-Behandlung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current success of molecular targeting therapy is shown by: imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec), targeted to the Bcr/Abl fusion protein derived from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 in chronic myelogenous leukemia; rituximab (Rituxan), a monoclonal antibody to CD20 used in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; trastuzumab (Herceptin), a chimeric monoclonal antibody to HER-2 used in breast cancer; and gefinitib (ZD1839, Irresa), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor used in non-small cell lung cancer. The superior therapeutic efficacy of these molecular targeting agents over traditional chemotherapy has been shown by the survival benefit achieved for patients with advanced or recurrent cancers. Although the precise molecular mechanisms by which these agents produce or enhance an antitumor effect, alone or in combination with anticancer drugs, are not known, the specific inhibition of target genes critically involved in tumor progression and metastasis by the agent is clear. However, further studies to determine which patient groups and anticancer drugs are appropriate for combination therapy with these molecular targeting agents are needed. Herein, we discuss the current status and potential for overcoming drug resistance in solid tumors and focus on the differential features of the tumor microenvironment in solid and hematologic malignancies.","['Kim, Ryungsa', 'Toge, Tetsuya']","['Kim R', 'Toge T']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, International Radiation Information Center, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Surg Today,Surgery today,9204360,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Disease Progression', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Molecular Biology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Paracrine Communication/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Trastuzumab']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2003/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00595-003-2710-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Surg Today. 2004;34(4):293-303. doi: 10.1007/s00595-003-2710-4.,IM,,,,,,,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the exception of 5-O-PN, all the other naringenins showed only weak toxic effects at concentrations below 50 micromol/l. A cell cycle analysis over several cell generations up to 4 days was carried out using the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE) followed by propidium iodide (PI) staining at the end of the experiment. The well-studied flavonol quercetin was included in the analysis as a reference substance. All flavonoids affected cell proliferation, but the extent and the resulting changes in the proliferation pattern were specific for each substance. In contrast to the radical scavenging activity of quercetin, the tested flavanones showed no anti-oxidative properties using several different test systems. Similarly, the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) was hardly effected by these compounds, while both menadione and quercetin strongly reduced the potential after 1 h of treatment. The reported chemical modification of interesting lead substances (like the strongly estrogenic 8-PN) presents a promising approach to modulate the properties of a relevant substance in a pharmacologically desirable way. The low toxicity and weak cytostatic properties of the tested naringenin derivatives is encouraging for further studies on known naringenin target molecules.","['Tokalov, Sergey V', 'Henker, Yvonne', 'Schwab, Pia', 'Metz, Peter', 'Gutzeit, Herwig O']","['Tokalov SV', 'Henker Y', 'Schwab P', 'Metz P', 'Gutzeit HO']","['Institut fur Zoologie, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

The np gene is localized in tandem with the cardiotrophin-1 gene on mouse chromosome 7. NP shares structural and functional features with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1, and cardiotrophin-like cytokine. It acts through a membrane receptor complex comprising CNTF receptor-alpha component (CNTFRalpha), gp130, and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway. NP is highly expressed in embryonic neuroepithelia. Strikingly, CNTFRalpha, but not its alternate ligands, CNTF and cardiotrophin-like cytokine, is expressed at the same developmental stages. NP is also observed in retina and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle. Moreover, NP could sustain the in vitro survival of embryonic motor neurons and could increase the proliferation of neural precursors when associated to epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2. Thus, NP is a new ligand for CNTFRalpha, with important implications for murine nervous system development.","['Derouet, Damien', 'Rousseau, Francois', 'Alfonsi, Fabienne', 'Froger, Josy', 'Hermann, Jacques', 'Barbier, Fabien', 'Perret, David', 'Diveu, Caroline', 'Guillet, Catherine', 'Preisser, Laurence', 'Dumont, Agnes', 'Barbado, Maud', 'Morel, Alain', 'deLapeyriere, Odile', 'Gascan, Hugues', 'Chevalier, Sylvie']","['Derouet D', 'Rousseau F', 'Alfonsi F', 'Froger J', 'Hermann J', 'Barbier F', 'Perret D', 'Diveu C', 'Guillet C', 'Preisser L', 'Dumont A', 'Barbado M', 'Morel A', 'deLapeyriere O', 'Gascan H', 'Chevalier S']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U564, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Angers, 4 Rue Larrey, 49033 Angers, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (neuropoietin, mouse)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism/*physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0306178101 [doi]', '0306178101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 6;101(14):4827-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0306178101.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MDS were treated with R115777 at doses of 600 mg orally (PO) bid in cycles of 4 weeks of therapy followed by a 2-week rest period. Dose reduction rules for toxicity were applied. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 28 patients treated were assessable. Three patients responded (complete remission, n = 2; partial remission, n = 1). Responders included two patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts and one patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation. Two of the responders had a diploid karyotype and one had multiple cytogenetic abnormalities including monosomy 5 and 7. The starting dose of 600 mg PO bid resulted in side effects (myelosuppression, fatigue, neurotoxicity, rash, or leg pain) necessitating dose reduction (n = 4) or discontinuation of therapy (n = 7) in 11 (41%) of 27 patients during the induction period (12 weeks). Lower doses of 300 mg PO bid were well tolerated. All responses occurred in patients who had been reduced to this dose level during the initial two cycles. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that R115777 has modest activity in MDS patients, but that, in this patient population, 4 weeks of daily doses of 600 mg PO bid is not tolerated.

The objective of this study was to evaluate factors predicting oral mucositis severity among 133 patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for chronic myelogenous leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were transplanted between 1992 and 1999, were >or= 18 years of age, received either cyclophosphamide/total-body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning regimens, and received four doses of methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis post-transplant. Oral mucositis was measured by a trained examiner every 2 to 3 days using the Oral Mucositis Index (OMI). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of mean OMI during days 6 to 12, 1 to 18, and the maximum OMI score between days 1 to 18. RESULTS: TBI containing conditioning regimens, body mass index >or= 25, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 TT genotype were found to be predictive of higher mean OMI scores (P <.05). Pretransplant multivitamin supplement use was associated with lower mean OMI scores compared to those who did not use supplements. Smoking status, race, pretransplant treatment with interferon-alfa or hydroxyurea, and patient/donor ABO compatibility were not associated with mean OMI scores. CONCLUSION: Patients who are scheduled to receive conditioning regimens containing TBI, have a pretransplant body mass index >or= 25, or carry the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 TT genotype should be considered at greater risk of developing oral mucositis following HCT. Future studies should investigate whether multivitamin supplementation before HCT could reduce mucositis severity.","['Robien, Kim', 'Schubert, Mark M', 'Bruemmer, Barbara', 'Lloid, Michele E', 'Potter, John D', 'Ulrich, Cornelia M']","['Robien K', 'Schubert MM', 'Bruemmer B', 'Lloid ME', 'Potter JD', 'Ulrich CM']","['Cancer Prevention Research Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Busulfan/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Stomatitis/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.05.147 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.05.147 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Apr 1;22(7):1268-75. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.05.147.,IM,,,,,"['R25 CA94880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA80416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficacy was assessed using International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and National Cancer Institute criteria for response. Safety monitoring included WHO toxicity grading for adverse events. Quality of life was also assessed. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients received treatment. According to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria, the overall response rate was 71.6% (complete remission, 37.0%; partial remission, 34.6%). The response rate using National Cancer Institute criteria was 80.2% (complete remission, 12.3%; partial remission, 67.9%). Median time to progression was 841 days (range, 28 to 1,146 days). The most frequently reported grade 3/4 toxicity was myelosuppression. WHO grade 3/4 hematological toxicities included granulocytopenia (32.1%), anemia (9.9%), and thrombocytopenia (4.9%). Gastrointestinal toxicity was more common with the oral formulation than with IV fludarabine phosphate, but was generally mild to moderate and did not require treatment. Statistically significant improvements in mean emotional and insomnia quality-of-life scores were seen after treatment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that oral fludarabine phosphate is clinically effective and generally well tolerated by patients with previously untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Oral fludarabine phosphate has a similar clinical efficacy and safety profile to the IV formulation. Oral fludarabine phosphate does not adversely affect quality of life and may improve emotional and insomnia scores.","['Rossi, J-F', 'van Hoof, A', 'de Boeck, K', 'Johnson, S A', 'Bron, D', 'Foussard, C', 'Lister, T A', 'Berthou, C', 'Kramer, M H H', 'Littlewood, T J', 'Marcus, R E', 'Deconinck, E', 'Montillo, M', 'Guibon, O', 'Tollerfield, S M']","['Rossi JF', 'van Hoof A', 'de Boeck K', 'Johnson SA', 'Bron D', 'Foussard C', 'Lister TA', 'Berthou C', 'Kramer MH', 'Littlewood TJ', 'Marcus RE', 'Deconinck E', 'Montillo M', 'Guibon O', 'Tollerfield SM']","['CHU, Montpellier, France. jf-rossi@chu-montpellier.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']","['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.05.012 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.05.012 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Apr 1;22(7):1260-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.05.012.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: For this retrospective review, we included episodes of VSB isolated between March 1997 and September 2002, in children (<or= 18 years) with a diagnosis of cancer or SCT patients. The primary outcome was VSSS, defined as hypotension requiring intravascular volume expansion or inotropic support and/or respiratory insufficiency necessitating assisted ventilation. RESULTS: Eighty-eight episodes of VSB occurred in 79 children. The mean age of the children was 6.7 years (range, 0.6 to 18.0 years). The most common underlying diagnosis was acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in 31 (35%) of 88 episodes, and 38 (43%) of 88 had undergone SCT. VSSS occurred in 16 (18%) of 88 episodes, and two children died from VSSS. Two variables were predictive of VSSS, namely peak temperature at presentation (odds ratio [OR], 6.3; 95% CI, 2.1 to 19.0; P =.001) and inpatient status (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 28.0; P =.02). Diagnosis of AML (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4 to 3.5; P =.8), receipt of SCT (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.6 to 5.7; P =.2), high-dose cytarabine (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.1 to 3.2; P =.6), and mucositis (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.6; P =.7) were not predictive of VSSS. CONCLUSION: VSSS occurred in 18% of episodes of VSB in children with cancer or SCT recipients. Peak temperature before antibiotic therapy and inpatient status were predictive of VSSS.","['Gassas, Adam', 'Grant, Ronald', 'Richardson, Susan', 'Dupuis, L Lee', 'Doyle, John', 'Allen, Upton', 'Abla, Oussama', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Gassas A', 'Grant R', 'Richardson S', 'Dupuis LL', 'Doyle J', 'Allen U', 'Abla O', 'Sung L']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*complications/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/complications/drug therapy/microbiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Shock, Septic/*complications/pathology', 'Streptococcal Infections/*complications/microbiology/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Viridans Streptococci/drug effects/*isolation & purification']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.09.108 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.09.108 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Apr 1;22(7):1222-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.09.108.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether there is a recovery of this lost bone mass in survivors of ALL is not known. We sought to determine if changes in BMD are common long-term sequelae in children with ALL. METHODS: Bone mineral densitometry of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was performed on 106 patients. The results were compared with those of age-matched normal controls. The effect of treatment was examined in those with low BMD compared with the remainder of the study group. RESULTS: When data were tested with respect to age, sex, and age and sex, no difference was observed in BMD between survivors of childhood ALL and controls. In the subgroup of patients with low BMD, the difference was not related to age, age at diagnosis, or years since diagnosis. Low BMD of the spine was not explained by radiotherapy (RT), methotrexate (MTX) dose, or corticosteroid dose. Low BMD of the femur was not explained by RT. However, those with low femoral BMD were more likely to have received high-dose MTX or higher-dose corticosteroids compared with the remainder of the group. CONCLUSION: It appears that survivors of childhood ALL as a whole recover normal BMD. However, those patients who received a total MTX dose of greater than 40000 mg/m(2) or a total corticosteroid dose of greater than 9000 mg/m(2) may not recover normal BMD and therefore should be screened for decreased BMD of the femoral neck.","['Mandel, Karen', 'Atkinson, Stephanie', 'Barr, Ronald D', 'Pencharz, Paul']","['Mandel K', 'Atkinson S', 'Barr RD', 'Pencharz P']","['Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Density', 'Bone and Bones/*physiopathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fractures, Bone/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Morbidity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Survivors']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.04.199 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.04.199 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Apr 1;22(7):1215-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.04.199.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether transfer of T cell receptors (TCRs) directed against mHags, exclusively expressed on hematopoietic cells, could redirect virus-specific T cells toward antileukemic reactivity, without the loss of their original specificity. Generation of T cells with dual specificity may lead to survival of these TCR-transferred T cells for prolonged periods of time in vivo due to transactivation of the endogenous TCR of the tumor-reactive T cells by the latent presence of viral antigens. Furthermore, TCR transfer into restricted T cell populations, which are nonself reactive, will minimize the risk of autoimmunity. We demonstrate that cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells can be efficiently reprogrammed into leukemia-reactive T cells by transfer of TCRs directed against the mHag HA-2. HA-2-TCR-transferred CMV-specific T cells derived from human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2+ or HLA-A2- individuals exerted potent antileukemic as well as CMV reactivity, without signs of anti-HLA-A2 alloreactivity. The dual specificity of these mHag-specific, TCR-redirected virus-specific T cells opens new possibilities for the treatment of hematological malignancies of HLA-A2+ HA-2-expressing patients transplanted with HLA-A2-matched or -mismatched donors.","['Heemskerk, Mirjam H M', 'Hoogeboom, Manja', 'Hagedoorn, Renate', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Heemskerk MH', 'Hoogeboom M', 'Hagedoorn R', 'Kester MG', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, C2-R, P.O.

The objective of these studies was to evaluate the ability of unique HLA-A2.1-specific nonameric peptides derived from CD33 antigen to generate AML-specific CTLs ex vivo. We present data here on the identification of an immunogeneic HLA-A2.1-specific CD33(65-73) peptide (AIISGDSPV) that was capable of inducing CTLs targeted to AML cells. The CD33-CTLs displayed HLA-A2.1-restricted cytotoxicity against both mononuclear cells from AML patients and the AML cell line. The peptide- as well as AML cell-specificity of CD33-CTLs was demonstrated and the secretion of IFN-gamma by the CTLs was detected in response to CD33(65-73) peptide stimulation. The cultures contained a distinct CD33(65-73) peptide-tetramer(+)/CD8(+) population. Alteration of the native CD33(65-73) peptide at the first amino acid residue from alanine (A) to tyrosine (Y) enhanced the HLA-A2.1 affinity/stability of the modified CD33 peptide (YIISGDSPV) and induced CTLs with increased cytotoxicity against AML cells. These data therefore demonstrate the potential of using immunogenic HLA-A2.1-specific CD33 peptides in developing a cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of AML patients.,"['Bae, Jooeun', 'Martinson, Jeffrey A', 'Klingemann, Hans G']","['Bae J', 'Martinson JA', 'Klingemann HG']","['RUSH University Medical Center, Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Cell Therapy, 1735 West Harrison Street, Cohn Research Building # 636, Chicago, IL 60612, USA. jbae@rush.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Peptides/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2003/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cellimm.2004.01.002 [doi]', 'S0008874904000206 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2004 Jan;227(1):38-50. doi: 10.1016/j.cellimm.2004.01.002.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that ZNF198-FGFR1 induces EMS-like disease in mice, with myeloproliferation and T lymphoma arising from common multipotential progenitors. Mutation of FGFR1 Tyr766 attenuates both myeloid and lymphoid diseases, identifying phospholipase C-gamma1 as a downstream effector.

Furthermore, BCR/ABL increases DNA double-strand damage after etoposide treatment and leads to a defect in an intra-S phase checkpoint, causing a radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS) phenotype.

MATERIALS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 550 UCBTs for hematologic malignancies reported to the Eurocord Registry. Main outcomes and prognostic factors were analyzed in univariable and multivariable analyses incorporating center and period effects and using death and relapse as competitive risks for nonfatal endpoints. Nucleated cell (NC) dose before freezing and number of HLA disparities had a significant influence on outcome. Cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil and platelet recovery was associated with the number of HLA mismatches, number of NC before freezing, and use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Coexistence of HLA class I and II disparities and high CD34 cell dose in the graft were associated with graft-vs-host disease grades III-IV. CI of disease relapse was higher in matched transplants showing a graft-vs-leukemia effect increased in HLA-mismatched transplants. Overall 3-year survival was 34.4%. Prognostic factors for survival were recipient age, gender, and disease status.

However, the leukemia cells become resistant to this drug in most blast crisis cases. The transcription factor Nrf2 regulates the gene expression of a number of detoxifying enzymes such as gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) synthesis, via the antioxidant response element (ARE). In this study, we examined the involvement of Nrf2 in the acquisition of resistance to imatinib. Since oxidative stress promotes the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, we also examined whether ascorbic acid, a reducing reagent, can overcome the resistance to imatinib by inhibiting Nrf2 activity. RESULTS: Binding of Nrf2 to the ARE of the gamma-GCS light subunit (gamma-GCSl) gene promoter was much stronger in the imatinib-resistant cell line KCL22/SR than in the parental imatinib-sensitive cell line KCL22. The levels of gamma-GCSl mRNA and GSH were higher in KCL22/SR cells, a finding consistent with the observation of an increase in Nrf2-DNA binding. Addition of a GSH monoester to KCL22 cells resulted in an increase in the IC(50) value of imatinib. In contrast, addition of ascorbic acid to KCL22/SR cells resulted in a decrease in Nrf2-DNA binding and decreases in levels of gamma-GCSl mRNA and GSH. Consistent with these findings, ascorbic acid partly restored imatinib sensitivity to KCL22/SR. CONCLUSION: Changes in the redox state caused by antioxidants such as ascorbic acid can overcome resistance to imatinib via inhibition of Nrf2-mediated gene expression.","['Tarumoto, Takahisa', 'Nagai, Tadashi', 'Ohmine, Ken', 'Miyoshi, Takuji', 'Nakamura, Makiko', 'Kondo, Takahito', 'Mitsugi, Kenji', 'Nakano, Syuji', 'Muroi, Kazuo', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Ozawa, Keiya']","['Tarumoto T', 'Nagai T', 'Ohmine K', 'Miyoshi T', 'Nakamura M', 'Kondo T', 'Mitsugi K', 'Nakano S', 'Muroi K', 'Komatsu N', 'Ozawa K']","['Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/*pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/05/18 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2003/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.exphem.2004.01.007 [doi]', 'S0301472X0400030X [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Apr;32(4):375-81. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.01.007.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Focal adhesion kinases have been shown to mediate intracellular signaling from integrins, and we recently demonstrated that gene expression and pre-mRNA splicing of the focal adhesion kinase, PYK2, is abnormal in CD34(+) cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. Here we investigated whether PYK2 gene products mediate integrin signaling in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. METHODS: Cord blood CD34(+) cells were retrovirally transduced with vectors encoding Pyk2H, Pyk2, or the dominant negative-acting, kinase-deficient, C-terminal PYK2 fragment, PRNK, and myeloid proliferation and differentiation was assessed using colony-forming cell (CFC), long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC), and liquid culture assays. RESULTS: CD34(+) cells overexpressing Pyk2H or Pyk2 generated 50% less colony-forming unit granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) than eGFP-transduced controls. Although the number of CFC generated by PRNK-expressing cells was unchanged, LTC-IC were significantly reduced. Culture of CD34(+) cells on FN significantly reduced the generation of mature myeloid cells vs those cultured on BSA-coated wells, and could be overcome by addition of SCF. As is observed when integrins are engaged, overexpression of either Pyk2H or Pyk2 decreased committed myeloid progenitor proliferation and differentiation; however, SCF could not override this inhibition. Finally, as is observed when integrins are not engaged, PRNK-mediated inhibition of endogenous Pyk2H resulted in integrin-nonresponsive proliferation and differentiation of myeloid precursors and accelerated differentiation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors. CONCLUSION: These studies indicate that PYK2 gene products mediate integrin-induced signals that regulate myelopoiesis.","['Dylla, Scott J', 'Deyle, David R', 'Theunissen, Koen', 'Padurean, Adrian M', 'Verfaillie, Catherine M']","['Dylla SJ', 'Deyle DR', 'Theunissen K', 'Padurean AM', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Stem Cell Institute and Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 2)']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media', 'Fibronectins', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 2', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Myelopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/05/18 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2003/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.exphem.2004.01.001 [doi]', 'S0301472X04000244 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Apr;32(4):365-74. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.01.001.,IM,,,,,"['CA09138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK-53673/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-49930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intracerebroventricular administration of LIF (0.01-1.0 microg/rat) significantly increased the plasma AVP concentration, and its effect was observed from 5 to 60 min after the injection. LIF did not cause significant changes in plasma Na+, total protein and blood pressure. There were no significant changes in the plasma AVP concentration after intravenous injection of LIF (1.0, 3.0 microg/rat). These results indicate that LIF plays a stimulatory role in the regulation of AVP release, and suggest the possibility that LIF may be involved in the pathogenesis of SIADH.","['Ishizaki, Seiji', 'Murase, Takashi', 'Sugimura, Yoshihisa', 'Banno, Ryoichi', 'Arima, Hiroshi', 'Miura, Yoshitaka', 'Oiso, Yutaka']","['Ishizaki S', 'Murase T', 'Sugimura Y', 'Banno R', 'Arima H', 'Miura Y', 'Oiso Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Neurosci Lett,Neuroscience letters,7600130,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '11000-17-2 (Vasopressins)']","['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Vasopressins/*blood/*metabolism']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/05/22 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2004/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.neulet.2004.02.019 [doi]', 'S0304394004001946 [pii]']",ppublish,Neurosci Lett. 2004 Apr 8;359(1-2):77-80. doi: 10.1016/j.neulet.2004.02.019.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the resultant MOLT-4 rho(0) cells was confirmed by Southern analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MOLT-4 rho(0) cells proliferated more slowly than parental cells (wild type) and produced significantly more lactate (approximately fourfold increase; P < 0.001) with concomitantly reduced oxygen consumption (12.3% vs. 100%; P < 0.001) compared with the wild type. MOLT-4 rho(0) cells also showed reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity and a reduced cytochrome c oxidase/citrate synthase activity ratio compared to parental wild-type MOLT-4 cells (P < 10(-11)). Electron microscopy showed elongated mitochondria with parallel cristae in MOLT-4 cells although the mitochondria in MOLT-4 rho(0) cells appeared enlarged, some were vacuolated with either an absent or a grossly distorted cristae pattern. Vital staining with 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) was used to image mitochondria in intact cells and study mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)). Flow cytometry using JC-1 indicated that MOLT-4 rho(0) had a lower Deltapsi(m) than MOLT-4. Sodium fluoride (an inhibitor of the glycolytic pathway) at a concentration of 20 mM further reduced the Deltapsi(m) in MOLT-4-rho(0) cells. This data suggested that a glycolytic pathway product, possibly ATP, was required for the maintenance of Deltapsi(m) in MOLT-4 rho(0) cells.","['Armand, Ray', 'Channon, Jacqueline Y', 'Kintner, Jennifer', 'White, Kristina A', 'Miselis, Kristin A', 'Perez, Raymond P', 'Lewis, Lionel D']","['Armand R', 'Channon JY', 'Kintner J', 'White KA', 'Miselis KA', 'Perez RP', 'Lewis LD']","['Section of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)', 'EC 2.3.3.1 (Citrate (si)-Synthase)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']","['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase/metabolism', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics/*metabolism', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/metabolism', 'Ethidium/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Mutation', 'Oxygen/metabolism']",2004/03/31 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/03/31 05:00'],"['2003/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.taap.2003.12.001 [doi]', 'S0041008X03005684 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2004 Apr 1;196(1):68-79. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2003.12.001.,IM,,,,,"['1K24 CA84081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum level of IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, antitumor antibody, homogeneous IgG were quantified by turbidimetric or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The mean values of serum IgM, IgG, IgA at diagnosis were not differed significantly in ALL patients and control children. The level of IgM and IgG1 inversely correlated with white blood cell (WBC) count in PB of patients. Normal range of serum IgG, separated by 25th and 75th percentiles of IgG variables, was associated in patients with decreased WBC count in PB but not in bone marrow (BM) versus patients with low concentration of IgG. Normal range of IgG also favors low frequency of homogeneous IgG and antitumor antibodies. Patients with high level of IgG, besides increased frequency of homogeneous IgG and antitumor antibodies, had worse 3-year overall survival (OS) rate as compared to patients with normal level of IgG (58.8 vs. 91.2%, P = 0.014).

To address this issue, we have identified which tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are involved in apoptosis and differentiation, respectively. HL-60 cells were induced specifically to undergo apoptosis with 68 microM etoposide, and to undergo granulocytic differentiation with 1 microM retinoic acid (RA). The corresponding two-dimensional electrophoretic maps of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from treated cells were compared. In the 8 h etoposide-treated HL-60 cell population, 83% of the cells were apoptotic. In the 120 h RA-treated cells, 50% of the cells were apoptotic. Eighteen cytosolic and nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were found in both the 8 h etoposide- and the 120 h RA-treated cells, but not in the proliferating HL-60 cell population. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analyses suggested that some of the proteins may be involved in signal transduction pathways (NFkappaB, GTP-binding protein, protein disulfide isomerase, Cyclophilin A), others in cell transcriptional and translational control (hnRNP H, hnRNP L, Hsp60, Hp1, Hcc-1, 26S proteasome beta-subunit, ATP synthase beta-chain), and a third group in cell cytoskeleton organization and receptor cycling (profilin, caveolin-1).

Twenty-seven of them had a malignant disease, either leukemia or solid tumor. We investigated the differences between the oncological and non-oncological patient groups. METHODS: Liver biopsy specimens were examined for HBsAg, HBcAg and CD57 antigens immunohistochemically. Liver damage was measured according to the Knodell scoring system and all findings were assessed by Pearson correlation statistical analysis. RESULTS: Forty-three cases (58.9%) had minimal hepatitis, 27 cases (37%) had mild and three cases (4.1%) had moderate hepatitis. Fibrosis was shown in four cases (5.5%). For histological activity index (HAI), there was no statistical difference between the two groups. HBcAg and HBsAg expression rates were 69.9% and 90.4%, respectively. CD57 (+) lymphocytes were found in 32 cases (43.8%). HBcAg expression was higher in oncological patients. There was a positive correlation between HAI and percentage of CD57 (+) cells. However, HBsAg expression showed a negative correlation with HAI. The number of CD57 (+) cells was lower than expected.

In all, 36 patients (median age 55 years) underwent RIST from an HLA-matched related donor between September 1999 and December 2002. The diagnoses included AML (n=14), leukemia evolving from MDS (n=10), and MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts n=6, refractory anemia n=6). The RIST regimen consisted of purine analog (cladribine or fludarabine)/busulfan, with or without antithymocyte globulin. The regimen was well tolerated, and 34 patients achieved durable engraftment and most achieved remission after RIST. A total of 17 patients developed grade II-IV acute GVHD, and 27 developed chronic GVHD. Eight patients relapsed, and five of them received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) as part of the preparative regimen. A total of 12 patients died (four disease progression, six transplantation-related complications, and two others). Estimated 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) in low- and high-risk groups was 85 and 64%, respectively. We conclude that RIST can be performed safely in elderly patients with myeloid malignancies, and has therapeutic potential for those who fail conventional chemotherapy. In view of the significant association between GVHD or ATG and DFS, defined management of GVHD following RIST should become a major target of clinical research.","['Hamaki, T', 'Kami, M', 'Kim, S-W', 'Onishi, Y', 'Kishi, Y', 'Murashige, N', 'Hori, A', 'Kojima, R', 'Sakiyama, M', 'Imataki, O', 'Heike, Y', 'Tanosaki, R', 'Masuo, S', 'Miyakoshi, S', 'Taniguchi, S', 'Tobinai, K', 'Takaue, Y']","['Hamaki T', 'Kami M', 'Kim SW', 'Onishi Y', 'Kishi Y', 'Murashige N', 'Hori A', 'Kojima R', 'Sakiyama M', 'Imataki O', 'Heike Y', 'Tanosaki R', 'Masuo S', 'Miyakoshi S', 'Taniguchi S', 'Tobinai K', 'Takaue Y']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Unit, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Busulfan/pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/chemistry', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'HLA Antigens/*chemistry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2004/03/30 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704477 [doi]', '1704477 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2004 May;33(9):891-900. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704477.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A common problem of adoptive immunotherapy strategies is the ex vivo expansion of the generated T cells to sufficient numbers.

Therefore, we explored the feasibility of suicide gene control of ex vivo generated CTLs expanded through the ectopic expression of hTert. To this end, we compared the efficacy of the new Escherichia coli-nitroreductase (E. coli-Ntr) suicide gene with the well-known herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-Tk). Introduction of hTert provided the transduced CTLs with a distinct growth advantage over the nontransduced CTLs. The hTert-E. coli-Ntr double-transduced CTLs retained their antigen-specific functions. Treatment of hTert-E. coli-Ntr double-transduced CTLs with metronidazole significantly inhibited the proliferation to a similar extent to the treatment of hTert-HSV-Tk double-transduced CTLs with ganciclovir.

Cells in which the promoter is highly methylated are auxotrophs and express ASY at very low levels. Electromobility shift assays (EMSA) of nuclear extracts with oligomers from the promoting region show, in addition to recognized transcription factor binding, a novel methyl binding protein specific for a 12 base consensus sequence, which includes a single methylated CpG. This sequence overlaps that of the amino-acid response unit of the ASY promoter, which is activated byATF4 and C/EBP. Competition by the methyl binding protein could account for the observed failure of the methylated promoter to bind these transcription factors and consequently, although other mechanisms can also be operative, for the specific repression of the gene. The ASY methyl binding protein (ASMB) is present in leukemic lymphoid and myeloid cells irrespective of their methylation status, and in normal lymphocytes after phytohemagglutinin stimulation.

Bcl-xES (extra short), a novel Bcl-x member, possesses a unique combination of BH4 and BH2 domains as well as a COOH-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane anchor domain. Bcl-xES contains sequences of hydrophobic alpha-6 helices but lacks sequences of alpha-5 helices, suggesting that it does not have pore channel-forming activity but functions uniquely as a trapping protein. mRNA expression analysis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and RNase protection assay reveal that Bcl-xES is expressed in a variety of human cancer cell lines and human tumors, including bone marrow from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bcl-xES expression is much less pronounced in some specimens of normal human tissues, including the breast, ovary, testis and lung. Stable, transfected human B lymphoma Namalwa variant cells expressing Bcl-xES were derived to investigate its role in apoptosis. Bcl-xES had a preventive effect on cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and various concentrations of anticancer drugs, including camptothecin, etoposide and cisplatin. Its protective action on cell death was correlated with the inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation. In a yeast two-hybrid system, Bcl-xES interacted with most Bcl-2 family members, including those containing only a BH3 domain, and with the Ced-4 homolog Apaf-1. Co-immunoprecipitation and gel filtration chromatography experiments suggest that Bcl-xES delays drug-induced apoptosis by disturbing the formation of Bax oligomers and preventing cytochrome c release, but also by interacting with Apaf-1 and inhibiting procaspase-9 activation, thus averting the apoptogenic proteolytic caspase cascade and cell death.","['Schmitt, Estelle', 'Paquet, Claudie', 'Beauchemin, Myriam', 'Bertrand, Richard']","['Schmitt E', 'Paquet C', 'Beauchemin M', 'Bertrand R']","[""Centre de recherche, Centre hospitalier de l' Universite of Montreal (CHUM), Hopital Notre-Dame and Institut du cancer de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']","['Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', 'Base Sequence', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/03/30 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207554 [doi]', '1207554 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 May 13;23(22):3915-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207554.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro exposure to STI571 of 32D murine myeloid progenitor cell clones transducing a temperature-sensitive p210 bcr-abl construct was associated with Chk2 phosphorylation and activation, Cdc25A degradation and persistent Cdk2 inhibitory phosphorylation, preventing, in turn, cell transition to and progression throughout the S phase of cell cycle. Chk2 and Cdc25A are both components of a complex network that integrates signals involved in regulated cell cycle progression, DNA repair and cell decision between life or death. Chk2 gene mutations or decreased expression, leading to its protein loss of function on Cdc25A target, and Cdc25A overexpression have been linked to poor prognosis of human cancers. In CML, they might further enhance the proliferative advantage and genomic instability of clonal myeloid progenitors featuring a class of poor prognosis patients eventually resistant to STI571.","['Mazzacurati, Lucia', 'Pattacini, Laura', 'Brusa, Gianluca', 'Mancini, Manuela', 'Benvenuti, Michela', 'Barbieri, Enza', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Greenberger, Joel S', 'Santucci, Maria Alessandra']","['Mazzacurati L', 'Pattacini L', 'Brusa G', 'Mancini M', 'Benvenuti M', 'Barbieri E', 'Martinelli G', 'Baccarani M', 'Greenberger JS', 'Santucci MA']","['Istituto di Ematologia e Oncologia Medica Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, University of Bologna, Medical School, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Cdc25a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",2004/03/30 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200365 [doi]', '6200365 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(2):168-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200365.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the major molecules triggering apoptosis, CD95 (FAS), is not expressed on CLL B cells at resting conditions. However, CD40 triggering of CLL B cells upregulates receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, like CD95. In the present study, we analyzed in B cells from 20 CLL patients the effect of CD40/CD40L interaction on: (i) CD95 modulation; (ii) CD95-mediated apoptosis and (iii) mRNA and protein expression of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) molecules.CD40 activation of CLL B cells was carried out by coculture with CD40L-transfected cells and cytofluorimetric analyses were performed to study CD95 modulation and apoptosis induction by an anti-CD95 moAb. Despite strong CD95 upregulation on the membrane of all the cases studied, only a minority of cases analyzed (3/20) proved weakly responsive to CD95-mediated apoptosis. Multiplex RT-PCR was used to analyze FLICE, FAS, FADD and TRADD mRNAs before and after CD40 triggering. In agreement with the cytofluorimetric data, FAS mRNA appeared significantly increased after CD40 triggering; the other molecules involved in DISC formation and in CD95-mediated apoptosis were also expressed without relevant differences between resting and activated conditions. Western blot analyses further confirmed FLICE and FADD protein expression by resting and activated CLL cells. Our findings demonstrate that, following CD40 triggering, CLL B cells are resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis despite a strong CD95 upregulation on the membrane and a normal mRNA or protein expression of the DISC components.","['de Totero, Daniela', 'Montera, Mariapina', 'Rosso, Ombretta', 'Clavio, Marino', 'Balleari, Enrico', 'Foa, Robin', 'Gobbi, Marco']","['de Totero D', 'Montera M', 'Rosso O', 'Clavio M', 'Balleari E', 'Foa R', 'Gobbi M']","['Immunopharmacology Lab, National Institute for Cancer Research, Genoa, Italy. detotero@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'CD40 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/physiology', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/03/30 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200362 [doi]', '6200362 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(2):152-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200362.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD38 expression has emerged as an independent prognostic factor, yet there is debate as to what level of CD38 affects prognosis. We plotted the hazard ratios for the treatment-free interval (TFI) between the higher and lower groups defined by CD38 cut-offs from 0 to 100%. The maximum hazard ratio was achieved for a cut-off of 7%. We examined by triple colour analysis the values for CD38 in 289 untreated patients using both >or=30 and >or=7% as thresholds for prognosis. Using a >or=7% threshold (but not >or=30%), we showed a significant correlation with advanced stage and male sex. The interval from diagnosis to first therapy or TFI was longer (median 36 months) in patients with <7% CD38 positive cells than those with >or= 30% (8.7 months) or with intermediate values between 7 and 29% (P<0.00005). The <7% threshold also identified patients in stage A with a long TFI (P=0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that CD38 has independent prognostic value for TFI in all patients. In 135 patients tested for deletions of p53, 13q14 and 11q23 and for trisomy 12, we showed a correlation between 13q14 deletion and <30%/<7% CD38 positive cells and a tendency for trisomy 12 to be associated with >or=30%/>or=7% CD38 positive cells.

Although zidovudine (AZT) and alpha-interferon (IFN) yield some responses and improve ATL prognosis, alternative therapies are needed. Arsenic trioxide (As) dramatically synergizes with IFN to induce growth arrest and apoptosis of ATL leukemia cells in vitro. These results prompted us to initiate a phase II trial of As/IFN combination in seven patients with relapsed/refractory ATL (four acute and three lymphoma). Four patients exhibited a clear initial response (one complete remission and three partial remissions). Yet, the treatment was discontinued after a median of 22 days because of toxicity (three patients) or subsequent progression (four patients). Six patients eventually died from progressive disease (five patients) or infection (one patient), but the remaining patient is still alive and disease free at 32 months. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that maximum arsenic blood levels (median 0.46 microM) were slowly achieved (8-15 days). In conclusion, arsenic/IFN treatment is feasible and exhibits an anti-leukemia effect in very poor prognosis ATL patients despite a significant toxicity. Future studies should assess the best timing for arsenic therapy: frontline with IFN/AZT or as maintenance after induction.","['Hermine, Olivier', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Poupon, Joel', 'Arnulf, Bertrand', 'Lefrere, Francois', 'Rousselot, Phillippe', 'Damaj, Gandhi', 'Delarue, Richard', 'Fermand, Jean Paul', 'Brouet, Jean Claude', 'Degos, Laurent', 'Varet, Bruno', 'de The, Hugues', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Hermine O', 'Dombret H', 'Poupon J', 'Arnulf B', 'Lefrere F', 'Rousselot P', 'Damaj G', 'Delarue R', 'Fermand JP', 'Brouet JC', 'Degos L', 'Varet B', 'de The H', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Hematology, Necker Hospital, Paris, France. hermine@necker.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oxides)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']","['Adult', 'Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage']",2004/03/30 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200374 [doi]', '6200374 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(2):130-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200374.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a clinical phase II study, 40 patients with standard- or high-risk ALL - except Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL -, relapsing at least 3 months after the beginning of therapy and who did not receive any SCT, received a rescue protocol combining amsacrine 120 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-3, cytarabine 1 g/m(2)/12 h, days 1-5, and etoposide 100 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-5. All relapses occurred 'on therapy'. In all, 16 patients (40%) achieved a second complete remission. The median time to neutrophil recovery >0.5 x 10(9)/l was 27 days. The median time to platelet recovery >50 x 10(9)/l was 28 days. Extra-hematologic toxicity was mild (only one toxic death from severe infection). The median overall survival was 5.4 months. The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 3.2 months with a 3-year DFS of 12%. Unfavorable prognostic factors for complete remission achievement were: high-risk ALL at diagnosis (P=0.03), and white blood cell count at relapse >or=30 x 10(9)/l (P=0.02). No relationship was found between survival and any characteristics of the disease. Four patients underwent allogeneic SCT (two phenoidentical and two genoidentical) and three patients received autologous SCT. This treatment combining amsacrine, cytarabine, and etoposide was therefore effective and well tolerated in 'on-therapy'-relapsed ALL.

Here we report on two effects of viral genes on other sites of the interferon signaling pathway. (i) In infected cells, Jak1 kinase associated with interferon receptors and Stat2 associated with the interferon signaling pathway rapidly disappear from infected cells. The level of interferon alpha receptor is also reduced, albeit less drastically at times after 4 h postinfection. Other members of the Stat family of proteins were either decreased in amount or posttranslationally processed in a manner different from those of mock-infected cells. The decrease in the levels of Jak1 and Stat2 may account for the decrease in the formation of complexes consisting of Stat1 or ISGF3 and DNA sequences containing the interferon-stimulated response elements after exposure to interferon. (ii) The disappearance of Jak1 and Stat2 was related at least in part to the function of the virion host shutoff protein, the product of the viral U(L)41 gene.

HTLV-1 contains four open reading frames (ORFs) in its pX region. ORF II encodes two proteins, p30(II) and p13(II), both of which are incompletely characterized. p30(II) localizes to the nucleus or nucleolus and has distant homology to the transcription factors Oct-1, Pit-1, and POU-M1. In vitro studies have demonstrated that at low concentrations, p30(II) differentially regulates cellular and viral promoters through an interaction with CREB binding protein/p300. To determine the in vivo significance of p30(II), we inoculated rabbits with cell lines expressing either a wild-type clone of HTLV-1 (ACH.1) or a clone containing a mutation in ORF II, which eliminated wild-type p30(II) expression (ACH.30.1). ACH.1-inoculated rabbits maintained higher HTLV-1-specific antibody titers than ACH.30.1-inoculated rabbits, and all ACH.1-inoculated rabbits were seropositive for HTLV-1, whereas only two of six ACH.30.1-inoculated rabbits were seropositive. Provirus could be consistently PCR amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA in all ACH.1-inoculated rabbits but in only three of six ACH.30.1-inoculated rabbits. Quantitative competitive PCR indicated higher PBMC proviral loads in ACH.1-inoculated rabbits. Interestingly, sequencing of ORF II from PBMC of provirus-positive ACH.30.1-inoculated rabbits revealed a reversion to wild-type sequence with evidence of early coexistence of mutant and wild-type sequence. Our data provide evidence that HTLV-1 must maintain its key accessory genes to survive in vivo and that in vivo pressures select for maintenance of wild-type ORF II gene products during the early course of infection.","['Silverman, Lee R', 'Phipps, Andrew J', 'Montgomery, Andrew', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Lairmore, Michael D']","['Silverman LR', 'Phipps AJ', 'Montgomery A', 'Ratner L', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (tof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/genetics/physiology']",2004/03/30 05:00,2004/05/07 05:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.8.3837-3845.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Apr;78(8):3837-45. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.8.3837-3845.2004.,IM,,PMC374265,,,"['CA-70529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-01474/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-069003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-92009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the viral transactivation factor, Tax, has been known to have apparent transforming ability, the exact function of Tax in ATL development is still not clear. To understand the role of Tax in ATL development, we introduced short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against Tax in a rat HTLV-1-infected T-cell line. Our results demonstrated that expression of siRNA targeting Tax successfully downregulated Tax expression. Repression of Tax expression was associated with resistance of the HTLV-1-infected T cells to Tax-specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte killing. This may be due to the direct effect of decreased Tax expression, because the Tax siRNA did not alter the expression of MHC-I, CD80, or CD86. Furthermore, T cells with Tax downregulation appeared to lose the ability to develop tumors in T-cell-deficient nude rats, in which the parental HTLV-1-infected cells induce ATL-like lymphoproliferative disease. These results indicated the importance of Tax both for activating host immune response against the virus and for maintaining the growth ability of infected cells in vivo.

However, its biological function and mechanism of transcriptional regulation in hematopoietic cells remain elusive. We have identified the regulatory region necessary for transcription of the mouse Hex gene in K562 leukemia cells through transient reporter assays involving various deletion mutants. This region, comprising +775 to +1177 in the first intron, had enhancer-like properties and showed high activity in other hematopoietic cell lines such as U937, HEL, and RAW264.7, but little activity in other Hex-expressing cell lines such as MH(1)C(1) and H4IIE hepatoma cells, suggesting that this region functions as a hematopoietic cell-specific enhancer-like element. Binding site mutation of hematopoietic transcription factors, such as GATAs and c-Myb present in the enhancer-like element, significantly decreased the luciferase reporter gene expression in K562 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that GATA-1, GATA-2, or c-Myb actually binds to three of these putative binding sites, and also suggested that several unidentified factors might interact with the enhancer-like element. Overexpression of GATA-1, GATA-2, or c-Myb stimulated the enhancer-like activity via these three binding sites.

As few data are available in very elderly patients, we conducted a 54-month retrospective study in patients over 70 years with MDS diagnosed at Hopital Charles Foix. Patients with cobalamine, folate or iron deficiency were excluded. Regarding biological and morphologic approaches, MDS patients were classified according to the FAB criteria. We then tempted to reclassify the patients according to the WHO criteria. The Bournemouth scoring system was used as a prognostic tool. During the study period, 100 patients were included, 29 males and 71 females, median age 86 +/- 7 years (70-103). At the time of bone marrow sampling, a peripheral blood cytopenia was documented in 64 patients, a bicytopenia in 27 patients and a pancytopenia in 9 patients. Isolated anaemia (Hb < 12 g/dL) was found in 60 patients and isolated thrombocytopenia (< 150 x 10(9)/L) in 4. Macrocytosis (MCV > 100 fL) was observed in 21 % of the cases. According to the FAB criteria, the 100 patients were classified as follows: refractory anaemia (RA): 79%; RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS): 8%; RA with excess of blasts (RAEB): 8%; RAEB in transformation: 1%; chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia: 4%. According to the WHO classification, the patients were reclassified as follows: RA (unilineage) (with or without ringed sideroblasts): 10%; refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with or without ringed sideroblasts (RCMD): 73%; RAEB: 7% (RAEB-1 6%, RAEB-21%); MDS/Myeloproliferative disorder: 4%; unclassified (hypocellularity): 5%; acute leukaemia: 1%. In order to estimate prognosis at the time of the bone marrow aspirate, we calculated the Bournemouth'score: 8 patients scored 0,57 scored 1,25 scored 2,8 scored 3 and 2 scored 4. In this geriatric population, 83% cases of MDS are RA or RCMD (with or without sideroblasts); MDS with excess of blasts are uncommon. Thus, elderly patients under study with MDS were diagnosed at an earlier stage of the disease than younger ones from series published in the literature. Due to frequent comorbidities, geriatric patients may be symptomatic for a slight decrease of haemoglobin level. Therefore, elderly patients are investigated as soon as they present with moderate anaemia that may explain the early MDS diagnosis.","['Dewulf, G', 'Gouin, I', 'Pautas, E', 'Gaussem, P', 'Chaibi, P', 'Andreux, J-P', 'Siguret, V']","['Dewulf G', 'Gouin I', 'Pautas E', 'Gaussem P', 'Chaibi P', 'Andreux JP', 'Siguret V']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Hopital Charles Foix (AP-HP), Ivry-sur-Seine.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood', 'Retrospective Studies']",2004/03/30 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2004 Mar-Apr;62(2):197-202.,IM,Syndromes myelodysplasiques diagnostiques dans un hopital geriatrique: profil cytologique de 100 patients.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright John Libbey Eurotext 20003.'],,,,,,,,,,

To determine the mechanism of action of HAPO, the anti-apoptotic activity and signal transduction pathway of HAPO were investigated using a factor-dependent leukemia cell line, the MO7e cells. Recombinant human HAPO (rhHAPO) was produced in Escherichia coli and purified by a series of column chromatography with a purity of more than 95%. rhHAPO significantly supported the survival of MO7e cells after deprivation of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). When the MO7e cells were treated with two specific inhibitors to PI3K (LY294002 or wortmannin), a significant loss of cell viability with evidence of apoptosis was observed. Moreover, the protein kinase B (Akt), one of the downstream effectors of PI3K-dependent survival signaling, was activated in HAPO-stimulated MO7e cells. Phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 and its downstream molecular Bad at serine 136 was induced by HAPO, but was blocked by two PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin. In addition, HAPO inhibited caspase-3 activities and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation. Such an effect of HAPO was also significantly blocked by either LY294002 or wortmannin.

Furthermore, PC-PS-MNC-CM5 induced about 66.6% of the U937 cells and 49.4% of the HL-60 cells to differentiate into mature monocytes/macrophages, which also markedly expressed surface antigens of CD11b, CD14, and CD 68. The differentiated U937 and HL-60 cells displayed physiological functions such as respiratory burst and phagocytosis, while PC-PS group and control group showed insignificant effects. Interestingly, the levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in PC-PS-MNC-CM were about 41 and 10 times, respectively, higher than that of control group. Antibody neutralization tests of the PC-PS-MNC-CM5 revealed that the growth-inhibitory and differentiation-inducing activities were mainly due to the elevated cytokines of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. It suggests that PC-PS is a biological response modifier (BRM), instead of a cytotoxic reagent, and may be a potential alternative in leukemia therapy.","['Chen, Yue-Yawn', 'Chang, Hung-Min']","['Chen YY', 'Chang HM']","['Graduate Institute of Food Science and Technology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106-17, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Polysaccharides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'U937 Cells/drug effects', 'Wolfiporia']",2004/03/30 05:00,2004/05/18 05:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2003/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.fct.2004.01.018 [doi]', 'S027869150400002X [pii]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2004 May;42(5):759-69. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2004.01.018.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have already evaluated the efficacy of extracts obtained from Brazilian herbal medicines in protecting the normal human epidermis keratinocytes [NHEK(B)] against the cytotoxicity caused by SQOOH. The EtOAc extract was separated by silica-gel column chromatography into eight fractions. Fractions (Fr) 1,3 and 5 significantly protected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells from the release of beta-hexosaminidase due to SQOOH. Additionally, Fr5-1 was most effective in a Gunze three-dimensional cultured human skin model (Vitrolife-skin) against the cytotoxicity due to SQOOH and the release of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4. The mixture of cinchonains Ia and Ib and the mixture of cinchonains IIa and IIb were isolated from Fr3 and Fr5-1, respectively. The results suggest that the addition of SQOOH caused the reduction in cell viability and the release of beta-hexosaminidase and cytokines as chemical mediators.

This is particularly well illustrated by studies of primary lymphocytes and their leukaemic counterparts. PI3K activation is required for proliferation of T cells and B cells, and certain oncogenes cause leukaemia in part by promoting PI3K signalling. Genetic manipulation of this pathway, together with biochemical studies in primary lymphocytes, has begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which PI3K contributes to the proliferation of normal and transformed lymphocytes. In particular, targeted gene disruption in mice has allowed the identification of specific isoforms of PI3K that are required for distinct cellular responses. Continued investigation of isoform specificity in PI3K signalling, as well as the characterization of critical downstream targets of PI3K signalling, may reveal strategies for the therapeutic control of immune responses and leukaemia.","['Fruman, D A']",['Fruman DA'],"['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, U.S.A. dfruman@uci.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']","['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2004/03/30 05:00,2004/12/23 09:00,['2004/03/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bst0320315 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2004 Apr;32(Pt 2):315-9. doi: 10.1042/bst0320315.,IM,,,,,['AI 50831/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last decade, CBT has increasingly been utilized not only for children, but also for adults. As a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), umbilical cord blood has the advantages of speed of availability, tolerance of 1-2 antigen HLA mismatch, and a low incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, UCB represents a highly convenient HSC source that may significantly extend the HSC donor pool. As graft cell dose is the major factor determining hematopoietic recovery and survival in CBT, methods to increase cell dose such as multiple-unit transplant and ex vivo expansion, or to increase stem cell homing such as intra-bone transplantation are being pursued. We could also speculate the existence of unique pathophysiology of acute GVHD after CBT compared with after bone marrow transplantation due to our clinical analysis. It might be very important to establish new standard management including immunosuppressive procedure after CBT to consistently keep better clinical results. Umbilical cord blood is promising alternative to bone marrow-derived stem cells. More prospective studies are needed to establish the role of CBT during various allogeneic HSC transplantations.","['Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Asano, Shigetaka']","['Takahashi S', 'Asano S']","['Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 6-1, 4 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of zosuquidar.3HCl were also determined. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and daunorubicinol were studied following daunorubicin administration on day 1 (50 mg/m2 i.v. infusion over 10 min) alone and on day 3 concomitantly with zosuquidar.3HCl (i.v. 200 or 300 mg/m2 over 6 h or 400 mg over 3 h). Of a total of 18 patients entered, 16 with acute leukemia completed the study. RESULTS: A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model adequately described daunorubicin concentration-time profiles. Five- and four-compartment models adequately described the daunorubicin-daunorubicinol pharmacokinetics in the absence and presence of zosuquidar.3HCl, respectively. The impact of zosuquidar.3HCl on coadministered daunorubicin was minimal, with a 10% reduction in daunorubicin clearance. The model predicted a 50% decrease in daunorubicinol apparent clearance in the presence of zosuquidar.3HCl. A direct concentration-effect relationship between zosuquidar.3HCl concentrations and inhibition of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux in CD56 lymphocytes was defined by a sigmoid E(max) model. The IC(50) was 31.7 microg/l. The zosuquidar.3HCl dosing regimen led to concentrations in excess of the IC(90) (169.6 microg/l) and provided maximal P-glycoprotein inhibition during the distribution phases of daunorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in daunorubicin and daunorubicinol clearance in the presence of zosuquidar.3HCl likely reflects inhibition of P-glycoprotein in the bile canaliculi impeding their biliary excretion. The results need to be interpreted carefully due to the sequential nature of daunorubicin administration and analysis.","['Callies, Sophie', 'de Alwis, Dinesh P', 'Mehta, Atul', 'Burgess, Michael', 'Aarons, Leon']","['Callies S', 'de Alwis DP', 'Mehta A', 'Burgess M', 'Aarons L']","['School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Dibenzocycloheptenes)', '0 (Quinolines)', '813AGY3126 (zosuquidar trihydrochloride)', 'YDU8YIP30L (daunorubicinol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bile Canaliculi', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dibenzocycloheptenes/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Quinolines/*pharmacokinetics']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/07/22 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0775-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004 Jul;54(1):39-48. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0775-4.

In vitro T-cell activation induces synthesis of this lipid, which is then expressed at very high levels (GM1bright) at the membrane of activated/effector cells. By flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we analyzed the expression and organization of GM1 in a series of 15 patients with CD3+ lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes (LDGL). We found that GM1bright GL were detectable in fresh blood samples obtained in all LDGL patients, although the range of brightly stained cells was extremely variable. This distinctive in vivo pattern has never been shown in T lymphocytes from healthy individuals or in patients with different chronic T or B lymphoproliferative disorders or active infectious diseases. The low number of cycling cells detected in LDGL patients was always included within the GM1bright GL population. Interestingly, GM1bright GL were demonstrated to contain a higher amount of IFN-gamma as compared to GM1dull GL. These findings allow to distinguish subsets of GL at different levels of activation within the monoclonal CD3+ population. The GM1bright GL subset is likely to be responsible for the renewing of GL and thus for maintaining chronic proliferation.","['Zambello, R', 'Cabrelle, A', 'Trentin, L', 'Agostini, C', 'Semenzato, G', 'Viola, A']","['Zambello R', 'Cabrelle A', 'Trentin L', 'Agostini C', 'Semenzato G', 'Viola A']","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Clinical Immunology Branch, University of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)']","['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'CD3 Complex', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Microdomains/*chemistry', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403292 [doi]', '2403292 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):771-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403292.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment outcome of these patients is heterogeneous. This study assessed whether such clinical heterogeneity could be partially explained by the presence and characteristics of additional chromosomal abnormalities. Cytogenetic descriptions were available for 249 of 326 children with Ph+ ALL, diagnosed and treated by 10 different study groups/large single institutions from 1986 to 1996. Secondary aberrations were present in 61% of the cases. Chromosomes 9, 22, 7, 14, and 8 were most frequently abnormal. Most (93%) karyotypes were unbalanced. Three main cytogenetic subgroups were identified: no secondary aberrations, gain of a second Ph and/or >50 chromosomes, or loss of chromosome 7, 7p, and/or 9p, while other secondary aberrations were grouped as combinations of gain and loss or others. Of the three main cytogenetic subgroups, the loss group had the worst event-free survival (P=0.124) and disease-free survival (P=0.013). However, statistical significance was not maintained when adjusted for other prognostic factors and treatment. Karyotypic analysis is valuable in subsets of patients identified by molecular screening, to assess the role of additional chromosomal abnormalities and their correlation with clinical heterogeneity, with possible therapeutic implications.","['Heerema, N A', 'Harbott, J', 'Galimberti, S', 'Camitta, B M', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Kamps, W', 'Basso, G', 'Pui, C-H', 'Schrappe, M', 'Auclerc, M-F', 'Carroll, A J', 'Conter, V', 'Harrison, C J', 'Pullen, J', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Richards, S', 'Riehm, H', 'Sather, H N', 'Shuster, J J', 'Silverman, L B', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Arico, M']","['Heerema NA', 'Harbott J', 'Galimberti S', 'Camitta BM', 'Gaynon PS', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Kamps W', 'Basso G', 'Pui CH', 'Schrappe M', 'Auclerc MF', 'Carroll AJ', 'Conter V', 'Harrison CJ', 'Pullen J', 'Raimondi SC', 'Richards S', 'Riehm H', 'Sather HN', 'Shuster JJ', 'Silverman LB', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Arico M']","['Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. heerema-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,"['Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403324 [doi]', '2403324 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):693-702. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403324.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study Groups', 'ALL-BFM', 'CoALL', 'AIEOP', 'DCLSG', 'FRALLE', 'CCG', 'DFCI', 'POG', 'St Jude', 'UKALL']",,,,,,,,

In this study, 61 newly diagnosed APL subjects were randomized into three treatment groups, namely by ATRA, As(2)O(3), and the combination of the two drugs. CR was determined by hematological analysis, tumor burden was examined with real-time quantitative RT-PCR of the PML-RAR alpha (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha) fusion transcripts, and side effects were evaluated by means of clinical examinations. Mechanisms possibly involved were also investigated with cellular and molecular biology methods. Although CR rates in three groups were all high (> or =90%), the time to achieve CR differed significantly, with that of the combination group being the shortest one. Earlier recovery of platelet count was also found in this group. The disease burden as reflected by fold change of PML-RAR alpha transcripts at CR decreased more significantly in combined therapy as compared with ATRA or As(2)O(3) mono-therapy (P < 0.01). This difference persisted after consolidation (P < 0.05). Importantly, all 20 cases in the combination group remained in CR whereas 7 of 37 cases treated with mono-therapy relapsed (P < 0.05) after a follow-up of 8-30 months (median: 18 months). Synergism of ATRA and As(2)O(3) on apoptosis and degradation of PML-RAR alpha oncoprotein might provide a plausible explanation for superior efficacy of combination therapy in clinic. In conclusion, the ATRA/As(2)O(3) combination for remission/maintenance therapy of APL brings much better results than either of the two drugs used alone in terms of the quality of CR and the status of the disease-free survival.","['Shen, Zhi-Xiang', 'Shi, Zhan-Zhong', 'Fang, Jing', 'Gu, Bai-Wei', 'Li, Jun-Min', 'Zhu, Yong-Mei', 'Shi, Jing-Yi', 'Zheng, Pei-Zheng', 'Yan, Hua', 'Liu, Yuan-Fang', 'Chen, Yu', 'Shen, Yang', 'Wu, Wen', 'Tang, Wei', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'De The, Hugues', 'Wang, Zhen-Yi', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu']","['Shen ZX', 'Shi ZZ', 'Fang J', 'Gu BW', 'Li JM', 'Zhu YM', 'Shi JY', 'Zheng PZ', 'Yan H', 'Liu YF', 'Chen Y', 'Shen Y', 'Wu W', 'Tang W', 'Waxman S', 'De The H', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Lab of Medical Genomics, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0400053101 [doi]', '0400053101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 13;101(15):5328-35. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0400053101.

We have previously shown that CBFB-MYH11 is necessary but not sufficient for leukemogenesis. Here, we report the identification of genes that specifically cooperate with CBFB-MYH11 in leukemogenesis. Neonatal injection of Cbfb-MYH11 knock-in chimeric mice with retrovirus 4070A led to the development of acute myeloid leukemia in 2-5 months. Each leukemia sample contained one or a few viral insertions, suggesting that alteration of one gene could be sufficient to synergize with Cbfb-MYH11. The chromosomal position of 67 independent retroviral insertion sites (RISs) was determined, and 90% of the RISs mapped within 10 kb of a flanking gene. In total, 54 candidate genes were identified; six of them were common insertion sites (CISs). CIS genes included members of a zinc finger transcription factors family, Plag1 and Plagl2, with eight and two independent insertions, respectively.

In this paper we describe a strategy optimized for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of haemoglobinopathies combined with HLA matching. This procedure involves a minisequencing-based genotyping of HLA regions A, B, C and DRB combined with mutation analysis of the gene regions involved by mutation. Analysis of at least eight polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) markers scattered through the HLA complex has also been included to detect potential contamination and crossing-over occurrences between HLA genes. The above assay can also be used for preimplantation HLA matching as a primary indication. The strategy was clinically applied for HLA matching in 17 cycles (14 for beta-thalassaemia, one for Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome and two for leukaemia). A reliable HLA genotype was achieved in 255/266 (95.9%) of the blastomeres. In total, 22 (14.8%) embryos were obtained that were HLA-matched with the affected siblings, 14 (9.4%) of which were unaffected and transferred back to the patients. Four clinical pregnancies were obtained, three of which (one twin, two singletons) are ongoing and were confirmed as healthy and HLA-identical with the affected children. Minisequencing-based HLA typing combined with HLA STR haplotyping has been shown to be a reliable strategy for preimplantation HLA matching. The major advantage of this approach is that the validation of a single assay can be done once and then used for the majority of the patients, reducing notably time needed for preclinical set-up of each case.","['Fiorentino, F', 'Biricik, A', 'Karadayi, H', 'Berkil, H', 'Karlikaya, G', 'Sertyel, S', 'Podini, D', 'Baldi, M', 'Magli, M C', 'Gianaroli, L', 'Kahraman, S']","['Fiorentino F', 'Biricik A', 'Karadayi H', 'Berkil H', 'Karlikaya G', 'Sertyel S', 'Podini D', 'Baldi M', 'Magli MC', 'Gianaroli L', 'Kahraman S']","['EmbryoGen (Centre for Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis), Rome, Italy. fiorentino@embryogen.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],"['Blastocyst/physiology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Female', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/*diagnosis', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Preimplantation Diagnosis/*methods']",2004/03/27 05:00,2005/03/22 09:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/molehr/gah055 [doi]', 'gah055 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2004 Jun;10(6):445-60. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gah055.

However, the signals initiating growth of primordial follicles are unknown. Growth factors such as leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) may play a role in this process. To investigate the expression of LIF and its receptor in early developing follicles, nine ovarian samples from adolescents/adults aged 13-43 years and 23 ovaries from human fetuses aged 19-33 gestational weeks were immediately fixed or frozen. The fixed samples were prepared for a study of immunocytochemical staining of LIF and its two receptor units (LIF-R and gp 130). mRNA was extracted from the frozen ovarian samples, and the expression of LIF, LIF-R and gp 130 was investigated by RT-PCR. Products were resolved by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and image analysis. There was strong to moderate immunocytochemical staining for LIF and LIF-R in oocytes from the primordial follicular stages onwards, and very weak to moderate staining for gp 130. LIF-R was also detected in granulosa cells of primary and secondary follicles from adolescents/adults. Transcripts of LIF, LIF-R and gp 130 RNA were identified by RT-PCR in all samples. The immunocytochemical staining and mRNA expression of LIF and its receptor are consistent with the concept that LIF might be involved in growth initiation of human primordial follicles through its receptor.","['Abir, R', 'Fisch, B', 'Jin, S', 'Barnnet, M', 'Freimann, S', 'Van den Hurk, R', 'Feldberg, D', 'Nitke, S', 'Krissi, H', 'Ao, A']","['Abir R', 'Fisch B', 'Jin S', 'Barnnet M', 'Freimann S', 'Van den Hurk R', 'Feldberg D', 'Nitke S', 'Krissi H', 'Ao A']","['Infertility and IVF Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petah Tikva 49100 Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. ronita@clalit.org.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Fetus/anatomy & histology/*physiology', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Ovary/cytology/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/03/27 05:00,2005/09/17 09:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/molehr/gah047 [doi]', 'gah047 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2004 May;10(5):313-9. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gah047.

An hGR 1A promoter/exon sequence (-218/+269) contains at least 12 deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I footprints that contain bound protein. Whereas four of these footprints (FP6, FP7, FP8, and FP11) contain bound hGR in protein-DNA complexes that are formed, only two (FP7 and FP11) appear to be important for the up-regulation of hGR 1A promoter/exon activity in T-lymphoblasts. Furthermore, the activity of these DNA elements depends upon the promoter context, leading to a redundant and complex regulation of expression of the hGR 1A promoter/exon. FP7 appears to be required for hormonal responsiveness in the absence of upstream sequences (+41/+191), whereas the hormonal responsiveness of FP11 requires a functional, adjacent FP12 DNA sequence. FP12 contains overlapping binding sites for the protooncogene transcription factors c-Myb and c-Ets. It seems likely that binding of either c-Myb or c-Ets to FP12 is necessary for the direct or indirect binding of the hGR to FP11 (a nonconsensus glucocorticoid response element), and the resultant steroid-responsiveness of the hGR 1A promoter/exon sequence. We propose that the identity of the accessory transcription factor bound to FP12 (c-Myb or c-Ets) may determine the nature of regulation (positive or negative) of hGR gene expression by hormone, and that this may be important for hormone-induced apoptosis in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Geng, Chuan-Dong', 'Vedeckis, Wayne V']","['Geng CD', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, 533 Bolivar Street, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']","['Binding Sites', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*metabolism', 'Exons/physiology', 'Humans', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1210/me.2003-0157 [doi]', 'me.2003-0157 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2004 Apr;18(4):912-24. doi: 10.1210/me.2003-0157.

In other mammals, this is not possible with LIF alone. Chicken ES-like cells (blastodermal cells) have only been cultured with mouse LIF because chicken LIF was not available. However the culture system is imperfect and chicken ES-like cells equivalent to mouse ES cells were not observed. In the present study, we cloned the cDNA-encoding chicken LIF using mRNA subtraction and RACE methodology. The chicken LIF cDNA encodes a protein with approximately 40% sequence identity to mouse LIF. It has 211 amino acids including a putative N-terminal signal peptide of 24 residues. Chicken blastodermal cells were cultured in the presence of bacterially expressed chicken LIF or mouse LIF. The expression of alkaline phosphatase and embryonal carcinoma cell monoclonal antibody-1 and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 and the activation of STAT3 were examined, all of which are indices of the undifferentiated state. Exposure in the blastodermal cells to recombinant chicken LIF but not to mouse LIF maintained the expression of these various markers. After 9 days of incubation, the blastodermal cells formed cystic embryoid bodies in the presence of mouse LIF but not in the presence of recombinant chicken LIF.

This study investigated the molecular basis of LIF-induced augmentation of I(CaL) in rodent cardiomyocytes. LIF induced phosphorylation of a serine residue in the alpha(1c) subunit (Ca(v)1.2) of L-type Ca2+ channels in cultured rat cardiomyocytes, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by PD98059. When constructs encoding either a wild-type or a carboxyl-terminal-truncated rabbit Ca(v)1.2 subunit were transfected into HEK293 cells, LIF induced phosphorylation of the resultant wild-type protein but not the mutant protein. Cotransfection of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase also resulted in phosphorylation of the Ca(v)1.2 subunit in the absence of LIF stimulation. In in-gel kinase assays, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylated a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the carboxyl-terminal region of Ca(v)1.2 (residues 1700 through 1923), which contains the consensus sequence Pro-Leu-Ser-Pro. A point mutation within this consensus sequence, which results in a substitution of alanine for serine at residue 1829 (S1829A), was sufficient to abolish the LIF-induced phosphorylation. LIF increased I(CaL) in HEK cells transfected with wild-type Ca(v)1.2 but not with the mutated version. These results provide direct evidence that LIF phosphorylates the serine residue at position 1829 of the Ca(v)1.2 subunit via the actions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and that this phosphorylation increases I(CaL) in cardiomyocytes.","['Takahashi, Eiichi', 'Fukuda, Keiichi', 'Miyoshi, Shunichiro', 'Murata, Mitsushige', 'Kato, Takahiro', 'Ita, Makoto', 'Tanabe, Tsutomu', 'Ogawa, Satoshi']","['Takahashi E', 'Fukuda K', 'Miyoshi S', 'Murata M', 'Kato T', 'Ita M', 'Tanabe T', 'Ogawa S']","['Institute for Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics, Shinanomachi Research Park, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Calcium Channels, L-Type)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (L-type calcium channel alpha(1C))', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Angiotensin II/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Aorta', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channels, L-Type/chemistry/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/drug effects/metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphoserine/analysis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1161/01.RES.0000126405.38858.BC [doi]', '01.RES.0000126405.38858.BC [pii]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2004 May 14;94(9):1242-8. doi: 10.1161/01.RES.0000126405.38858.BC.

T-PLL, defined as a T-cell leukemia showing rapidly rising PB lymphocyte counts, was the only tumor type expressing the oncoprotein TCL1 (71% of cases) and could present with relatively low lymphocyte levels or small tumor cell morphology. SS, defined by accompanying erythrodermic skin disease, was frequently associated with peripheral eosinophilia but could also develop high numbers of prolymphocytes, especially late in the disease course. T-LGL leukemia, defined by accompanying cytopenias or autoimmune phenomena (or both), had the best clinical outcome and generally showed the lowest circulating lymphocyte levels with only a few cases developing marked lymphocytosis.

METHODS: The recombinant adenovirus vector with murine sFas, adsFas, and the control vector adEGFP were constructed using homologous recombination between two plasmids in Escherichia coli. BMT was carried out after the BMMCs were infected with Adenoviruses. The mice models of leukemia/lymphoma were constructed by inoculating female C57BL/6 mice (H-2b) with 10(5) EL4 cells/mouse through caudal vein. Donors of bone marrow grafts were syngeneic male mice. BMMCs were infected with AdsFas or AdEGFP 24 hours before (Group D or E). The following three groups were simultaneously used: Group A, no BMMCs transplanted; Group B, transplanted with BMMCs not infected with adenoviruses; Group C, only transfusing EL4 cells, neither irradiation nor BMT. The hematopoietic reconstitution, generation of leukemia/lymphoma and the survival rate were observed in all groups after BMT. RESULTS: The adenovirus vectors were successfully constructed. The titre of virus after purification was up to 2.5 x 10(11) pfu/ml. Spleen indices examined 11 days after BMT were not obviously different among Group B, D and E (P > 0.05), but indices in Group A were significantly lower than those in the latter three groups (P < 0.01). Counts of leukocytes and platelets on +30 day showed mice were reconstituted satisfactorily in Group B and D, but very low in Group C and E. The Y-chromosomes existed 2 months after BMT and examination of bone marrow cytology showed that Group B and D were almost normal, but Group C and E had plenty of lymphoblast-like tumor cells. Tumors were obviously observed in the mice of Group C and E by histopathological examination, but the mice in Group B and D were normal. The survival rates were 0 (0/4) in Group A, 100% in Group B (6/6) and D (16/16), 12.5% (2/16) in Group C and 6.25% (1/16) in Group E respectively. It is demonstrated that, in contrast with the control (Group EGFP), survival rate was significantly increased in the sFas Group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The transfer of sFas gene by adenovirus changed the prognosis state of leukemia/lymphoma mice after auto-BMT. The transduction of sFas might block the effect of the immune escape of EL4 cells through FasL. These results could thus provide a new direction to find a way to treat the leukemia and its recurrence after BMT.","['Hu, Zhong-bo', 'Zou, Ping', 'Li, Ai-xiang', 'Zhang, You-shan', 'Wang, Liang-li', 'Liu, Ling-bo']","['Hu ZB', 'Zou P', 'Li AX', 'Zhang YS', 'Wang LL', 'Liu LB']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']","['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Escape/*physiology']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2004 Mar;117(3):419-24.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 10 normal individuals, 8 donors and 11 patients with leukemia before and after transplantation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of 24 TCR V beta genes was used to examine serial samples of PBMC. The PCR products were further analyzed by genescan to evaluate clonality of T cells. RESULTS: The 24 TCR V beta gene repertoire displayed highly diverse and polyclonal spectratypes in all normal individuals and 4 of 8 donors. Another 4 donors expressed part of the 24 TCR V beta subfamily and 1 donor had oligoclonality. The expressions of the 24 TCR V beta subfamilies were skewed and restricted in 11 leukemia patients before and after transplantation. Some absences of 24 TCR V beta subfamily expression were quite similar between the recipients pro-transplantation and related donors. The number of subfamilies expressed increased over time post-transplantation, but the restricted expressions of the subfamily could last 6 - 30 months after transplantation. All patients with GVHD and some without GVHD exhibited T cell clonal expansion. The expansive T cell clone was distributed in V beta 2-3, 16-17, 18-19, 21 and V beta 23 in patients with GVHD and in V beta 7, 9, 16 and 19 in patients without GVHD. One patient with syngeneic-HSCT (syn-HSCT) had V beta 15 and 16 T cell expansion after transplantation. One patient displayed V beta 18 T cell expansion after donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). CONCLUSIONS: Normal individuals express the entire 24 TCR V beta gene repertoire and have polyclonal distribution. However, the TCR V beta gene repertoire is only partially expressed in some donors. The TCR V beta gene repertoire is restrictedly expressed in a skew fashion in patients with leukemia before and after transplantation. The number of TCR V beta gene subfamilies increases over time post-transplantation. GVHD and GVL effects may induce the proliferation of T cell clones. Clinical GVL response may be distinguished from GVHD alloreactivity through the host MHC antigen.","['Liu, Qi-fa', 'Li, Yang-qiu', 'Yang, Dong', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Yang, Li-jian', 'Chen, Shao-hua', 'Sun, Jing', 'Liu, Xiao-li', 'Zhou, Shu-yun']","['Liu QF', 'Li YQ', 'Yang D', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang LJ', 'Chen SH', 'Sun J', 'Liu XL', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. liuqifa@fimmu.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']","['Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2004 Mar;117(3):413-8.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concerns about the transfusion-related complications, such as infections (e.g. the very low risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission and the risk of postoperative infections), haemolytic transfusion reaction, immunological effects and the costs, prompt a reevaluation of the transfusion practice. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 84 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), who were treated with combination chemotherapy between June 1, 1997 and December 7, 2001, was performed. The use of red-cell transfusions with a restrictive transfusion policy (haemoglobin = 7.2-8.8 g dL(-1), dependent on age and symptoms, n = 38) was compared with a more liberal transfusion trigger (haemoglobin = 9.6 g dL(-1), n = 46). The number of units transfused was recorded. Signs and symptoms of anaemia, chemotherapy-related effects and complications were investigated for both transfusion policies. The more restrictive transfusion policy led to a significant decrease of 11% of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in patients with AML. No significant differences were found in the incidence of infections, number of platelet units transfused, bleeding complications, cardiac symptoms or response to chemotherapy. The more restrictive transfusion policy was feasible in this clinical setting, and it might be concluded that a restrictive transfusion policy is safe in supporting clinical patients treated with intensive chemotherapy for AML.","['Jansen, A J G', 'Caljouw, M A A', 'Hop, W C J', 'van Rhenen, D J', 'Schipperus, M R']","['Jansen AJ', 'Caljouw MA', 'Hop WC', 'van Rhenen DJ', 'Schipperus MR']","['Sanquin Blood Bank South West Region, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Transfus Med,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",9301182,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemoglobins)']","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/adverse effects/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', '*Health Policy', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/etiology/therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.0958-7578.2004.00477.x [doi]', 'TME477 [pii]']",ppublish,Transfus Med. 2004 Feb;14(1):33-8. doi: 10.1111/j.0958-7578.2004.00477.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As high as a 50-percent difference in Hb content can be encountered between two units. In this study, 500 mL of whole blood (WB)-generated RBCs according to their total Hb content was used to decrease the number of units ordered by using a new software called Hemosoft. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-one consecutive patients were enrolled for the study. The median age and male-to-female ratio were 38 (range, 16-69) and 28:23, respectively. Patients' diagnoses were 38 acute leukemia, 11 lymphoma, and 2 multiple myeloma. When placing orders for RBCs, clinicians were asked to send the information about patient's actual body weight (ABW) and their actual and target Hb. The total blood volume of the recipient was calculated, and the aim was to find the best RBCs from the inventory to decrease two-unit orders to one unit, or four units to two or one unit, all done using Hemosoft. Posttransfusion Hb was checked 2 hours after transfusion. ABW and the median pretransfusion Hb level were 64 kg (range, 40-100) and 7.3 g per dL (5.6-9.8), respectively. RESULTS: A total of 104 RBC units were ordered for 51 patients. In 49 (96.1%), the order was for two units and in 2 (3.9%) was for three units. Hemosoft successfully found a suitable match in 62.7 percent (32/51) of the orders. Actual number of RBCs transfused was two units (41.25) and one unit (58.8%), respectively. In total, 72 units were transfused with a reduction of 30 percent (72/104) from the original order. The median target Hb level was 9.3 g per dL (range, 7.0-11.3) and overall success rate to achieve it was 96.6 percent (range, 73.8-124.2). There was no impact of inventory size, but the ABW of the recipient was found significant to have a successful match unit (58.8 +/- 11.0 kg vs. 75.0 +/- 8.4 kg, respectively; p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: We clearly demonstrated that the number of RBC transfusions could be minimized by the rational use of the Hb content of the units. Although the total numbers of patients who shall benefit from this approach seems to be limited, it allows us to use high-Hb-content units rationally by using an in-house blood-banking software.","['Arslan, Onder', 'Toprak, Selami', 'Arat, Mutlu', 'Kayalak, Yasemin']","['Arslan O', 'Toprak S', 'Arat M', 'Kayalak Y']","['Ankara University, Medical School, Department of Hematology, Blood Bank & Apheresis Unit, Ankara, Turkey. arslan@medicine.ankara.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/prevention & control', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching/standards', 'Decision Making, Computer-Assisted', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Hemoglobins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Software']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03225.x [doi]', 'TRF03225 [pii]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2004 Apr;44(4):485-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03225.x.,IM,,,,,,['Transfusion. 2005 Jan;45(1):3-4.

METHODS: The medical charts of 200 CLL patients registered to our center between 1984 and 2000 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Of all patients, 129 were men and 71 were women (male/female ratio, 1.82). The median age at the time of initial diagnosis was 63 years (range, 38-90 years). Sixty patients were classified as Binet's Stage A, 49 as Stage B, and 91 as Stage C. Sixty-two cases were diagnosed during routine laboratory examinations when they were asymptomatic. Forty-three patients were lost to follow-up, and 157 patients have been followed regularly until the end of the study period. Hemolytic anemia developed in nine (5.7%) patients, second primary cancer in six (3.8%), and Richter's syndrome in two (1.2%). Forty-eight percent of CLL patients were treated immediately after initial diagnosis. The overall response (complete or partial) to first-line and second-line therapies was 61.6% and 54.4%, respectively. The median time of follow-up for patients followed up regularly was 47 months (range, 1-195 months). Sixty-three patients died during the follow-up: the deaths of 39 (62%) of these were attributable to CLL-related causes. The median survival time was 48 months. The 5-year survival rate was 36.5% and the 10-year survival rate was 8%. Stage according to Rai's classification, lymphocyte count, and age showed a significant prognostic effect on survival by univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, advanced age and lymphocyte count were independent prognostic parameters. CONCLUSION: In our study, more asymptomatic CLL patients have been diagnosed in recent years. The survival, especially of our early-stage patients, was shorter than that in other CLL series of Western origin. Rai's staging system was seen to determine prognosis better than Binet's staging system.","['Pamuk, Omer Nuri', 'Pamuk, Gulsum Emel', 'Soysal, Teoman', 'Ongoren, Seniz', 'Baslar, Zafer', 'Ferhanoglu, Burhan', 'Aydin, Yildiz', 'Ulku, Birsen', 'Aktuglu, Gulten', 'Akman, Nuran']","['Pamuk ON', 'Pamuk GE', 'Soysal T', 'Ongoren S', 'Baslar Z', 'Ferhanoglu B', 'Aydin Y', 'Ulku B', 'Aktuglu G', 'Akman N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, University of Istanbul, Istanbul, Turkey. onpamuk80@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/04/23 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.SMJ.0000053674.03385.B7 [doi]'],ppublish,South Med J. 2004 Mar;97(3):240-5. doi: 10.1097/01.SMJ.0000053674.03385.B7.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cost analysis. METHODS: In the period 1994-1999, the direct medical costs (price level of 1998) of bone-marrow transplantation from related donors (BMT), stem-cell transplantation from unrelated donors (VUD-SCT) and allogeneic peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) from related donors were determined on the basis of data on adult patients with either acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 66) or acute lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 31). First, the medical resource use by these patients was determined and multiplied by the unit costs of each of the items. Second, a structural programme for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation brings along costs that are not evident from the registration of the medical resource use (e.g., the costs of pretransplantation screening and the selection of the donor). The costs of these items were calculated by taking inventory in the hospitals and assessed by experts. RESULTS: The average costs per transplanted patient were [symbol: see text] 98,334 (BMT), [symbol: see text] 151,754 (VUD-SCT) and [symbol: see text] 98,977 (PBSCT) during the first two years after transplantation. The greater part of the costs was incurred in the transplantation phase. In VUD-SCT, one-third of the total cost was due to the costs of finding a suitable donor. CONCLUSION: The current budget for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is insufficient to perform the transplantations adequately. Periodic evaluation of the budgets for complicated procedures based on cost analyses has added value for the evaluation of the development of these procedures in time and can thereby contribute to the quality and continuity of care.","['Groot, M T', 'van Agthoven, M', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Willemze, R', 'Uyl-de Groot, C A']","['Groot MT', 'van Agthoven M', 'Lowenberg B', 'Willemze R', 'Uyl-de Groot CA']","['Institute for Medical Technology Assessment, Erasmus Medisch Centrum, Postbus 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam. groot@bmg.eur.nl']",['dut'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,0400770,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/economics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/economics/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*economics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics', 'Transplantation, Autologous/economics', 'Transplantation, Homologous/economics']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 2004 Mar 6;148(10):480-4.,IM,Der rol van kostenanalysen in de evaluatie van de ontwikkeling van medische technologieen.

The emphasis is placed on the three-dimensional gel-based microchips developed at the Center of Biological Microchips headed by A.D. Mirzabekov since 1988. The gel-based chips of the last generation, IMAGE chips (Immobilized Micro Array of Gel Elements), have a number of advantages over the previous versions. The microchips are manufactured by photo-initiated copolymerization of gel components and immobilized molecules (DNA, proteins, and ligands). This ensures an even distribution of the immobilized probe throughout the microchip gel element with a high yield (about 50% for oligonucleotides). The use of methacrylamide as a main component of the polymerization mixture resulted in a substantial increase of gel porosity without affecting its mechanical strength and stability, which allowed one to work with the DNA fragments of up to 500 nt in length, as well as with rather large protein molecules. At present, the gel-based microchips are widely applied to address different problems. The generic microchips containing a complete set of possible hexanucleotides are used to reveal the DNA motifs binding with different proteins and to study the DNA-protein interactions. The oligonucleotide microchips are a cheap and reliable tool of diagnostics designed for mass application. Biochips have been developed for identification of the tuberculosis pathogen and its antibiotic-resistant forms; for diagnostics of orthopoxviruses, including the smallpox virus; for diagnostics of the anthrax pathogen; and for identification of chromosomal rearrangements in leukemia patients. The protein microchips can be adapted for further use in proteomics. Bacterial and yeast cells were also immobilized in the gel, maintaining their viability, which open a wide potential for creation biosensors on the basis of microchips.","['Kolchinskii, A M', 'Griadunov, D A', 'Lysov, Iu P', 'Mikhailovich, V M', 'Nasedkina, T V', 'Turygin, A Iu', 'Rubina, A Iu', 'Barskii, V E', 'Zasedatelev, A S']","['Kolchinskii AM', 'Griadunov DA', 'Lysov IuP', 'Mikhailovich VM', 'Nasedkina TV', 'Turygin AIu', 'Rubina AIu', 'Barskii VE', 'Zasedatelev AS']","['Health Front Line, Ltd., Champaign, IL, USA.']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,['0 (Gels)'],"['*Gels', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', '*Semiconductors']",2004/03/27 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/03/27 05:00'],"['2004/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 2004 Jan-Feb;38(1):5-16.,IM,Mikrochipy na osnove trekhmernykh iacheek gelia: istoriia i perspektivy.,,,,,,,43,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of S. stercoralis infection in patients who were undergoing cancer treatment at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). RESULTS: The overall S. stercoralis infection frequency was approximately 1.0 per 10,000 new cancer cases between 1971 and 2003. Twenty-two of 25 patients (88%) were U.S. residents (19 from Texas; 1 each from Mississippi, Tennessee, and Puerto Rico), and the remaining 3 (13%) were from Latin America. Thirteen (52%) had solid-organ malignancies, whereas 12 (48%) had hematologic malignancies (lymphoma or multiple myeloma, n=8; leukemia, n=3; aplastic anemia, n=1). Twelve patients (48%) received systemic corticosteroids, 9 (36%) received antineoplastic therapy, and 2 underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Diarrhea was reported in 13 patients (57%), and eosinophilia was observed in 11 patients (48%); 4 patients (16%) had probable hyperinfection syndrome (in 3 cases of polymicrobial gram-negative bacteremia, 1 patient had Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, whereas 1 patient presented with K. pneumoniae lung infection alone). Evidence of definite pulmonary hyperinfection syndrome was observed in 2 HSCT recipients (8%). Fourteen (74%) of 19 patients responded to thiabendazole therapy. Two patients with definite pulmonary hyperinfection syndrome developed fatal S. stercoralis hemorrhagic alveolitis despite receiving high-dose thiabendazole plus ivermectin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, strongyloidiasis was uncommon in patients with cancer and remained localized in individuals with solid-organ malignancies. Definite pulmonary accelerated autoinfections were observed only in HSCT recipients. Therefore, pre-HSCT S. stercoralis screening in individuals from endemic regions of the United States warrants further study.","['Safdar, Amar', 'Malathum, Kumthorn', 'Rodriguez, Saul J', 'Husni, Rola', 'Rolston, Kenneth V I']","['Safdar A', 'Malathum K', 'Rodriguez SJ', 'Husni R', 'Rolston KV']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. asafdar@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antinematodal Agents)', 'N1Q45E87DT (Thiabendazole)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antinematodal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Child', 'Feces/parasitology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/parasitology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Strongyloidiasis/complications/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Thiabendazole/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",2004/03/26 05:00,2004/05/07 05:00,['2004/03/26 05:00'],"['2004/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20120 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Apr 1;100(7):1531-6. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20120.,IM,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

Experimental in vitro systems involving well defined cell lines and conditions can be used to some advantage to answer specific questions and to develop in vitro models of imatinib resistance that would reflect its potential heterogeneity. METHODS: Two cell lines, KBM5 and KBM7, which expressed p210 Bcr/Abl and which differed in their inherent sensitivity to imatinib, the number of copies of the BCR/ABL fusion gene, and the activation of apoptotic pathways, were grown in vitro in the presence of increasing concentrations of imatinib. The resistant cells were analyzed for cell cycle progression, apoptotic response after exposure to imatinib, expression of Bcr/Abl, tyrosine kinase activity, and the presence of mutations within the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) coding domain of BCR/ABL. At various levels of resistance, the cells were transferred into drug-free media, and the stability of the resistant phenotype was determined in the absence of the drug. RESULTS: In KBM7 cells, the development of resistance was characterized by loss of apoptotic response to the drug, amplification of BCR/ABL, increased levels of expression of p210 Bcr/Abl, and decreased inhibition of Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase (TK) activity by imatinib. No mutations within the ATP-binding domain of Bcr/Abl were identified, and resistance remained stable in the absence of the drug. In KBM5 cells, which previously were found to be characterized by the acquisition of a single C-T mutation at ABL nucleotide 944 (T315I) at high levels of resistance, this same mutation was detected at an intermediate level, but not at a low level, of resistance. The response of KBM5 cells to imatinib was characterized by a low level of apoptotic response, a marginal increase in BCR/ABL copy number, a modest increase in p210 expression, and a highly imatinib-resistant Bcr/Abl TK. Partial reversal of resistance was observed in highly resistant KBM5-STI571(R1.0) cells, which continued to display the C-T mutation. In KBM5 cells with an intermediate level of resistance, the T315I mutation was no longer detectable upon their reversal to the sensitive phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: BCR/ABL amplification with subsequent overexpression of Bcr/Abl protein, loss of apoptotic response, or point mutation of the ATP-binding site of BCR/ABL was associated alternatively with the acquisition of the resistant phenotype, supporting the notion that multiple mechanisms are involved in the induction of resistance to imatinib. The initial number of BCR/ABL copies itself was not related directly to the degree of resistance. The reversibility of the resistance may be complete, partial, or irreversible, depending on the mechanism(s) involved and the degree of resistance. Both cell lines serve as models for further elucidation of various aspects of imatinib-resistance mechanisms.","['Scappini, Barbara', 'Gatto, Simona', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Ricci, Clara', 'Divoky, Vladimir', 'Wierda, William G', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Dong, Li', 'Hayes, Kimberly', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Beran, Miloslav']","['Scappini B', 'Gatto S', 'Onida F', 'Ricci C', 'Divoky V', 'Wierda WG', 'Andreeff M', 'Dong L', 'Hayes K', 'Verstovsek S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Beran M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2004/03/26 05:00,2004/05/07 05:00,['2004/03/26 05:00'],"['2004/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20131 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Apr 1;100(7):1459-71. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20131.,IM,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

OSI-211 has significant activity in severe combined immunodeficient mouse models of human leukemia. METHODS: This study was conducted to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and pharmacokinetics of OSI-211 in patients with refractory myeloid leukemias. Patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) were eligible. OSI-211 was given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 3 days. The starting dose was 1.5 mg/m2 per day (4.5 mg/m2 per course). The dose was escalated by 50% until Grade 2 toxicity was observed and then by 30-35% until the DLT was defined. Serial plasma and urine samples were collected, and drug levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. RESULTS: Twenty patients (18 patients [90%] with AML, and 1 patient each [5%] with MDS and CML-BP) were treated. Mucositis and diarrhea were considered to be the DLTs. The maximum tolerated dose was 3.7 mg/m2 per day. Fourteen of 18 evaluable patients (78%) with AML or MDS achieved transient bone marrow aplasia. The mean systemic clearance of lurtotecan in plasma was 0.946 +/- 1.53 L/hour/m2. Urinary recovery of lurtotecan was 6.66% +/- 5.26% (range, 1.05-18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal encapsulation of lurtotecan altered its metabolism significantly. There was no evident correlation between exposure, as measured by plasma pharmacokinetics of lurtotecan, and clinical response or toxicities.

METHODS: Patients received 18 weeks of therapy. Prophylactic cranial radiation (2400 centigrays) and 12 doses of triple intrathecal chemotherapy were administered to the first cohort of patients. A subsequent cohort received the same therapy, with the exceptions that intrathecal therapy was reduced to six doses and radiotherapy was administered only to high-risk individuals. RESULTS: The median follow-up durations were 6.8 years in Cohort 1 and 4.1 years in Cohort 2. Three occurrences of transverse myelitis, 2 severe neuropathies, 3 cases of aphasia, and 1 case of blindness were documented in the first cohort of 52 patients (Cohort 1). In the subsequent cohort of 40 patients (Cohort 2), none of these occurrences were observed, and patients experienced less neurologic toxicity overall (61% vs. 26%; P=0.001). Responses were similar, and the 3-year event-free survival rate was 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.65) for Cohort 1 and 0.45 (0.29-0.60) for Cohort 2.

However, the optimal approach to concurrent treatment in women with early-stage breast carcinoma remains undefined. We present updated results of a prospective protocol of concurrent cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil (CMF) and reduced-dose radiotherapy, focusing on tumor control and patient tolerance. METHODS: One hundred twelve women with AJCC Stage I or Stage II breast carcinoma with 0-3 positive axillary lymph nodes were enrolled in a prospective single-arm study of concurrent CMF and reduced-dose radiotherapy (39.6 gray [Gy] to the whole breast, 16-Gy boost). A high proportion of women had risk factors associated with an increased risk of local disease recurrence, including age <40 (32%), close or positive margins (37%), or lymphatic/vascular invasion (51%). The median follow-up period was 94 months. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 94%. By 60 months, 5 patients (4%) experienced local disease recurrence and 19 patients (17%) experienced distant metastasis. There were no isolated regional lymph node recurrences. Local disease recurrence occurred in 1 of 25 patients (4%), 1 of 16 patients (6%), and 3 of 70 patients (4%) with positive, close (<1 mm), and negative margins, respectively. One patient developed acute myelogenous leukemia. An additional patient developed Grade 2 pneumonitis. Cosmetic results were not recorded uniformly for all patients and therefore could not be reliably analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent CMF and reduced-dose radiotherapy resulted in a low level of late toxicity and excellent local tumor control, despite the large proportion of patients with substantial risk factors for local disease recurrence.

Some patients survive for long periods without requiring definitive therapy, while others die rapidly despite intensive treatment. Because most patients with CLL express CD20 on their malignant cells, the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been incorporated into treatment regimens in efforts to improve outcome. Rituximab monotherapy has limited activity in previously untreated and refractory/relapsed CLL patients with response rates that are generally lower than those seen in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although increased dosing intensity and frequency leads to higher response rates than seen in patients treated with standard dose rituximab, responses are almost always partial remissions and the doses used are not feasible in routine clinical practice. On the other hand, combining rituximab with chemotherapy has proved to be feasible and appears to be synergistic with fludarabine-based chemotherapy in the treatment of CLL on the basis of recent phase II trials. In these studies, response rates (including complete remissions) to rituximab in combination with fludarabine-containing regimens are higher than those reported in similar phase II studies with any other treatment regime. The highest response rates reported are for the combination of rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide. A randomized phase III trial has been initiated to evaluate the addition of rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed CLL. The combination of rituximab with other agents is also being investigated, and these ongoing trials will help define the role of rituximab in CLL.","['Hillmen, Peter']",['Hillmen P'],"['Pinderfields General Hospital, Aberford Road, Wakefield WF1 4DG, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']","['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2004/03/26 05:00,2004/04/10 05:00,['2004/03/26 05:00'],"['2004/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['S0093-7754(03)00644-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2004 Feb;31(1 Suppl 2):22-6.,IM,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall response rate improved from 47% (7% complete response) after initial treatment to 73% (37% complete response) after maintenance treatment; median progression-free survival was 37 months. A similar study in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) also showed some improvement in response rates after maintenance therapy and a median progression-free survival of 19 months.

Single-stranded DNA 20-mers complementary to the target DNA were used to construct the DNA biosensors. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) provirus DNA was used as target DNA. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) investigation of ssDNA/Ppy before and after incubation in target DNA-containing sample revealed significant changes in terms of an imaginary (Z"") vs. a real (Z') component. The PAD results were in good agreement with EIS investigations. The PAD method was selected, because it does not require such sophisticated equipment as it is used to perform EIS and the results obtained can be more easily estimated. Optimum conditions for performing PAD and evaluating an analytical signal were elaborated.

Between 1989 and 2001, 267 consecutive MM patients underwent APHSCT. We set out to determine the correlation between A-ALC and ALC-15 and the utility of A-ALC as a marker for ALC-15 recovery. A-ALC was found to be both a strong predictor for area under curve (AUC=0.93; P=0.0001) and strongly correlated with (r(s)=0.83; P=0.0001) ALC-15 recovery. Higher infused A-ALC was significantly correlated with an ALC-15>/=500/microl.

These translocations can form leukemia-specific chimeric fusion proteins or they can deregulate expression of an (onco)gene, resulting in aberrant expression or overexpression. Detection of chromosome aberrations is an important tool for risk classification. We developed rapid and sensitive split-signal fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assays for six of the most frequent chromosome aberrations in precursor-B-ALL and T-ALL. The split-signal FISH approach uses two differentially labeled probes, located in one gene at opposite sites of the breakpoint region. Probe sets were developed for the genes TCF3 (E2A) at 19p13, MLL at 11q23, ETV6 at 12p13, BCR at 22q11, SIL-TAL1 at 1q32 and TLX3 (HOX11L2) at 5q35. In normal karyotypes, two colocalized green/red signals are visible, but a translocation results in a split of one of the colocalized signals. Split-signal FISH has three main advantages over the classical fusion-signal FISH approach, which uses two labeled probes located in two genes. First, the detection of a chromosome aberration is independent of the involved partner gene. Second, split-signal FISH allows the identification of the partner gene or chromosome region if metaphase spreads are present, and finally it reduces false-positivity.","['van der Burg, M', 'Poulsen, T S', 'Hunger, S P', 'Beverloo, H B', 'Smit, E M E', 'Vang-Nielsen, K', 'Langerak, A W', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['van der Burg M', 'Poulsen TS', 'Hunger SP', 'Beverloo HB', 'Smit EM', 'Vang-Nielsen K', 'Langerak AW', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RanGTP-binding protein 17)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TFPT protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ran GTP-Binding Protein)']","['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'ran GTP-Binding Protein/genetics']",2004/03/26 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/26 05:00'],"['2004/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403340 [doi]', '2403340 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 May;18(5):895-908. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403340.,IM,,,,,,,,162,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the effects of ACA on various myeloid leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. We further examined the molecular mechanisms of ACA-induced apoptosis in myeloid leukemic cells. RESULTS: Low-dose ACA dramatically inhibited cellular growth of leukemic cells by inducing apoptosis. Because NB4 promyelocytic leukemic cells were most sensitive to ACA, we used NB4 cells for further analyses. Production of reactive oxygen species triggered ACA-induced apoptosis. ACA-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells was in association with the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) and activation of caspase-9, suggesting that ACA-induced death signaling is mediated through a mitochondrial oxygen stress pathway. In addition, ACA activated Fas-mediated apoptosis by inducing of casapse-8 activity. Pretreatment with the thiol antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) did not inhibit caspase-8 activation, and the antagonistic anti-Fas antibody ZB4 did not block generation of reactive oxygen species, indicating that both pathways were involved independently in ACA-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ACA had a survival advantage in vivo in a nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice leukemia model without any toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ACA induces apoptosis in myeloid leukemic cells via independent dual pathways. In addition, ACA has potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of myeloid leukemia.","['Ito, Keisuke', 'Nakazato, Tomonori', 'Murakami, Akira', 'Yamato, Kenji', 'Miyakawa, Yoshitaka', 'Yamada, Taketo', 'Hozumi, Nobumichi', 'Ohigashi, Hajime', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Ito K', 'Nakazato T', 'Murakami A', 'Yamato K', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Yamada T', 'Hozumi N', 'Ohigashi H', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kizaki M']","['Departments of Internal Medicine and Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzyl Alcohols)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', ""SQV3080A20 (1'-acetoxychavicol acetate)""]","['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzyl Alcohols', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/pathology', 'Phytotherapy', 'Terpenes/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/drug effects/*physiology']",2004/03/26 05:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/03/26 05:00'],"['2004/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-1142-03 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Mar 15;10(6):2120-30. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-1142-03.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of MAIDS-related lymphoma/cytopenia is unknown but it has been postulated to involve a defective marrow microenvironment or stroma. The basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) of stromal origin is an important stimulator for hematopoietic progenitors of several lineages. Long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs) were established and pure stromal cell cultures were used for in vitro infection hematopoietic reconstitution studies. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze bFGF gene expression in stromal cells derived from either viral-infected marrow or uninfected marrow. RT-PCR analysis showed a 40% reduction in the expression of bFGF transcript expression from viral-infected stromal cells, however, the levels of bek and flg bFGF receptors remained unchanged indicating virus-infection only inhibited bFGF gene expression in stromal cells. Viral infection was associated with a progressive decrease in bFGF transcript expression 35% of control at day 7, 50% of control at day 14 and 60% of control at day 21 compared to the mock-infected cultures. In addition, for bek and flg the transcript expression in, in vitro-infected primary cultures were comparable to the mock-infected cultures and remained essentially unchanged throughout culture period. Western blot analysis revealed viral-infected stromal cells produced a 45% decrease in bFGF protein production. Reduction of bFGF protein was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescent staining. We report MuLV infection reduces bFGF transcript expression but not its surface-receptors (bek and flg) in infected stromal cells. Impaired hematopoiesis consistently exhibited from MuLV-infected stromal cultures was restored by exogenous bFGF; therefore, bFGF was responsible in restoration of normal marrow stromal support function. These results suggest a role for bFGF deficiency in the pathogenesis of MAIDS-related marrow failure.","['Tse, Kam-Fai', 'Inayat, Mohammed S', 'Morrow, Jennifer K', 'DellaPuca, Richard', 'Hughes, Nedda K', 'Gallicchio, Vincent S']","['Tse KF', 'Inayat MS', 'Morrow JK', 'DellaPuca R', 'Hughes NK', 'Gallicchio VS']","['Hematology/Oncology Division, Laboratory of Experimental Immunohematopoiesis and Developmental Therapeutics, Department of Internal Medicine,University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536-0084, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (FLG protein, human)', '0 (Filaggrin Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Fgfr2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2)']","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*virology', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/analysis/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Filaggrin Proteins', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/virology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/*virology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/03/26 05:00,2004/08/21 05:00,['2004/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.virusres.2004.01.007 [doi]', 'S016817020400022X [pii]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2004 May;101(2):175-84. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2004.01.007.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation can irreversibly affect spermatogenesis, sperm cryopreservation is an important option for storing male reproductive potential. In this report, we review our database of 10 years of experience with cryostorage for male cancer patients. We assess types of cancer, timing of collection, sperm quality, and utilization for reproductive purposes. We also report specimen disposal and rates of patient death. There were a total of 164 oncology patients electing to freeze sperm at our institution during the study period. Types of cancer were varied, with testicular cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, and gastrointestinal cancers comprising the largest groups. Evaluation of semen parameters for these groups revealed that oligospermia, even prior to initiation of cancer therapy, was common. Sperm counts, motility, and morphology did not differ by type of cancer. Interestingly, less than 5% of patients utilized their specimens for reproductive purposes. Seven insemination cycles yielded no pregnancies, while one of two IVF attempts and the single ICSI case were successful. In conclusion, the epidemiological review of our database suggests that sperm cryostorage for fertility preservation in male cancer patients is under-utilized. Additionally, there is minimal use of cryopreserved specimens for reproductive purposes. We speculate that this under-utilization may be due to the paucity of reports regarding reproductive outcome after freezing. It is our objective to provide a compilation of data that will prove useful to both physicians and patients who are considering sperm cryopreservation.","['Chung, Karine', 'Irani, Jennifer', 'Knee, Gerald', 'Efymow, Brenda', 'Blasco, Louis', 'Patrizio, Pasquale']","['Chung K', 'Irani J', 'Knee G', 'Efymow B', 'Blasco L', 'Patrizio P']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 3701 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",0375672,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Cryopreservation', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Oligospermia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Pennsylvania/epidemiology', 'Semen Preservation/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Spermatozoa/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy']",2004/03/26 05:00,2004/09/01 05:00,['2004/03/26 05:00'],"['2004/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ejogrb.2003.11.024 [doi]', 'S0301211503005852 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2004 Apr 5;113 Suppl 1:S7-11. doi: 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2003.11.024.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B cells of some B-CLL patients are resistant to the anti-proliferative effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Herein, we identified two mutations within the putative signal sequence of TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaR-I) gene of TGF-beta-resistant B-CLL patients (i.e., a Leu12Gln substitution together with an in-frame single Ala deletion). Although TbetaR-I mutants were expressed to the cell surface and interacted normally with TGF-beta-bound TbetaR-II, their expression significantly reduced gene transcription stimulated by TGF-beta, suggesting a causal relationship in the development of TGF-beta-resistant B-CLL. Screening of additional B-CLL patients solely for the presence of TbetaR-I signal sequence mutations showed that these mutations correlated with and predicted for B-CLL patient insensitivity to TGF-beta. Our results demonstrate that TGF-beta-resistant B-CLL is linked to signal sequence mutations within the TbetaR-I gene, and may eventually be employed as a prognostic indicator in B-CLL.","['Schiemann, William P', 'Rotzer, Diana', 'Pfeifer, Waither M', 'Levi, Edi', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Knaus, Petra', 'Kadin, Marshall E']","['Schiemann WP', 'Rotzer D', 'Pfeifer WM', 'Levi E', 'Rai KR', 'Knaus P', 'Kadin ME']","['Department of Pediatrics, Program in Cell Biology, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Goodman Building, K1011, 1400 Jackson Street, Denver, CO 80206, USA. schiemannwp@njc.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,"['0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']","['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Sorting Signals', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2004/03/26 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cdp.2003.11.001 [doi]', 'S0361090X03002034 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 2004;28(1):57-64. doi: 10.1016/j.cdp.2003.11.001.,IM,,,,,['CA73161-0/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The isolates were retrospectively studied for drug resistance. The first resistant isolate associated with clinical failure of antiviral therapy emerged 44 days post-ACV treatment initiation. Susceptibility testing revealed an ACV-resistant HSV strain that demonstrated cross resistance to PFA in the absence of any previous PFA treatment. The observed cross resistance was conferred by a single amino acid substitution, Ser724Asn, in the HSV DNA polymerase (DNA pol) gene. During the subsequent course of ACV therapy, the ACV/PFA-cross-resistant isolates were replaced by ACV-resistant, PFA-sensitive isolates. These isolates carried no DNA pol mutations, but had an Arg163His substitution in the thymidine kinase gene. Upon subsequent switching of antiviral therapy from ACV to PFA, the original ACV/PFA-cross-resistant DNA pol mutant re-appeared. Our study shows the emergence of different drug-resistant HSV variants during ongoing, unchanged ACV therapy. Furthermore, a rapid re-selection of the original resistant variant was observed after switch. For optimal antiviral management of HSV infections in HSCT recipients, therapeutic decisions should be guided by drug susceptibility results whenever therapeutic failure is observed and/or when changes in antiviral treatment are considered.","['Stranska, Ruzena', 'van Loon, Anton M', 'Bredius, Robbert G M', 'Polman, Merjo', 'Nienhuis, Elske', 'Beersma, Matthias F C', 'Lankester, Arjan C', 'Schuurman, Rob']","['Stranska R', 'van Loon AM', 'Bredius RG', 'Polman M', 'Nienhuis E', 'Beersma MF', 'Lankester AC', 'Schuurman R']","['Department of Virology, Eijkman-Winkler Center, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands. r.stranska@lab.azu.nl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Antivir Ther,Antiviral therapy,9815705,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']","['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Child', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Herpes Simplex/*immunology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*drug effects/enzymology/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*immunology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Mouth/virology', 'Nose/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Sputum/virology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism']",2004/03/26 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2004/03/26 05:00'],"['2004/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Antivir Ther. 2004 Feb;9(1):97-104.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To develop clinically relevant beta-globin antisense agents we created nine stable mouse erythroleukemia cell lines expressing unique anti-beta-globin RNA transcripts with different potentials for cross-hybridization with gamma-globin mRNA. We observed variable inhibition of beta-globin expression independent of the hybridization potential of the respective antisense beta-globin RNA transcript. Similarly, inhibition of gamma-globin expression by anti-beta transcripts varied widely in the nine stable cell lines. Three neighboring regions in the beta-globin gene with low RNA folding potentials conferred significantly stronger antisense effect toward beta-globin while sparing the homologous targets in gamma-globin. We have identified for the first time targets in the beta-globin gene for which the homologous regions in gamma-globin are relatively inaccessible to antisense attack.

This group of 17 pts consisted of 9 small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL) and 8 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of clonal immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) rearrangement using the complementarity determining region III (CDRIII) constantly retrieved two distinct bands in all PCR informative samples of those pts. To rule out biclonality, we evaluated samples by fluorescein activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and sequenced the PCR products. We were able to obtain both IgH sequences from 12 patients. FACS suggested biclonality in one case, which also correlated with sequencing results as both IgH rearrangements were in-frame. Recently, we reported a patient who sustained transformation into an aggressive disease after biIgH was detected in the setting of monoclonal disease (Cerny et al., 2003b, Haematologica 88(05):ECR15 B.). We decided to compare clinical characteristics and prognosis of 17 pts with biIgH and 37 pts with monoIgH rearrangements. Although we found some minor differences in disease characteristics between both groups, these did not translate into a significantly different overall survival.

Twenty paraffin-embedded bone marrow core biopsy specimens from newly diagnosed patients with MPD were evaluated -- osteomyelofibrosis (OMF), n = 9 and chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML), n = 11. We demonstrate increased SGTP and MT expression in the bone marrow of MPD patients. In our study levels of MT in OMF patients were higher than in CML. This suggests that MT expression may correlate with bone marrow fibrosis. These data, although based on a relatively small number of patients, raise the possibility that SGTP and MT may play a role in the pathogenesis of MPD.

It has generally been resistant to alkylating chemotherapy, but some effect has been observed with the purine analog 2-deoxycoformicin with documented partial or complete response rates in up to 45% of patients. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies against CD 52 has been shown to be highly effective in T-PLL with response rates of up to 76%. This may allow for further consolidating treatment with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients treated at Rikshospitalet University Hospital are evaluated and the literature on T-PLL is reviewed. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Four of our patients were treated with alemtuzumab. Three showed complete or partial response. One patient underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation with an HLA-identical sibling, but died on day 21 as a result of transplantation complications. The treatment is generally well tolerated; the principal management problem is immunosuppression, as shown in one patient who developed a varicella-zoster meningoencephalomyelitis as a consequence of not receiving antiviral prophylaxis.

MATERIAL/METHODS: The kinetics of daunorubicin binding with erythrocytes was studied in blood and in washed erythrocyte suspensions from healthy donors and patients with acute leukemia. The effect of daunorubicin on erythrocyte deformability was studied using cell filtration through membranes with 3 microm-diameter cylindrical pores. Erythrocyte-bound daunorubicin (EBD), prepared by equilibrating anticoagulated autologous blood with the antibiotic, was administered (45 or 60 mg/m2 body surface) to 14 leukemic patients as part of the 7+ 3 or RACOP courses. The pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and its tolerability were studied. RESULTS: Human erythrocytes bound daunorubicin (rubomycin) in citrated whole blood or in washed saline suspension. The equilibrium erythrocyte/medium daunorubicin concentration ratios (attained in 30-60 min at 37 degrees C) averaged 2.9 +/- 0.5 (n=13) in blood and 5.7 +/- 0.6 (n=8) in suspension (p<0.001), without any significant difference between the erythrocytes of donors and patients with acute drug-resistant leukemia or leukemic relapses. Incubation of patient blood with daunorubicin (0.5 mg/ml cells) did not affect erythrocyte deformability (filterability). After intravenous administration, the peak drug concentration and its elimination rate were lower for EBD than for free daunorubicin. The patients tolerated EBD better than its standard free form. In nine patients who received three EBD infusions, side effects were less frequent than in those treated with free daunorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that daunorubicin-loaded erythrocytes are promising for clinical application and deserve further clinical study.","['Skorokhod, Oleksli A', ""Garmaeva, Tat'yana Ts"", 'Vitvitsky, Victor M', 'Isaev, Valentin G', 'Parovichnikova, Elena N', 'Savchenko, Valerii G', 'Ataullakhanov, Fazoil I']","['Skorokhod OA', 'Garmaeva TTs', 'Vitvitsky VM', 'Isaev VG', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Savchenko VG', 'Ataullakhanov FI']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']","['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Erythrocyte Deformability/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2004/03/25 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/03/25 05:00'],"['2003/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['4158 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2004 Apr;10(4):PI55-64.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Host enzymes termed ADARs (adenosine deaminases that act on double-stranded RNA) are required for LDAg production. These enzymes change the stop codon (UAG) of SDAg to a tryptophan codon (UGG). However, the temporal and spatial regulation of HDV RNA editing is largely unknown. In this study, we constructed three GFP fusion proteins containing different lengths of SDAg and characterized their cellular localization and effects on HDV replication. One of these fusion proteins, designated D(1-88)-GFP, inhibited LDAg but not SDAg production, suggesting that D(1-88)-GFP inhibits HDV RNA editing. Two experiments further supported this supposition: (i). RT-PCR analysis combined with NcoI restriction enzyme digestion revealed that HDV RNA editing was reduced by 42% in HeLa-D(1-88)-GFP when compared with HeLa cells; and (ii). the ratio of SDAg/LDAg production from the reporter RNAs was reduced in cells co-transfected with ADAR-expressing and reporter plasmids in the presence of D(1-88)-GFP. Double fluorescence microscopy found that D(1-88)-GFP was either associated with SC-35 or was adjacent to PML (premyelocytic leukaemia antigen) at nuclear speckles, but D(1-88)-GFP was not co-localized with ADAR, which was mainly located in the nucleolus. In situ hybridization showing co-localization of HDV RNA with D(1-88)-GFP at nuclear speckles suggested that HDV RNA editing might occur in the nuclear speckles and require other nuclear factor(s), in addition to ADAR.","['Shih, Ko-Nien', 'Chuang, Ya-Ting', 'Liu, Hsuan', 'Lo, Szecheng J']","['Shih KN', 'Chuang YT', 'Liu H', 'Lo SJ']","['Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan 112.', 'Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan 112.', 'Department of Life Science, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan 112.', 'Department of Life Science, School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, TaoYun, Taiwan 333.', 'Department of Life Science, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan 112.', 'Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan 112.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Hepatitis delta Antigens)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']","['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/virology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hepatitis Delta Virus/*genetics/*physiology', 'Hepatitis delta Antigens/*genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', '*RNA Editing', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection']",2004/03/25 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/03/25 05:00'],"['2004/03/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.19661-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2004 Apr;85(Pt 4):947-957. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.19661-0.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.19661-0 [doi],,,,

Coexposure of K562 or LAMA84 cells to subtoxic concentration of flavopiridol (150-200 nM) and bortezomib (5-8 nM) resulted in a synergistic increase in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. These events were associated with a marked diminution in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)/DNA binding activity; enhanced phosphorylation of SEK1/MKK4 (stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase 1/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); down-regulation of Bcr/Abl; and a marked reduction in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT5 activity. In imatinib mesylate-resistant K562 cells displaying increased Bcr/Abl expression, bortezomib/flavopiridol treatment markedly increased apoptosis in association with down-regulation of Bcr/Abl and BclxL, and diminished phosphorylation of Lyn, Hck, CrkL, and Akt. Parallel studies were performed in imatinib mesylate-resistant LAMA84 cells exhibiting reduced expression of Bcr/Abl but a marked increase in expression/activation of Lyn and Hck. Flavopiridol/bortezomib effectively induced apoptosis in these cells in association with Lyn and Hck inactivation. The capacity of flavopiridol to promote bortezomib-mediated Bcr/Abl down-regulation and apoptosis was mimicked by the positive transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb) inhibitor DRB (5,6-dichloro 1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzinida-sole). Finally, the bortezomib/flavopiridol regimen also potently induced apoptosis in Bcr/Abl(-) human leukemia cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that a strategy combining flavopiridol and bortezomib warrants further examination in chronic myelogenous leukemia and related hematologic malignancies.","['Dai, Yun', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Pei, Xin-Yan', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Rahmani M', 'Pei XY', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, MCV Station Box 230, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (CTDSP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2004/03/25 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/03/25 05:00'],"['2004/03/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4121 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55148-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jul 15;104(2):509-18. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4121.

The 2 ploidy groups presented a striking similarity of their cytogenetic profiles: chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 7, 13, 15, 16, and 17, significantly monosomic in hypodiploidy 30 to 39, were also frequently disomic in near-triploidy, whereas those retained in pairs in hypodiploidy 30 to 39 were frequently tetrasomic in near-triploidy. DNA content data revealed the simultaneous presence of 2 aneuploid peaks in most tested cases (DNA indexes: 0.72-0.87/1.39-1.89) and a multiple correspondence analysis applied on cytogenetic profiles ascertained their strong relationship. We thus assumed that near-triploidy derives from the duplication of hypodiploidy with 30 to 39 chromosomes and that both aneuploid groups are 2 expressions of the same disease. These 24 patients presented with B-cell phenotype, low leukocytoses (median white blood cell count, 4.2 x 10(9)/L), and poor prognosis (complete remission, 57%; median disease-free-survival, 8 months; median survival, 10.4 months) comparable to that of Ph(+) patients treated according to the same protocol. We suggest that hypodiploidy with 30 to 39 chromosomes or near-triploidy should be regarded as a new high-risk factor in the risk stratification of adult ALL protocols.","['Charrin, Christiane', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Ffrench, Martine', 'Le, Quoc-Hung', 'Andrieux, Joris', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Lai, Jean-Luc', 'Bilhou-Nabera, Chrystele', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Bernheim, Alain', 'Bastard, Christian', 'Mossafa, Hossein', 'Perot, Christine', 'Maarek, Odile', 'Boucheix, Claude', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Delannoy, Andre', 'Fiere, Denis', 'Dastugue, Nicole']","['Charrin C', 'Thomas X', 'Ffrench M', 'Le QH', 'Andrieux J', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Lai JL', 'Bilhou-Nabera C', 'Michaux L', 'Bernheim A', 'Bastard C', 'Mossafa H', 'Perot C', 'Maarek O', 'Boucheix C', 'Lheritier V', 'Delannoy A', 'Fiere D', 'Dastugue N']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie et de Cytogenetique, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Place d'Arsonval, 69437 Lyon Cedex 03, France. christiane.charrin@chu-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', '*Diploidy', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyploidy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/25 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/03/25 05:00'],"['2004/03/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-04-1299 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43307-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 15;104(8):2444-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-04-1299.

Here we show that this G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is also aberrantly expressed in a high percentage of human acute myeloid leukemias. We investigated the mechanism of transformation by Cb2 and demonstrate that aberrant expression of this receptor on hematopoietic precursor cells results in distinct effects depending on the ligand used. Cb2-expressing myeloid precursors migrate upon stimulation by the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol and are blocked in neutrophilic differentiation upon exposure to another ligand, CP55940. Both effects depend on the activation of G(alphai) proteins and require the mitogen-induced extracellular kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway. Down-regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels upon G(alphai) activation is important for migration induction but is irrelevant for the maturation arrest. Moreover, the highly conserved G protein-interacting DRY motif, present in the second intracellular loop of GPCRs, is critical for migration but unimportant for the differentiation block. This suggests that the Cb2-mediated differentiation block requires interaction of G(alphai) proteins with other currently unknown motifs. This indicates a unique mechanism by which a transforming GPCR, in a ligand-dependent manner, causes 2 distinct oncogenic effects: altered migration and block of neutrophilic development.","['Alberich Jorda, Meritxell', 'Rayman, Nazik', 'Tas, Marjolein', 'Verbakel, Sandra E', 'Battista, Natalia', 'van Lom, Kirsten', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Maccarrone, Mauro', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Alberich Jorda M', 'Rayman N', 'Tas M', 'Verbakel SE', 'Battista N', 'van Lom K', 'Lowenberg B', 'Maccarrone M', 'Delwel R']","['Erasmus MC, Department of Hematology, Dr Molewaterplein 50, 3015GE Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Cyclohexanols)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '83003-12-7', '(3-(2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl)-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)']","['Acute Disease', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclohexanols/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Glycerides/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Ligands', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism']",2004/03/25 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/03/25 05:00'],"['2004/03/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4357 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55150-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jul 15;104(2):526-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4357.

We previously demonstrated that an allosterically controllable ribozyme, maxizyme (Mz), can induce apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. Ph(+) ALL cells harbor a bcrabl fusion gene (e1a2) encoding a 190-kDa fusion protein (p190) involved in disease pathogenesis. In this study, we have designed a Mz that specifically cleaves e1a2 mRNA and transduced this e1a2Mz into Ph(+) ALL cells using a third-generation lentiviral vector system. In 3 of 5 Ph(+) ALL cell lines, e1a2Mz transduction resulted in a significant decrease in viability and increased cell apoptosis. We observed a decrease in e1a2 mRNA in all Ph(+) ALL cells transduced with e1a2Mz, and the e1a2 mRNA level was higher in e1a2Mz-resistant cells than in e1a2Mz-sensitive cells. All samples of primary Ph(+) ALL cells tested showed e1a2Mz-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Importantly, e1a2Mz did not influence the colony formation of normal CD34(+) cord blood cells. These results indicate that e1a2Mz kills Ph(+) ALL cells specifically, suggesting that it may be used as a novel gene therapy strategy for Ph(+) ALL.","['Soda, Yasushi', 'Tani, Kenzaburo', 'Bai, Yuansong', 'Saiki, Minoru', 'Chen, Minghan', 'Izawa, Kiyoko', 'Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Kuwabara, Tomoko', 'Warashina, Masaaki', 'Tanabe, Tsuyoshi', 'Miyoshi, Hiroyuki', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Nakazawa, Shinpei', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Taira, Kazunari', 'Asano, Shigetaka']","['Soda Y', 'Tani K', 'Bai Y', 'Saiki M', 'Chen M', 'Izawa K', 'Kobayashi S', 'Takahashi S', 'Uchimaru K', 'Kuwabara T', 'Warashina M', 'Tanabe T', 'Miyoshi H', 'Sugita K', 'Nakazawa S', 'Tojo A', 'Taira K', 'Asano S']","['Department of Advanced Molecular and Cell Therapy, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka-shi 812-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Catalytic)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Apoptosis', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'RNA, Catalytic/chemistry/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods']",2004/03/25 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/03/25 05:00'],"['2004/03/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-06-1948 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55128-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jul 15;104(2):356-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-06-1948.

Oncogenic p21(ras) decreases surface Fas antigen expression and renders fibroblasts resistant to Fas mediated apoptosis. Neurofibromin, which is encoded by NF1, is a GTPase activating protein that negatively regulates p21(ras) activity. NF1 loss leads to deregulation of p21(ras)-effector pathways, which control myeloid cell survival. Heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 increases mast cell numbers in Nf1 +/- mice, and enhances mast cell survival in response to c-kit ligand (kit-L). Here, we show that Nf1-deficient mast cells have reduced surface Fas antigen expression in response to kit-L and are resistant to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis. Using genetic intercrosses between Nf1 +/- and class I (A)-PI-3K-deficient mice, we demonstrate that hyperactivation of the p21(ras)-class I(A) PI-3K pathway is the mechanism for this phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that mast cells from both Fas antigen-deficient mice and Nf1 +/- mice are resistant to apoptosis following kit-L withdrawal in vivo.

The degree of degradation of the fusion protein was even more pronounced when a single-chain form of the MLV protease was cloned after the gene coding for MBP.

We model the interaction between naive T cells, effector T cells, and CML cancer cells in the body, using a system of ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change of the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system.

However, animal studies generally have not demonstrated a high radiosensitivity of fetuses, and the underlying causes for the discrepancy remain unidentified. We examined atomic bomb survivors exposed in utero for translocation frequencies in blood lymphocytes at 40 years of age. Contrary to our expectation of a greater radiosensitivity in fetuses than in adults, the frequency did not increase with dose except for a small increase (less than 1%) at doses below 0.1 Sv, which was statistically significant. We interpret the results as indicating that fetal lymphoid precursor cells comprise two subpopulations.

However, the role of PPARgamma signals in other types of cancer cells (e.g., leukemia) except solid cancer cells is still unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of 15dPGJ2 to modify the proliferation of the human leukemia cell line THP-1. 15dPGJ2 at 5 microM stimulated the proliferation in THP-1 at 24 to 72 h after incubation. In contrast, 15dPGJ2 at concentrations above 10 microM inhibited the proliferation through the induction of apoptosis. PGD2, PGJ2, and Delta12-PGJ2 (DeltaPGJ2), precursors of 15dPGJ2, had similar proliferative effects at lower concentrations, whereas they induced apoptosis at high concentrations. 15dPGJ2 and three precursors failed to induce the differentiation in THP-1 as assessed by using the differentiation marker CD11b. FACScan analysis revealed that PGD2 at 5 microM, PGJ2 at 1 microM, DeltaPGJ2 at 1 microM and 15dPGJ2 at 5 microM all accelerated cell cycle progression in THP-1. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that PGD2 at 5 microM and 15dPGJ2 at 5 microM inhibited the expression of phospho-p38, phospho-MKK3/MKK6, and phospho-ATF-2, and the expression of Cdk inhibitors including p18, p21, and p27 in THP-1. In contrast, PGJ2 at 1 microM and DeltaPGJ2 at 1 microM did not affect their expressions. These results suggest that 15dPGJ2 and PGD2 may, through inactivation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, inhibit the expression of Cdk inhibitors, leading to acceleration of the THP-1 proliferation.","['Azuma, Yasutaka', 'Watanabe, Kyoko', 'Date, Masataka', 'Daito, Michiharu', 'Ohura, Kiyoshi']","['Azuma Y', 'Watanabe K', 'Date M', 'Daito M', 'Ohura K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Osaka Dental University, Japan. aazuma@cc.osaka-dent.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Pharmacol Sci,Journal of pharmacological sciences,101167001,"['0 (1-keto-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene)', '0 (15-deoxyprostaglandin J2)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Hydantoins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Pyridines)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '75693-75-3 (BW 245C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']","['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD11 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'CD11b Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromones/administration & dosage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydantoins/administration & dosage', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Morpholines/administration & dosage', 'Phenanthrenes/*metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/*physiology']",2004/03/24 05:00,2005/03/16 09:00,['2004/03/24 05:00'],"['2004/03/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1254/jphs.94.261 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharmacol Sci. 2004 Mar;94(3):261-70. doi: 10.1254/jphs.94.261.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the cytokines, proto-oncogenes, and other transiently expressed gene products are encoded by mRNAs that contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). In this article, we describe an approach to selectively synthesize ARE-containing cDNA (ARE-cDNA) using an innovative combination of culture treatment, thermostabilization of reverse transcriptase (RT) by the disaccharide trehalose, and use of optimized ARE-specific oligomers. The monocytic cell line, THP-1, was treated with cycloheximide and endotoxin to enrich for ARE-mediated gene expression followed by the RT procedure. Selection of ARE-cDNA with simultaneous suppression of abundant cDNA was made possible using the procedure as monitored by the preferential expression of IL-8, an ARE-cDNA molecule, over the abundant housekeeping cDNA, beta-actin. The use of trehalose dramatically reversed cDNA abundance, resulting in almost complete suppression of housekeeping cDNA. Finally, construction of specialized ARE-cDNA libraries confirmed the selectivity of ARE-cDNAs and the presence of rare genes. The ability to reverse the abundance of housekeeping and other highly expressed genes toward ARE genes facilitates the discovery and study of rare early response and transiently expressed genes.","['Khabar, Khalid S A', 'Dhalla, Mohammed', 'Al-Haj, Latifa', 'Bakheet, Tala', 'Sy, Cheikh', 'Naemmuddin, Mohammed']","['Khabar KS', 'Dhalla M', 'Al-Haj L', 'Bakheet T', 'Sy C', 'Naemmuddin

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 7,452 transplantation patients described as being either in a multiple graft program (""planned"") or not, were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Subsequent multivariate analyses concentrated on the real occurrence of second transplantation, survival, relapse, and transplant-related mortality. RESULTS: Although the transplantation rate in the planned group failed to reach 60%, the median survival from transplantation is 60 months for the planned, compared with 51 months for the remainder group. While the hazard ratio of the planned group is 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.00; P =.05) before approximately 70 months, this ""effect"" is reversed after 70 months, with the hazard ratio estimated as 3.01 (95% CI, 1.07 to 8.46; P =.04). A time-dependent multivariate Cox analysis shows that, taking patients without a second transplantation as a reference group, those receiving a second transplantation in first remission (ie, before relapse) show an increased probability of transplant-related mortality, especially if the transplantation is performed more than 12 months after the first, and the reduction of the risk of relapse is less than when the transplantation is performed earlier. Performing a second transplantation after relapse does not seem to prolong survival, though a second transplantation before relapse is associated with a higher probability of mortality. CONCLUSION: To improve survival of tandem autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma, the second transplantation should preferably be performed before relapse and within 6 to 12 months of the first transplantation.","['Morris, C', 'Iacobelli, S', 'Brand, R', 'Bjorkstrand, B', 'Drake, M', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Gahrton, G']","['Morris C', 'Iacobelli S', 'Brand R', 'Bjorkstrand B', 'Drake M', 'Niederwieser D', 'Gahrton G']","['Haematology Department, Belfast City Hospital, Northern Ireland. curly.morris@bll.n-i.nhs.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/24 05:00,2004/05/28 05:00,['2004/03/24 05:00'],"['2004/03/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.06.144 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.06.144 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 May 1;22(9):1674-81. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.06.144.

Previous reports suggest an increased risk for perioperative complications in these immunodeficient patients. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with any type of hematologic malignancy who underwent open-heart surgery at our institution between 7/1996 and 6/2002 were identified. Their hospital charts were reviewed; demographics, perioperative data and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: There were 24 patients (20 men, 4 women); mean age was 68+/-13 years (range 31-84 years). Ten patients had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, seven non-Hodgkin lymphomas, three multiple myeloma and one Hodgkin's disease, chronic myelocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma each. The mean pre-operative duration of the hematologic disease was 6.6 years. Twenty-two patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (with valve replacement in three patients) and two patients had isolated valve replacement. There was one in-hospital death (4.1%). Twelve patients (50%) had a minor or major complication. Seven reoperations were required-five during the same admission (one for mediastinal bleeding, one for an expanding femoral pseudoaneurysm, one for acute cholecystitis and two for IACD/pacer insertion) and two within 30 days (one for deep sternal wound infection and one for leg wound infection). Mean post-operative stay was 8.2+/-5.8 days and mean ICU stay was 1.6+/-1.1 days. There were three late deaths-two were due to progression of the hematologic disease. The 3-year actuarial survival was 83%. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac operations can be performed with acceptable mortality but significant morbidity rates in patients with hematologic malignancies. Bleeding and infectious complications are most frequently seen and usually lead to reoperations. These findings warrant caution during patient selection.","['Fecher, Alison M', 'Birdas, Thomas J', 'Haybron, David', 'Papasavas, Pavlos K', 'Evers, Debbie', 'Caushaj, Philip F']","['Fecher AM', 'Birdas TJ', 'Haybron D', 'Papasavas PK', 'Evers D', 'Caushaj PF']","['Department of Surgery, Temple University School of Medicine Clinical Campus at the Western Pennsylvania Hospital, 4800 Friendship Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, USA. afecher@wpahs.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,8804069,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Loss, Surgical', 'Coronary Artery Bypass/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation/*adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Reoperation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surgical Wound Infection', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/03/24 05:00,2004/04/30 05:00,['2004/03/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2003/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ejcts.2003.12.006 [doi]', 'S101079400300784X [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2004 Apr;25(4):537-40. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcts.2003.12.006.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altered membrane transport is also a mechanism of drug resistance. In order to facilitate ara-C uptake and prolong retention in the cell, lipophilic prodrugs were synthesized. Fatty acid groups with a varying acyl chain length and number of double bonds were esterified at the 5' position on the sugar moiety of ara-C. The compounds were tested in two pairs of ara-C resistant leukemic cell lines (murine L1210 and rat BCLO and their resistant variants L4A6 and Bara-C, respectively) and two pairs of cell lines with a resistance to gemcitabine, another deoxycytidine analog (human ovarian cancer A2780 and murine colon cancer C26-A and their resistant variants AG6000 and C26-G, respectively). L4A6, Bara-C and AG6000 have varying degrees of decreased dCK activity, while the mechanism for C26-G is not yet clear. In the parent cell lines, ara-C was more active, but in the resistant variants several of the analogs were more active, while the degree of cross-resistance varied. In AG6000 with a total dCK deficiency, all compounds were inactive. Structure-activity relation analysis showed that ara-C derivatives with shorter acyl chains and more double bonds were more active in the parental and drug resistant cells. Further mechanistic studies were performed with the elaidic acid derivative of ara-C (CP-4055). CP-4055 inhibited deamination of dCyd partly and induced DNA synthesis inhibition effectively in C26-A and C26-G cells, but the retention of inhibition was much longer for CP-4055 than for ara-C. In contrast to ara-C, CP-4055 inhibited RNA synthesis for 60% after drug exposure. In conclusion, CP-4055 seems to be a promising prodrug, whose effects were different and longer lasting than for the parent drug.","['Bergman, A M', 'Kuiper, C M', 'Voorn, D A', 'Comijn, E M', 'Myhren, F', 'Sandvold, M L', 'Hendriks, H R', 'Peters, G J']","['Bergman AM', 'Kuiper CM', 'Voorn DA', 'Comijn EM', 'Myhren F', 'Sandvold ML', 'Hendriks HR', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, PO Box 7057, 1007 MB Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (deoxycytidine deaminase)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fatty Acids/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/metabolism', 'RNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Rats']",2004/03/24 05:00,2004/04/06 05:00,['2004/03/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2003.09.028 [doi]', 'S0006295203007640 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Feb 1;67(3):503-11. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.09.028.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acquired imbalances, particularly loss of 7q, are commonly associated with MDS/AML and a poor prognosis; however, this patient remained in remission after treatment for more than two years before AML relapse, perhaps because the affected regions fall outside of the critical regions of imbalance.","['Ganly, Peter', 'McDonald, Margaret', 'Spearing, Ruth', 'Morris, Christine M']","['Ganly P', 'McDonald M', 'Spearing R', 'Morris CM']","['Cancer Genetics Research Group, Christchurch School of Medicine, PO Box 4345, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",2004/03/24 05:00,2004/04/15 05:00,['2004/03/24 05:00'],"['2003/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2003.07.006 [doi]', 'S0165460803003182 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2004 Mar;149(2):125-30. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2003.07.006.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PG increased the amount of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a characteristic oxidative DNA lesion, in human leukemia cell line HL-60, but not in HP100, which is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-resistant cell line derived from HL-60. Although PG induced no or little damage to 32P-5'-end-labeled DNA fragments obtained from genes that are relevant to human cancer, DNA damage was observed with treatment of esterase. HPLC analysis of the products generated from PG incubated with esterase revealed that PG converted into gallic acid (GA). GA induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Fe(III)EDTA or Cu(II). In the presence of Fe(III) complex such as Fe(III)EDTA or Fe(III)ADP, GA caused DNA damage at every nucleotide. Fe(III) complex-mediated DNA damage by GA was inhibited by free hydroxy radical (*OH) scavengers, catalase and an iron chelating agent. These results suggested that the Fe(III) complex-mediated DNA damage caused by GA is mainly due to *OH generated via the Fenton reaction. In the presence of Cu(II), DNA damage induced by GA occurred at thymine and cytosine. Although *OH scavengers did not prevent the DNA damage, methional inhibited the DNA damage. Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage was inhibited by catalase and a Cu(I) chelator. These results indicated that reactive oxygen species formed by the interaction of Cu(I) and H2O2 participates in the DNA damage. GA increased 8-oxodG content in calf thymus DNA in the presence of Cu(II), Fe(III)EDTA or Fe(III)ADP.

Beyond normal therapeutic doses, the drug is hepatotoxic and genotoxic. All of the harmful effects of acetaminophen have been attributed to the production of its toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Since many of the cytotoxic/genotoxic events triggered by NAPQI are consistent with the actions of topoisomerase II-targeted drugs, the effects of this metabolite on human topoisomerase IIalpha were examined. NAPQI was a strong topoisomerase II poison and increased levels of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage >5-fold at 100 microM. The compound induced scission at a number of DNA sites that were similar to those observed in the presence of the topoisomerase II-targeted anticancer drug etoposide; however, the relative site utilization differed. NAPQI strongly impaired the ability of topoisomerase IIalpha to reseal cleaved DNA molecules, suggesting that inhibition of DNA religation is the primary mechanism underlying cleavage enhancement. In addition to its effects in purified systems, NAPQI appeared to increase levels of DNA scission mediated by human topoisomerase IIalpha in cultured CEM leukemia cells. In contrast, acetaminophen did not significantly affect the DNA cleavage activity of the human enzyme in vitro or in cultured CEM cells. Furthermore, the analgesic did not interfere with the actions of etoposide against the type II enzyme. These results suggest that at least some of the cytotoxic/genotoxic effects caused by acetaminophen overdose may be mediated by the actions of NAPQI as a topoisomerase II poison.","['Bender, Ryan P', 'Lindsey, R Hunter Jr', 'Burden, D Andrew', 'Osheroff, Neil']","['Bender RP', 'Lindsey RH Jr', 'Burden DA', 'Osheroff N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Imines)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'G6S9BN13TI (N-acetyl-4-benzoquinoneimine)']","['Acetaminophen/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry', 'Benzoquinones/*chemistry/metabolism/*poisoning', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/chemistry', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*chemistry/toxicity', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Etoposide/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Imines/*chemistry/metabolism/*poisoning', 'Mutagens/chemistry/metabolism/poisoning', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2004/03/24 05:00,2004/07/22 05:00,['2004/03/24 05:00'],"['2004/03/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi036107r [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2004 Mar 30;43(12):3731-9. doi: 10.1021/bi036107r.,IM,,,,,"['T32 CA009582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 CA09582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM33944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NDGA inhibits the auto-regulated de novo synthesis of c-jun mRNA in TPA-stimulated HL60 cells. Our data also determine that this compound induces proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in human leukemia HL60 cells. To obtain information on the functional role of the AP-1 inhibition by NDGA in apoptosis signaling, the effects of pharmacological inhibition of AP-1 binding on c-myc, p53, and bax protein level were determined. Our results indicate that treatment of cells with NDGA enhances c-myc, p53, and bax protein levels. To rule out the possibility that NDGA will induce apoptosis because of the effects on proteins other than AP-1, we investigated the effect of another AP-1 inhibitor, SP600125, which is specific to Jun-N-terminal kinase. SP600125 decreased not only the phosphorylation level of jun protein but also AP-1/DNA binding activity. Also, apoptosis was observed to be induced by SP600125, concomitant with the increase in c-myc, p53, and bax protein level. In addition, apoptosis induced by both AP-1 inhibitors was accompanied by the activation of a downstream apoptotic cascade such as caspase 9, caspase 3, and poly[ADP-ribose]polymerase (PARP). When the cells were treated with NDGA or SP600125 in the presence of antisense c-myc oligonucleotides, apoptosis was not observed and an increase of c-myc, p53, and bax proteins was not manifested. All these results show that the inhibition of the transcription factor AP-1 action is related with either the drug-induced apoptosis or the drug toxicity of the HL60 cells. The apoptosis induced by AP-1 inhibition may be dependent on c-myc protein levels suggesting that the c-myc protein induces apoptosis at a low level of AP-1 binding activity. Altogether, our findings suggest that the presence of the AP-1 signal acts as a survival factor that determines the outcome of myc-induced proliferation or apoptosis.","['Park, Seyeon', 'Hahm, Eun-Ryeong', 'Lee, Dug-Keun', 'Yang, Chul-Hak']","['Park S', 'Hahm ER', 'Lee DK', 'Yang CH']","['School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Extracts/chemistry', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/03/23 05:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.10768 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2004 Apr 1;91(5):973-86. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10768.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

The patient was a 57-year-old man with a history of stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, status post-6 cycles of combination chemotherapy in 1999, who presented in August 2002 with enlarged lymph nodes, anemia, and marked leukocytosis (50 x 10(9) g/dL) consistent with a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). A bone marrow biopsy showed granulocytic hyperplasia, neutrophilia, and mild eosinophilia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies on cell proliferation were performed with DS19 mouse erythroleukemic cells, PC-3 human prostate cancer cells and Caco-2 human colon cancer cells. Actions on histone deacetylase and the induction of histone acetylation were compared for 4-phenylbutyrate and structurally related molecules. RESULTS: Increasing inhibition of cell proliferation by phenyl alkanoic acids together with a decrease in cells in S phase and an increase in apoptotic cells was observed with increased chain length between four and ten carbons. Introduction of double bonds into the side chain was associated with increased growth inhibition. In contrast, 4-phenylbutyrate was a more potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase and inducer of histone acetylation than the other phenyl alkanoic acids examined. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with the action of 4-phenylbutyrate, actions other than inhibition of histone deacetylase appear to be more important for growth inhibition by longer chain phenyl alkanoic and phenyl alkenoic acids.","['Lea, Michael A', 'Shareef, Asif', 'Sura, Monali', 'desBordes, Charles']","['Lea MA', 'Shareef A', 'Sura M', 'desBordes C']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, NJ 07103, USA. lea@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '7WY7YBI87E (4-phenylbutyric acid)']","['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phenylbutyrates/*pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/07/22 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2003/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0782-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004 Jul;54(1):57-63. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0782-5.

Delaying the scheduled treatment of leukemia until complete resolution of fungal infection may have major implications for prognosis. We report 11 leukemic patients with previous aspergillus (n=10) and candida (n=1) infection who received voriconazole 400 mg/day intravenously or orally for between 44 and 245 days. Nine patients were scheduled for allogeneic stem cell transplant, and two for consolidation therapy for acute leukemia. None of the patients had a relapse of fungal infection, and scheduled treatment was delayed only once. Voriconazole was well tolerated, except in one patient who had abnormal liver tests secondary to hepatic graft-versus-host disease, and one who had visual disturbances. This small but homogeneous series indicates that voriconazole may be useful to prevent fungal relapse during at-risk periods in leukemic patients. Prospective trials are warranted to confirm these encouraging results.","['Cordonnier, C', 'Maury, S', 'Pautas, C', 'Bastie, J N', 'Chehata, S', 'Castaigne, S', 'Kuentz, M', 'Bretagne, S', 'Ribaud, P']","['Cordonnier C', 'Maury S', 'Pautas C', 'Bastie JN', 'Chehata S', 'Castaigne S', 'Kuentz M', 'Bretagne S', 'Ribaud P']","['Hematology Department, Henri Mondor Hospital, Creteil, France. carlcord@club-internet.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Aspergillus/metabolism', 'Candida/metabolism', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology', 'Voriconazole']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704469 [doi]', '1704469 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2004 May;33(9):943-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704469.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disregulation of cell cycle could be a mechanism of progression of leukemic blasts and glucocorticoids (GCs), the main pharmacological agent in the treatment of ALL, could affect cell cycle distribution. In our study we have evaluated cell cycle distribution and the expression of several molecules involved in cell cycle regulation in blasts collected from 32 patients with ALL before and 48 h after treatment with GCs. A significant increase of the percentage of ALL blasts in G(0)/G(1) phase was recorded after treatment with GCs in 22 (69%) out of 32 patients and 18 of these patients were also good responders to GC therapy. In these patients an increase of the expression of at least one of the 4 evaluated CDKIs (p15, p16, p21 and p27) was found in 29 out of 32 patients (90.6%) without any change in CDK2 and 4 expression. All patients expressed detectable levels of Rb-1 phosphorylation at the diagnosis. Twenty (63%) patients showed a decrease, while two patients showed an increase of p110 Rb-1 phosphorylation and no changes were detected in the remaining 10 patients after GC therapy. The univariate analysis showed that the reduction of pRb-1 phosphorylation was significantly higher in B-cell lineage patients and in good responders. In conclusion, this is the first report that evaluate the Rb-1 function as predictor of response in childhood ALL and our data suggest that its hypophosphorylation and, consequently, reduced activity correlates with a statistical significance with the responsiveness to GC therapy. These results suggest that Rb-1 can be a useful molecular target for the therapy of this subset of patients.","['Addeo, Raffaele', 'Casale, Fiorina', 'Caraglia, Michele', ""D'Angelo, Velia"", 'Crisci, Stefania', 'Abbruzzese, Alberto', 'Di Tullio, Maria Teresa', 'Indolfi, Paolo']","['Addeo R', 'Casale F', 'Caraglia M', ""D'Angelo V"", 'Crisci S', 'Abbruzzese A', 'Di Tullio MT', 'Indolfi P']","['Pediatric Oncology Service, Pediatric Department, II University of Naples, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']","['Blast Crisis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Child', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism']",2004/03/23 05:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['837 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.3.5.838 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2004 May;3(5):470-6. doi: 10.4161/cbt.3.5.838.

The t(3;3) is a nonrandom abnormality found in a small percentage of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary AML or chronic myeloid leukemia and is strongly associated with abnormal thrombopoiesis and a particularly poor prognosis. So far, it has never been observed in HIV-positive patients. Sporadic cases of AML have been reported in HIV patients and the feasibility of chemotherapy in association with HAART and disease outcome are still not clearly defined. Despite the poor response to chemotherapy in our case, which might also be related to the unfavorable karyotype, the secondary nature of the disease and the HIV positivity, the patient had a relatively long period of survival that could be due to the use of HAART. The association of chemotherapy with HAART appeared to be feasible and tolerable and could be suggested as a choice treatment in this peculiar subset of HIV/AML patients.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Gentile, Giuseppe', 'Martino, Pietro', 'Petti, Maria Concetta', 'Russo, Eleonora', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Gentile G', 'Martino P', 'Petti MC', 'Russo E', 'Mancini M', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']","['Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'HIV Infections/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/etiology/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2003/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000076525 [doi]', '76525 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2004;111(3):160-2. doi: 10.1159/000076525.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 S.

When the telomere length reaches a critical point, cell senescence and death occur. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that counteracts telomere loss by adding telomeric sequences. In patients with acquired aplastic anemia, the mean telomere length (TRF) of peripheral blood leukocytes is generally short when compared to normal controls, without it being clear whether a relationship between TRF and disease severity exists. Additionally, increased telomerase activity (TA) is found in the bone marrow mononuclear cell population (MNCs) of aplastic anemia patients, especially in the chronic form of the disease. Fanconi anemia (FA) patients generally demonstrate increased TA and short telomeres in peripheral blood MNCs, a fact attributed to the high turnover of hematopoietic progenitor cells in combination with direct breakages at telomeric sequences. Furthermore, a strong correlation has been shown between TRF and the severity of aplastic anemia, but not with FA evolution towards myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloblastic leukemia. In respect of dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a disease of either X-linked or autosomal dominant/recessive inheritance which is characterized by premature ageing of highly regenerative tissues, studies have been carried out in order to elucidate whether the X-linked DC is caused by a defect in ribosomal RNA processing and/or telomere maintenance. Finally, the direct genetic link established between DC pathogenesis and short telomeres may lead to the development of new therapeutic protocols for diseases characterized by short telomere length and subsequent genomic instability.","['Polychronopoulou, Sophia', 'Koutroumba, Paraskevi']","['Polychronopoulou S', 'Koutroumba P']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece. sophpol@otenet.gr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],"['Anemia, Aplastic/congenital/etiology/*genetics', 'Dyskeratosis Congenita/etiology/genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia/etiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Telomerase/metabolism/*physiology', 'Telomere/metabolism/*physiology/ultrastructure']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000076519 [doi]', '76519 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2004;111(3):125-31. doi: 10.1159/000076519.,IM,,,,,,,,43,,"['Copyright 2004 S.

In the classical view, IgE acts merely to prime mast cells, attaching to FcepsilonRs but not evoking any cell signaling response until cross-linked by the presence of a multivalent allergen. However, several recent studies have reported that IgE alone can promote cell survival and cytokine production in the absence of cross-linking by allergen. In this study we demonstrate that acute addition of monomeric IgE elicits a wide spectrum of responses in the rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 mast cell line, including activation of phospholipases Cgamma and D, a rise in cytosol Ca(2+), NFAT translocation, degranulation, and membrane ruffling within minutes. Calcium transients persist for hours as long as IgE is present resulting in the maintained translocation of the transcription factor NFAT to the nucleus. Removal of IgE reverses the signaling processes. Our results indicate that, far from simply preparing the cells for a response to allergen, monomeric IgE can stimulate signaling pathways that lead to degranulation, membrane ruffling, and NFAT translocation. The mechanism of activation is likely to be via aggregation of the FcepsilonR1 because activation by IgE can be inhibited with monovalent hapten.","['Pandey, Vinita', 'Mihara, Shoji', 'Fensome-Green, Amanda', 'Bolsover, Stephen', 'Cockcroft, Shamshad']","['Pandey V', 'Mihara S', 'Fensome-Green A', 'Bolsover S', 'Cockcroft S']","['Department of Physiology, University College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']","['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/immunology', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin E/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Wortmannin']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/07/31 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.172.7.4048 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Apr 1;172(7):4048-58. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.172.7.4048.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saucernetin-7 potently inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells in both a dose- and time-dependent manner with an IC50, approximately 5 microM. DNA flow-cytometry indicated that saucernetin-7 markedly induced a G1 phase arrest of HL-60 cells. Among the G1 phase cell cycle-related proteins, the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)6 and cyclin D1 were reduced by saucernetin-7, whereas the steady-state levels of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D2, cyclin D3 and cyclin E were unaffected. The protein and mRNA levels of a CDK inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1, but not p27KIP1, were markedly increased by saucernetin-7 and p21CIP1/WAF1 induction is likely to occur at the transcriptional level because actinomycin D blocked this induction. In addition, saucernetin-7 markedly enhanced the binding of p21CIP1/WAF1 with CDK2 and CDK6, resulting in the reduced activity of both kinases and the hypophosphorylation of Rb protein. We furthermore suggest that saucernetin-7 is a potent inducer of the differentiation of HL-60 cells, based on observations such as a reduction of the nitroblue tetrazolium level, an increase in the esterase activities and phagocytic activity, morphology changes, and the expression of CD14 and CD66b surface antigens. In conclusion, the onset of saucernetin-7-induced the G0/G1 arrest of HL-60 cells prior to the differentiation is linked to a sharp up-regulation of the p21CIP1/WAF1 level and a decrease in the CDK2 and CDK6 activities. This is the first report demonstrating that saucernetin-7 potently inhibits the proliferation of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells via the G1 phase cell cycle arrest and differentiation induction.","['Seo, Bo-Rim', 'Lee, Kyung-Won', 'Ha, Joohun', 'Park, Hee-Jun', 'Choi, Jong-Won', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Seo BR', 'Lee KW', 'Ha J', 'Park HJ', 'Choi JW', 'Lee KT']","['College of Pharmacy, Kyung-Hee University, Hoegi-Dong, Seoul 130-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CEACAM8 protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (saucernetin-7)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']","['Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Western', 'CDC2-CDC28 Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Furans/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', '*Lignans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Extracts/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Saururaceae/*metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/09/11 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/carcin/bgh143 [doi]', 'bgh143 [pii]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2004 Aug;25(8):1387-94. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgh143.

The need for new capabilities to visualize and compare cross-species alignment data is intensified by the growing number of genomic sequence datasets being generated for an ever-increasing number of organisms. To be efficient these visualization algorithms must support the ability to accommodate consistently a wide range of evolutionary distances in a comparison framework based upon phylogenetic relationships. RESULTS: We have developed Phylo-VISTA, an interactive tool for analyzing multiple alignments by visualizing a similarity measure for multiple DNA sequences. The complexity of visual presentation is effectively organized using a framework based upon interspecies phylogenetic relationships. The phylogenetic organization supports rapid, user-guided interspecies comparison. To aid in navigation through large sequence datasets, Phylo-VISTA leverages concepts from VISTA that provide a user with the ability to select and view data at varying resolutions. The combination of multiresolution data visualization and analysis, combined with the phylogenetic framework for interspecies comparison, produces a highly flexible and powerful tool for visual data analysis of multiple sequence alignments.

Although the transactivator Tax has been established as an essential effector of human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1)-mediated diseases, which include both a neurodegenerative pathology and leukemia/lymphoma, its exact role(s) in the pathogenesis remains to be clarified. Because the apoptotic potential of Tax is still being debated, we addressed this question by testing the susceptibility of Tax(-) and Tax(+) cells to apoptosis under conditions of growth factor withdrawal and Bax overexpression. Results showed that Tax(+) cells are protected from apoptosis triggered by depletion of growth factors. This protective effect seems to be the result of a block in the apoptotic program regulated by mitochondria. Furthermore, in an attempt to elucidate which transcriptional pathway activated by Tax is important in the observed Tax-induced resistance, we found that CREB/ATF activity plays a relevant role in protecting cells from apoptosis induced by Bax overexpression. All together, these data might suggest that the ability of Tax to inhibit certain apoptotic stimuli could be important in its role as a viral transforming protein.","['Saggioro, Daniela', 'Acquasaliente, Lidia', 'Daprai, Laura', 'Chieco-Bianchi, Luigi']","['Saggioro D', 'Acquasaliente L', 'Daprai L', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, Oncology Section, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy. d.saggioro@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochromes c', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1196/annals.1299.111 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 Dec;1010:591-7. doi: 10.1196/annals.1299.111.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the chemopreventive potential of isothiocyanates, we studied proliferation, apoptosis induction and p53, bcl-2 and bax protein expression in Jurkat T-leukemia cells by the isothiocyanate sulforaphane. Sulforaphane caused G(2)/M-phase delay and increase of apoptotic cell fraction in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Necrosis was observed after prolonged exposure to elevated sulforaphane doses. Moreover, it markedly increased p53 and bax protein expression, and slightly affected bcl-2 expression. Since selective targeting and low toxicity for normal host tissues are fundamental requisites for proposed chemopreventive agents such as sulforaphane, we tested sulforaphane on non-transformed phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human T-lymphocytes. We demonstrated that sulforaphane arrested cell-cycle progression in G1 phase by a significant down-modulation of cyclin D3. Moreover, sulforaphane induced apoptosis (and also necrosis), mediated by an increase in the expression of p53, whereas it exerted little effect on bcl-2 and bax levels. These findings indicate that sulforaphane can exert protective effects inhibiting leukemic cell growth. Moreover, sulforaphane is active not only in transformed lymphocytes but also in their normal counterpart. Although in vitro studies do not necessarily predict in vivo outcomes, our findings raise important questions regarding the suitability of sulforaphane for cancer chemoprevention.","['Fimognari, Carmela', 'Nusse, Michael', 'Berti, Fausto', 'Iori, Renato', 'Cantelli-Forti, Giorgio', 'Hrelia, Patrizia']","['Fimognari C', 'Nusse M', 'Berti F', 'Iori R', 'Cantelli-Forti G', 'Hrelia P']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy. fimognari@biocfarm.unibo.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']","['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Sulfoxides', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Thiocyanates/*pharmacology']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1196/annals.1299.072 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 Dec;1010:393-8. doi: 10.1196/annals.1299.072.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Khat use has been associated with development of oral cancer, but its molecular effects remain controversial. This study describes a novel cytotoxic effect of whole khat extract on three leukemia cell lines. Cells were exposed to khat extract and harvested for analysis by fluorescent and electron microscopy, trypan blue exclusion, as well as immunoblotting to characterize the mode of cell death. In a separate series, cells were pretreated with a panel of caspase inhibitors for possible inhibitory effects. Khat induced a rapid cell death effect in HL-60, Jurkat, and NB4 cells that occurred within 2 h of exposure. The treated cells retained their ability to exclude trypan blue dye, a key feature in the apoptotic process. Exposed cells consistently developed morphological features of manifest apoptosis. Z-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor, completely inhibited toxic activity for up to 8 h, with partial inhibition by other caspase-specific agents. Western blot analysis showed specific cleavage of caspase-3 in khat-exposed cells. This study shows that khat induces cell death by apoptosis in a process sensitive to inhibition by caspase inhibitors, suggesting that subcellular interactions could be of particular relevance for the biological effects of khat in the cell death process and possibly carcinogenesis.","['Dimba, E', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Francis, G W', 'Johannessen, A C', 'Vintermyr, O K']","['Dimba E', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Francis GW', 'Johannessen AC', 'Vintermyr OK']","['Department of Odontology-Oral Pathology and Forensic Odontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. elizabeth.dimba@students.uib.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']","['Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Catha', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*toxicity']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1196/annals.1299.070 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 Dec;1010:384-8. doi: 10.1196/annals.1299.070.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and wines, triggers apoptosis in some systems and inhibits the death signal in others. In this regard, the reported inhibitory effect on hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis has been attributed to its antioxidant property. Here, we provide evidence that exposure of human leukemia cells to low concentrations of resveratrol (4-8 micro M) inhibits caspase activation and DNA fragmentation induced by incubation with hydrogen peroxide or upon triggering apoptosis with a novel compound that kills via intracellular hydrogen peroxide production. At these concentrations, resveratrol elicits pro-oxidant properties as evidenced by an increase in intracellular superoxide concentration. This pro-oxidant effect is further supported by our observations that the drop in intracellular superoxide and cytosolic acidification induced by hydrogen peroxide is completely blocked in cells preincubated with resveratrol. Thus, the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis is not due to its antioxidant activity, but contrarily via a pro-oxidant effect that creates an intracellular environment nonconducive for apoptotic execution.","['Ahmad, Kashif Adil', 'Clement, Marie-Veronique', 'Pervaiz, Shazib']","['Ahmad KA', 'Clement MV', 'Pervaiz S']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']","['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1196/annals.1299.067 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 Dec;1010:365-73. doi: 10.1196/annals.1299.067.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently cloned a new member of the BCL2 family of apoptosis-related genes, BCL2L12. In the present study, the expression of BCL2 and BCL2L12 genes during cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HL-60 leukemic cells was investigated. The kinetics of apoptosis induction and cell toxicity were evaluated by DNA laddering and the MTT method, respectively. BCL2 and BCL2L12 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers. The ratio of apoptotic cells increased with increasing concentrations of cisplatin and exposure time of cell culture to the drug. Gradual, time-dependent downregulation of BCL2 gene was observed during cisplatin treatment. Up-regulation of BCL2L12 was observed 3 h (no DNA fragmentation) and 6 h (initiation of the DNA fragmentation) after treatment with cisplatin, followed by a decrease of its expression after 12-h continuous treatment with the drug. It is known that the main anti-carcinogenic effect of cisplatin is due to the induction of cell apoptosis. Present results indicate that downregulation of the BCL2 and upregulation of the BCL2L12 gene may be the underlying mechanisms.","['Floros, Kostas V', 'Thomadaki, Hellinida', 'Lallas, George', 'Katsaros, Nikos', 'Talieri, Maroulio', 'Scorilas, Andreas']","['Floros KV', 'Thomadaki H', 'Lallas G', 'Katsaros N', 'Talieri M', 'Scorilas A']","['National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens 15310, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (BCL2L12 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']","['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Muscle Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1196/annals.1299.025 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 Dec;1010:153-8. doi: 10.1196/annals.1299.025.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This investigation examined the effect of the potent MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 on apoptosis in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cell lines, and acute leukemic and non-leukemic patient samples. The pro-apoptotic effect of the inhibitor varied across the five cell lines tested (KG1a, HEL, TF-1, MO7e, and THP-1) from highly significant induction of apoptosis to no apparent response. The pro-apoptotic effect of U0126 in the most sensitive cell line, KG1a, appeared to be related to its CD34 positivity. Three of five leukemic bone marrow samples showed considerable sensitivity to the inhibitor and a similar association with CD34 expression was evident. Interestingly, control marrow cells from six non-leukemic patients did not show a significant effect when exposed to U0126. These results suggest that this agent may offer a potential alternative to standard chemotherapy with a particular role in the most primitive types of leukemia, these often being the most resistant to standard chemotherapy.","['Kerr, A H J', 'James, J A', 'Smith, M A', 'Willson, C', 'Court, E L', 'Smith, J G']","['Kerr AH', 'James JA', 'Smith MA', 'Willson C', 'Court EL', 'Smith JG']","['Centre for Research in Biomedicine, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of the West of England, Bristol BS16 1QY, UK.

Cellular responses induced by elevated [Ca(2+)](i) depended on the duration and amplitude of the calcium-signal.

We assessed the survival of a large cohort of pediatric oncological patients to provide hard data on which to base realistic evaluation and planning schemes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter retrospective survey covered consecutively diagnosed and treated patients admitted to eight national level hospitals in seven countries in Central America and the Caribbean. The research protocol was discussed extensively, so the data to be collected and the criteria for their evaluation were clearly pre-defined. We analysed 2214 patients diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 with various cancers, classified as hemato-oncological disorders (70%) and solid tumors (30%). RESULTS: Three-year overall survival was 48.4% [standard error (SE) 1.3]. Detailed analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia highlighted the wide intercountry variability: 3-year survival was 62.2% (SE 5.3) in Cuba, 74.2% (SE 3.3) in Costa Rica, 61.7% (SE 4.9) in Nicaragua, and lower in the other four countries. CONCLUSIONS: The yield of diagnostic-therapeutic protocols depends largely on the context of care in which they are applied.

Studies have shown that farnesylation of Ras is the first, obligatory first step in a series of post-translational modifications leading to membrane association, which, in turn, determines the switch from an inactive to an active Ras-GTP bound form. Based on the theorical assumption that preventing Ras farnesylation might result in the inhibition of Ras functions, a range of FTIs have been synthesized. Their biology is fascinating since after substantial investigation and their use in several phase II studies and at least two phase III trials, the exact mechanism of action remains unclear. FTIs can block the farnesylation of several additional proteins, such as RhoB, prelamins A and B, centromere proteins (CENP-E, CENP-F), etc. While the FTIs clearly do not or only partly target Ras, these agents appear to have clinical activity in leukemia and in some solid tumors regardless of their Ras mutational status. Although inhibition of FTase by these compounds has been well documented also in normal tissues, their toxic effects seem to be manageable. However, preliminary results of early Phase II-III studies suggest that the activity of FTIs, as a single-agent, is modest and generally lower than that obtained by standard cytotoxic drugs. Ongoing clinical studies are assessing the role of FTIs for early stage disease or in combination with cytotoxic agents or with other molecular targeted therapies for advanced stage tumors. Further insights in the molecular mechanism of action of FTIs might help in better define their optimal use in combination with standard therapies in the treatment of cancer patients.","['Russo, Patrizia', 'Loprevite, Maura', 'Cesario, Alfredo', 'Ardizzoni, Andrea']","['Russo P', 'Loprevite M', 'Cesario A', 'Ardizzoni A']","['Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, National Institute for Research on Cancer Genova-Italia. patrizia.russo@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Med Chem Anticancer Agents,Current medicinal chemistry.

This equilibrium ensures that cells survive in the right milieu, but undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) when damaged, or when the environment is no longer supportive. Diseases may occur with alterations in this homeostasis. For example, cancer cells may survive in an environment in which they would not normally exist. This is accomplished by alterations in the expressions or functions of genes controlling both survival and apoptotic signaling pathways. Survival signaling pathways involve the activation of cell surface receptors, serine threonine kinases, transcription factors as well as other molecules. In breast and ovarian cancers, the ErbB2 growth factor receptor is overexpressed and this contributes to the progression of these cancers, in part by constitutively activating survival signaling pathways. In contrast, apoptotic signal transduction pathways are often inhibited in cancer. For example, overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis and this contributes to the accumulation of cells in follicular lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Furthermore, alterations in these signaling pathways in cancer cells may lead to drug resistance. Recent advances in molecular targeted therapies have taken advantage of alterations in survival and apoptotic signaling pathways in cancer to specifically target aberrantly regulated molecules. For example, Herceptin trade mark inhibits ErbB2 function and anti-sense oligonucleotides against Bcl-2 reduce Bcl-2 expression. These agents can thus induce apoptosis in the specific cancer cell against which they have been targeted. In this review, we will discuss alteration in survival and apoptotic signal transduction pathways in cancer and the development of novel chemotherapeutic drugs to target these pathways.","['Kabore, Albert F', 'Johnston, James B', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Kabore AF', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson SB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, 675 McDermot Ave, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada. gibsonsb@cc.umanitoba.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1568009043481551 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2004 Mar;4(2):147-63. doi: 10.2174/1568009043481551.,IM,,,,,,,,189,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data sets generated by these arrays consist of a small number of observations (e.g., 20-100 samples) on a very large number of variables (e.g., 10,000 genes or proteins). The observations in these data sets often have other attributes associated with them such as a class label denoting the pathology of the subject. Finding the genes or proteins that are correlated to these attributes is often a difficult task since most of the variables do not contain information about the pathology and as such can mask the identity of the relevant features. We describe a genetic algorithm (GA) that employs both supervised and unsupervised learning to mine gene expression and proteomic data. The pattern recognition GA selects features that increase clustering, while simultaneously searching for features that optimize the separation of the classes in a plot of the two or three largest principal components of the data. Because the largest principal components capture the bulk of the variance in the data, the features chosen by the GA contain information primarily about differences between classes in the data set. The principal component analysis routine embedded in the fitness function of the GA acts as an information filter, significantly reducing the size of the search space since it restricts the search to feature sets whose principal component plots show clustering on the basis of class. The algorithm integrates aspects of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computations to yield a smart one pass procedure for feature selection, clustering, classification, and prediction.","['Lavine, Barry K', 'Davidson, Charles E', 'Rayens, William S']","['Lavine BK', 'Davidson CE', 'Rayens WS']","['Department of Chemistry, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY 13699-5810, USA. bklab@clarkson.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,9810948,,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics', '*Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Principal Component Analysis']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/05/14 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138620704773120801 [doi]'],ppublish,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2004 Mar;7(2):115-31. doi: 10.2174/138620704773120801.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A shared feature of signal transduction downstream of most receptors on immune cells, as in nonhematopoietic cell types, is the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The mechanism by which this common signaling event is elicited by distinct receptors and contributes to unique functional outcomes is an intriguing puzzle. Understanding how specificity is achieved in PI3K signaling is of particular significance because altered regulation of this pathway is observed in many disease states, including leukemia and lymphoma. Here we review recent advances in the understanding of PI3K signaling mechanisms in different immune cells and receptor systems.

Molecular targeted therapies against specific oncogenic events are now possible. The BCR-ABL story represents a notable example of how research from the fields of cytogenetics, retroviral oncology, protein phosphorylation, and small molecule chemical inhibitors can lead to the development of a successful molecular targeted therapy. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI571, or CP57148B) is a direct inhibitor of ABL (ABL1), ARG (ABL2), KIT, and PDGFR tyrosine kinases. This drug has had a major impact on the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) as well as other blood neoplasias and solid tumors with etiologies based on activation of these tyrosine kinases. Analysis of CML patients resistant to BCR-ABL suppression by Imatinib mesylate coupled with the crystallographic structure of ABL complexed to this inhibitor have shown how structural mutations in ABL can circumvent an otherwise potent anticancer drug. The successes and limitations of Imatinib mesylate hold general lessons for the development of alternative molecular targeted therapies in oncology.","['Wong, Stephane', 'Witte, Owen N']","['Wong S', 'Witte ON']","['Molecular Biology Interdepartmental PhD Program/UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095-1662, USA. sw@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Immunol,Annual review of immunology,8309206,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytogenetics/*history', '*Drug Design', '*Genes, abl', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/08/03 05:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.immunol.22.012703.104753 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Immunol. 2004;22:247-306. doi: 10.1146/annurev.immunol.22.012703.104753.,IM,,,,,,,,360,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we performed a flow cytometric analysis of 267 Thai adult AML cases to delineate the pattern of leukemic cell surface antigens. Forty-eight cases (18%) were identified as acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) and 219 cases as non-M3. The most frequent subtype of AML in Thailand was M1/M2 and the least frequent was M7. M3 immunophenotypes were characterized by their unique lack of expression of CD34 and HLA-DR as contrast to the high mean expression of 50% and 70%, respectively, in non-M3. Overall, 60% of cases expressed CD34. Aberrant lymphoid antigens were uniquely seen in specific subtypes of Thai AML, including CD19 (33% of non-M3 vs 23% of M3) and CD2 (12% of M3 vs 2% of non-M3). CD56 was frequently expressed in both M3 and non-M3 while CD16 appeared to be associated with M4/M5 (24% of cases) and CD7 with M1/M2 (21% of cases). Eighty-one percent of non-M3 expressed CD38 while only 53% of M3 did. We found that most Thai adult AML patients were on average 15-20 years younger than those of the West or Japan with only 25% of Thai cases over 60 years of age, although the immunophenotypes were not markedly different. Biological studies of acute leukemia in various countries should help to provide epidemiological clues that play a role in the pathogenesis of leukemia in different geographic regions of the world.

Comparison between lymphoid and myeloid subtypes.,57-60,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if image morphometry has any role in distinguishing blasts of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-L2) from those of acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M1) and (AML-M2). STUDY DESIGN: Ten cases each of ALL-L2, AML-M1 and AML-M2 diagnosed according to the French-American-British criteria were studied. In all cases May-Grunwald-Giemsa-stained bone marrow aspiration smears were obtained. At least 100 blast cells from each case were subjected to analysis randomly with an image cytometer using Leica Quantimet 600 software (Cambridge, U.K.). The area, convex area, length, width, perimeter, convex perimeter, roundness, total optical density, average optical density and pixel grey value variance of the nuclei were measured by random selection of cells using a 40:1 objective (1 pixel = 0.446 micron). RESULTS: Mann Whitney's nonparametric test showed that there was considerable overlap of morphometric variables between the 3 subtypes. Though statistical significance was found in ""roundness"" between blasts of AML-M1 and ALL-L2, power analyses (sample size of 100 blasts of each subtype) did not show sufficient power for this variable. However, between blasts of ALL-L2 and AML-M2, ""average optical density"" and ""pixel grey value variance"" were statistically significant with full power using power analyses. CONCLUSION: Image morphometry may be helpful in differentiating blasts from lymphoid and myeloid leukemic subtypes.","['Rajesh, Logasundaram', 'Pattari, Sanjib Kumar', 'Garewal, Gurjeewan', 'Dey, Pranab', 'Srinivasan, Radhika']","['Rajesh L', 'Pattari SK', 'Garewal G', 'Dey P', 'Srinivasan R']","['Department of Pathology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Hypertrophy/diagnosis', 'Image Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Video/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*pathology']",2004/03/23 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/03/23 05:00'],"['2004/03/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 2004 Feb;26(1):57-60.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth inhibition was accompanied by induction of apoptosis, as determined by an ELISA for the detection of cell death and the TUNEL assay. Using phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies (PY20), we observed that tyrosine kinase activity in DMS114 cells was inhibited by treatment with beta-HIVS and CDDP together. The tyrosine kinase activity of isolated Src and that of isolated receptors for epidermal growth factor were also inhibited by the two agents together. The synergistic effects of the growth of DMS114 cells of beta-HIVS and CDDP were not due simply to the intracellular accumulation of CDDP or to levels of DNA adducts.

It is known that induction of the GADD45a gene is regulated in a p53-dependent manner after ionizing irradiation. Our previous study showed that X-ray irradiation increased the transcription rate of the GADD45a gene much earlier than the maximum accumulation of stabilized p53 protein in human myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells. We hypothesized that some transcription factor(s) may cooperate with p53 in regulating the GADD45a gene early after the irradiation of ML-1 cells. This idea is supported by recent studies showing that the p53-dependent activation of several genes in human and mouse cells requires some additional transcription factors, such as Sp1, GKLF, Ets1, and IRF-1. To examine the possible involvement of cooperating factors in transcriptional regulation of the GADD45a gene by ionizing radiation, we comprehensively searched for the X-ray-inducible binding locus of the nuclear factor throughout the upstream region (-2244 bp/+89 bp) and the third intron (+1389 bp/+2488 bp) of the GADD45a gene by EMSA using 136 probes. The X-ray-responsive binding of nuclear factors was detected at eight loci. Oct, NF-kappaB, HNF, NF-AT, and KLF family transcription factors were identified by a competition assay.

Subjects were traced through National Health Service and social security records, and their mortality was compared with that expected from rates in the national population by the person-years method. RESULTS: Analysis was based on 565 deaths, of which 339 had occurred during the additional period of follow up. Mortality was close to or below expectation for all causes (565 deaths v 607.6 expected), all cancers (188 v 184.2), and for all specific categories of malignancy including stomach cancer (10 v 11.6), breast cancer (11 v 13.2), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7 v 4.8), and leukaemia (5 v 4.6). All five deaths from leukaemia occurred in the subset of subjects with greatest potential for exposure to ethylene oxide, but even in this group the excess of deaths was small (2.6 expected). CONCLUSIONS: The balance of evidence from this and other epidemiological investigations indicates that any risk of human cancer from ethylene oxide is low, particularly at the levels of occupational exposure that have occurred in Britain over recent decades.

We found that in NB4 acute promyelocytic and in K562 erythroleukemia cell lines treatment with the MEK1 inhibitors PD98059 and PD184352 greatly enhances apoptotic cell death induced by ATO alone. Combined treatment results in the induction of the p53AIP1 (p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1) gene in both cell lines. Because NB4 and K562 cell lines carry an inactive p53, we investigated the possible role of p73, a p53 paralogue that has been shown to regulate several p53 target genes including p21, Bax, and p53AIP1. We found that MEK1 inhibitors reduce the levels of dominant-negative (DeltaN) p73 proteins and promote the accumulation of endogenous p73alpha through its transcriptional activation and its tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in p21 up-regulation and significant inhibition of cell growth. ATO reduces DeltaNp73 levels and promotes a p300-mediated acetylation of endogenous p73, thus favoring cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Finally, the combined treatment with MEK1 inhibitors and ATO enhances the affinity of phosphoacetylated p73 for the p53AIP1 promoter in vivo, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, leading to p53AIP1 up-regulation and increased apoptosis.","['Lunghi, Paolo', 'Costanzo, Antonio', 'Levrero, Massimo', 'Bonati, Antonio']","['Lunghi P', 'Costanzo A', 'Levrero M', 'Bonati A']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche, Via Gramsci 14, 43100 Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (P53AIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (delta Np73 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/03/20 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/03/20 05:00'],"['2004/03/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-08-2743 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55149-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jul 15;104(2):519-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-08-2743.

The artificial antigen-presenting constructs (aAPCs) effectively stimulated HA-1- and HA-2-specific CTL clones as shown by ligand-specific expansion, cytokine production, and maintenance of cytotoxic activity, without alteration of CTL phenotype. Furthermore, HA-1-specific polyclonal CTL lines were enriched as efficiently by aAPCs as by autologous HA-1 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. Thus, aAPCs coated with HLA/mHag complexes, CD80, and CD54 may serve as tools for in vitro enrichment of immunotherapeutic mHag-specific CTL lines.","['Oosten, Liesbeth E M', 'Blokland, Els', 'van Halteren, Astrid G S', 'Curtsinger, Julie', 'Mescher, Matthew F', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Mutis, Tuna', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Oosten LE', 'Blokland E', 'van Halteren AG', 'Curtsinger J', 'Mescher MF', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Mutis T', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. l.e.m.oosten@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/physiology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Oligopeptides/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology']",2004/03/20 05:00,2004/08/28 05:00,['2004/03/20 05:00'],"['2004/03/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-07-2461 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54529-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jul 1;104(1):224-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-07-2461.

Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells adoptively transferred into mice persistently infected with Friend virus proliferated and appeared activated, but failed to produce IFNgamma or reduce virus loads. Cotransfer experiments revealed that a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells from persistently infected mice suppressed IFNgamma production by the CD8(+) T cells. Treatment of persistently infected mice with anti-GITR antibody to ameliorate suppression by regulatory T cells significantly improved IFNgamma production by transferred CD8(+) T cells and allowed a significant reduction in viral loads.

Overall, parents expressed more promotion than prevention focus, especially in relation to general rather than illness-related contexts. Greater use by parents of prevention focus in general contexts predicted lower QOL for survivors (as rated both by parents and survivors themselves) and less satisfactory parental well-being.

Functional Annotation of Mouse (FANTOM) 2, the largest mouse transcriptome project yet, provides a wealth of data on novel genes, splice variants and non-coding RNA, and provides a unique opportunity to identify novel human disease genes. AIMS: To demonstrate the power of combining the FANTOM 2 cDNA dataset with a positional candidate approach and bioinformatics analysis to identify genes underlying human genetic disease. RESULTS: By mapping all FANTOM 2 cDNA to the human genome, we were able to identify mouse clones that co-localised on the human genome with mapped but uncloned human disease loci. By this method we identified mouse and corresponding human genes mapping within the loci of 100 different human genetic diseases (mapped interval of <5 cM). Of particular interest was the elucidation through FANTOM 2 novel mouse gene data of candidate human genes for the following: (i) developmental -disorders: neural tube defect, Meckel syndrome, Wolf--Hirschhorn syndrome and keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans cum ophiasi; (ii) neurological disorders: benign familial infantile convulsions 3, early-onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes, infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia and vacuolar neuro-myopathy and (iii) cancer-related syndromes: tylosis with oesophageal cancer and low-grade B-cell chronic lymphatic leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The FANTOM 2 data will dramatically accelerate efforts to identify genes underlying human disease. It will also facilitate the creation of transgenic mouse models to help elucidate the function of potential human disease genes.","['Kiyosawa, H', 'Kawashima, T', 'Silva, D', 'Petrovsky, N', 'Hasegawa, Y', 'Sakai, K', 'Hayashizaki, Y']","['Kiyosawa H', 'Kawashima T', 'Silva D', 'Petrovsky N', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Sakai K', 'Hayashizaki Y']","['Technology and Development team for Mammalian Cellular Dynamics, Bioresource Center, RIKEN Tsukuba Institute, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)']","['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping/*methods', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Computational Biology', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'Darier Disease/genetics', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Epilepsy, Benign Neonatal/genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Genome, Human', 'Genomic Library', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Spinocerebellar Degenerations/genetics']",2004/03/20 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/03/20 05:00'],"['2004/03/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1444-0903.2004.00581.x [doi]', 'IMJ581 [pii]']",ppublish,Intern Med J. 2004 Mar;34(3):79-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1444-0903.2004.00581.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, two of 11 treated patients subsequently developed a leukemia-like disease probablydue to the undesired activation of an oncogene. Gene transfer to HSCs resulted in substantial correction of immune function and multi-lineage engraftment in two patients with adenosine deaminase (ADA)-SCID. Several Phase I clinical trials for treatment of hemophilia A and B have been initiated or completed. Partial correction of hemophilia A, albeit transient, has been reported by ex vivo gene transfer to autologous fibroblasts. Intramuscular injection of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to patients with severe hemophilia B resulted in evidence of Factor IX gene transfer to skeletal muscle and a separate trial based on hepatic infusion of AAV vector is ongoing. Sustained therapeutic levels of coagulation factor expression have been achieved in preclinical models using retroviral, lentiviral, AAV and high capacity adenoviral vectors.

Expression and activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor-3 (Stat3) and inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation were evaluated in cells transfected with this chimeric molecule. Increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stat3 at Tyr705 was detected after 10 min LIF treatment in cells transfected with either the 130/190 or the wild type receptor. Cell proliferation was decreased upon LIF treatment in both cell types. However, expression of the C-terminal region of the cytoplasmic region of LIFRalpha subunit (190CT) in HL-60 cells resulted in lower levels of Stat3 phosphorylation induction by LIF and cell proliferation was unaffected. Immunohistochemical staining indicated an inverse correlation between Cdc25B expression and the levels of phospho-Stat3 in 190CT and 130/190 cells. Expression of CD15, a cell differentiation marker, was lower in 190CT than in 130/190 cells.

The study was focused on survival times in patients according to a) cytologico-clinical type of leukemia, b) timeframe in which treatment was initiated (between 1980-1985 and 1986-1090). All patients diagnosed of leukemia between the years 1980-1990, living in Cracow and whose cytologico-clinical picture was determined had their survival times and censored survival times established. Survival until 1997 was taken into account. For each cytologico-clinical type of leukemia survival function according to Kaplan-Meier was calculated. The Cox model was implemented to analyze the risk of death depending on the period in which the disease appeared--two time frames were established 1980-1985 and 1986-1990. Other parameters considered were; age, sex and area in which the patient lived (suburb). Practically in all types of leukemia a higher probability of survival was found in patients in whom leukemia was diagnosed (and consequently treated) in the second period i.e., 1986-1990. The highest achievement was observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, in which the relative 5-year survival probability rose from 35% in the years 1980-1985 to 78% in the years 1986-1990, thus achieving the level of well developed countries. A similar picture was seen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia where the relative 5 year survival probability rose from 57% to 77%, and in chronic granulocytic leukemia where the 5 year survival probabilities were accordingly 23% and 39%. All cited values for the second period of analysis are at the levels noted in the United States and in Europe. The positive changes in the survival times observed in patients with leukemia seen in the second half of the 80-ies (in comparison to the period 1980-1985) has been interpreted as the result of advancements in therapy of the disease in Cracow.","['Fornal, Maria', 'Janicki, Kazimierz', 'Grodzicki, Tomasz']","['Fornal M', 'Janicki K', 'Grodzicki T']","['Katedra Chorob Wewnetrznych i Gerontologii, Collegium Medicum, Uniwersytet Jagiellonski.']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Przegl Epidemiol,Przeglad epidemiologiczny,0413725,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2004/03/20 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/20 05:00'],"['2004/03/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Przegl Epidemiol. 2003;57(4):671-82.,IM,Ewolucja przezycia chorych na bialaczki w Krakowie--przypadkow zarejestrowanych w latach 1980-1990.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the capacity of oncoretroviral (MLV)- and lentiviral (HIV-1)-based vectors pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVg) to transduce HVS-T cells. HIV-1-derived vectors efficiently transduced HVS-T cell lines, reaching up to 85% of cells expressing the transgene in a single round of infection. MLV-based vectors, on the other hand, were unable to transduce more than 1% of any of the HVS-T cell lines analyzed.

We previously demonstrated that gemtuzumab infusion results in near-complete CD33 saturation in peripheral blood, and that saturating gemtuzumab levels result in continuous binding and internalization of gemtuzumab due to renewed CD33 expression. We now demonstrate that a high CD33-antigen load in peripheral blood is an independent adverse prognostic factor, likely due to peripheral consumption of gemtuzumab. Indeed, CD33 saturation in bone marrow is significantly reduced (40-90% saturation) as compared with CD33 saturation in corresponding peripheral blood samples (>90%). In vitro, such reduced CD33 saturation levels were strongly related with reduced cell kill. Apparently, high CD33-antigen loads in blood consume gemtuzumab and thereby limit its penetration into bone marrow. Consequently, CD33 saturation in bone marrow is reduced, which hampers efficient cell kill. Therefore, gemtuzumab should be administered at higher or repeated doses, or, preferably, after reduction of the leukemic cell burden by classical chemotherapy.","['van der Velden, V H J', 'Boeckx, N', 'Jedema, I', 'te Marvelde, J G', 'Hoogeveen, P G', 'Boogaerts, M', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['van der Velden VH', 'Boeckx N', 'Jedema I', 'te Marvelde JG', 'Hoogeveen PG', 'Boogaerts M', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']","['Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*blood', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2004/03/19 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/19 05:00'],"['2004/03/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403350 [doi]', '2403350 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 May;18(5):983-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403350.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied BLNK expression in the leukemic cells from 352 patients with childhood ALL (309 B-lineage; 43 T-lineage). By HG_U95Av2 Affymetrix GeneChip analysis, BLNK was expressed in 275 of 284 (96.8%) B-lineage ALL samples but in only one of 43 (2.3%) T-lineage ALL samples.

All 30 primary B-lineage ALL samples studied by RT-PCR expressed BLNK transcripts; all 19 samples studied by Western blotting or flow cytometry expressed BLNK protein.

The incidence of relapse was significantly lower in patients who developed acute or chronic GVHD, but disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly inferior in patients who developed acute GVHD. A benefit of 'mild' GVHD was only seen in high-risk patients who developed grade I acute GVHD. The strongest association between GVHD and a decreased incidence of relapse was observed in patients with standard-risk acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. In conclusion, the therapeutic window between decreased relapse and increased transplant-related mortality due to the development of GVHD appeared to be very narrow.","['Kanda, Y', 'Izutsu, K', 'Hirai, H', 'Sakamaki, H', 'Iseki, T', 'Kodera, Y', 'Okamoto, S', 'Mitsui, H', 'Iwato, K', 'Hirabayashi, N', 'Furukawa, T', 'Maruta, A', 'Kasai, M', 'Atsuta, Y', 'Hamajima, N', 'Hiraoka, A', 'Kawa, K']","['Kanda Y', 'Izutsu K', 'Hirai H', 'Sakamaki H', 'Iseki T', 'Kodera Y', 'Okamoto S', 'Mitsui H', 'Iwato K', 'Hirabayashi N', 'Furukawa T', 'Maruta A', 'Kasai M', 'Atsuta Y', 'Hamajima N', 'Hiraoka A', 'Kawa K']","['Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, University of Tokyo Hospital, Japan. ycanda-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",2004/03/19 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/19 05:00'],"['2004/03/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403343 [doi]', '2403343 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 May;18(5):1013-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403343.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively studied the expression of cyclin D1 in CD5 positive leukemic B lymphoproliferative disorders at diagnosis and identified 65 cases overexpressing cyclin D1. We did not distinguish any clinical or biological criteria allowing one to identify a non-MCL group. Multivariate analysis identified age, anemia and p27kip1 expression as independent prognostic factors of survival. By univariate analysis, p27kip1 high expression proved to be the strongest predictor of prolonged survival. The median survival of p27 low expressors was 30 months, while it was not reached for p27 high expressors. A high level of p27 expression was often found associated with the absence of nodal involvement and the presence of somatic mutations, but neither of them was restricted to the p27 high expression group. In conclusion, we hypothesize that MCL and these cyclin D1 positive leukemic lymphoproliferative disorders represent a continuous spectrum of diseases.

Conversely, loss of Bmi1 leads to haematological defects and severe progressive neurological abnormalities in which de-repression of the ink4a/Arf locus is critically implicated. Here, we show that Bmi1 is strongly expressed in proliferating cerebellar precursor cells in mice and humans. Using Bmi1-null mice we demonstrate a crucial role for Bmi1 in clonal expansion of granule cell precursors both in vivo and in vitro. Deregulated proliferation of these progenitor cells, by activation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, leads to medulloblastoma development. We also demonstrate linked overexpression of BMI1 and patched (PTCH), suggestive of SHH pathway activation, in a substantial fraction of primary human medulloblastomas. Together with the rapid induction of Bmi1 expression on addition of Shh or on overexpression of the Shh target Gli1 in cerebellar granule cell cultures, these findings implicate BMI1 overexpression as an alternative or additive mechanism in the pathogenesis of medulloblastomas, and highlight a role for Bmi1-containing polycomb complexes in proliferation of cerebellar precursor cells.","['Leung, Carly', 'Lingbeek, Merel', 'Shakhova, Olga', 'Liu, James', 'Tanger, Ellen', 'Saremaslani, Parvin', 'Van Lohuizen, Maarten', 'Marino, Silvia']","['Leung C', 'Lingbeek M', 'Shakhova O', 'Liu J', 'Tanger E', 'Saremaslani P', 'Van Lohuizen M', 'Marino S']","['Institute of Clinical Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Zurich, Schmelzbergstrasse 12, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (PTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Patched Receptors)', '0 (Patched-1 Receptor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Ptch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SHH protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']","['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cerebellum/cytology/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hedgehog Proteins', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Patched Receptors', 'Patched-1 Receptor', 'Phenotype', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",2004/03/19 05:00,2004/04/08 05:00,['2004/03/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nature02385 [doi]', 'nature02385 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2004 Mar 18;428(6980):337-41. doi: 10.1038/nature02385.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the case of a 77-year-old female patient who had acute inflammatory proptosis during regressive right ethmoiditis. The diagnosis was reached by computed tomography showing an extraconical intraorbital tumor sprouting from the sinus, and by clinical examination and confirmed by the hematological investigation. Acute proptosis developing in an acute myeloblastic leukemia context heavily swayed diagnosis towards orbital granulocytic sarcoma. Chemotherapy by cytarabine and hydroxycarbamide associated with intravenous corticoid therapy resulted in complete disappearance of the proptosis within 10 days.

Definition and specific therapeutic indication].,187-91; discussion 192,"Introduction. On the 29th of October 2003, mitoxantrone was approved by the french health agency Afssaps (Agence francaise de securite sanitaire des produits de sante) for its use in the aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is the first immuno-suppressor having demonstrated particular efficacy in this progressive form of MS. Definition of aggressive MS. Agressive multiple sclerosis is defined as an MS that leads to the rapid accumumation of disabilities, whether these latter are the result of repeated relapses (at least 2 in the past 12 Months) or the continuous progression of a disability (increase in 2 points on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) in the past 12 Months). The benefits of mitoxantrone. In cases of aggressive multiple sclerosis, mitoxantrone (20 mg IV), administered in Monthly cycles for 6 Months, clearly reduces the frequency of relapses, the appearance of new lesions on MRI and the progression of the disability. Precautions to be taken when using mitoxanthrone. The side effects however justify the fact that this drug is limited to the aggressive forms of MP. Cardiac toxicity limits the duration of the prescription and the maximum dose administered, requiring strict echocardiographical monitoring. Its unpredictable haematological toxicity can be devastating (risk of subsequent leukaemia). The benefit-risk ratio must be discussed with the patient and a Yearly echochardiography and three Monthly blood count must be continued during the 5 Years following withdrawal of mitoxantrone. The prescription of mitoxantrone is limited to the neurologists of departments specialized in neurology.","['Edan, Gilles']",['Edan G'],['Service de neurologie hopital Pont de Chaillou rue Henri Le Guilloud 35033 Rennes.'],['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Placebos)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']","['Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Analgesics/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-beta/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Multiple Sclerosis/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Neuroprotective Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Patient Selection', 'Placebos', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",2004/03/19 05:00,2004/04/03 05:00,['2004/03/19 05:00'],"['2004/03/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0755-4982(04)98520-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0755-4982(04)98520-x [doi]']",ppublish,Presse Med. 2004 Feb 14;33(3):187-91; discussion 192. doi: 10.1016/s0755-4982(04)98520-x.,IM,Sclerose en plaques agressive.

Neonatal chickens were treated with cyclophosphamide (CY) or PBS, and then infected with ALV-J (ADOL-7501) at 2 weeks of age. CY treatment induced B cell specific immunosuppression throughout the experiment confirmed by decreased bursal weight, intact lymphocyte mitogenetic activity stimulated by Con A and increased relative subpopulation of CD3-positive cells as measured by flow cytometry. Chickens in this experiment had Mareks disease virus exposure prior to three weeks of age as determined by the presence of lymphocytic infiltration and antibody. Virus neutralizing antibody against ALV-J was first observed at 6 weeks post-infection in some of the infected chickens in the PBS group. As expected, none of the chickens from the CY group and uninfected chickens developed virus-neutralizing antibody. The viremic status was measured by real time RT-PCR using SYBR green I dye. The percentage of viremic chickens was significantly higher, and more chickens had high titered viremia, in the CY treated group. No neoplastic foci consistent with ALVJ infection were observed in any of the experimental chickens. The frequency and intensity of viral antigen expression determined by immunohistochemistry was significantly higher in tissues from CY treated birds than those of PBS treated chickens at 3 weeks post-infection. This study showed that B cell specific immunosuppression with CY treatment in chickens resulted in increase in viremia and viral antigen load in tissues.","['Kim, Yongbaek', 'Brown, Thomas P', 'Pantin-Jackwood, Mary J']","['Kim Y', 'Brown TP', 'Pantin-Jackwood MJ']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA. kim16@niehs.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Vet Sci,Journal of veterinary science,100964185,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '163795-75-3 (SYBR Green I)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']","['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Body Weight/physiology', 'Bursa of Fabricius/immunology', '*Chickens', 'Concanavalin A/immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Diamines', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping/veterinary', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Organic Chemicals/chemistry', 'Poultry Diseases/immunology/*virology', 'Quinolines', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Random Allocation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Spleen/immunology/virology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Viremia/veterinary']",2004/03/19 05:00,2004/07/17 05:00,['2004/03/19 05:00'],"['2004/03/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['200403049 [pii]'],ppublish,J Vet Sci. 2004 Mar;5(1):49-58.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study determined whether caspase-independent apoptosis, using multiple and diverse endpoints, could be produced by toxicants other than cisplatin and in cell models other than RPTC. Cisplatin, staurosporine, vincristine, and A23187 induced RPTC apoptosis after 24 h as indicated by 2- to 2.5-fold increases in annexin V and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and 2- to 10-fold increases in cell shrinkage. All toxicants induced 8- to 50-fold increases in caspase-3 activities, which were completely inhibited by the pan caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk. However, ZVAD-fmk only decreased cisplatin- and staurosporine-induced annexin V staining and cell shrinkage 30 to 50%, staurosporine-induced TUNEL staining 30%, and did not affect vincristine- or A23187-induced RPTC apoptosis. All toxicants tested induced apoptotic RPTC nuclear morphology. However, similar to its effect on annexin V and TUNEL staining, ZVAD-fmk only partially inhibited toxicant-induced apoptotic nuclear morphology. Cisplatin and staurosporine also induced annexin V staining in the human epithelial cancer cell lines Caki-1 (kidney carcinoma), A549 (lung carcinoma), A172 (glioblastoma), and murine lymphocytic leukemia L1210 cells. Pretreatment with ZVAD-fmk inhibited cisplatin-induced annexin V staining in Caki-1, A172, and A549 cells but had no affect in L1210 cells. Pretreatment with ZVAD-fmk did not decrease staurosporine-induced annexin V staining in Caki-1, A549, L1210, and A172 cells.

Paradoxically, arsenic has also been used, amid at low doses, in the treatment of leukemia for over a century. Here we demonstrate that low to moderate concentrations of arsenite (2-10 microm) that has little or no effect on normal melanocytes may induce apoptosis of human melanomas including highly metastatic ones despite their low surface Fas levels. The two prerequisites that dictate apoptotic response of melanomas upon arsenite treatment are low nuclear NF-kappaB activity and an endogenous expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Under these conditions, melanoma cells acquired sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated killing.

Suppression of these pathways dramatically accelerates arsenite-induced apoptosis.

TdT is expressed only on immature lymphocytes and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells and its transcriptional expression is tightly regulated. We had previously found that protein kinase C (PKC) activation down-regulates TdT expression. PKC-activation induces the synthesis of the Fos and Jun proteins, known as the major components of activation protein 1 (AP-1) transcriptional factor implicated in transcriptional control. Here we report the identification of several DNA-protein interactions within the TdT promoter region in non-TdT expressing human cells. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a putative AP-1-like DNA-binding site, suggesting that AP-1 may play a relevant role in TdT transcriptional regulation. Using a different source of nuclear extracts and the AP-1-TdT motif as a probe we identified several DNA-protein retarded complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Super-band shifting analysis using an antibody against c-Jun protein confirmed that the main interaction is produced by a nuclear factor that belongs to the AP-1 family transcription factors. Our findings suggest that the TdT gene expression is down-regulated, at least in part, through AP-1-like transcription factors.","['Peralta-Zaragoza, Oscar', 'Recillas-Targa, Felix', 'Madrid-Marina, Vicente']","['Peralta-Zaragoza O', 'Recillas-Targa F', 'Madrid-Marina V']","['National Institute of Public Health, Division of Molecular Biology of Pathogens, Morelos, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']","['Blotting, Northern', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/*immunology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay/methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*immunology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/immunology', 'Protein Kinase C/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/03/19 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/03/19 05:00'],"['2004/03/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.0019-2805.2003.01791.x [doi]', 'IMM1791 [pii]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2004 Feb;111(2):195-203. doi: 10.1111/j.0019-2805.2003.01791.x.,IM,,PMC1782414,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since T cells, which mediate autoimmunity, can through recognition of self-antigens also target tumour cells, it was postulated that CD25+ regulatory cells would also inhibit the generation of immune responses to rumours. Depletion of these cells using CD25-specific monoclonal antibodies has indeed been shown to promote rejection of several transplantable murine tumour cell lines including melanoma, leukaemia and colorectal carcinoma. Results obtained using these models indicate that in the absence of regulatory cells, CD4+ T cells mediate tumour immunity, although the precise mechanisms through which these cells result in tumour rejection have not yet been elucidated. The target antigens recognized by these CD4+ T cells have also not yet been identified. Immunization of mice with tumour cells in the absence of CD25+ regulatory cells does, however, induce immunity against a variety of different tumour cell lines indicating that the target antigen(s) are shared amongst tumours of distinct histological origins.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is distinguished by the presence of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that results in a shortened chromosome 22, termed the Philadelphia(Ph) chromosome. As a result of the translocation, a fusion gene called the Bcr-Abl gene is created from two normal cellular genes, encoding a chimeric Bcr-Abl protein with a deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. The expression of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the transformed phenotype of CML cells. Imatinib can block the kinase activity of Bcr-Abl, thus inhibiting the proliferation of Ph-positive progenitors, and has shown activity against all phases of CML, though responses are most substantial and durable in patients in the chronic phase. An international phase III study which compared the efficacy of imatinib with that of interferon alpha combined with low-dose cytarabine in newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML showed the rate of major cytogenetic response at 24 months was 90%, including 82% of complete cytogenetic response. These results indicated that imatinib was superior to interferon-containing treatment as a first-line therapy.

Nitrotyrosine formation catalysed by peroxidase using hydrogen peroxide and nitrite was detected at a high level similar to that of mature eosinophils. However, no expression of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) was detected by RT-PCR or immunocytochemistry. In contrast, the induction of myeloperoxidase (MPO) by butyrate was clearly detected by RT-PCR, Northern blot, and immunocytochemical staining.

Previously, we reported that a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) retroviral vector containing a human stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha)-chimeric envelope protein (Env) (S3) acquired the ability to transduce human cells via CXCR4, the cognate receptor for SDF-1alpha, while retaining the ability to transduce mouse cells via mCAT1. METHODS: We constructed expression plasmids for derivatives of the S3 Env protein; S3-D84K containing an Asp-84-to-Lys (D84K) substitution, S3-H8R-D84K containing D84K and an additional His-8-to-Arg substitution, and S3-D84K-RY containing D84K and additional Gln-227-to-Arg plus Asp-243-to-Tyr substitutions which have been suggested to suppress the loss of function of His-8. Cellular expression, virion incorporation, and entry functions of these derivatives were investigated. RESULTS: All three derivatives were incorporated into virions. The S3-D84K vector lost its ecotropism, but could transduce CXCR4-expressing human and mouse cells at titers of 10(3) to 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The S3-H8R-D84K vector did not show transduction, although its Env protein could bind to CXCR4. The transduction titer of the S3-D84K-RY vector via CXCR4 was slightly lower than that of the S3-D84K vector. These results indicate that the His-8 residue of the S3-D84K Env protein is indispensable and may be fully functional in postbinding membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Insertion of a ligand at Pro-79 of the Moloney MLV Env protein has proved to be a valuable strategy for constructing direct targeting retroviral vectors, since it permits the formation of a redirected Env protein without ecotropism, and it does not disrupt the function of the essential His-8 residue.","['Katane, Masumi', 'Fujita, Rika', 'Takao, Eiko', 'Kubo, Yoshinao', 'Aoki, Yasunobu', 'Amanuma, Hiroshi']","['Katane M', 'Fujita R', 'Takao E', 'Kubo Y', 'Aoki Y', 'Amanuma H']","['Molecular Cell Science Laboratory, Discovery Research Institute, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)']","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histidine/genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virion/genetics/metabolism']",2004/03/18 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.487 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2004 Mar;6(3):260-7. doi: 10.1002/jgm.487.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

It can occur as a primary idiopathic disorder or in association with benign or malignant diseases, most notably mycosis fungoides. In addition, it also can be found incidentally on histology. We describe an unusual case of follicular mucinosis in a 19-year-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One month after bone marrow transplantation, he developed cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the palms and soles, which was followed 12 days later by the appearance of multiple erythematous follicular papules and plaques on his face, auricles, and postauricular area. Biopsy of follicular plaque revealed changes of follicular mucinosis without evidence of graft-versus-host disease or leukemia cutis. The follicular rash was associated with prominent peripheral eosinophilia. The rash and eosinophilia resolved after 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. In conclusion, we report a case of FM occurring as a transient reaction during the course of cutaneous GVHD following bone marrow transplantation for ALL.

In particular, the application of DNA micro-arrays to monitor expression profiles from tumor cells is improving cancer analysis to levels that classical methods have been unable to reach. However, molecular diagnostics based on expression profiling requires addressing computational issues as the overwhelming number of variables and the complex, multi-class nature of tumor samples. Thus, the objective of the present research has been the development of a computational procedure for feature extraction and classification of gene expression data. METHODS: The Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) approach has been implemented in a data mining scheme, which allows the identification of those genes that are most likely to confer robust and accurate classification of samples from multiple tumor types. RESULTS: The proposed method has been tested on two different microarray data sets, namely Golub's analysis of acute human leukemia and the small round blue cell tumors study presented by Khan et al.. The identified features represent a rational and dimensionally reduced base for understanding the biology of diseases, defining targets of therapeutic intervention, and developing diagnostic tools for classification of pathological states. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the SIMCA model residuals allows the identification of specific phenotype markers. At the same time, the class analogy approach provides the assignment to multiple classes, such as different pathological conditions or tissue samples, for previously unseen instances.","['Bicciato, S', 'Luchini, A', 'Di Bello, C']","['Bicciato S', 'Luchini A', 'Di Bello C']","['Department of Chemical Process Engineering, University of Padova, Via Marzolo, 9, 35131 Padova, Italy. silvio.bicciato@unipd.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Methods Inf Med,Methods of information in medicine,0210453,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']","['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*physiology', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/classification/physiology', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*classification', '*Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Phenotype', '*Principal Component Analysis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2004/03/18 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2004/03/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['04010004 [pii]'],ppublish,Methods Inf Med. 2004;43(1):4-8.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, skull radiographs still provide significant information that is helpful in finding pathologic conditions and appreciating their extents. Abnormalities in the skull may be reflected as variations in the density, size, and shape of the skull, as well as skull defects. Skeletal dysplasias may manifest as a generalized decrease in calvarial density (hypophosphatasia, osteogenesis imperfecta), a generalized increase in calvarial density (osteopetrosis), or a focal increase in density (frontometaphyseal dysplasia). Diffusely decreased or increased calvarial density is usually associated with a process that affects the entire skeleton. Therefore, correct differentiation among these dysplasias depends on other concurrent features. Decreased size of the cranial vault at birth generally implies an underlying insult to the brain, including fetal alcohol syndrome and the so-called TORCH infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, herpes simplex).

We reported previously that retinoic acid (RA) is a potent and selective inducer of the cell-surface antigen CD38 in myeloid leukemia cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the RA-induced CD38 antigen could be a target for an anti-CD38-based immunotoxin to induce selective killing of leukemia cells. The combination of RA and the anti-CD38 gelonin immunotoxin induced a synergistic killing of leukemia cells. Thus, coculture of myeloid leukemia cells and cell lines with as little as 1 nM RA in the presence of immunotoxin induced substantial killing (>90%) of leukemia cell clones. More importantly, the blasts of myeloid leukemia patients, irrespective of their morphological and phenotypic features, also responded to the RA and immunotoxin combination when cultured ex vivo. A similar synergistic effect between RA and immunotoxin was observed against a multidrug-resistant variant subline of HL-60 cells. However, another variant of HL-60 cells, HL-60R, in which the retinoid receptor function has been abrogated by a trans-dominant-negative mutation, exhibited complete resistance to the immunotoxin-induced killing effect in the presence or absence of RA. Our results suggest that RA combined with anti-CD38-based therapeutic agent may offer exciting opportunities for the treatment of myeloid leukemias despite their multiplicity of genetic and clinical varieties.","['Mehta, Kapil', 'Ocanas, Larry', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Marks, John W', 'Rosenblum, Michael G']","['Mehta K', 'Ocanas L', 'Malavasi F', 'Marks JW', 'Rosenblum MG']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. kmehta@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']","['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*biosynthesis/therapeutic use', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Immunotoxins/chemistry/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mutation', 'Plant Proteins/chemistry', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2004/03/18 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2004 Mar;3(3):345-52.,IM,,,,,['R01-CA92115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated EBV entry into NK cells using a recombinant EBV, which contains enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene in its genome (EGFP-EBV). After 48 h of exposure to EGFP-EBV, we detected EGFP signals in approximately 30% of NK-92 and NKL cells and >40% of peripheral blood NK cells from three healthy volunteers. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of various EBV-associated genes confirmed EBV infection. In situ hybridization for EBERs and BHLFs showed that latent and lytic infections coexisted at the early phase of EBV infection in two NK cell lines. Although BHLF-positive cells in the early lytic phase were round-shaped, EBER-positive cells in latent EBV infection tended to show a bizarre shape. Flow cytometric analysis of EGFP-EBV-exposed NK cell lines showed that most of EBV-infected cells entered early apoptosis after 72 h of EBV exposure, which explains the difficulties to establish EBV-carrying NK clones. Flow cytometry and reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that two NK cell lines may fuse with EBV using HLA class II after binding to the virus through a distinct molecule from CD21. We established two EBV-carrying NKL clones showing latency types I and II, both of which are recognized in EBV-associated NK cell neoplasms. Because EBV-infected NKL cells showed only type I latency during the early phase of infection, the temporal profile of latent gene expression is similar to that of T cells.

The exposure of Jurkat human T-cell leukemia cells to BITC resulted in the inhibition of the G(2)-M progression that coincided with the apoptosis induction. The experiment using the phase-specific synchronized cells demonstrated that the G(2)-M phase-arrested cells are more sensitive to undergoing apoptotic stimulation by BITC than the cells in other phases. We also confirmed that BITC activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase, at the concentration required for apoptosis induction. An experiment using a JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 or a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 indicated that BITC-induced apoptosis might be regulated by the activation of these two kinases. Conversely, BITC is likely to confine the Jurkat cells in the G(2)-M phase mainly through the p38 MAPK pathway because only the p38 MAPK inhibitor significantly attenuated the accumulation of inactive phosphorylated Cdc2 protein and the G(2)-M-arrested cell numbers. We reported here for the first time that the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein was phosphorylated by the BITC treatment without significant alteration of the Bcl-2 total protein amount. This was abrogated by a JNK specific inhibitor SP600125 at the concentration required for specific inhibition of the c-Jun phosphorylation. Moreover, the spontaneous phosphorylation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 in the G(2)-M synchronized cells was enhanced synergistically by the BITC treatment. Involvement of the MAPK activation in the Bcl-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis induction also was observed in HL-60 and HeLa cells. Thus, we identified the phosphorylated Bcl-2 as a key molecule linking the p38 MAPK-dependent cell cycle arrest with the JNK activation by BITC.","['Miyoshi, Noriyuki', 'Uchida, Koji', 'Osawa, Toshihiko', 'Nakamura, Yoshimasa']","['Miyoshi N', 'Uchida K', 'Osawa T', 'Nakamura Y']","['Laboratory of Food and Biodynamics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '871J6YOR8Q (benzyl isothiocyanate)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']","['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2004/03/18 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2004/03/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2296 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Mar 15;64(6):2134-42. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2296.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To additionally investigate the efficacy of the human IgG1 with enhanced ADCC, we generated the defucosylated chimeric anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) IgG1 antibody KM2760. KM2760 exhibited much higher ADCC using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as effector cells compared with the highly fucosylated, but otherwise identical IgG1, KM3060. In addition, KM2760 also exhibited potent ADCC in the presence of lower concentrations of human PBMCs than KM3060. Because CCR4 is a selective marker of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, the effectiveness of KM2760 for T-cell malignancy was evaluated in several mouse models. First, to compare the antitumor activity of KM2760 and KM3060, we constructed a human PBMC-engrafted mouse model to determine ADCC efficacy with human effector cells. In this model, KM2760 showed significantly higher antitumor efficacy than KM3060, indicating that KM2760 retains its high potency in vivo. Second, KM2760 suppressed tumor growth in both syngeneic and xenograft mouse models in which human PBMCs were not engrafted. Although murine effector cells exhibited marginal ADCC mediated by KM2760 and KM3060, KM2760 unexpectedly showed higher efficacy than KM3060 in a syngeneic mouse model, suggesting that KM2760 functions in murine effector system in vivo via an unknown mechanism that differs from that in human. These results indicate that defucosylated antibodies with enhanced ADCC as well as potent antitumor activity in vivo are promising candidates for the novel antibody-based therapy.","['Niwa, Rinpei', 'Shoji-Hosaka, Emi', 'Sakurada, Mikiko', 'Shinkawa, Toyohide', 'Uchida, Kazuhisa', 'Nakamura, Kazuyasu', 'Matsushima, Kouji', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Hanai, Nobuo', 'Shitara, Kenya']","['Niwa R', 'Shoji-Hosaka E', 'Sakurada M', 'Shinkawa T', 'Uchida K', 'Nakamura K', 'Matsushima K', 'Ueda R', 'Hanai N', 'Shitara K']","['Tokyo Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive disease characterized by visceral invasion. We show that ATL and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy patients exhibit high plasma levels of functional vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The viral oncoprotein Tax transactivates the promoter of the gap-junction protein connexin-43 and enhances gap-junction-mediated heterocellular communication with endothelial cells. The interaction of HTLV-I-transformed cells with endothelial cells induces the gelatinase activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 in endothelial cells and down-regulates the tissue inhibitor of MMP. This leads to subendothelial basement membrane degradation followed by endothelial cell retraction, allowing neoplastic lymphocyte extravasation. We propose a model that offers a mechanistic explanation for extravasation of HTLV-I-infected cells: after specific adhesion to endothelia of target organs, tumor cells induce a local and transient angiogenesis-like mechanism through paracrine stimulation and direct cell-cell communication with endothelial cells. This culminates in a breach of the endothelial barrier function, allowing cancer cell invasion. This local and transient angiogenesis-like sequence that may facilitate visceral invasion in ATL represents a potential target for ATL therapy.","['Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Abou Merhi, Raghida', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Talhouk, Rabih', 'El-Khoury, Hilda', 'Nasr, Rihab', 'Gout, Olivier', 'Sulahian, Rita', 'Homaidan, Fadia', 'de The, Hugues', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'El-Sabban, Marwan E']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Abou Merhi R', 'Gessain A', 'Talhouk R', 'El-Khoury H', 'Nasr R', 'Gout O', 'Sulahian R', 'Homaidan F', 'de The H', 'Hermine O', 'El-Sabban ME']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, PO Box 113-6044, Beirut, Lebanon. bazarbac@aub.edu.lb']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Connexin 43)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']","['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Connexin 43/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2004/03/18 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2004/03/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2390 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Mar 15;64(6):2039-46. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2390.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that loss of heterozygosity, homozygous deletions, and abnormal expression of the FHIT gene are involved in several types of human malignancies. A CpG island is present in the 5' promoter region of the FHIT gene, and methylation in this region correlates with loss of FHIT expression. To test whether aberrant methylation of the FHIT gene may play a role in pediatric leukemia, we assessed the FHIT methylation status of 10 leukemia cell lines and 190 incident population-based cases of childhood acute lymphocytic and myeloid leukemias using methylation-specific PCR. Conventional and fluorescence in situ hybridization cytogenetic data were also collected to examine aneuploidy, t(12, 21), and other chromosomal rearrangements. Four of 10 leukemia cell lines (40%) and 52 of 190 (27.4%) bone marrows from childhood leukemia patients demonstrated hypermethylation of the promoter region of FHIT. Gene expression analyses and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment showed that promoter hypermethylation correlated with FHIT inactivation. Among primary leukemias, hypermethylation of FHIT was strongly correlated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) histology (P = 0.008), high hyperdiploid (P < 0.0001), and translocation-negative (P < 0.0001) categories. Hyperdiploid B-cell ALLs were 23-fold more likely to be FHIT methylated compared with B-cell ALL harboring TEL-AML translocations. FHIT methylation was associated with high WBC counts at diagnosis, a known prognostic indicator. These results suggest that hypermethylation of the promoter region CpG island of the FHIT gene is a common event and may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of specific cytogenetic subtypes of childhood ALL.","['Zheng, Shichun', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Gunn, Laura', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Leung, Kenneth', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Wiencke, John K']","['Zheng S', 'Ma X', 'Zhang L', 'Gunn L', 'Smith MT', 'Wiemels JL', 'Leung K', 'Buffler PA', 'Wiencke JK']","['Laboratory for Molecular Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143-0560, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']","['*Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Decitabine', '*Diploidy', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/03/18 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2004/03/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2387 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Mar 15;64(6):2000-6. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2387.,IM,,,,,"['P42 ES 04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES 009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES 06717/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human recombinant IGFBP-3 induced growth arrest and apoptosis of HL-60 and NB4 cells. We have previously identified RXR alpha as a nuclear receptor for IGFBP-3 and have proceeded to examine further the role of this interaction in leukemia cell lines. In signaling assays, IGFBP-3 potently suppressed RAR- and VDR-mediated signaling while enhancing RXR signaling. Interestingly, when IGFBP-3 was administered to these cells in combination with an RAR-selective ligand, the ability of these retinoids to induce differentiation was blunted. On the other hand, IGFBP-3 enhanced the effect of an RXR-selective ligand to induce differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 cells. Further studies showed that IGFBP-3 down-regulated (at the transcriptional level) the retinoid-induced expression of C/EBP epsilon in NB4 cells.

We developed a quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1) transcripts, and applied it to clinical samples. METHOD: MDR1 transcripts were amplified using the NASBA technique combined with sandwich hybridization of amplified MDR1 mRNA followed by chemiluminescence detection on an automated analyzer. Quantification of MDR1 mRNA was achieved through competitive coamplification of in vitro-generated RNA, which acts as an internal control. RESULTS: The competitive NASBA assay exhibited higher sensitivity (reliable detection limit was 100 copies of MDR1 mRNA) and linearity over a broader dynamic range (7 logarithmic orders) than the competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. All 33 clinical samples obtained from patients with leukemia were successfully assayed, demonstrating its feasibility. MDR1 expression-compensated with beta-actin expression-ranged from 1.4 x 10(2) to 2.5 x 10(6) (median 4.8 x 10(5)) copies/microg RNA, while the range of MDR1 expression in peripheral blood samples from 15 healthy adults was from 8.9 x 10(4) to 5.2 x 10(5) (median 2.2 x 10(5)) copies/microg RNA. MDR1 expression in 8 of 33 clinical samples exceeded the median of healthy adult samples. CONCLUSIONS: The competitive NASBA assay is applicable to MDR1 mRNA quantification in clinical samples and would contribute to detection of clinical multidrug resistance.","['Hayashi, Tsukasa', 'Kobayashi, Hiroyuki', 'Miyachi, Hayato', 'Ohshima, Toshio', 'Ujiiye, Takeshi', 'Kawase, Masako', 'Hotta, Tomomitsu', 'Takemura, Yuzuru']","['Hayashi T', 'Kobayashi H', 'Miyachi H', 'Ohshima T', 'Ujiiye T', 'Kawase M', 'Hotta T', 'Takemura Y']","['KAINOS Laboratories Inc., 2-38-18 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Actins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Transferrin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Self-Sustained Sequence Replication/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/03/18 05:00,2005/01/12 09:00,['2004/03/18 05:00'],"['2003/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2003/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cccn.2003.12.013 [doi]', 'S0009898103006016 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2004 Apr;342(1-2):115-26. doi: 10.1016/j.cccn.2003.12.013.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the adrenal, macrophages, and lymphocytes, physiologically widely infiltrating the adrenal cortex, and adrenocortical, and chromaffin cells produce cytokines, as IL-1, IL-6, TNFalpha, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and IL-18 which have a key role in the immune-adreno-cortical communication. In addition to cytokines interacting with adrenal function, cytokine independent mechanisms are responsible for a cell to cell-mediated immune regulation of the adrenal. The importance of this immune-endocrine cross-talk becomes evident in the case of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases being necessary for an adequate adrenal stress response. Secretory products of macrophages are involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis, Sertoli cell activity, and germ cell survival in the human testes. In rats, IL-1 is involved in the paracrine regulation of Leydig cell steroidogenesis. IL-6 has been suggested to exert adverse effects on the male reproductive function, inducing persistent testicular resistance to luteinizing hormone (LH) action and/or suppression of Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Cytokines such as IL-8 and MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1) are involved in follicular development and atresia, ovulation, steroidogenesis, and corpus luteum function.

The hallmark of CML is a genetic translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome), which creates the abnormal bcr-abl gene and a continuously activated Bcr-Abl protein. Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity leads to signal transduction and cell growth. Traditional therapies for CML include allogeneic stem cell transplantation, interferon alfa, and oral chemotherapeutic agents. However, because Bcr-Abl is the causative abnormality in CML, it represents an ideal target for rational biologic therapy. Imatinib mesylate is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically blocks Bcr-Abl function. Clinical trials have demonstrated that imatinib mesylate produces rapid responses in patients with all stages of CML, including those who were resistant to interferon alfa therapy or intolerant of it. When imatinib mesylate therapy was initiated early in the course of CML, there was a complete hematologic response in 98% of the patients and a complete cytogenetic response in 72% of the patients. Although long-term safety and survival data are not yet available, imatinib mesylate is a promising new treatment option for CML that targets the molecular cause of the disease.","['Duffy, Kathleen M']",['Duffy KM'],"['University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pa, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/physiopathology/therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2004/03/18 05:00,2004/04/01 05:00,['2004/03/18 05:00'],"['2004/03/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002820-200312001-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2003 Dec;26(6 Suppl):26S-31S. doi: 10.1097/00002820-200312001-00007.,IM,,,,,,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data have indicated that in pediatric leukemia the majority, but not all, of the chromosome translocations arise, in utero, during fetal hemopoiesis, probably as initiating events. In most cases, functionally complementary and secondary genetic events are also required. These are acquired rapidly, and possibly in utero also, in infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but post-natally for most childhood ALL and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). An important consequence of the latter is a very variable and occasionally protracted post-natal latency (1-15 years). Another important corollary is that functional chromosomal translocations and pre-leukemic clones arise at a substantially higher frequency (approximately 100x) before birth than the cumulative incidence or risk of disease.

Two case reports are introduced. CLASSIFICATION: According to the new WHO classification of 2000, mastocytoses are separated into cutaneous and systemic mastocytoses. Systemic mastocytosis is subdivided into an indolent course with good prognosis and four subgroups with poor prognosis (systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal hematologic non-mast-cell disease, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, mast cell leukemia, and mast cell sarcoma). GENETICS: Systemic mastocytoses are clonal disorders of mast cells and their progenitor cells, which may show point mutations of the protooncogene c-kit. This gene codes for the stem cell receptor (CD117). THERAPY: Therapy of systemic mastocytosis depends on patient's symptoms. There is no known cure of the disease. Besides diet and avoidance of skin irritations, symptoms are treated with H(1)- or H(2)-blockers, steroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and PUVA therapy. If patients suffer from systemic reactions such as hypotension or syncope, epinephrine solution should be prescribed for emergency use.","['Kraemer, Doris M', 'Grunewald, Susanne M', 'Kolb-Maurer, Annette']","['Kraemer DM', 'Grunewald SM', 'Kolb-Maurer A']","['Medizinische Poliklinik der Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg. kraemer_d@klinik.uniwuerzburg.de']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', '0 (Histamine H2 Antagonists)', '661FH77Z3P (Dimethindene)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']","['Adult', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dimethindene/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Epinephrine/administration & dosage', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists/administration & dosage', 'Histamine H2 Antagonists/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/classification/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Skin/pathology']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2003/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00063-004-1021-x [doi]'],ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2004 Mar 15;99(3):131-6. doi: 10.1007/s00063-004-1021-x.,IM,"Systemische Mastozytose.

METHODS: We reviewed the literature describing the characteristic features of LSCs in various leukemias and the novel molecular approaches being used to specifically ablate the LSC population. RESULTS: Studies have demonstrated the potential importance of ablating LSCs when treating leukemia. The unique characteristics of LSCs that differentiate them from their normal counterparts can be exploited to specifically target the malignant population.

Telomerase is the enzyme complex that maintains telomere integrity. Hematopoietic stem cells express telomerase and contain long telomeres, which become shorter as cells differentiate and mature. The extent of telomere shortening and the level of telomerase activity often correlate with the presence and severity of some hematopoietic diseases. METHODS: The fundamentals of telomeres and telomerase are reviewed, and the telomere biology of human hematopoietic cells is discussed. RESULTS: Telomere length and telomerase activity are important in the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. Changes within these compartments affect both normal hematopoietic cells and the generation of hematopoietic disease. Telomere length provides information pertaining to the proliferative history and potential of a hematopoietic cell.

Several lines of evidence suggest similar pathogenetic mechanisms for these fusion proteins. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify shared target genes in inducibly transfected U937 cells expressing AML1-ETO, PML-RARalpha, or PLZF-RARalpha. All three fusion proteins significantly repressed the expression of 38 genes and induced the expression of 14 genes. Several of the regulated genes were associated with Wnt signaling. One of these, plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), was induced on the mRNA and protein level by all three fusion proteins. In addition, primary AML blasts carrying one of the fusion proteins significantly overexpressed plakoglobin. The plakoglobin promoter was cloned and shown to be induced by AML1-ETO, with promoter activation depending on the corepressor and histone deacetylase binding domains. The induction of plakoglobin by AML fusion proteins led to downstream signaling and transactivation of TCF- and LEF-dependent promoters, including the c-myc promoter, which was found to be bound by plakoglobin in vivo after AML1-ETO expression. beta-Catenin protein levels and TCF and LEF target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 were found to be induced by the fusion proteins. On the functional level, a dominant negative TCF inhibited colony growth of AML1-ETO-positive Kasumi cells, whereas plakoglobin transfection into myeloid 32D cells enhanced proliferation and clonal growth.

Inactivating mutations in Ikaros cause antigen-mediated lymphocyte hyperproliferation and the rapid development of leukemia and lymphoma. Here we show that Ikaros's ability to negatively regulate the G(1)-S transition can be modulated by phosphorylation of a serine/threonine-rich conserved region (p1) in exon 8. Ikaros phosphorylation in p1 is induced during the G(1)-S transition. Mutations that prevent phosphorylation in p1 increase Ikaros's ability to impede cell cycle progression and its affinity for DNA. Casein kinase II, whose increased activity in lymphocytes leads to transformation, is a key player in Ikaros p1 phosphorylation. We thus propose that Ikaros's activity as a regulator of the G(1)-S transition is controlled by phosphorylation in response to signaling events that down-modulate its DNA binding activity.","['Gomez-del Arco, Pablo', 'Maki, Kazushige', 'Georgopoulos, Katia']","['Gomez-del Arco P', 'Maki K', 'Georgopoulos K']","['Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Cell Line', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'S Phase/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/05/11 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.24.7.2797-2807.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Apr;24(7):2797-807. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.7.2797-2807.2004.,IM,,PMC371126,,,"['R01 AI038342/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI380342/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recently reported clinical studies in colorectal cancer have shown that bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, in combination with cytotoxic therapy has positive effects on patient survival. Furthermore, the VEGF receptor kinase (VEGF-R) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vatalanib, has also shown encouraging results in colorectal cancer, with molecular resonance imaging providing evidence that the anti-tumor efficacy was indeed the result of anti-angiogenic activity. Both of these agents are progressing in phase III trials. This proof of concept has stimulated the desire for second-generation VEGF-R inhibitors having an improved profile. Structural biology insight regarding the binding mode of protein kinase inhibitors is valuable for the design of molecules possessing superior selectivity, efficacy and tolerability. Towards this goal, we have developed a new series of VEGF-R2 kinase inhibitors, based upon an anthranilic acid amide scaffold. An X-ray crystal structure of a representative compound, AAL993 (ZK260253), in complex with the catalytic domain of diphosphorylated VEGF-R2 has revealed that this molecule binds to an inactive conformation of the protein. This binding mode, similar to that observed for the anti-leukemia drug, imatinib in complex with c-Abl kinase, may be responsible for the high selectivity of AAL993 and provides valuable insight for the design of further compounds.","['Manley, Paul William', 'Bold, Guido', 'Bruggen, Josef', 'Fendrich, Gabrielle', 'Furet, Pascal', 'Mestan, Jurgen', 'Schnell, Christian', 'Stolz, Barbara', 'Meyer, Thomas', 'Meyhack, Bernd', 'Stark, Wilhelm', 'Strauss, Andre', 'Wood, Jeanette']","['Manley PW', 'Bold G', 'Bruggen J', 'Fendrich G', 'Furet P', 'Mestan J', 'Schnell C', 'Stolz B', 'Meyer T', 'Meyhack B', 'Stark W', 'Strauss A', 'Wood J']","['Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, WKL-136-4-86, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland. paul.manley@pharma.norvartis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']","['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/05/07 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2003/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bbapap.2003.11.010 [doi]', 'S1570963903003625 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2004 Mar 11;1697(1-2):17-27. doi: 10.1016/j.bbapap.2003.11.010.,IM,,,,,,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is considered that the accumulation of neoplastically transformed lymphocytes B (CLL cells) is primarily the consequence of the disturbance, i.e., blockade of these cells' apoptosis process. Apoptosis is the specific process of programmed cell death regulated by numerous extracellular and intracellular mechanisms. The Bcl-2 proteins are well-known modulators of this process. Some of these proteins (such as Bcl-2, and Bcl-XI) are anti-apoptotic, while others (such as Bad or Bax) are pro-apoptotic. Our study included the analysis of 20 peripheral blood specimens from 20 patients with CLL, and 20 peripheral blood specimens of healthy persons who represented the control group. Using Western blotting analysis, we quantitatively examined the protein expression of Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, and Bcl-XI). The level of Bcl-2 (p = 3.68 x 10(-10)), Bax (p = 0.019), and Bad (p = 0.073) proteins expression was significantly increased in all the analyzed peripheral blood samples of patients, while the level of Bcl-XI protein (p = 0.75) did not significantly differ in peripheral blood samples of patients, compared to the controls. The results of this study showed that the increased level of expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bad protein represented the most striking feature of CLL cells. Moreover, the variations in the expression of only one protein of the Bcl-2 family could not represent the prognostic parameter in the treatment of this disease.","['Brajuskovic, Goran', 'Vukosavic, Slobodanka', 'Dimitrijevic, Jovan', 'Cerovic, Snezana', 'Usaj, Slavica Knezevic', 'Marjanovic, Slobodan', 'Romac, Stanka', 'Milic, Andelija Skaro']","['Brajuskovic G', 'Vukosavic S', 'Dimitrijevic J', 'Cerovic S', 'Usaj SK', 'Marjanovic S', 'Romac S', 'Milic AS']","['Vojnomedicinska akademija, ZPSM-Institut za patologiju, Beograd. brajuskovic@hotmail.com']",['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']","['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/vsp0401041b [doi]'],ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2004 Jan-Feb;61(1):41-6. doi: 10.2298/vsp0401041b.,IM,Ekspresija Bcl-2 familije proteina u limfocitima B periferne krvi bolesnika sa hronicnom limfocitnom leukemijom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the current study was to determine the prevalence of hyperglycemia during induction chemotherapy for ALL using a regimen comprised of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (Hyper-CVAD) and to determine its effect on survival, duration of disease remission, and treatment-related complications. METHODS: Two hundred seventy-eight adult patients with previously untreated ALL who achieved a complete remission with the hyper-CVAD regimen were evaluated. Hyperglycemia was defined as > or = 2 glucose determinations of > or = 200 mg/dL during the first 30 days of induction chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy was comprised of fractionated cyclophosphamide at a dose of 300 mg/m2 twice daily on Days 1-3, doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 on Day 4, vincristine at a dose of 2 mg on Days 4 and 11, and dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg on Days 1-4 and Days 11-14 (hyper-CVAD). Hyper-CVAD, given in odd-number courses (Courses 1, 3, 5, and 7), was alternated with methotrexate and cytarabine (MTX/Ara-C), given in even-number courses (Courses 2, 4, 6, and 8). MTX/Ara-C was comprised of MTX at a dose of 200 mg/m2 over 2 hours followed by 800 mg/m2 over 22 hours on Day 1, Ara-C at a dose of 3 g/m2 every 12 hours for 4 doses over 2 days (Days 2 and 3), and intravenous methylprednisolone given at a dose of 50 mg twice daily on Days 1-3. The complete remission duration (CRD), survival, and treatment-related complications were determined for patients with and without hyperglycemia; differences between the two groups were assessed using standard statistical methods. RESULTS: Hyperglycemia was found to occur in 103 patients (37%). Patients with hyperglycemia had a shorter median CRD (24 months vs. 52 months; P = 0.001) and a shorter median survival (29 months vs. 88 months; P < 0.001); they also were more likely to develop sepsis (16.5% vs. 8.0%; P = 0.03) or any complicated infection (sepsis, pneumonia, or fungal) (38.8% vs. 25.1%; P = 0.016) compared with patients without hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hyperglycemia during induction chemotherapy for ALL with the hyper-CVAD regimen were found to have a shorter CRD, experience a significant increase in overall mortality, and be at an increased risk for developing complicated infections.","['Weiser, Mary Ann', 'Cabanillas, Maria E', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Pierce, Sherry A', 'Escalante, Carmen P', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', ""O'Brien, Susan M""]","['Weiser MA', 'Cabanillas ME', 'Konopleva M', 'Thomas DA', 'Pierce SA', 'Escalante CP', 'Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien SM""]","['Department of General Internal Medicine, Ambulatory Treatment and Emergency Care, The University of Texas M.

B-cell precursor neoplasms are considered to be somatically premutational. However, the variable frequency of SM of the variable region (VH) genes has been described in cases of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PB-ALL). To better characterize PB-ALL based on the differentiation stage, we investigated the SM of the VH genes expressed by tumor cells of the surface immunoglobulin (sIg)(-) HBL-3 cell line derived from childhood PB-ALL. In the HBL-3 cell line, the rearranged Ig heavy chain VH gene sequence showed no SM in the complementarity-determining regions of 1, 2, and 3, or in the framework regions of 1, 2, and 3 relative to the putative germline VH gene sequences. In addition, the VH segment of HBL-3 cells showed no intraclonal sequence heterogeneity, indicating ongoing SM. Our data demonstrated that HBL-3 cells express unmutated and developmentally regulated rearrangement of VH genes at the stage of B-cell precursor cells. HBL-3 cells, which are derived only from the sIg(-) PB-ALL, showed that SM cannot be recognized in VH genes of tumor cells before the expression of sIg.","['Hojo, Hiroshi', 'Sasaki, Yoshikazu', 'Nakamura, Naoya', 'Sato, Michiko', 'Abe, Masafumi']","['Hojo H', 'Sasaki Y', 'Nakamura N', 'Sato M', 'Abe M']","['First Department of Pathology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, 1 Hikariga-oka, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan. hirohojo@fmu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']","['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2003/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10024-003-8085-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2004 May-Jun;7(3):250-7. doi: 10.1007/s10024-003-8085-0.

They are catabolized by the cytosolic thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which is subject to a genetic polymorphism. In children, enzyme activities are immature at birth and developmental patterns vary widely from one enzyme to another. The present study was undertaken to evaluate erythrocyte TPMT activity and the correlation between genotype and phenotype in different age groups from birth to adolescence and adulthood. METHODS: The study included 304 healthy adult blood donors, 147 children and 18 neonates (cord bloods). TPMT activity was measured by liquid chromatography, and genotype was determined using a polymerase chain reaction reverse dot-blot analysis identifying the predominant TPMT mutant alleles (TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B, TPMT*3C, TPMT*2). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in TPMT activity between cord bloods ( n=18) and children ( n=147) (17.48+/-4.04 versus 18.62+/-4.14 respectively, P=0.424). However, TPMT was significantly lower in children than in adults (19.34+/-4.09) ( P=0.033). In the whole population, there were 91.9% homozygous wild type, 7.9% heterozygous mutants and 0.2% homozygous mutants. The frequency of mutant alleles was 3.0% for TPMT*3A, 0.7% for TPMT*2 and 0.4% for TPMT*3C. CONCLUSION: No impact of child development on TPMT activity could be evidenced, suggesting that TPMT activity is already mature at birth. The difference between children and adults was low with reduced clinical impact expected. When individual TPMT activity was compared with genotype, there was an overlapping region where subjects (4.5%, 12 adults, 9 children) were either homozygous wild type or heterozygous, with a TPMT activity below the antimode value. This result highlighted the importance of measuring TPMT activity to detect all patients at risk of thiopurine toxicity.","['Ganiere-Monteil, Catherine', 'Medard, Yves', 'Lejus, Corinne', 'Bruneau, Beatrice', 'Pineau, Alain', 'Fenneteau, Odile', 'Bourin, Michel', 'Jacqz-Aigrain, Evelyne']","['Ganiere-Monteil C', 'Medard Y', 'Lejus C', 'Bruneau B', 'Pineau A', 'Fenneteau O', 'Bourin M', 'Jacqz-Aigrain E']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie, Hotel-Dieu, 9 Quai Moncousu, 44093 Nantes cedex 1, France. catherine.ganiere@chu-nantes.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*blood/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Whites/*genetics']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/09/30 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2003/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00228-004-0732-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2004 Apr;60(2):89-96. doi: 10.1007/s00228-004-0732-5.

Recently, the role of oncogenic K-ras in leukemogenesis was investigated in a novel mouse model utilizing interferon (IFN)-inducible, Cre-mediated expression of oncogenic K-ras from its endogenous promoter. Conditional expression of oncogenic K-ras from its endogenous promoter in the hematopoietic system induces a lethal myeloproliferative disease in mice, but not AML, indicating that additional mutations are required for AML development. These results are consistent with a model in which the AML phenotype requires at least two cooperating mutations in the hematopoietic progenitor cells: one promoting proliferation and enhanced cell survival (such as oncogenic ras or a constitutively activated receptor tyrosine kinase) and one associated with impaired differentiation and enhanced immortalization (such as loss-of-function mutations in hematopoietic transcription factors). The model system with oncogenic K-ras provides a versatile platform to test the contribution of cooperating mutations in AML, and the efficacy of Ras pathway inhibitors in vivo.","['Chan, Iris T', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Chan IT', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. iris_chan@dfci.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,['EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)'],"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['827 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.3.5.828 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2004 May;3(5):536-7. doi: 10.4161/cc.3.5.828.

METHODS: The trends and patterns of childhood cancer survival during 20 years were investigated using the Osaka Cancer Registry's data. The study subjects were 3443 reported cases diagnosed as having the first primary cancer between 1975 and 1994 at the ages of 0-14 years and who lived in Osaka Prefecture, excluding Osaka City. All childhood cancers were classified into 12 diagnostic groups according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer based on the histology of the cancer. The 5 year relative survival was calculated by the Ederer II method. RESULTS: The 5-year relative survival was 58% for all cancers. The survivals of retinoblastoma and kidney tumor patients were as high as 89 and 72%, respectively, whereas those of leukemia and liver tumor patients were as low as 45 and 47%, respectively. When divided into the first and second half-periods, the survival for all cancers was markedly improved from 48 to 68%. The survivals, especially for patients with leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoma and gonadal or embryonal tumors, were enhanced by >20% between the first and second half-periods. When these results were compared with those reported in England and Wales and the USA, however, the survivals for many diagnostic groups in Osaka were lower, except that for neuroblastoma.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) for 48 adults younger than 60 years with inv(16)/t(16;16) who had attained a complete remission on one of four consecutive clinical trials and were assigned to receive HDAC consolidation therapy. Twenty-eight patients were assigned to either three or four courses of HDAC, and 20 patients were assigned to one course of HDAC followed by alternative intensive consolidation therapy. RESULTS: Pretreatment features were similar for the two groups. The CIR was significantly decreased in patients assigned to receive three to four cycles of HDAC compared with patients assigned to one course (P=.03; 5-year CIR, 43% v 70%, respectively). The difference in RFS also approached statistical significance (P=.06). In a multivariable analysis that adjusted for potential confounding covariates, only treatment assignment (three to four cycles of HDAC) predicted for superior RFS (P=.02). The OS of both groups was similar (P=.93; 5-year OS, 75% for the three to four cycles of HDAC group v 70% for the one cycle of HDAC group), reflecting a high success rate with stem-cell transplantation salvage treatment administered among patients in both treatment groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, in AML patients with inv(16)/t(16;16), repetitive HDAC therapy decreases the likelihood of relapse compared with consolidation regimens including less HDAC.","['Byrd, John C', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Edwards, Colin G', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Stamberg, Judith', 'Koduru, Prasad R K', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Davey, Frederick R', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Byrd JC', 'Ruppert AS', 'Mrozek K', 'Carroll AJ', 'Edwards CG', 'Arthur DC', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Stamberg J', 'Koduru PR', 'Moore JO', 'Mayer RJ', 'Davey FR', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, B302A Starling Loving Hall, 320 W 10th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210-1240, USA. byrd-3@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']","['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'United States']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.07.012 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.07.012 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Mar 15;22(6):1087-94. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.07.012.,IM,,,,,"['CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase III randomized study was performed using valspodar plus mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (PSC-MEC; n=66) versus MEC (n=63) to treat patients with relapsed or refractory AML and high-risk MDS. RESULTS: For the PSC-MEC versus MEC arms, complete response (CR) was achieved in 17% versus 25% of patients, respectively (P=not significant). For patients who had not received prior intensive chemotherapy (ie, with secondary AML or high-risk MDS), the CR rate was increased--35% versus 15% for the remaining patients (P=.018); CR rates did not differ between treatment arms. The median disease-free survival in those achieving CR was similar in the two arms (10 versus 9.3 months) as was the patients' overall survival (4.6 versus 5.4 months). The CR rates in MDR+ (69% of patients) versus MDR- patients were similar for those receiving either chemotherapy regimen (16% versus 24%). The CR rate for unfavorable cytogenetic patients (45% of patients) was 13% compared to the remainder, 28% (P=.09). Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the clearances of mitoxantrone and etoposide were decreased by 59% and 50%, respectively, supporting the empiric dose reductions in the PSC-MEC arm designed in anticipation of drug interactions between valspodar and the chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: CR rates and overall survival were not improved by using PSC-MEC compared to MEC chemotherapy alone in patients with poor-risk AML or high-risk MDS.","['Greenberg, Peter L', 'Lee, Sandra J', 'Advani, Ranjana', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Sikic, Branimir I', 'Letendre, Louis', 'Dugan, Kathleen', 'Lum, Bert', 'Chin, David L', 'Dewald, Gordon', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Bennett, John M', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Greenberg PL', 'Lee SJ', 'Advani R', 'Tallman MS', 'Sikic BI', 'Letendre L', 'Dugan K', 'Lum B', 'Chin DL', 'Dewald G', 'Paietta E', 'Bennett JM', 'Rowe JM']","['Hematology Division, Stanford University Medical Center, 703 Welch Rd, Suite G-1, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. peterg@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.07.048 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.07.048 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Mar 15;22(6):1078-86. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.07.048.,IM,,PMC5457168,['NIHMS857505'],,"['R01 CA092474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA013650/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13650/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA017145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA066636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR 00070/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA023318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 52168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA011083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR000070/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2004 Jul 1;22(13):2747'],,,

Germ-line mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and CHK2 genes have been detected in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), suggesting a potential role of these genes in genetic predisposition to these tumors. However, no familial association has been previously recognized in MCL. DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine the possible existence of familial lymphoid neoplasms in MCL, we searched clinical records of MCL patients and identified three families in which a MCL, an acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, and a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma occurred in a first-degree relative of a MCL patient. RESULTS: The neoplasms in two daughters appeared at an earlier age and were more aggressive than that in the respective parent, suggesting that the phenomenon of anticipation may characterize familial lymphomas associated with MCL. No mutations were detected in the ATM, CHK2, CHK1, and p53 genes. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that inactivation of the investigated DNA damage response genes do not account for familial disease aggregation in MCL patients, although such aggregation may occur and seems to be associated with the phenomenon of anticipation.","['Tort, Frederic', 'Camacho, Emma', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Harris, Nancy Lee', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Campo, Elias']","['Tort F', 'Camacho E', 'Bosch F', 'Harris NL', 'Montserrat E', 'Campo E']","[""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2004/03/17 05:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Mar;89(3):314-9.,IM,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2004 Mar;89(3):262-3.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed our HCL patients treated with front-line 2-CdA (by 2-hour infusion) either for 5 consecutive days at 0.14 mg/kg/day (daily subset, n=21) or once a week at 0.14 mg/kg for 5 cycles (weekly subset, n=16). RESULTS: Of the 37 eligible patients, 30 (81%) achieved complete response (CR) and 7 (19%) partial response (PR) (overall response rate, 100%); identical response rates were recorded in the daily and weekly subsets. After a median follow-up of 122 months (range, 54-156), the overall relapse rate was 27% (8/30): 24% (4/17) had relapsed in the subset treated daily whereas 30% (4/13) had done so in the subset treated weekly (p=ns). The projected 13-year overall and the relapse-free survivals are 96% and 52%, respectively. In terms of hematologic toxicity, the weekly 2-CdA schedule was associated with significantly fewer cases of grade 3-4 neutropenia. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In HCL patients, a single dose of 2-CdA induces a long-term CR. Over 90% of patients are alive 13 years later and over 50% of patients appear to be clinically cured by this treatment. The weekly schedule seems to be a safer option for neutropenic HCL patients, while apparently providing equivalent results in terms of response rates and long-term outcome.","['Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Tani, Monica', 'Marchi, Enrica', 'Stefoni, Vittorio', 'Alinari, Lapo', 'Musuraca, Gerardo', 'Gabriele, Annalisa', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Zinzani PL', 'Tani M', 'Marchi E', 'Stefoni V', 'Alinari L', 'Musuraca G', 'Gabriele A', 'Pileri S', 'Baccarani M']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L. e A.

The aim of the study was to investigate the diagnostic value of CD123 expression in B-cell disorders with circulating hairy and villous lymphocytes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the diagnostic value of CD123 expression in neoplastic cells from 59 patients with B-cell disorders with circulating hairy or villous lymphocytes: HCL (n=24), the variant form of HCL (n=11) and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) (n=24). Cells from 12 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were used as controls. Immunophenotypic analysis was performed by flow cytometry on 77 samples from peripheral blood (n=48), bone marrow (n=25) and spleen cell suspensions (n=4). RESULTS: Our findings show that cells from 95% of typical HCL express CD123 with strong to moderate intensity while this molecule is absent in circulating cells from most cases of HCL-variant (91%) and SLVL (97%). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CD123 is a useful new marker for distinguishing B-cell disorders with circulating villous lymphocytes as its expression is characteristic of typical HCL with high sensitivity and specificity.

We retrospectively evaluated the impact on survival of an aggressive versus a non-aggressive approach in 1005 patients aged >60 years registered in the database of the GIMEMA cooperative group. DESIGN AND METHODS: Group A patients (n=621) received aggressive treatment, while group B patients (n=384) underwent non-aggressive therapy. The groups were different for risk factor distribution: the patients in group B had a higher median age, worse performance status (PS) and a higher proportion of previous myelodysplastic disease. RESULTS: The overall median survival was 7 and 5 months in groups A and B, respectively (p min of 0.0001). At multivariate analysis the following factors were associated with a significantly shorter survival: age >71 years (RR=1.27; 95% CI=1.07-1.50), PS=2-4 (RR=1.44; 95% CI=1.24-1.68), white cell count > 10,000 mL (RR=1.37; 95% CI=1.06-1.75), and heart dysfunction requiring treatment (RR=1.26; 95% CI=1.05-1.50). No difference in survival was associated with aggressive or non-aggressive treatment (RR=1.1; 95% CI=0.94-1.32). Patients aged min of 70 years, with no heart disease, but a white cell count > 10,000/mL showed a significantly better survival when treated aggressively (median survival 7 vs 3 months, p = 0.011). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Despite an obvious selection of patients with a worse prognosis in group B, the difference in survival between the two groups was marginal. Multivariate analysis failed to demonstrate a significant survival benefit in aggressively treated patients. All these considerations indicate that elderly patients with AML are overall unlikely to benefit from aggressive treatment, so that this should be offered only to selected patients.","['Pulsoni, Alessandro', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Casini, Marco', 'Cerri, Raffaella', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'De Paoli, Lorella', 'Di Bona, Eros', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Marmont, Filippo', 'Petti, Maria Concetta', 'Rigolin, Gianmatteo', 'Ronco, Francesca', 'Spadano, Antonio', 'Tosti, Maria Elena', 'Visani, Giuseppe', 'Mele, Alfonso', 'Mandelli, Franco']","['Pulsoni A', 'Pagano L', 'Latagliata R', 'Casini M', 'Cerri R', 'Crugnola M', 'De Paoli L', 'Di Bona E', 'Invernizzi R', 'Marmont F', 'Petti MC', 'Rigolin G', 'Ronco F', 'Spadano A', 'Tosti ME', 'Visani G', 'Mele A', 'Mandelli F']","['Dpt. of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, La Sapienza University, Roma, Italy. pulsoni@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/17 05:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Mar;89(3):296-302.,IM,,,,,,"['Haematologica. 2004 Mar;89(3):261-3.

Thus, the retonoic acid receptor (RARalpha) agonist, AM80, regulates tissue factor (TF), thrombomodulin (TM) expression and granulocytic differentiation in promyelocytic cells, while the RARgamma-selective retinoid, CD437, inhibits in vitro cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways constitute key integration points along the signal transduction cascades that link diverse extracellular stimuli to proliferation, differentiation and survival. DESIGN AND METHODS: PI3K and MEK/ERK kinase-dependent pathways were examined as potential targets of retinoid signaling. Likewise, by using specific inhibitors, the role of those kinases in retinoid-induced granulocytic differentiation, apoptosis, and TF and TM expression n NB4 cells were analyzed. RESULTS: AM80-treated NB4 cells had increased PI3K activity and phosphoinositide turnover. High steady-state pERK-1/-2 activity levels were not significantly changed by AM80. Yet, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly reduced AM80-elicted ERK-1/-2 activity. Thus, the PI3K pathway might contribute to elevated ERK-1/-2 activity in NB4 cells. Inhibition of the PI3K and MEK/ERK pathways reversed AM80-induced granulocytic differentiation, TF down-regulation and TM induction. Besides, CD437 significantly reduced ERK-1/-2 activity of NB4 cells. Further ERK-1/-2 activity inhibition with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, increased the retinoid pro-apoptotic effect with an additive effect. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Regardless the different regulation of PI3K and MAPK pathways promoted by AM80 and CD437, there is a varying degree of cross-talk between these pathways in the control of the overall response of promyelocytic cells to retinoids. Thus, disruption of targeted pathways, together with specific retinoids, might be an effective therapeutic treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Lopez-Pedrera, Chary', 'Barbarroja, Nuria', 'Buendia, Paula', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Dorado, Gabriel', 'Velasco, Francisco']","['Lopez-Pedrera C', 'Barbarroja N', 'Buendia P', 'Torres A', 'Dorado G', 'Velasco F']","['Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia, Avda.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether deletions of known suppressor sequences occur in myeloid malignancies associated with 5q-. DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty patients with MDS or AML were selected for the presence of a 5q karyotypic deletion, either isolated (19 cases) or associated with other chromosome changes (11 cases). Multiple fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei was applied in all cases using a panel of eleven probes for known suppressor genes or loci deleted in MDS/AML. Metaphase FISH was also performed to clarify discrepancies between conventional and molecular cytogenetics. RESULTS: No additional deletions were found in nineteen cases with an isolated 5q-. Mono-allelic deletions where found in 9/11 cases, 3 of which were related to monosomies by conventional cytogenetics. Interphase-FISH showed p53, AML1, D13S25, NF1, or Ikaros in six out of nine (66%) patients with 5q- and additional karyotypic changes. Metaphase FISH was helpful in assigning some of these cryptic events to non-proliferating cells. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes that isolated 5q- is the marker of a highly stable clone in both MDS and AML. AML with isolated 5q- are molecularly closer to 5q- syndrome than to AML with complex changes. Interphase-FISH data strongly support a mutator phenotype underlying complex karyotypes with a 5q deletion.","['Crescenzi, Barbara', 'La Starza, Roberta', 'Romoli, Silvia', 'Beacci, Donatella', 'Matteucci, Caterina', 'Barba, Gianluca', 'Aventin, Ana', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Ciolli, Stefania', 'Nozzoli, Chiara', 'Martelli, Massimo Fabrizio', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['Crescenzi B', 'La Starza R', 'Romoli S', 'Beacci D', 'Matteucci C', 'Barba G', 'Aventin A', 'Marynen P', 'Ciolli S', 'Nozzoli C', 'Martelli MF', 'Mecucci C']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Trasplantation Unit, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Painting', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",2004/03/17 05:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Mar;89(3):281-5.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, flavanone with hydroxylation at C4' and C6 had a significant cytotoxic effect in human leukemia HL-60 cells accompanied by the occurrence of DNA ladders, apoptotic bodies, and hypodiploid cells, characteristics of apoptosis. The replacement of a hydroxyl group (OH) by a methoxyl (OCH3) group at C4' or C6 attenuated the apoptotic effect in cells, and there was no significant cytotocity of flavanone or flavanone with OH or OCH3 in C7-treated HL-60 cells. Induction of enzyme activity of caspase-3 and -9, but not caspase-1 and -8, accompanied by release of cytocrome C from mitochondria to cytosol and the appearance of cleaved of PARP (85 kDa), D4-GDI (23 kDa), and caspase-3 (p17/p15) fragments, was identified in 4'-OH- or 6-OH- flavanone-treated HL-60 cells. Caspase-3 and -9 inhibitors Ac-DEVD-FMK and Ac-LEHD-FMK, but not caspase-1 and -8 inhibitors Ac-YVAD-FMK and Ac-LETD-FMK, attenuated 4'-OH- or 6-OH-flavanone-induced cell death. And, inhibition of capsase-9 activity by Ac-LEHD-FMK suppresses caspase-3 protein procession induced by 4'-OH- and 6-OH-flavanone, indicative of caspase-9 activation locating upstream of caspase-3. A decrease in the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and increases in the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad were found in 4'-OH- or 6-OH-flavanone-treated HL-60 cells. Induction of endogenous ROS production was detected in 4'-OH- or 6-OH-flavanone-treated HL-60 cells by the DCHF-DA assay. Antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and allopurinol (ALL), but not pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) or diphenylene iodonium (DPI), significantly inhibited 4'-OH- or 6-OH-flavanone-induced ROS production, with blocking of the apoptosis induced by 4'-OH- or 6-OH-flavanone. The apoptosis-inducing activity of 4'-OH- or 6-OH-flavanone was also observed in another leukemia cell line (Jurkat), but was not found in mature monocytic cells (THP-1) and normal human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). This suggests that hydroxylation at C4' or C6 is important to the apoptosis-inducing activities of flavanone through ROS production, and that activation of the caspase-3 cascade, downstream of caspase-9 activation, is involved.","['Ko, Ching Huai', 'Shen, Shing-Chuan', 'Chen, Yen Chou']","['Ko CH', 'Shen SC', 'Chen YC']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (ARHGDIB protein, human)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor beta)', '0 (rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']","['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Allopurinol/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Flavanones/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, bcl-2/physiology', 'Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylation', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor beta', 'rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2003/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2003.12.020 [doi]', 'S0891584903008682 [pii]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2004 Apr 1;36(7):897-910. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2003.12.020.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first part of this study, CSF-Tau, CSF-Phospho-Tau, and CSF-Neuromodulin (CSF-NM) were measured in a heterogeneous group of patients presenting in the pediatric oncology department. In the second part, the neurodegenerative markers were analyzed in a group of children with non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (nB-ALL) treated according to EORTC protocols 58881 and 58951. PROCEDURE: CSF was collected from lumbar punctures at diagnosis only in the first group, and at diagnosis and during treatment in the second group. CSF-proteins were measured with ELISA. RESULTS: There was no age variation in any of the markers at diagnosis in the first group of children. After prephase induction therapy with one intrathecal (IT) injection of methotrexate (MTX) and 7 days systemic corticosteroids, an increase in CSF-Tau was observed, and accompanied with increase of both CSF-P-Tau and CSF-NM. While CSF-Tau remained high during induction treatment, CSF-P-Tau, and CSF-NM decreased. CONCLUSION: Neurodegenerative markers do not vary with age. The different protein profiles suggest that the neurotoxicity from the prephase, which results in an increase of CSF-Tau, CSF-P-Tau, and CSF-NM, may have a different mechanism to the neurotoxicity induced later during induction treatment, when only CSF-Tau remains high.","['Van Gool, Stefaan W', 'De Meyer, Geert', 'Van de Voorde, Andre', 'Vanmechelen, Eugeen', 'Vanderstichele, Hugo']","['Van Gool SW', 'De Meyer G', 'Van de Voorde A', 'Vanmechelen E', 'Vanderstichele H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. stefaan.vangool@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Neurotoxicology,Neurotoxicology,7905589,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (tau Proteins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/cerebrospinal fluid/toxicity', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*cerebrospinal fluid/*toxicity', 'Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/cerebrospinal fluid/toxicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'tau Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.neuro.2003.12.001 [doi]', 'S0161-813X(03)00232-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Neurotoxicology. 2004 Mar;25(3):471-80. doi: 10.1016/j.neuro.2003.12.001.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One week after the HSCT the patient developed respiratory symptoms which progressively deteriorated. The IF and culture for PIV3 became positive again only after the symptoms deteriorated. However, retrospectively, a real-time PCR assay showed that the PIV3 was detectable throughout the conditioning phase and the amount of virus increased at the time of reappearance of respiratory symptoms post-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: Management of PIV3 infection is important in HSCT. The use of this real-time PCR assay could improve diagnosis and management of PIV3 infection.","['Templeton, K E', 'Bredius, R G M', 'Scheltinga, S A', 'Claas, E C J', 'Vossen, J M', 'Kroes, A C M']","['Templeton KE', 'Bredius RG', 'Scheltinga SA', 'Claas EC', 'Vossen JM', 'Kroes AC']","['Departments of Medical Microbiology, Center of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center, Postbus 9600, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,,"['Child, Preschool', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nasal Lavage Fluid/virology', 'Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human/genetics/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*therapy', 'Respirovirus Infections/*virology']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2003/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2003/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/S1386-6532(03)00215-4 [doi]', 'S1386653203002154 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2004 Apr;29(4):320-2. doi: 10.1016/S1386-6532(03)00215-4.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from patients with more than one malignancy were analyzed according to each primary malignancy. For the present study, OR > or =2.0 or < or =0.5 was defined to be increased or decreased, respectively. RESULTS: There were 110 primary malignancies (52 hematologic neoplasms, 58 carcinomas) in the 100 adult patients. Allele frequencies were similar in patients and controls (C282Y: 0.0850 vs. 0.0896, respectively (OR = 0.9); H63D: 0.1400 vs. 0.1447, respectively (OR = 0.9)). Two patients had hemochromatosis and C282Y homozygosity. With C282Y, increased OR occurred in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders, and adenocarcinoma of prostate (2.0, 2.8, and 3.4, respectively); OR was decreased in myelodysplasia (0.4). With H63D, increased OR occurred in myeloproliferative disorders and adenocarcinomas of breast and prostate (2.4, 2.0, and 2.0, respectively); OR was decreased in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (0.5 and 0.4, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In 100 consecutive adults with malignancy evaluated in a community medical oncology practice, frequencies of HFE C282Y or H63D were similar to those in the general population. This suggests that C282Y or H63D is not associated with an overall increase in cancer risk. However, odds ratios computed in the present study suggest that increased (or decreased) risk for developing specific types of malignancy may be associated with the inheritance of HFE C282Y or H63D. Study of more patients with these specific types of malignancies is needed to determine if trends described herein would remain and yield significant differences.","['Barton, James C', 'Bertoli, Luigi F', 'Acton, Ronald T']","['Barton JC', 'Bertoli LF', 'Acton RT']","['Southern Iron Disorders Center, Birmingham, Alabama, USA. ironmd@dnamail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (HFE protein, human)', '0 (Hemochromatosis Protein)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']","['Adenocarcinoma/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Carcinoma/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Hemochromatosis/*genetics', 'Hemochromatosis Protein', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/genetics', 'Odds Ratio']",2004/03/17 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2004/03/17 05:00'],"['2003/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1471-2407-4-6 [doi]', '1471-2407-4-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2004 Feb 10;4:6. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-4-6.,IM,,PMC356917,,,,,,,20040210,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past decades seminal discoveries in the field of CML research have greatly contributed to our knowledge of leukemogenesis. The hallmark of the disease is the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, the first described acquired non-random cytogenetic abnormality in human malignancies. This chromosomal abnormality is the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22). At the molecular level this involves the fusion of the ABL protooncogene on chromosome 9 with the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The fusion protein has increased tyrosine kinase activity and is a key event in the malignant transformation of a given progenitor cell in the bone marrow. Diagnosis of CML is based on the peripheral blood smear, bone marrow examination, the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome and its molecular correlate, the BCR-ABL transcript. Remarkable progress has been made in the treatment options over the last years which as a result rendered the therapeutic choices more complex and challenging. The current knowledge of treatment options is reviewed with particular emphasis on the newly introduced tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib which opened an as yet unexpected promising avenue in the treatment of CML.","['Tobler, A', 'Solenthaler, M']","['Tobler A', 'Solenthaler M']","['Hamatologisches Zentrallabor, Inselspital, Universitat Bern. andreas.tobler@insel.ch']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Ther Umsch,Therapeutische Umschau.

The dose required to achieve consistent control after complete response is uncertain, but the available data suggest a dose-response for tumor control after CR. The role of radiation therapy after partial response (PR) is uncertain as many such patients are advised to undergo high dose chemotherapy followed by bone marrow reconstitution. Involved field radiation therapy after PR is able to achieve durable freedom-from-relapse. The role of radiation therapy for peripheral T-cell lymphomas and mediastinal T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas is also uncertain. Finally, in the era of combination chemotherapy and conformal irradiation, a uniform understanding of what constitutes ""involved field"" treatment volume is lacking.

Jurkat cells expressed one wild-type and one mutated (R477H) GR allele. GR(R477H) ligand-binding-dependent nuclear import, as revealed by live-cell microscopy of YFP-tagged GR, was unaffected. Transactivation and transrepression were markedly impaired; however, GR(R477H) did not act in a dominant-negative manner, that is, did not prevent cell death, when introduced into a GC-sensitive cell line by retroviral gene transfer. Contrary to another GR heterozygous, but GC-sensitive, T-ALL model (CCRF-CEM), Jurkats expressed lower basal GR levels and did not auto-induce their GR, as revealed by 'real-time' RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Absent GR auto-induction could not be restored by transgenic GR and, hence, was not caused by reduced basal GR levels.

RNA interference-mediated downregulation of E2FBP1/hDril1 results in hyperplasis of PML-NBs and consequent commitment to PML-dependent premature senescence. Thus, the function of E2FBP1/hDril1 is required for maintenance of survival potential of the cells.

A continuous supply of this catalytic molecule led to a substantial reduction in leukemic-cell burden and survival. Rats with postinfarction heart failure were treated with a DNA enzyme targeting TNFa, and this led to a substantial improvement of cardiac function concomitant with a restoration of the hemodynamic status of the animals.

We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems.

Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway is an important step in this process and can be accomplished by mutation of p53 or down-modulation of p19(Arf), a p53 regulatory protein. Consistent with these data, pre-B cells from either p53 or Ink4a/Arf null mice bypass crisis. However, the Ink4a/Arf locus encodes both p19(Arf) and a second tumor suppressor, p16(Ink4a), that blocks cell cycle progression by inhibiting Cdk4/6. To determine if p16(Ink4a) plays a role in Ab-MLV transformation, primary transformants derived from Arf(-/-) and p16(Ink4a(-/-)) mice were compared. A fraction of those derived from Arf(-/-) animals underwent crisis, and even though all p16(Ink4a(-/-)) primary transformants experienced crisis, these cells became established more readily than cells derived from +/+ mice. Analyses of Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells infected with a virus that expresses both v-Abl and p16(Ink4a) revealed that p16(Ink4a) expression does not alter cell cycle profiles but does increase the level of apoptosis in primary transformants. These results indicate that both products of the Ink4a/Arf locus influence Ab-MLV transformation and reveal that in addition to its well-recognized effects on the cell cycle, p16(Ink4a) can suppress transformation by inducing apoptosis.","['Sachs, Zohar', 'Sharpless, Norman E', 'DePinho, Ronald A', 'Rosenberg, Naomi']","['Sachs Z', 'Sharpless NE', 'DePinho RA', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Pathology, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)']","['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Mice', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/deficiency/genetics/metabolism']",2004/03/16 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2004/03/16 05:00'],"['2004/03/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.7.3304-3311.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Apr;78(7):3304-11. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.7.3304-3311.2004.,IM,,PMC371071,,,"['R01 CA033771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, alloreactive NK cells were shown to mediate antileukemic effects against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) after mismatched transplantation, when KIR ligand incompatibility existed in the direction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Therefore, we investigated whether solid tumor cells would have similar enhanced susceptibility to allogeneic KIR-incompatible NK cells compared with their KIR-matched autologous or allogeneic counterparts. NK populations enriched and cloned from the blood of cancer patients or healthy donors homozygous for HLA-C alleles in group 1 (C-G1) or group 2 (C-G2) were tested in vitro for cytotoxicity against Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastic cell lines (EBV-LCLs), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and melanoma (MEL) cells with or without a matching KIR-inhibitory HLA-C ligand. Allogeneic NK cells were more cytotoxic to tumor targets mismatched for KIR ligands than their KIR ligand-matched counterparts. Bulk NK populations (CD3(-)/CD2(+)/CD56(+)) expanded 10(4)-fold from patients homozygous for C-G1 or C-G2 had enhanced cytotoxicity against KIR ligand-mismatched tumor cells but only minimal cytotoxicity against KIR ligand-matched targets. Further, NK cell lines from C-G1 or C-G2 homozygous cancer patients or healthy donors expanded but failed to kill autologous or KIR-matched MEL and RCC cells yet had significant cytotoxicity (more than 50% lysis at 20:1 effector-target [E/T] ratio) against allogeneic KIR-mismatched tumor lines.

This technique is analogous to comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) that detects genomic imbalances. We applied CESH for the study of hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a disorder with a largely unknown expression profile. Twelve HCL cases with spleen involvement were investigated by CESH and CGH. While the latter analysis identified only a few nonrecurrent genomic imbalances, CESH showed a consistent expression profile in all HCL cases. In addition, pairing normal spleen with normal lymph node, a ""spleen signature"" was established by CESH. This signature most likely reflects the expression profile of spleen-specific components, such as the sinusoidal lining cells from the red pulp and the marginal zone B cells from the white pulp. Imprint of the spleen signature was found in the HCL expression profile, suggesting that HCL may originate from a particular B-cell subset present in these splenic components. Besides pairing HCL with normal lymph node and spleen, we identified an ""HCL signature"" comprising several chromosome regions with altered expression.

Because elevated plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a potent nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) inhibitor, are prevalent in diverse cardiovascular diseases, the goal of this study was to examine the contribution of NO deficiency to macrophage lipid accumulation. Inhibition of NO synthesis in PMA-primed human monocytic leukemia HL-60 cells resulted in a twofold increase in expression of the receptor for oxidized LDL (OxLDL), termed the lectin-like OxLDL receptor (LOX-1). Blockade of inducible NOS in activated macrophages resulted in 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)-OxLDL accumulation and imparted macrophages with a foamy appearance as detected with oil-red O lipid staining. ADMA (15 microM) or N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 300 microM), both of which suppress inducible NOS activity, increased oil-red staining 1.9- and 2.8-fold, respectively.

To examine the role of LOX-1 in this process, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex-mediated LOX-1 gene silencing. LOX-1 expression was suppressed twofold by siRNA as shown by Western blot analysis. This suppression was associated with a two- to fourfold decrease in DiI-OxLDL uptake as identified by fluorescence microscopy and decreased oil-red O staining by activated macrophages. In conclusion, accumulation of ADMA (a competitive inhibitor of NOS) in patients with chronic renal failure may be responsible for upregulation of LOX-1 receptor and increased OxLDL uptake, thus contributing to lipidosis and foam cell formation. The data illustrate an additional nonendothelial mode of antiatherogenic action of NO: prevention of LOX-1 induction and lipid accumulation by macrophages.","['Smirnova, I V', 'Kajstura, M', 'Sawamura, T', 'Goligorsky, M S']","['Smirnova IV', 'Kajstura M', 'Sawamura T', 'Goligorsky MS']","['Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

MAP is a multibranched lysine core with antigenic peptides. Immunization of BALB/c mice with pRL1a MAP effectively induced pRL1a CTLs. Here, we demonstrate the presence of pRL1a-recognizing CD8(+) T-cells in pRL1a MAP-immunized and RL male 1-bearing BALB/c and (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F(1) mice by using IFNgamma ELISPOT and H-2L(d)/pRL1a tetramer assays. A few IFNgamma ELISPOTs and no tetramer-positive cells were detected ex vivo in spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with pRL1a MAP. After a single in vitro stimulation with RL male 1, 432 and 741 IFNgamma ELISPOTs/10(5) cells were detected and tetramer-positive CD8(+) T-cells occurred at relative frequencies of 5.7% and 30.8% in splenic CD8(+) T-cells from mice that had been doubly and triply immunized, respectively, against pRL1a MAP. Tetramer-positive cells displayed two distinct cell populations, CD62L(low) and CD62L(high). Secondary in vitro stimulation expanded CD62L(high) cells more efficiently than CD62L(low) cells. Furthermore, a higher frequency of IFNgamma-producing and tetramer-positive CD8(+) T-cells was detected ex vivo in RL male 1-bearing semi-allogeneic (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F(1) than in BALB/c mice on day 14 after tumor inoculation.","['Takada, Itsuro', 'Noguchi, Yuji', 'Kenjo, Akira', 'Wada, Hisashi', 'Uenaka, Akiko', 'Fujita, Teizo', 'Inoue, Hajime', 'Nakayama, Eiichi']","['Takada I', 'Noguchi Y', 'Kenjo A', 'Wada H', 'Uenaka A', 'Fujita T', 'Inoue H', 'Nakayama E']","['Department of Immunology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (pRL1a protein, mouse)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']","['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Interferon-alpha/*immunology', 'L-Selectin/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oligopeptides/*immunology', 'Peptides/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/03/16 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/03/16 05:00'],"['2004/03/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb02212.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2004 Mar;95(3):254-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb02212.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transferrin receptor 2(TfR2), another receptor for transferrin (Tf), has recently been cloned. We examined expression levels of TfR1, TfR2-alpha (membrane form) and TfR2-beta (non-membrane form) transcripts in cells from 67 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and correlated the results with a variety of clinical features and disease outcomes of these patients. Significant correlations were noted between the levels of both TfR1 and TfR2-alpha (r = 0.771, P < 0.001) and TfR1 and TfR2-beta (r = 0.534, P < 0.001). Unexpectedly, initial white blood cell (WBC) counts were inversely correlated with levels of expression of either TfR1(r = -0.357, P = 0.003), TfR2-alpha (r = -0.486, P < 0.0001), or TfR2-beta (r = -0.435, P = 0.0003). Only TfR2 expression was significantly associated with either serum iron (r = -0.270, P = 0.045) or serum ferritin (r = -0.364, P = 0.008). Multivariate analyses using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that elevated TfR2-alpha, but not TfR1 or TfR2-beta mRNA levels significantly contributed to a better prognosis for AML patients. Furthermore, a group with high expression levels of both TfR2-alpha and TfR2-beta survived significantly longer than a group without high expression of both of them (P < 0.01 by log-rank). The present study suggests that (i) TfRs-independent iron uptake might have an important role in in vivo proliferation of AML cells; (ii) expression of TfR2 (especially the alpha form) is a novel prognostic factor for patients with AML.","['Nakamaki, Tsuyoshi', 'Kawabata, Hiroshi', 'Saito, Bungo', 'Matsunawa, Manabu', 'Suzuki, Junko', 'Adachi, Daisuke', 'Tomoyasu, Shigeru', 'Phillip Koeffler, H']","['Nakamaki T', 'Kawabata H', 'Saito B', 'Matsunawa M', 'Suzuki J', 'Adachi D', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Phillip Koeffler H']","['Department of Haematology, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. nakamaki@med.showa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (TFR2 protein, human)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']","['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Iron/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/03/16 05:00,2004/05/27 05:00,['2004/03/16 05:00'],"['2004/03/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['4866 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04866.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Apr;125(1):42-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04866.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the expression of Ikaros isoforms in 49 infant and childhood leukaemia patients was analysed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. We found overexpression of the DN Ikaros 6 (Ik6) isoform in a subset of leukaemia patients harbouring t(4;11) translocations. To further study the consequences of Ik6 overexpression in B ALL, we inducibly expressed Ik6 in BaF3 cells and found that Ik6 overexpression delayed cell death after interleukin-3 withdrawal, suggesting that overexpression of Ik6 found in t(4;11) B cells could contribute to leukaemogenesis by preventing the apoptosis of cells in an environment with reduced survival factors.","['Ruiz, Anna', 'Jiang, Jie', 'Kempski, Helena', 'Brady, Hugh J M']","['Ruiz A', 'Jiang J', 'Kempski H', 'Brady HJ']","['Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']","['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/03/16 05:00,2004/05/27 05:00,['2004/03/16 05:00'],"['2004/03/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['4854 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04854.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Apr;125(1):31-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04854.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we reported whether polyamines were capable of affecting apoptotic cell death triggered by H2O2 in leukemia cells or not. Alpha-difluoromethylornithine treatment (DFMO, 3 mmol/L, 48 h), which depletes intracellular putrescine by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase, reduced H2O2-induced cell death in the HL-60 leukemia cells. Cytotoxicity caused by H2O2 in putrescine-depleted cells was 50% lower than that in the control cells, as determined by propidium iodide, the annexin V and DNA fragmentation assays. Following putrescine (1 mmol/L) supplement, cell death induction caused by H2O2 was restored to a similar level as the DFMO-untreated control cells. It seems that this partly resulted from the intralysosomal iron-dependent oxidation of the cells because DFMO did not significantly affect the increment of enzymes related to oxidative-stress resistance. Putrescine depletion by DFMO treatment reduced the cellular iron uptake of the cells by about 70%. In parallel to the reduction of iron uptake, lysosomal damage (assayed by acridine orange relocalization or uptake test) in the DFMO-treated cells was far less than that in the control cells. Moreover, putrescine supplement also restored the iron uptake to the control cell levels. Pre-incubation with desferrioxamine (DFO), which chelates iron and forms a non-reactive Fe-DFO complex that is localized in the lysosomal compartment, inhibited H2O2-induced cell death. This work suggests that polyamines may play a critical role in apoptotic cell death triggered by H2O2 via the regulation of the iron-dependent instability of the lysosome.","['Shim, H W', 'Moon, M S', 'Shin, K S', 'Cho, H J', 'Yoo, B S', 'Kim, I G']","['Shim HW', 'Moon MS', 'Shin KS', 'Cho HJ', 'Yoo BS', 'Kim IG']","['Department of Radiation Biology, Environment Radiation Research Group, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Yusong, Taejon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']","['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Eflornithine/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*toxicity', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors']",2004/03/16 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/16 05:00'],"['2004/03/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/b:cbto.0000013355.63593.35 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2003 Nov;19(6):393-405. doi: 10.1023/b:cbto.0000013355.63593.35.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitor of DNA methylation, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AZA), which can re-activate these genes, is under clinical investigation for therapy of leukemia. The objective of this study was to determine the concentrations of 5AZA that will re-activate target silent genes in human leukemic cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RT-PCR was used to evaluate the effect of concentrations of 1 to 100 ng/ml of 5AZA on the re-activation of p15 and p73 in KG1a myeloid leukemic cells and E-cadherin in HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells. The effect of 5AZA on inhibition of growth, DNA synthesis and colony formation in these cell lines was also investigated. RESULTS: The extent of activation of the target genes was dependent on the concentration of 5AZA. For p15, pronounced activation was observed at 10 ng/ml or greater. For p73 and E-cadherin significant activation was observed at 100 ng/ml of 5AZA. Maximal inhibition of growth, DNA synthesis and colony formation occurred at 100 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: The in vitro antineoplastic and gene re-activation activity of 5AZA is dependent on the concentration of this analog. These data may be helpful in the design of the optimal dose-schedule of 5AZA for the clinical therapy of leukemia.","['Farinha, Nuno J', 'Shaker, Sepideh', 'Lemaire, Maryse', 'Momparler, Louise', 'Bernstein, Mark', 'Momparler, Richard L']","['Farinha NJ', 'Shaker S', 'Lemaire M', 'Momparler L', 'Bernstein M', 'Momparler RL']","[""Service d'hematologie-oncologie, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1C5, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']","['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cadherins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2004/03/16 05:00,2004/05/22 05:00,['2004/03/16 05:00'],"['2004/03/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2004 Jan-Feb;24(1):75-8.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: After treated with above mentioned treatment for 2 months, percentage of patients with normal peripheral blood count increased, including patients with WBC > or = 4.0 x 10(9)/L raised from 46% to 70%, with Hb > or = 120 g/L from 17% to 46% and with PLT > or = 100 x 10(9)/L from 63% to 85%; nucleated cell volume in bone marrow increased from 35.83 +/- 28.42% to 60.46 +/- 17.73% (P < 0.01); HLA-DR cell was also increased significantly from 10.55 +/- 4.95% to 14.84 +/- 4.94%, (P < 0.01); while the residual leukemia cells were not increased in one year, from 5.90 +/- 5.09% before and 5.82 +/- 2.42% after treatment (P > 0.05). The maximal DFS in patients was 123 months. The 3-year survival rate was 64.15 +/- 1.96% and 5-year survival rate was 51.19 +/- 16.25%. CONCLUSION: The integrative Chinese and western medicine treating program used in this study is beneficial for the long-term treatment of AML patients after complete remission.","['Su, Er-yun', 'Chen, Hui-shu', 'Han, Yue-mei']","['Su EY', 'Chen HS', 'Han YM']","['Affiliated Hospital to Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014. erhyunsu@hzcnc.com']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', '*Phytotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",2004/03/16 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/03/16 05:00'],"['2004/03/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2004 Feb;24(2):124-6.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib potently inhibits several protein tyrosine kinases, including BCR-ABL, c-Kit, and PDGF receptor. Imatinib blocks the phosphorylation of downstream target proteins and interrupts the malignant transformation leading to the development of CML. Phase I and II studies demonstrated that imatinib is highly effective and well tolerated in all phase of CML. We got our experience with imatinib on more than two-year monitoring 34 patients within the Expanded Access Study CST1571 0113. Imatinib 400 mg/d was administered orally to 10 women and 24 men in median age of 53 years (22-70) who were hematologically (n = 9) or cytogenetically (n = 13) resistant, cytogenetically refractory (n = 3) or intolerant (n = 9) to interferon alpha. The median follow-up time was 97.5 weeks (23-115), the median time from CML diagnosis to the start of the study was 32.3 months (6-140.5). Complete hematologic response was achieved in 33 of 34 (97%) pts, total major cytogenetic response (complete plus major) in 21 of 33 (63%) pts. Cytogenetic relapse was observed in 2 of 33 pts (6%), cytogenetic progression in 4 (12%) pts. Non-hematologic toxicity was mild (grade 1 or 2) and no patient was excluded from the study due to it. Hematological toxicity grade 3 limited dose of imatinib in 26% of patients and probably caused lower rate of cytogenetic responses in heavy pretreated patients. Both quantitative RT-PCR methods (competitive RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR Light-Cycler) were found useful to monitor patients with CML on imatinib therapy. Our results confirmed high efficacy and safety of imatinib in late-chronic phase CML patients failing prior interferon therapy. The lower incidence of hematological toxicity and higher rate of cytogenetic responses in patients treated with imatinib in early-chronic phase CML justify according to our opinion the recommendation to administer imatinib early after the diagnosis of CML in patients who are not indicated for allogeneic transplantation.","['Voglova, J', 'Poznarova, A', 'Chrobak, L', 'Rabasova, J', 'Beranek, M', 'Moravcova, J', 'Faber, E', 'Klamova, H', 'Cikhart, M']","['Voglova J', 'Poznarova A', 'Chrobak L', 'Rabasova J', 'Beranek M', 'Moravcova J', 'Faber E', 'Klamova H', 'Cikhart M']","['Oddeleni klinicke hematologie II. interni kliniky FN, Hradec Kralove.']",['cze'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2004/03/16 05:00,2004/04/02 05:00,['2004/03/16 05:00'],"['2004/03/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Vnitr Lek. 2004 Jan;50(1):21-3, 26-9.",IM,Imatinib mesylat (Glivec) v lecbe chronicke faze chronicke myeloidni leukemie.,,,,,['Vnitr Lek. 2004 Jan;50(1):10-2.

Leukemic cells had trisomy 4 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality and, also, a novel point mutation in the extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) leading to truncated protein with a loss of 36 amino acids. There was no evidence that this receptor transmitted signals even in the presence of high doses of rhG-CSF in the cultures.

Since myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxicity for acetyldinaline in preclinical and clinical studies, experiments were conducted to examine the in vitro and in vivo effects of acetyldinaline on murine megakaryocytic (CFU-meg) progenitor cells. METHODS: Bone marrow and spleen cells from untreated mice were continuously exposed in vitro to acetyldinaline or dinaline in clonal assays. For the in vivo study, BDF(1) mice were dosed orally with 50 mg/kg acetyldinaline every day for 14 days. RESULTS: Both acetyldinaline and dinaline induced an in vitro dose-dependent decrease in CFU-meg colonies derived from either the spleen or bone marrow. Splenic CFU-meg were more sensitive in vitro to acetyldinaline and dinaline than their marrow counterparts. In the in vivo experiments, platelet counts decreased throughout the 14-day dosing period and had returned to normal by day 18. Marrow and spleen CFU-meg declined after the first dose but had recovered by days 4 and 7, respectively. Elevated splenic CFU-meg counts were observed through day 20, 6 days after dosing ended. Recovery of platelet counts in treated mice was associated with increases in both marrow and splenic CFU-meg. CONCLUSIONS: There was differential in vitro toxicity of acetyldinaline to murine CFU-meg derived from the bone marrow versus spleen. The in vitro assay predicted the more severe effect of acetyldinaline on splenic progenitors than on their marrow counterparts that was observed in the in vivo phase. In addition, megakaryocytopoiesis in the marrow showed evidence of recovery from drug toxicity in the face of continuing daily acetyldinaline treatments.","['Volpe, Donna A', 'LoRusso, Patricia M', 'Foster, Brenda J', 'Parchment, Ralph E']","['Volpe DA', 'LoRusso PM', 'Foster BJ', 'Parchment RE']","['Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD, USA. volpe@cder.fda.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', 'UMF554N5FG (tacedinaline)']","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phenylenediamines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Thrombopoiesis/*drug effects']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/07/22 05:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2003/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0783-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004 Jul;54(1):89-94. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0783-4.

A number of epidemiological studies have reported associations between leukemia risk and personal use of household appliances. In the ""Norddeutsche Leukamie und Lymphomstudie"" (NLL), which was conducted in Northern Germany (Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony) between 1997 and 2001, lifetime use of a preselected array of electric appliances (microwave ovens, hair-dryers, motorized electrical alarm clocks (i.e. that use a motor to move their hands or digits), electric blankets and pillows, heated waterbeds, computers with conventional screens, TVs, and electric sewing machines) was recorded in a standardized, personal, computerized interview. Exposure was assessed on three different levels of precision: ever use, cumulative appliance-years, and average time of daily use. Additional questions referred to exposure modifying factors, including distance from screen while watching TV, position of an alarm clock at the bed etc.). Exposure to ELF-EMF from household appliances was quantified as ever vs. never use, gross and net appliance-years of lifetime use and cumulative microT-hours. Flux densities were based on measurements of appliances from the published literature. These were used as weighting factors to account for the different device-specific contributions to overall ELF-EMF exposure.

Here we show that infection of normal human CD34+ cord blood (CB) cells with a retroviral vector encoding p210BCR-ABL rapidly activates a factor-independent phenotype and autocrine interleukin-3/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor/erythropoietin production in the transduced cells. These changes are characteristic of primitive chronic myeloid leukemic (CML) cells and are important to the leukemogenicity of BCR-ABL-transduced murine hematopoietic stem cells. When BCR-ABL-transduced human CB cells were incubated with imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of the p210BCR-ABL kinase, or when human CB cells were transduced with a BCR-ABL cDNA lacking the SH2 domain (p210DeltaSH2), factor independence was significantly reduced. In contrast, deletion of the SH2 domain had little impact on the p210BCR-ABL kinase-dependent promotion of erythropoietic differentiation also seen immediately following the BCR-ABL transduction of primitive human CB cells, but not in naturally occurring CML. Thus, p210BCR-ABL has distinct biological effects in primary human hematopoietic cells, which variably mimic features of human CML, and activation of these changes can show different dependencies on the integrity of the SH1 and SH2 domains of p210BCR-ABL.","['Chalandon, Y', 'Jiang, X', 'Loutet, S', 'Eaves, A C', 'Eaves, C J']","['Chalandon Y', 'Jiang X', 'Loutet S', 'Eaves AC', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Lineage', 'Erythropoietin/biosynthesis', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'src Homology Domains']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403335 [doi]', '2403335 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 May;18(5):1006-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403335.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans such as syndecan-1 and CD44 are thought to play a central role in the survival signals provided by these bone marrow survival niches, which require complex interactions between myeloma cells, extracellular matrix, stromal cells and soluble factors. In this report, we demonstrate that interleukin-6 (IL-6), the main survival and growth factor for myeloma cells, strongly increases CD44 gene expression. In addition, we show that IL-6 modulates CD44 RNA alternative splicing and induces the overexpression of all CD44 variant exons. Finally, we show that IL-6-induced CD44 cell surface molecules have a functional polarized membrane distribution. As IL-6 secretion induced from bone marrow stromal cells by myeloma cells is partly mediated through direct cell-to-cell interaction involving CD44 adhesion molecules, our findings suggest that a CD44/IL-6 amplification loop plays a crucial role in myeloma cell survival.","['Vincent, T', 'Mechti, N']","['Vincent T', 'Mechti N']","['INSERM Unite U475, Montpellier Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']","['Alternative Splicing', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*analysis/genetics', 'Hyaluronic Acid/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403333 [doi]', '2403333 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 May;18(5):967-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403333.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less is known in leukemia about the role of HIF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the most important proangiogenic target gene of HIF-1. We show by immunohistochemistry that the oxygen-regulated component of HIF-1 (HIF-1alpha) is overexpressed in clusters of leukemic cells in BM specimens of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and absent in biopsies of normal BM. Half the HIF-1alpha-positive ALL biopsies exhibited VEGF coexpression.

The current study has elucidated just such a pathway for GrB-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic alterations. Two Bcl-2 family members have been identified as interactive players in this newly discovered mitochondrial response to GrB: the pro-survival protein Mcl-1L and the pro-apoptotic protein, Bim. Expression of Mcl-1L, which localizes mainly to the outer mitochondrial membrane, decreases significantly in cells subjected to CTL-free cytotoxicity mediated by a combination of GrB and replication-deficient adenovirus. The data suggest that Mcl-1L is a substrate for GrB and for caspase-3, but the two enzymes appear to target different cleavage sites. The cleavage pattern of endogenous Mcl-1L resembles that of in vitro translated Mcl-1L subjected to similar proteolytic activity. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed with endogenous as well as with in vitro translated proteins suggest that Mcl-1L is a high affinity binding partner of the three isoforms of Bim (extra-long, long, and short). Bim, a BH3-only protein, is capable of mediating the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and this activity is inhibited by the presence of exogenous Mcl-1L. The findings presented herein imply that Mcl-1L degradation by either GrB or caspase-3 interferes with Bim sequestration by Mcl-1L.","['Han, Jie', 'Goldstein, Leslie A', 'Gastman, Brian R', 'Froelich, Christopher J', 'Yin, Xiao-Ming', 'Rabinowich, Hannah']","['Han J', 'Goldstein LA', 'Gastman BR', 'Froelich CJ', 'Yin XM', 'Rabinowich H']","['Departments of Pathology and Plastic Surgery, The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Granzymes', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/07/01 05:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M313234200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)66811-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 May 21;279(21):22020-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M313234200.

In this study, we examined the ability of olopatadine to inhibit the expression of cytokine genes in vitro via high-affinity receptors for immunoglobulin E in mast cells, using a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell line and an in vivo mouse model. Levels of gene expression in RBL-2H3 cells were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and serum interleukin-4 (IL-4) level in mice was quantified by ELISA. Olopatadine inhibited significantly the induction of IL-4 expression by mast cells both in vivo and in vitro. Olopatadine inhibited Ca(2+) influx through receptor-operated channels (ROC) without affecting Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Comparative analysis of olopatadine with other anti-allergic drugs and the ROC blocker SKF-96365 demonstrated that the potency of inhibition of Ca(2+) influx correlated with the degree of suppression of degranulation and arachidonic acid release. Inhibition of Ca(2+) influx decreased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, which participate in regulation of cytokine (e.g. IL-4) gene expression. However, the rank order of inhibition of Ca(2+) influx did not correspond to reduction of IL-4 expression, suggesting that an unknown mechanism(s) of action, in addition to inhibition of Ca(2+) influx, is involved in the expression of cytokines in mast cells.","['Matsubara, Masahiro', 'Masaki, Shigehiro', 'Ohmori, Kenji', 'Karasawa, Akira', 'Hasegawa, Kazuhide']","['Matsubara M', 'Masaki S', 'Ohmori K', 'Karasawa A', 'Hasegawa K']","['Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd., 1188 Shimotogari, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8731, Japan. masahiro.matsubara@kyowa.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Dibenzoxepins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '2XG66W44KF (Olopatadine Hydrochloride)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'I61V87164A (1-(2-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy)-4-methoxyphenylethyl)-1H-imidazole)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Dibenzoxepins/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-13/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Mast Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Olopatadine Hydrochloride', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2003.12.008 [doi]', 'S000629520300947X [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Apr 1;67(7):1315-26. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.12.008.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclopentenone prostaglandins of the J series, prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ(2)) and 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), are thought to be derivatives of PGD(2). In this study, the biphasic effects of the PGJ(2) and 15d-PGJ(2) on proliferation and apoptosis in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), a tumor analog of mast cells, were examined. At low concentrations, 1 or 3 microM PGJ(2) and 15d-PGJ(2) induced cell proliferation, respectively. At high concentrations (10-30 microM) both the inhibition of viability and decrease in histamine content in RBL-2H3 cells were dose dependent. These effects were independent of the nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), since troglitazone, an agonist of PPARgamma did not cause any effects in RBL-2H3 cells. Cell death induced by PGJ(2) and 15d-PGJ(2) was the result of apoptotic processes, since RBL-2H3 cells treated with 30 microM of the prostaglandins had condensed nuclei, DNA fragmentation and increase in activities of caspase-3 and -9. Moreover, PGJ(2) or 15d-PGJ(2)-induced apoptotic effects were prevented by the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. In conclusion, the PGJ(2) or 15d-PGJ(2)-induced apoptosis in RBL-2H3 cells occurs mainly via mitochondrial pathways instead of by PPARgamma-dependent mechanisms.","['Emi, Maiko', 'Maeyama, Kazutaka']","['Emi M', 'Maeyama K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Ehime University School of Medicine, Sigenobu-cho, Onsen-gun, Ehime 791-0295, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (15-deoxyprostaglandin J2)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q0U2IGF9CK (cyclopentenone)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']","['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2003/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2003.10.037 [doi]', 'S0006295203009018 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Apr 1;67(7):1259-67. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.10.037.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human, the GSTP1-1 expression is commonly increased in many tumors and involved in the development of antineoplastic drug resistance. Reactive oxygen species are released at inflammation sites and oxidative stress conditions enhance the expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes such as GSTs. Here we investigated the regulation of the GSTP1-1 gene expression in the K562 cell line by nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). By studying GSTP1-1 mRNA expression and NF-kappaB/GSTP1-1 promoter interactions, we showed the implication of NF-kappaB in the GSTP1-1 gene expression and we described a new specific TNFalpha-inducible NF-kappaB binding site upstream of the minimal promoter. Moreover, TNFalpha treatment as well as cotransfection of NF-kappaB signaling pathway intermediates induced an activation of the GSTP1-1 gene promoter in K562 cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of the NF-kappaB site strongly inhibited TNFalpha- and NF-kappaBp65-induced promoter activation. Altogether, we showed that a sequence located at -323/-314 within the GSTP1-1 promoter bound NF-kappaB p50/65 and p65/p65 dimers and that this kappaB site was involved in the regulation of the gene by TNFalpha.","['Morceau, Franck', 'Duvoix, Annelyse', 'Delhalle, Sylvie', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Morceau F', 'Duvoix A', 'Delhalle S', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Recherche sur le Cancer et les Maladies du Sang, Centre Universitaire de Luxembourg, 162A Avenue de la Faiencerie, Luxembourg L-1511, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']","['Binding Sites', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', '*Nitriles', 'Organic Chemicals/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', '*Sulfones', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2003/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2003.10.036 [doi]', 'S0006295203009109 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Apr 1;67(7):1227-38. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.10.036.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constructing a classifier based on gene expression signatures comprising multiple discriminatory molecular markers derived from microarray data analysis is an emerging trend for cancer diagnosis. To identify the best genes for classification using a small number of samples relative to the genome size remains the bottleneck of this approach, despite its promise. We have devised a new method of gene selection with reliability analysis, and demonstrated that this method can identify a more compact set of genes than other methods for constructing a classifier with optimum predictive performance for both small round blue cell tumors and leukemia. High consensus between our result and the results produced by methods based on artificial neural networks and statistical techniques confers additional evidence of the validity of our method.

The data are consistent with prior reports emphasizing attention deficits following CRT, and suggest that attention shifting may be particularly affected by CRT early in life.","['Schatz, Jeffrey', 'Kramer, Joel H', 'Ablin, Arthur R', 'Matthay, Katherine K']","['Schatz J', 'Kramer JH', 'Ablin AR', 'Matthay KK']","['Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA. schatz@sc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Int Neuropsychol Soc,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,9503760,,"['Adolescent', 'Attention/*physiology', 'Brain/*physiopathology/*radiation effects', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'Cues', 'Humans', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Survival', 'Visual Perception/*physiology']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/04/15 05:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2001/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1017/S1355617704102075 [doi]', 'S1355617704102075 [pii]']",ppublish,J Int Neuropsychol Soc. 2004 Mar;10(2):211-20. doi: 10.1017/S1355617704102075.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to define the population of Croatian children aged 0-14 years who were potentially exposed to each of those risks during the war and to investigate any possible association between the exposure and the incidence of haematological malignancies. The authors analyzed the data reported by the Cancer Registry of Croatia during the pre-war period (1986-1990), war period (1991-1995) and post-war period (1996-1999). In the group of 10 counties potentially exposed to depleted uranium and two counties where chemical war damage occurred, no significant difference in incidence of the studied haematological malignancies was noted in comparison to pre-war period. The incidence of lymphatic leukaemia significantly increased in four counties where population mixing had occurred during the war period, supporting the 'mixing theory'. In those counties, the incidence of Hodgkin's lymphoma decreased during and after the war. In Croatia as a whole, decreases in incidence of myeloid leukaemias during war and non-Hodgkin lymphoma after the war were noted.","['Labar, B', 'Rudan, I', 'Ivankovic, D', 'Biloglav, Z', 'Mrsic, M', 'Strnad, M', 'Fucic, A', 'Znaor, A', 'Bradic, T', 'Campbell, H']","['Labar B', 'Rudan I', 'Ivankovic D', 'Biloglav Z', 'Mrsic M', 'Strnad M', 'Fucic A', 'Znaor A', 'Bradic T', 'Campbell H']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Croatia. blabar@iskon.hr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,"['0 (Hazardous Substances)', '0 (Radioactive Pollutants)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Croatia/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hazardous Substances/*toxicity', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prevalence', 'Radioactive Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Registries', 'Uranium/chemistry/*toxicity']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/07/01 05:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/b:ejep.0000013400.65418.60 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2004;19(1):55-60. doi: 10.1023/b:ejep.0000013400.65418.60.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the responsible molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity is associated with cancer cell apoptosis, which may also be the major mechanism responsible for the anticancer effects of green tea polyphenols. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that some fruits and vegetables inhibit tumor cell proteasome activity and that this inhibition contributes to their cancer-preventative activities. We report that the extracts of apple and grape are more potent than onion, tomato and celery in: (i) inhibiting the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity in leukemia Jurkat T cell extract; (ii) accumulating the polyubiquitinated proteins in intact Jurkat T cells; (iii) inducing activation of caspase-3/-7 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in intact Jurkat T cells; and (iv) inducing the appearance of spherical cells preferentially in prostate cancer PC-3 over the normal NIH 3T3 cell line. We also found that strawberry extract had some effect on Jurkat T cell extract and the prostate PC-3 cell line but not on intact Jurkat T cells. Our findings suggest that the proteasome is a cancer-related molecular target for, at least, the extracts of apple, grape and onion, and that the inhibition of proteasome activity by these fruits or vegetable may contribute to their cancer-preventative effects, although other molecular mechanisms may also be involved.","['Chen, Marina S', 'Chen, Di', 'Dou, Q Ping']","['Chen MS', 'Chen D', 'Dou QP']","['The Prevention Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and Department of Pathology, Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tea)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chymotrypsin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Fruit/chemistry/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Tea', 'Vegetables/chemistry/*physiology']",2004/03/12 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/03/12 05:00'],"['2004/03/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/12 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 2004 Jan-Feb;18(1):73-80.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In none of the three cases did a pulmonary function tests demonstrate an obstructive pulmonary disease. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND COURSE: Bone marrow aspiration in one girl showed an acute lymphoblastic leukemia of T-cell immunophenotype with a large mediastinal lymphoma. Lymph node biopsy in the boy demonstrated a nodular sclerosing subtype of Hodgkin's disease. In the other girl a ganglioneuroma was found.

After immunostaining (CD34) and morphometric analysis in comparison with a control group, CML specimens showed an increased vascularity and conspicuous morphological abnormalities of microvessels. A close relationship between microvessels and fiber density was detectable in initial biopsies and also in repeatedly performed examinations following therapy. Monotherapy by imatinib and HU generated a significant reduction of microvessels and reticulin fibers in contrast to changes after IFN administration or combination regimens of IFN and HU. A persistence of numerical and structural anomalies of vasculature was observable even several months after BMT. These anomalies shed some light on disturbances of the stroma compartment after myeloablative therapy. The relationship between BM vascularity and fibers is probably dependent on concomitant changes of megakaryopoiesis as the source of various mediators involved in the development of myelofibrosis and neo-angiogenesis acting within a complex functional network.","['Kvasnicka, H M', 'Thiele, J', 'Staib, P', 'Engels, K', 'Kriener, S', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A']","['Kvasnicka HM', 'Thiele J', 'Staib P', 'Engels K', 'Kriener S', 'Schmitt-Graeff A']","['Zentrum fur Pathologie, Universitat Koln, Joseph-Stelzmann-Strasse 9, 50924 Koln, Germany. hm.kvasnicka@uni-koeln.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*pathology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Reference Values']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00292-003-0677-y [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 2004 Mar;25(2):127-34. doi: 10.1007/s00292-003-0677-y.,IM,Therapie-bedingte Veranderungen der Angiogenese bei Philadelphia-Chromosom-positiver chronischer myeloischer Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SART3 was detected on the cell surface of several B-lineage leukemic cells with different maturation stages, but not on normal peripheral blood B cells.

The activation of JAKs results in the phosphorylation and activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The constitutive activation of JAK/STAT pathway may play an important role in growth and survival of human cancer cells. In this study, we examined whether a chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin could inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway. In ovarian cancer and sarcoma cells that express constitutively active JAK2, cisplatin significantly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of JAK2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, cisplatin also inhibited Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and down-regulated BcL-XL anti-apoptotic protein in the cancer cells tested. In leukemia cells expressing high level of TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, cisplatin dramatically inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of TEL-JAK2 as well. Furthermore, our results have shown that down-regulation of JAK2 by cisplatin might be through modulation of a tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 but not SOCS family members. Taken together, our observations demonstrated that cisplatin down-regulated the JAK/STAT pathway through de-phosphorylation of JAK/STAT in cancer cells.","['Song, Hui', 'Sondak, Vernon K', 'Barber, Dwayne L', 'Reid, Thomas J', 'Lin, Jiayuh']","['Song H', 'Sondak VK', 'Barber DL', 'Reid TJ', 'Lin J']","['Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0936, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/*therapeutic use', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/04/17 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2004 Apr;24(4):1017-26.,IM,,,,,['96714/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correct diagnosis and management are important in order to prevent long-term complications. Furthermore, it appears that HES represents a premalignant state in some patients, and close follow-up is necessary to detect early signs of malignant transformation. Previous studies of patient cohorts have led to the identification of a subgroup of patients with various clinical and biological features of primitive myeloproliferative disease. Patients in this subgroup have a clinically more aggressive disease in terms of organ damage and eventually develop acute myeloid leukemia. Among the remaining patients, it appears that some present an underlying T-cell disorder characterized by overproduction of Th2-type cytokines in vivo. Indeed, lymphocytes belonging to the Th2 subset are implicated in the maturation, activation and recruitment of eosinophils, essentially through the production of IL-5. Such patients appear to present a more benign disease at short term; however, they may develop T-cell lymphoma years after initial diagnosis. Therapy of HES includes glucocorticoids, hydroxyurea and more recently, interferon-alpha. Prednisone is generally recommended initially, followed by hydroxyurea in case of treatment failure. Until now, interferon-alpha has been reserved for refractory cases of HES. Our proposal for a new treatment strategy, based on current understanding of the pathogenesis of different subgroups of HES and on the mechanisms of action of the proposed therapeutic agents, which will be discussed in detail. Moreover, prevention of malignant transformation has become a new subject of concern when considering the beneficial effects of drugs.","['Roufosse, F', 'Bartholome, E', 'Schandene, L', 'Goldman, M', 'Cogan, E']","['Roufosse F', 'Bartholome E', 'Schandene L', 'Goldman M', 'Cogan E']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology and Department of Internal Medicine, Hopital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Spain,Drugs Today (Barc),"Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",101160518,,,2004/03/11 05:00,2004/03/11 05:01,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:01 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['485234 [pii]', '10.1358/dot.1998.34.4.485234 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs Today (Barc). 1998 Apr;34(4):361-73. doi: 10.1358/dot.1998.34.4.485234.,,,,,,,,,,,['(c) 1998 Prous Science.

Both arms allowed additional hydroxyurea to keep the white blood cell count lower than 5 x 10(9)/L. Quality of life data were collected in a subset of patients. Between 1993 and 2001, 407 patients were randomized. At a median follow-up of 53 months, there were no significant differences in overall survival (odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.46), progression-free survival, and complete hematologic or major cytogenetic responses.

During the average 65 months (range, 2-238 months) of follow-up, 5 patients developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and only 1 of 14 patients with MGUS transformed to multiple myeloma (MM). Also, 14 deaths occurred, with only 1 from ESRD but 4 from alkylator-related leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Chemotherapy offered little benefit on renal functions of MGUS or SMM patients.

Topo II poisons form cleavable complexes that are processed to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DNA-PK mediates nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Inhibition of this DSB repair pathway may sensitize cells to topo II poisons. We investigated the effects of a novel DNA-PK inhibitor, NU7026 (2-(morpholin-4-yl)-benzo[h]chomen-4-one), on the response to topo II poisons using K562 leukemia cells. NU7026 (10 microM) potentiated the growth inhibition of idarubicin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, etoposide, amsacrine (mAMSA), and mitroxantrone with potentiation factors at 50% growth inhibition ranging from approximately 19 for mAMSA to approximately 2 for idarubicin (potentiation of etoposide was confirmed by clonogenic assay). In contrast, NU7026 did not potentiate camptothecin or cytosine arabinoside (araC). NU7026 did not affect the levels of etoposide-induced topo IIalpha or beta cleavable complexes. NU7026 alone had no effect on cell cycle distribution, but etoposide-induced accumulation in G2/M was increased by NU7026. A concentration-dependent increase in etoposide-induced DSB levels was increased by NU7026. The mechanism of NU7026 potentiation of topo II poisons involves inhibition of NHEJ and a G2/M checkpoint arrest.","['Willmore, Elaine', 'de Caux, Sarah', 'Sunter, Nicola J', 'Tilby, Michael J', 'Jackson, Graham H', 'Austin, Caroline A', 'Durkacz, Barbara W']","['Willmore E', 'de Caux S', 'Sunter NJ', 'Tilby MJ', 'Jackson GH', 'Austin CA', 'Durkacz BW']","['School of Cell and Molecular Biosciences, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne Medical School, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE2 4HH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (2-(morpholin-4-yl)benzo(h)chromen-4-one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-07-2527 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54593-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 15;103(12):4659-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-07-2527.

The D(H)J(H)-proximal V(H) segments and the D(H)2 gene family were significantly overrepresented. Only 21% of V(H)-J(H) joinings were potentially productive, a finding associated with a trend toward an increased risk of relapse. These results suggest that physical location at the V(H) locus is involved in preferential usage of D(H)J(H)-proximal V(H) segments whereas D(H) and J(H) segment usage is governed by position-independent molecular mechanisms.

Increased in vitro platelet aggregation in response to drugs employed at this stage has been documented. To investigate the presence of an in vivo platelet agonist effect, we studied changes in aggregation patterns of patients with ALL receiving IRT. METHODS: Platelets from 22 children with a new diagnosis of ALL were obtained during IRT once the platelet count reached >100 x 10(9)/L. Platelets were stimulated with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, ristocetin, and epinephrine. Platelet responses were evaluated by optical aggregometry. RESULTS: Percentages of platelet aggregation in ALL patients were as follows: ADP, 89+/-22; collagen, 90+/-24; ristocetin, 84+/-26, and epinephrine, 81+/-20. Percentages in healthy individuals were ADP: 98+/-12; collagen: 105+/-10; ristocetin: 100+/-15, and epinephrine, 98+/-8. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet aggregation with classical agonists was diminished during IRT for ALL of childhood, although it remained within the normal lower limit for age. Considerable heterogeneity in platelet reactivity existed, probably reflecting the presence of several pharmacologically altered platelet subpopulations.

Pathology samples from 155 clinically-suspected NHL cases were evaluated centrally initially using the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) classification in a rapid review (within 2 weeks after surgery/biopsy) and then later at the consensus review (once a year). The samples were subsequently re-classified according to the new World Health Organisation (WHO) classification. After the pathology review, 96 (62%) patients were eligible for the study, and 58 of them (60%) had extra-nodal primaries. These NHL cases included B-cell lymphomas (precursor B-cell, 11; Burkitt, 18; diffuse large B-cell, 18; not otherwise specified, 3) and T/Natural Killer (NK)-cell lymphomas (precursor T-cell, 23; anaplastic large cell, 20; others, 3). There was excellent concordance in making the diagnoses (95/96, 99%) and typing (93/96, 97%) of NHL between the rapid and consensus reviews. Five cases, initially diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by the review, were re-classified as Burkitt lymphoma according to the immunocytochemical criteria by the WHO classification. A total of 59 (38%) cases were excluded from the study: they were Hodgkin lymphoma (7), leukaemias (11), reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (20), necrotizing lymphadenitis (7), no consensus diagnosis (1), insufficient materials (2), and others (11). This is the first report of the central pathology review from the paediatric NHL group study in Japan. Because various diseases, either neoplastic or reactive, mimicked NHL, clinically and histopathologically, the central pathology review system was critical and essential for patient enrollment and protocol assignment in our clinical trial.

While clinical investigation of these agents has been largely limited to adults, clinical trials for paediatric cancer patients with many of these agents are now underway. This paper reviews the current status of molecularly-targeted therapies for paediatric malignancies, with special attention given to one class of agents, inhibitors of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase. FLT3 is expressed and activated in many human leukemias, including a significant percentage of pediatric AML and infant and childhood ALL, especially in the setting of MLL gene rearrangement. Activating mutations of FLT3 portend a poor prognosis in pediatric AML. Activated FLT3 can be effectively and selectively targeted by small molecule inhibitors, and these agents have shown promise in early phase clinical trials in adults with AML. Limited preclinical data with FLT3 inhibitors in MLL-rearranged ALL have also been reported. Challenges and future directions for the use of FLT3 inhibitors and other targeted agents in paediatric cancer are discussed.","['Brown, P', 'Small, D']","['Brown P', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21231-1000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']","['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Forecasting', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/physiology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2003/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2003/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2003/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ejca.2003.08.030 [doi]', 'S0959804904000152 [pii]']",ppublish,"Eur J Cancer. 2004 Mar;40(5):707-21, discussion 722-4. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2003.08.030.",IM,,,,,"['CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA91177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA60441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,138,,,,,,,,,,,,

A high percentage of allele matching was obtained for five microsatellite loci, DQCARII (96%), MICA (93%), MIB (89%), C1-3-1 (93%), and D6S510 (97%), that are localized within 100 kb of the HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-B, HLA-C, or HLA-A locus. In contrast, the other eight microsatellites are located farther away from the HLA classical loci and have much lower percentages of allele matching [e.g. tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) (73%), TNFd (74%), D6S273 (64%), C3-2-11 (46%), C5-3-1 (50%), C5-4-5 (63%), C5-2-7 (68%), and D6S265 (81%)]. Therefore, there were at least eight microsatellite markers with relatively high percentages of mismatches in the donor/recipient pairs with acute or chronic GVHD, poor graft survival, and leukemia relapse. However, there were no statistically significant associations between mismatched donor-recipient pairs at the 13 microsatellite loci and acute or chronic GVHD, graft survival, and leukemia relapse. Nevertheless, allele matching at the microsatellite TNFd locus near the TNFa gene was found by the Fisher's exact double-sided test to be significantly associated with decreased survival in the grade III/IV acute GVHD group. Overall, these results suggest that the matching of microsatellite polymorphisms within the HLA region, especially the ones farthest from the classical HLA loci, was not useful indicator for the outcome of HSC transplantation from unrelated donors. In this regard, the future determination of the genome-wide microsatellite genotypes in HLA-matched donor-recipient pairs, outside the MHC, may be a better possibility for identifying minor histocompatibility genes in linkage disequilibria with microsatellites as potential predictive markers for the occurrence of acute GVHD and survival rate in HSC transplantation.","['Li, S', 'Kawata, H', 'Katsuyama, Y', 'Ota, M', 'Morishima, Y', 'Mano, S', 'Kulski, J K', 'Naruse, T', 'Inoko, H']","['Li S', 'Kawata H', 'Katsuyama Y', 'Ota M', 'Morishima Y', 'Mano S', 'Kulski JK', 'Naruse T', 'Inoko H']","['Department of Molecular Life Science, Division of Basic Science and Molecular Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa 259-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['200 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0001-2815.2004.00200.x [doi]']",ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 2004 Apr;63(4):362-8. doi: 10.1111/j.0001-2815.2004.00200.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this in vitro study, we report that malignant and normal T cells differ in their susceptibility toward UVA-1 radiation-induced apoptosis. Dose-response studies revealed that malignant CD4+ T cells isolated from a patient with adult T cell leukemia and Sezary's syndrome as well as malignant T cell lines exhibited a significantly higher susceptibility toward UVA-1 radiation-induced apoptosis 4 h (early apoptosis) and 24 h (late apoptosis) after exposure than normal, CD4+ T cells. This difference was specific for UVA-1 irradiation because it was not detected when apoptosis was induced in these cells through exposure to UVB radiation or stimulation with cell-permeable ceramides. It has been shown that UVA-1 radiation-induced T cell apoptosis is initiated through the generation of singlet oxygen. This is in agreement with the present observation that stimulation of unirradiated cells with a singlet oxygen-generating system induced apoptosis in malignant cells to a greater extent than in normal cells. Moreover, downregulation of FAS surface expression in malignant T cells was associated with the inhibition of UVA-1 radiation/singlet oxygen-induced apoptosis in these cells. It was thus of great interest to learn that addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VADfmk decreased and interferon-gamma stimulation, which is known to upregulate caspase levels including caspase-3, increased the sensitivity of T cells toward UVA-1 radiation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, malignant T cells had significantly higher procaspase-3 levels when compared with normal cells. These studies indicate that the susceptibility of human T cells toward UVA-1 radiation-induced apoptosis is related to the availability of caspases such as caspase-3 and that strategies directed at upregulating caspase levels will increase the efficacy of UVA-1 phototherapy.","['Yamauchi, Ritsuko', 'Morita, Akimichi', 'Yasuda, Yoko', 'Grether-Beck, Susanne', 'Klotz, Lars-Oliver', 'Tsuji, Takuo', 'Krutmann, Jean']","['Yamauchi R', 'Morita A', 'Yasuda Y', 'Grether-Beck S', 'Klotz LO', 'Tsuji T', 'Krutmann J']","['Department of Geriatric and Environmental Dermatology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, T-Cell', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology/*radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/04/03 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)30656-4 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0022-202X.2003.22106.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2004 Feb;122(2):477-83. doi: 10.1046/j.0022-202X.2003.22106.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular modeling was used to design and synthesize the epitopes as chimeric constructs with promiscuous T-helper epitopes derived either from the tetanus toxoid (amino acids 947-967) or measles virus fusion protein (amino acids 288-302). Circular dichroism measurements revealed that the peptides had a secondary structure that correlated well with the crystal structure data or predicted structure. The chimeric peptides were then evaluated for their immunogenicity in rabbits or mice. Antibodies against one of the epitopes derived from the gp21 subunit were found to be neutralizing in its ability to inhibit the formation of virus-induced syncytia. These studies underscore the importance of the gp21 transmembrane region for the development of vaccine candidates.

Its expression decreases during differentiation of haematopoietic cells. Of mature blood cells, only chicken and rat thrombocytes express PCLP protein. PCLP expression in human haematopoietic cells has not been studied. Here we demonstrate PCLP mRNA in human CD34+ cells, in lineage committed erythroid, megakaryocyte and myeloid progenitors, in K562 leukaemia cells, and in peripheral blood leucocytes. The mRNA expression level was higher in developing cells than in mature leucocytes. By Northern blotting and cDNA sequencing, the haematopoietic and renal PCLP mRNAs were identical. Of the mobilized CD34+ cells, 28% (mean; range 14-61%) expressed PCLP protein and the majority of PCLP+ cells were CD117+. Almost all of the K562 cells expressed PCLP protein.

In order to learn more about the regulation of this abnormality, LTC4 synthase mRNA expression was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled LTC4 synthase RNA was synthesized and incubated in cytosolic extracts from CML neutrophils, normal neutrophils and eosinophils. LTC4 synthase mRNA was detected in total but not cytoplasmic RNA from normal neutrophils. In contrast, LTC4 synthase mRNA was found in the cytoplasm of CML neutrophils and in normal eosinophils, which also express the enzyme. The DIG-labelled LTC4 synthase RNA was, as opposed to normal neutrophils, degraded in cytosolic extracts from CML neutrophils. The degradation was time dependent and cell concentration dependent. Degradation was also seen in eosinophils, indicating that degradation of LTC4 synthase RNA was correlated to the expression of the protein. This study showed that the difference in expression of LTC4 synthase in normal and CML neutrophils was not because of a total lack of LTC4 synthase mRNA in normal neutrophils. However normal neutrophils lack, in contrast to CML neutrophils, LTC4 synthase mRNA in the cytoplasm. This discrepancy is not caused by a stabilized LTC4 synthase RNA in the cytosol of CML neutrophils. Instead an abnormal degradation of LTC4 synthase RNA was found in the cytosol of CML neutrophils.","['Roos, Cecilia', 'Sjolinder, Mikael', 'Stenke, Leif', 'Tornhamre, Susanne']","['Roos C', 'Sjolinder M', 'Stenke L', 'Tornhamre S']","['Division of Physiological Chemistry II, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 4.4.1.20 (leukotriene-C4 synthase)']","['Cytosol/enzymology', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', '*RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['4848 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04848.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Mar;124(6):739-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04848.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyperleptinaemia has also been demonstrated following cessation of treatment for childhood ALL. Therefore a prospective study was undertaken to evaluate serial changes in percentage bone mineral content (BMC), adiposity and serum leptin concentrations during 2 years of treatment of children with ALL with chemotherapy but without cranial irradiation. DESIGN AND PATIENT: Only patients treated using the MRC ALL 97/ALL 97 (modified 99) protocols for childhood ALL were eligible for entry into the study. A total of 14 patients (seven male, with a median age of 7.5 years (range 3.4-16.7 years) were recruited. Serial dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning was undertaken at diagnosis and during two years of treatment. Serum leptin concentrations were determined at the same time as the scans. RESULTS: Reductions in %BMC were observed at the hip and lumbar spine by 12 months (P < 0.01) and remained low after 24 months of treatment. Subanalysis of %BMC measurements at the hip demonstrated a greater reduction in %BMC at the trochanteric region compared to the femoral neck. The percentage corrected fat mass increased from 6 months whereas the body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) was increased after 24 months of treatment (P < 0.05). Serum leptin concentrations increased following 24 months of therapy (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Children treated for ALL with contemporary regimens have a predisposition to osteopenia, excess adiposity and hyperleptinaemia during treatment without cranial irradiation administration. We speculate that in addition to glucocorticoid administration, leptin resistance may account in part for these observations.","['Davies, J H', 'Evans, B A J', 'Jones, E', 'Evans, W D', 'Jenney, M E M', 'Gregory, J W']","['Davies JH', 'Evans BA', 'Jones E', 'Evans WD', 'Jenney ME', 'Gregory JW']","['Department of Child Health, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK. daviesjh@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,['0 (Leptin)'],"['Adolescent', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leptin/*blood', 'Male', 'Obesity/*complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Prospective Studies']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['1986 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2265.2003.01986.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2004 Mar;60(3):358-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.2003.01986.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New laboratory techniques (CD38, fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) can identify some patients with early-stage CLL at high risk of rapid disease progression. The array of treatment options has expanded in recent years and now includes monoclonal antibodies used alone or in combination with purine nucleoside analogues and alkylating agents, which have culminated in dramatically improved response rates. Supportive care guidelines now include vaccination strategies, surveillance for secondary malignancies, and aggressive management of infectious complications.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 patients with B-CLL were purified and compared with lymph node samples collected from 17 of these patients. Also compared were B cells obtained from peripheral blood samples from 5 healthy controls and B cells from reactive lymph nodes from 3 otherwise healthy persons. The patients were treated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, between January 15,1991, and February 7, 2003. Mononuclear cells were stained by a 2-color (fluorescein isothiocyanate/phycoerythrin) flow cytometric assay using antibodies to the chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, and CCR7) and also to CD19. RESULTS: Of the 45 patients in this study, 20 had Rai stage 0 disease, 12 had stage I disease, 3 had stage II disease, 2 had stage III disease, and 8 had stage IV disease. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the chemokine receptor expression on B-CLL cells was compared with normal controls and was not significantly different, except for an increase in the median expression of CXCR3 (P = .003) and CCR7 (P = .001) on B-CLL cells. We also found a significant increase in the expression of CXCR4 and CCR7 in B-CLL cells from patients with stage IV compared with stage 0 disease (P = .001 and P = .02, respectively). Furthermore, circulating B-CLL cells showed significantly higher expression of CXCR4 and CCR7 when compared with B lymphocytes in lymph nodes (P = .003 and P < .001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The expression of CXCR4 and CCR7 on B-CLL cells correlates with Rai stage. Also, these chemokine receptors may be down-regulated once malignant B cells enter the lymph nodes. To our knowledge, this is the first published report that shows the strong association of Rai stage with CXCR4 and CCR7 expression levels in B-CLL cells.","['Ghobrial, Irene M', 'Bone, Nancy D', 'Stenson, Mary J', 'Novak, Anne', 'Hedin, Karen E', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Ansell, Stephen M']","['Ghobrial IM', 'Bone ND', 'Stenson MJ', 'Novak A', 'Hedin KE', 'Kay NE', 'Ansell SM']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minn 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']","['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/analysis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*metabolism']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(11)62865-6 [pii]', '10.4065/79.3.318 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2004 Mar;79(3):318-25. doi: 10.4065/79.3.318.,IM,,,,,"['CA91542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was found to have hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperuricaemia and acute renal impairment. Skin biopsy was consistent with calcinosis cutis. There was no evidence of metastatic calcification in other organs. TREATMENT: Hypercalcaemia was treated with aggressive hydration and intravenous pamidronate. High doses of analgesics were required for partial pain relief. OUTCOME: Cutaneous lesions proved resistant to early calcium lowering and were a source of constant pain. She succumbed to leukaemia four months later. CONCLUSION: Treatment of calcinosis cutis was unsatisfactory and would have been dependent on the successful treatment of the underlying leukaemia.","['Tan, A W H', 'Ng, H J', 'Ang, P', 'Goh, Y T']","['Tan AW', 'Ng HJ', 'Ang P', 'Goh YT']","['National Skin Centre, Singapore. audreytan@nsc.gov.sg']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,,"['Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*complications', 'Calcinosis/*etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/complications/*etiology']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/06/04 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2004 Jan;33(1):107-9.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the clinical presentation and outcome of 12 adult chickenpox patients requiring intensive care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was performed in an adult medical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated hospital involving consecutive patients with varicella admitted over 4 years (1997-2000). RESULTS: The 12 patients had a mean +/- SD age of 40 +/- 20 (range, 15 to 86) years. Two patients were above 65 years old (aged 73 and 86 years). All but 1 were male. None had previous varicella vaccination. Six patients had direct exposure to persons with chickenpox infection. Four patients had underlying pulmonary pathology: past pulmonary tuberculosis (2), emphysema (1) and recurrent right pleural effusion from autoimmune serositis (1). The mean APACHE II score was 14.2 (range, 6 to 26). Ten patients had varicella pneumonia (of whom 2 had acute respiratory distress syndrome and 5 had acute lung injury), 1 had chickenpox encephalitis and 1 patient presented concomitantly with diabetic ketoacidosis. The median duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) was 11 days (range, less than 1 day to 76 days). Nine patients (75%) required mechanical ventilation (median duration, 14 days; range, less than 1 day to 79 days). All patients were treated with acyclovir. There were 3 deaths (25%); 2 were above 65 years old and 1 was 37 years old with acute myeloid leukaemia on chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with varicella infection requiring intensive care carry significant mortality.

There is little information on cancer incidence among Malays, a low-risk population. The population-based cancer registration system in Singapore offers the opportunity in this regard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of all newly diagnosed cancer cases among Singapore Malay residents in the period 1968 to 1997 was conducted to determine the time trends using data from Singapore Cancer Registry. Age-standardised incidence rates and average annual percentage change, using Poisson regression, were calculated. RESULTS: During the 30-year study period, a total of 9101 incident cases of cancer were diagnosed among Malays in Singapore. The 3 most common sites of cancer were lung, liver and colorectum in males; and breast, colorectum and ovary in females in the period 1983 to 1997. Leukaemia was among the top 10 cancer sites in both sexes. Malays generally experienced lower cancer incidence rates compared to Chinese, but rates have been increasing at 1.5% to 2% annually. Statistically significant increases in incidence were observed for most of the cancer sites. The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma increased, while there were no significant changes in the general population. CONCLUSION: The relatively lower cancer risk among Singapore Malays might be attributed to genetic factors or closer adherence to a more traditional lifestyle. This study provides a baseline for comparisons with other populations with diverse cancer risk patterns in order to obtain a better understanding of possible aetiologic factors.","['Wang, H', 'Seow, A', 'Lee, H P']","['Wang H', 'Seow A', 'Lee HP']","['Department of Community, Occupational and Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,,"['Asia, Southeastern/ethnology', 'Asians/statistics & numerical data', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Singapore/ethnology', 'Urologic Neoplasms/epidemiology']",2004/03/11 05:00,2004/06/04 05:00,['2004/03/11 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2004 Jan;33(1):57-62.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A polymerase-chain-reaction-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay was used to detect the telomerase activity. Patensin induced growth arrest and apoptotic cell death in HL-60 cells. The telomerase activity was inhibited in a time-dependent manner during the patensin-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells, and the expression of bcl-2 was progressively down-regulated by patensin. Inhibition of the telomerase activity of HL-60 cells was closely related to the patensin-induced apoptosis.

Recommendations of the Working Group Geriatric Oncology of the German Society for Haematology and Oncology (DGHO), the Austrian Society for Haematology and Oncology (OGHO) and the German Society for Geriatrics (DGG).",72-82,"While the incidence rate of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is increasing with the age of the patients, the 5-year-survival rates are decreasing in an age-dependent manner. Patients with AML are considered to be old when they have reached the age of 60. This consideration is due to patient- and disease-specific parameters, which reveal differences between older and younger patients with AML. Standard of therapy is a dose-intensive chemotherapy aiming at the induction of complete remission, followed by different kinds of post-remission therapies. A small percentage of patients can be cured by this approach. However, most patients will die within the first 2 years after diagnosis due to resistance or relapse of the disease or therapy-related complications. The improvements achieved in the treatment of patients with AML are mainly restricted to the group of younger patients. The small percentage of patients who are cured, and the high rate of treatment-related mortality in elderly patients with AML give rise to the question which patients benefit from a primarily curative approach, and which should be treated with a palliative approach. The value of a palliative approach has not yet been consistently assessed in clinical trials. Geriatric assessment will be an important tool in clinical trials for elderly patients with AML to be used in the decision making process. There is hope that new classes of drugs and treatment modalities such as inhibitors of signal transduction, monoclonal antibodies, inhibitors of angiogenesis, or allogenic blood stem cell therapy after non-myeloablative conditioning regimens will improve the therapy of elderly patients with AML in the near future.","['Wedding, U', 'Bokemeyer, C', 'Meran, J G']","['Wedding U', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Meran JG']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitat Jena, Germany. ulrich.wedding@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction']",2004/03/10 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/03/10 05:00'],"['2004/03/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000075610 [doi]', '75610 [pii]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2004 Feb;27(1):72-82. doi: 10.1159/000075610.,IM,,,,,,,,68,,"['Copyright 2004 S.

In contrast, little is known about genes altered in complex karyotypic abnormalities. We studied acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with complex karyotypes and abnormal chromosome 21. High-resolution bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array-based comparative genomic hybridization disclosed amplification predominantly in the 25- to 30-megabase (MB) region that harbors the APP gene (26.3 MB) and at position 38.7-39.1 MB that harbors the transcription factors ERG and ETS2. Using oligonucleotide arrays, APP was by far the most overexpressed gene (mean fold change 19.74, P = 0.0003) compared to a control group of AML with normal cytogenetics; ERG and ETS2 also ranked among the most highly expressed chromosome 21 genes. Overexpression of APP and ETS2 correlated with genomic amplification, but high APP expression occurred even in a subset of AML patients with normal cytogenetics (10 of 64, 16%). APP encodes a glycoprotein of unknown function previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease, but not in AML. We hypothesize that APP and the transcription factors ERG and ETS2 are altered by yet unknown molecular mechanisms involved in leukemogenesis.

However, the subsequent development of leukemia in two children with X-linked SCID who were apparently cured after transplantation of retrovirally corrected CD34+ cells has raised concerns regarding the safety of gene therapy approaches utilizing integrating vectors. Nonhuman primates and dogs represent the best available models for gene transfer safety and efficacy and are particularly valuable for evaluation of long-term effects. We have followed 42 rhesus macaques, 23 baboons, and 17 dogs with significant levels of gene transfer for a median of 3.5 years (range 1-7) after infusion of CD34+ cells transduced with retroviral vectors expressing marker or drug-resistance genes. None developed abnormal hematopoiesis or leukemia. Integration site analysis confirmed stable, polyclonal retrovirally marked hematopoiesis, without progression toward mono- or oligoclonality over time. These results suggest that retroviral integrations using replication-incompetent vectors, at copy numbers achieved using standard protocols, are unlikely to result in leukemogenesis and that patient- or transgene-specific factors most likely contributed to the occurrence of leukemia in the X-SCID gene therapy trial.","['Kiem, Hans-Peter', 'Sellers, Stephanie', 'Thomasson, Bobbie', 'Morris, Julia C', 'Tisdale, John F', 'Horn, Peter A', 'Hematti, Peiman', 'Adler, Rima', 'Kuramoto, Ken', 'Calmels, Boris', 'Bonifacino, Aylin', 'Hu, Jiong', 'von Kalle, Christof', 'Schmidt, Manfred', 'Sorrentino, Brian', 'Nienhuis, Arthur', 'Blau, C Anthony', 'Andrews, Robert G', 'Donahue, Robert E', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E']","['Kiem HP', 'Sellers S', 'Thomasson B', 'Morris JC', 'Tisdale JF', 'Horn PA', 'Hematti P', 'Adler R', 'Kuramoto K', 'Calmels B', 'Bonifacino A', 'Hu J', 'von Kalle C', 'Schmidt M', 'Sorrentino B', 'Nienhuis A', 'Blau CA', 'Andrews RG', 'Donahue RE', 'Dunbar CE']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Division of Orcology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']","['Animals', 'Antibodies/chemistry', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dogs', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Leukemia/etiology/*pathology', 'Macaca', 'Papio', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics/therapy', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors']",2004/03/10 05:00,2004/10/09 09:00,['2004/03/10 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ymthe.2003.12.006 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(03)00408-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2004 Mar;9(3):389-95. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2003.12.006.,IM,,,,,"['DK56465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL74162/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several copper compounds, such as NCI-109268 and bis-8-hydroxyquinoline copper(II) [Cu(8-OHQ)(2)], can inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20S proteasome. In human leukemia cells, proteasome inhibition occurs within 15min after treatment, followed by apoptosis. Neither proteasome inhibition nor apoptosis occurs in non-transformed, immortalized human natural killer cells under the same treatment. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction were detected in prostate cancer cells treated with the ligand 8-OHQ alone following pre-treatment with copper(II) chloride. None of these events occurred in cells treated with copper(II) chloride alone, 8-OHQ alone (without growth in copper-enriched media), or nickel(II) chloride pre-treatment followed by 8-OHQ. Furthermore, we found that copper-mediated inhibition of purified 20S proteasome cannot be blocked by a reducing agent and that organic copper compounds do not generate hydrogen peroxide in the cells, suggesting that proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction are not due to copper-mediated oxidative damage of proteins. Our results suggest that certain types of organic ligands could bind to tumor cellular copper, forming potent proteasome inhibitors and apoptosis inducers at copper concentrations found in tumor tissues.","['Daniel, Kenyon G', 'Gupta, Puja', 'Harbach, R Hope', 'Guida, Wayne C', 'Dou, Q Ping']","['Daniel KG', 'Gupta P', 'Harbach RH', 'Guida WC', 'Dou QP']","['Drug Discovery Program, Departments of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Interdisciplinary Oncology, H.

Cells were incubated for 2hr with increasing DNR concentrations and thereafter for 22hr in drug-free medium. Apoptosis was measured by detection of caspase-3-like activity and DNA fragmentation assayed by propidium iodide and flow cytometry. High DNR concentrations initiated faster apoptosis in HL60 cells and in AML cells, as shown by caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation data. DNA fragmentation into small fragments was preceded by the formation of a narrow peak on the left side of the G1 peak, most likely large DNA fragments, but further studies are required for unequivocal confirmation. This peak could easily be misinterpreted as a G1 peak without careful time monitoring. In K562 cells, no left peak was detected, apoptosis was slow and not related to concentration. In AML cells, large interindividual variations were observed in the time course of DNA fragmentation at 0.25microg DNR/mL. In conclusion, our findings support the concept of dose intensification for optimal apoptosis induction as higher doses correlate with earlier and more rapid caspase-3 induction and DNA fragmentation in leukemic cells. The DNA fragmentation assay may be a valuable tool to determine leukemic cells' chemosensitivity to apoptosis.","['Masquelier, Michele', 'Zhou, Qi Feng', 'Gruber, Astrid', 'Vitols, Sigurd']","['Masquelier M', 'Zhou QF', 'Gruber A', 'Vitols S']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute/Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm S-171 76, Sweden. michele.masquelier@ks.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']","['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology']",2004/03/10 05:00,2004/04/13 05:00,['2004/03/10 05:00'],"['2003/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2003.10.025 [doi]', 'S0006295203008669 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Mar 15;67(6):1047-56. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.10.025.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High throughput screens to identify factors which enhance differentiation to particular lineages and promote expansion of precursors in culture are dependent on the development of sensitive and reproducible assays for screening. Here we describe a bioassay to identify factors with cardiomyogenic activity which enhance the yield of cardiomyocytes from undifferentiated stem cells. The assay is based on a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter under the transcriptional control of the 250 bp MLC-2v promoter expressed in pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. We show that reporter expression is limited to developing cardiomyocytes and can be used to determine quantitatively the number of ventricular cardiomyocytes formed in cultures under inducing or non-inducing conditions. This assay differs from all others described previously in that it has an easily quantifiable readout, there is negligible background differentiation in the absence of exogenous cardiogenic factors and it is carried out feeder cell-free. Thus, it is entirely independent of competing differentiation inhibitory factors, such as leukemia inhibitory factor. Patch clamp electrophysiology of the GFP-positive cells confirmed their functional ventricular phenotype and indicated that selection on the basis of GFP would provide cells suitable for transplantation.","['Moore, Jennifer C', 'Spijker, Rene', 'Martens, Anton C', 'de Boer, Teun', 'Rook, Martin B', 'van der Heyden, Marcel A G', 'Tertoolen, Leon G', 'Mummery, Christine L']","['Moore JC', 'Spijker R', 'Martens AC', 'de Boer T', 'Rook MB', 'van der Heyden MA', 'Tertoolen LG', 'Mummery CL']","['Hubrecht Laboratory, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Tropomyosin)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']","['Animals', 'Biomarkers/analysis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Electrophysiology', 'Genes, Reporter/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Rats', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Tropomyosin/analysis']",2004/03/10 05:00,2004/09/25 05:00,['2004/03/10 05:00'],"['2004/03/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1387/ijdb.15005574 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2004 Feb;48(1):47-55. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.15005574.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two months later, MDS progressed to erythroleukemia (French-American-British [FAB]classification, acute myeloid leukemia [AML]-M6), and in December, 2001, she was treated with combined chemotherapy containing aclarubicin, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which improved her clinical symptoms. However, 1 month after the chemotherapy, she developed ALL. The blasts at that time had a markedly basophilic cytoplasm with multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles, and their morphology mimicked that of ALL-L3. The blasts also expressed CD13, a myeloid marker, in addition to lymphoid markers. Southern-blot analysis revealed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, but no additional chromosomal abnormality characteristic of ALL-L3 was detected. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, but she developed tumor lysis syndrome and died of multiple organ failure. Although the precise mechanism of lymphoid transformation is not yet fully understood, this case clinically supports the nature of MDS as a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell disorder.","['Sato, Norihide', 'Nakazato, Tomonori', 'Kizaki, Masahiro', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro']","['Sato N', 'Nakazato T', 'Kizaki M', 'Ikeda Y', 'Okamoto S']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. norihide.satou@pep.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,"['Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",2004/03/10 05:00,2004/04/07 05:00,['2004/03/10 05:00'],"['2004/03/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.03137 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Feb;79(2):147-51. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.03137.,IM,,,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to determine the biological effects and investigate signaling of the TEL/ARG fusion protein, multiple sublines of Ba/F3 cells were generated in which a TEL/ARG complementary DNA was expressed under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Treatment of these cells with doxycycline, a tetracycline analogue, rapidly induced expression of the TEL/ARG protein. TEL/ARG was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and was also found to rapidly induce tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins, including rasGAP, CBL, STAT5, PI3K, SHP2, Dok, and SHC. The Ba/F3-tet-TEL/ARG cells remained interleukin (IL)-3 dependent without doxycycline but with doxycycline displayed a marked reduction in cell death in the absence of IL-3. TEL/ ARG cells also displayed an enhanced proliferative response to IL-3 and to insulin-like growth factor 1. At least in Ba/F3 cells, although the growth rate was much lower compared to that with IL-3, TEL/ARG appeared to induce some cell proliferation as an immediate consequence. Nonetheless, the hyperresponsiveness to growth factors reported here is more likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemia.","['Okuda, Keiko', 'Sato, Yuko', 'Sonoda, Yoshiaki', 'Griffin, James D']","['Okuda K', 'Sato Y', 'Sonoda Y', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Health Sciences and Preventive Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan. keiko_o@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TEL-ARG fusion protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Doxycycline', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2004/03/10 05:00,2004/04/07 05:00,['2004/03/10 05:00'],"['2004/03/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.03125 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Feb;79(2):138-46. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.03125.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was an increase of proerythroblasts in the bone marrow. A large amount of normoblasts (early and intermediate erythroblasts) appeared in the spleen. In the peripheral blood, the white blood cells, reticulocyte and platelet counts increased and RBC count and hematocrit decreased. The degree of abnormalities in the MEL-W group was significantly lower than that in other two groups. Hemorheological measurements indicated that the deformability and orientation of RBCs in MEL and MEL-M groups were impaired, whereas those in MEL-W group did not change significantly. Micropipette aspiration measurement revealed that MEL-W had higher elastic modulus than MEL and MEL-M, indicating that it was more difficult for MEL-W to deform and migrate in vivo.

As a result of two sequential proteolytic cleavages, AbetaPP releases the Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, which accumulates in insoluble plaques in the brain of patients affected by Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Another peptide, a C-terminal fragment named AbetaPP Intracellular Domain (AID), is generated by AbetaPP processing and is released intracellularly. Several functions for AID have been proposed: pro-apoptotic peptide, regulator of calcium homeostasis, molecule involved in transcriptional regulation. Many intracellular proteins, such as Fe65, Jip-1, Shc, Numb and X11alpha, interact with AID and modulate its function by different mechanisms. Here we report the cloning and initial characterization of two isoforms of a novel protein that we named AID Associated protein-1a (AIDA-1a), AIDA-1b and AIDA-1bDeltaAnk. We show that AbetaPP and the AIDA-1 proteins interact in vitro, in living cells and, endogenously, in leukemia cell lines. Transfected AIDA-1a, AIDA-1b and AIDA-1bDeltaAnk localize in different compartments and the intracellular distribution of AIDA-1a can be modified by over-expression of AbetaPP. AIDA-1 proteins are expressed at high levels in the brain; thus, studying their involvement in AbetaPP processing and AID function might give new insights regarding a possible role for these molecules in normal brain development and in the pathogenesis of AD.","['Ghersi, Enrico', 'Vito, Pasquale', 'Lopez, Peter', 'Abdallah, Mona', ""D'Adamio, Luciano""]","['Ghersi E', 'Vito P', 'Lopez P', 'Abdallah M', ""D'Adamio L""]","['Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, 1300 Morris Park Avenue, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Alzheimers Dis,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,9814863,"['0 (ANKS1B protein, human)', '0 (Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']","['Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/*genetics', 'Brain/embryology/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",2004/03/09 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/03/09 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3233/jad-2004-6108 [doi]'],ppublish,J Alzheimers Dis. 2004 Feb;6(1):67-78. doi: 10.3233/jad-2004-6108.,IM,,,,,['R01 AG 22024-01/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY281131', 'GENBANK/AY281132', 'GENBANK/AY283057']",,,,,,,,,

Survivin, a member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis family overexpressed by cancer cells, inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis induced by immune cells. In addition, cancer cells express Fas ligand (FasL) on their surfaces as a counterattack against immune cells. Mechanisms by which cancer cells express FasL, including involvement of survivin, are unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that survivin up-regulated FasL expression and investigated how this might occur. Quantitative immunostaining showed correlation between survivin and FasL protein expression in colon cancer tissues (r=0.79). FasL expression was up-regulated in LS180 colon cancer cells transfected with the survivin gene. Transfectants showed increased cytotoxicity against a Fas-sensitive human T leukemia cell line, Jurkat. In contrast, FasL expression was down-regulated in SW480 cells transfected with a small inhibitory RNA to prevent survivin expression. Survivin gene transfectants showed increased DNA binding of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) to the FasL promoter, and up-regulation of Sp1 phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues; the total amount of Sp1 was unchanged. Thus, survivin enables cancer cells not only to suppress immune cell attack by inhibiting Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling, but to attack immune cells by induction of FasL.","['Asanuma, Koichi', 'Tsuji, Naoki', 'Endoh, Teruo', 'Yagihashi, Atsuhito', 'Watanabe, Naoki']","['Asanuma K', 'Tsuji N', 'Endoh T', 'Yagihashi A', 'Watanabe N']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (fas Receptor)']","['Adjuvants, Immunologic/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/immunology', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism/*physiology', 'Survivin', 'Transcription, Genetic/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2004/03/09 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/03/09 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3922 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Mar 15;172(6):3922-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3922.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Milk fat globule-EGF-factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a glycoprotein secreted by activated macrophages that works as a bridge between apoptotic cells and phagocytes by specifically recognizing phosphatidylserine exposed on apoptotic cells. In this study, we found that developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), originally identified as an embryonic endothelial cell protein that binds alphavbeta3 integrin, is structurally and functionally homologous to MFG-E8. That is, both consist of a signal sequence, two epidermal growth factor domains and two factor VIII-homologous domains (C1 and C2). Del-1 bound to the apoptotic cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine via the factor VIII-homologous domains with an affinity similar to that of MFG-E8. The phagocytic activity of NIH 3T3 cells against apoptotic cells was enhanced by Del-1 through an interaction between the epidermal growth factor domain in Del-1 and alphavbeta3 integrin expressed in the NIH 3T3 cells. Screening of primary macrophages and macrophage cell lines for the expression of MFG-E8 and Del-1 indicated that MFG-E8 and Del-1 are expressed in different sets of macrophages. These results suggest the existence of macrophage subsets that use MFG-E8 or Del-1 differently to engulf apoptotic cells.","['Hanayama, Rikinari', 'Tanaka, Masato', 'Miwa, Keiko', 'Nagata, Shigekazu']","['Hanayama R', 'Tanaka M', 'Miwa K', 'Nagata S']","['Department of Genetics, Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Edil3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mfge8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)']","['Adjuvants, Immunologic/biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', '*Apoptosis/immunology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia P388', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Milk Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', '*Phagocytosis/immunology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology']",2004/03/09 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/03/09 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3876 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Mar 15;172(6):3876-82. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3876.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heparanase, the heparan sulfate-specific endo-beta-glucuronidase, has previously been shown to be a key enzyme in melanoma invasion, yet its involvement in monocyte extravasation has not been elucidated. We examined a potential regulatory mechanism of heparanase in HSPG degradation and transmigration through basement membranes in leukocyte trafficking using human promonocytic leukemia U937 and THP-1 cells. PMA-treated cells were shown to degrade 35S-sulfated HSPG in endothelial extracellular matrix into fragments of an approximate molecular mass of 5 kDa. This was not found with untreated cells. The gene expression levels of heparanase or the enzyme activity of the amount of cell lysates were no different between untreated and treated cells. Immunocytochemical staining with anti-heparanase mAb revealed pericellular distribution of heparanase in PMA-treated cells but not in untreated cells. Cell surface heparanase capped into a restricted area on PMA-treated cells when they were allowed to adhere. Addition of a chemoattractant fMLP induced polarization of the PMA-treated cells and heparanase redistribution at the leading edge of migration. Therefore a major regulatory process of heparanase activity in the cells seems to be surface expression and capping of the enzyme. Addition of the anti-heparanase Ab significantly inhibited enzymatic activity and transmigration of the PMA-treated cells, suggesting that the cell surface redistribution of heparanase is involved in monocyte extravasation through basement membranes.","['Sasaki, Norihiko', 'Higashi, Nobuaki', 'Taka, Tomohiro', 'Nakajima, Motowo', 'Irimura, Tatsuro']","['Sasaki N', 'Higashi N', 'Taka T', 'Nakajima M', 'Irimura T']","['Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Molecular Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/immunology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glucuronidase/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Heparitin Sulfate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/enzymology/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects/enzymology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2004/03/09 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/03/09 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3830 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Mar 15;172(6):3830-5. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3830.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is often characterized by the expression of the MDR1 gene product P-glycoprotein (or gp170) at the membrane of tumor cells. To further propose a potential complementary tool in cancer treatment, the sensitivity of gp170 tumor cells to NK-dependent lysis was investigated. Two kinds of cells were generated from wild-type K562 erythroleukemic cells: the first were derived from Taxol-selected cells and cloned, whereas the second were retrovirally transduced by the cDNA of the MDR1 gene. The last process was also applied to the human embryonal carcinoma cells called Tera-2 cells. First, both cloned and MDR-1 K562 cells appeared highly susceptible to naive NK cell killing. Interestingly, in addition, Tera-2 cells that were not sensitive to NK lysis could be killed when they expressed gp170 at their membranes. In previous data, we demonstrated that NK cell release of bimolecular complexes composed of perforin and platelet-activating factor (PAF) interacting with the PAF-R, which has to be expressed on the target cell membranes, were components of NK tumor cell killing.

In this study we show that an epoxycyclohexenone derivative,(2R,3R,4S)-2,3-epoxy-4-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-6-(1E)-propenyl-cyclohe x-5-en-1-one (ECH) specifically inhibits the FasL-dependent killing pathway in CTL-mediated cytotoxicity. Recently, we have reported that ECH blocks activation of procaspase-8 in the death-inducing signaling complex and thereby prevents apoptosis induced by anti-Fas Ab or soluble FasL. Consistent with this finding, ECH profoundly inhibited Fas-mediated DNA fragmentation and cytolysis of target cells induced by perforin-negative mouse CD4+ CTL and alloantigen-specific mouse CD8+ CTL pretreated with an inhibitor of vacuolar type H+-ATPase concanamycin A that selectively induces inactivation and proteolytic degradation of perforin in lytic granules. However, ECH barely influenced perforin/granzyme-dependent DNA fragmentation and cytolysis of target cells mediated by alloantigen-specific mouse CD8+ CTL. The components of lytic granules and the granule exocytosis pathway upon CD3 stimulation were also insensitive to ECH. In conclusion, our present results demonstrate that ECH is a specific nonpeptide inhibitor of FasL-dependent apoptosis in CTL-mediated cytotoxicity. Therefore, ECH can be used as a bioprobe to evaluate the contributions of two distinct killing pathways in various CTL-target settings.","['Mitsui, Tomokazu', 'Miyake, Yasunobu', 'Kakeya, Hideaki', 'Osada, Hiroyuki', 'Kataoka, Takao']","['Mitsui T', 'Miyake Y', 'Kakeya H', 'Osada H', 'Kataoka T']","['Division of Bioinformatics, Center for Biological Resources and Informatics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '5QOR3YM052 (cyclohexanone)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclohexanones/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/physiology', 'Epoxy Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Exocytosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Isoantigens/physiology', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/metabolism']",2004/03/09 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/03/09 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3428 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Mar 15;172(6):3428-36. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.172.6.3428.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examines the role of ""acute response"" cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta released by AM exposed to ambient particulate matter with a diameter of <10 microm (PM(10)) in amplifying the proinflammatory mediator expression by A549 cells and human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). The results showed that supernatants from human AM incubated 24 h with PM(10) (100 microg/ml) contained more TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, IL-6, and IL-8 than nonexposed AM supernatants. The 3-h treatment of A549 cells with PM(10)-exposed AM supernatants increased TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-8, regulated on activation normal T-cells expressed and secreted (RANTES), and leukemia inhibitory factor mRNA compared with the treatment with nonexposed AM supernatants and, compared with untreated A549 cells, additionally increased ICAM-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA. Preincubating PM(10)-exposed AM supernatants with anti-IL-1 beta antibodies reduced all the above mediators as well as VEGF mRNA expression (P < 0.05), while anti-TNF-alpha antibodies were less effective (P > 0.05), and the combination of the two antibodies most effective. When HBEC were treated similarly, anti-TNF-alpha antibodies had the greatest effect. In A549 cells PM(10)-exposed AM supernatants increased NF-kappa B, activator protein (AP)-1 and specificity protein 1 binding, while anti-TNF-alpha and anti-IL-1 beta antibodies reduced NF-kappa B and AP-1 binding. We conclude that AM-derived TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta provide a major stimulus for the production of proinflammatory mediators by lung epithelial cells and that their relative importance may depend on the type of epithelial cell target.","['Ishii, Hiroshi', 'Fujii, Takeshi', 'Hogg, James C', 'Hayashi, Shizu', 'Mukae, Hiroshi', 'Vincent, Renaud', 'van Eeden, Stephan F']","['Ishii H', 'Fujii T', 'Hogg JC', 'Hayashi S', 'Mukae H', 'Vincent R', 'van Eeden SF']","[""James Hogg iCAPTURE Centre for Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Research, St. Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6Z 1Y6, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Key questions on the optimal management of ET patients were formulated by an Advisory Council (AC) and approved by an Expert Panel (EP) composed of 7 senior hematologists. The AC systematically reviewed the published literature from 1980 to August 2002, and articles were graded according to their internal validity and quality. Using the Delphi technique, the EP was asked to answer the key questions according to the available evidence. From September 2002 to March 2003, four Consensus Conferences were held in accordance with the Nominal Group Technique with the goal of solving residual disagreement on recommendations. RESULTS: The EP provided recommendations on when to start platelet-lowering therapy, the most appropriate platelet-lowering agent, the use of anti-platelet therapy, and the management of women in childbearing age and of pregnant women. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: By using evidence and consensus, recommendations for the treatment of key problems in ET have been issued.

DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted over a 15-year period (1987-2001). The study included 59 patients with hematologic malignancies with a proven or probable mucormycosis admitted in 18 Hematology Divisions in tertiary care or university hospitals. RESULTS: The most frequent sites of infection were lung (64%) and orbito-sinus-facial (24%); cerebral involvement observed in 19% of cases was always associated with other sites of infection. Antifungal treatment was empirically administered in 49 patients (83%); 7 patients underwent radical surgical debridement (12%). Therapy was successful for only 18 patients (37%). Forty-seven patients died within 3 months of the diagnosis of fungal infection: the cause of death was mucormycosis in 41 patients (87%) and progression of hematologic disease in 6 patients (13%). At univariate analysis, the factors that correlated with a positive outcome from infection were the following: male sex, amphotericin B treatment, neutrophil recovery from post-chemotherapy aplasia. At multivariate analysis, the only factor that significantly correlated with recovery from infection was the liposomal amphotericin B treatment. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Mucormycosis is a rare filamentous fungal infection that occurs most frequently in neutropenic patients with acute leukemia. It does not seem to have increased in recent years. Although a reduction of mortality has been observed recently, the mortality rate still remains high.

DESIGN AND METHODS: During this period, a total of 78 EBV-HLH patients were consecutively registered in 3 separate studies. The rates of initial response, reactivation, and survival as well as causes of death were analyzed. The outcome of the patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was also studied. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 43 months, clinical reactivation was noted in 13 patients (19.4%) and a total of 12 patients needed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, of whom 9 are alive and well.

We explored aberrant promoter methylation of genes potentially involved in B-cell malignancies and encoding proteins implicated in DNA repair (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, MGMT), detoxification of environmental xenobiotics (glutathione S-transferase P1, GSTP1), apoptosis regulation (death associated protein kinase, DAP-k and caspase 8, CASP8) and cell cycle control (p73). DESIGN AND METHODS: Three hundred and seventeen B-cell malignancies were investigated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) of MGMT, GSTP1, DAP-k, CASP8 and p73 genes. In selected cases, MSP results were matched to protein expression studies by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. RESULTS: DAP-k promoter methylation occurred at highest frequency in follicular lymphoma (85.0%) and MALT-lymphoma (72.2%). MGMT methylation targeted both precursor B-cell neoplasia (23.8%) and mature B-cell tumors (27.6%). GSTP1 methylation was commonest in hairy cell leukemia (75.0%), follicular lymphoma (55.5%), Burkitt s lymphoma (52.0%), and MALT lymphoma (50.0%). Methylation of p73 and CASP8 was rare or absent. DAP-k and MGMT methylation caused absent protein expression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of MGMT, DAP-k and GSTP1 represents a major pathogenetic event in several B-cell malignancies. In follicular lymphoma and MALT lymphoma, frequent inactivation of the apoptosis extrinsic pathway through DAP-k methylation may reinforce the survival advantage already conferred by deregulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Inactivation of GSTP1 in gastric MALT lymphoma represents an additional mechanism favoring accumulation of reactive oxygen species and lymphomagenesis. Finally, the frequency of GSTP1 aberrant methylation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma prompts studies aimed at verifying the prognostic impact of this epigenetic lesion in these lymphomas.","['Rossi, Davide', 'Capello, Daniela', 'Gloghini, Annunziata', 'Franceschetti, Silvia', 'Paulli, Marco', 'Bhatia, Kishor', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Vitolo, Umberto', 'Pileri, Stefano A', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Carbone, Antonino', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Rossi D', 'Capello D', 'Gloghini A', 'Franceschetti S', 'Paulli M', 'Bhatia K', 'Saglio G', 'Vitolo U', 'Pileri SA', 'Esteller M', 'Carbone A', 'Gaidano G']","['Hematology Unit, Dept. of Medical Sciences and IRCAD, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.67 (fatty acyl ethyl ester synthase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['Acyltransferases/genetics', 'Aneuploidy', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/03/09 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/09 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Feb;89(2):154-64.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A small fraction of patients are resistant to the first line treatment, while most patients relapse within two years of achieving complete remission (CR). No standard treatment exists for refractory or relapsed patients. The GIMEMA group designed a phase II trial for adult ALL patients with refractory or relapsed disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients aged >15 years with primary refractory or relapsed ALL were eligible for this study. The salvage strategy included a single high dose of idarubicin combined with high dose cytarabine, followed by consolidation therapy leading to a stem cell transplant procedure according to donor availability. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2002, 135 patients were enrolled. Seventy-five patients (55%) achieved CR, including 12 Philadelphia-positive cases; 44 patients had persistent leukemia and 16 died during reinduction. Fifty patients received a stem cell transplant: 19 from an HL-A identical sibling, 16 from an unrelated donor, 7 from a haploidentical relative, 2 received cord blood, and 6 had an autotransplant. The median disease-free and overall survival were both short (5.0 and 6.4 months, respectively); however, after a median follow-up of 40 months, 13 patients are alive, 10 of whom are free of disease (9 transplanted), while 3 are alive with leukemia. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The treatment induced CR in a high percentage of poor prognosis patients, thus rendering a transplant procedure feasible in most of them. However, significant rates of transplant-related mortality and post-transplant relapse encourage the search for more effective and less toxic conditioning regimens.","['Camera, Andrea', 'Annino, Luciana', 'Chiurazzi, Federico', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Cascavilla, Nicola', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Marmont, Filippo', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Recchia, Anna', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Rotoli, Bruno', 'Mandelli, Franco']","['Camera A', 'Annino L', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Fazi P', 'Cascavilla N', 'Fabbiano F', 'Marmont F', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Recchia A', 'Vignetti M', 'Rotoli B', 'Mandelli F']","['Hematology, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/chemically induced/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/09 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/09 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Feb;89(2):145-53.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some genotypes of this highly polymorphic enzyme are associated with decreased activity. Previous studies have suggested that individuals with the MTHFR 677TT, 1298AC and 1298CC have a lower risk of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DESIGN AND METHODS: In order to test this association we studied the presence of the C677T and A1298C mutant alleles in 174 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in 110 controls from central Italy. RESULTS: We did not find any association between the different polymorphisms and susceptibility to ALL. In multivariate analysis different genotypes did not show any correlation with the risk of ALL. The adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for MTHFR C677T were 0.69 (0.4-1.19) for 677CT versus 677CC wild type, and 0.99 (0.50-1.97) for 677TT versus 677CC. The corresponding values for MTHFR A1298C were 0.93 (0.56-1.53) for 1298AC versus 1298AA wild type and 1.14 (0.36-3.61) for 1298CC versus 1298AA.

By using a differential display analysis, we isolated MAGI-3 as a Tax1-inducible gene in Rat-1 cells.

MAGI-3 has multiple PDZ domains and interacted with Tax1 but not Tax2 in 293T cells. The interaction of Tax1 with MAGI-3 was dependent on a PDZ domain-binding motif, which is missing in Tax2. The interaction of Tax1 with MAGI-3 altered their respective subcellular localization, and moreover, the interaction correlated well with the high transforming activities of Tax1 in Rat-1 cells relative to Tax2. MAGI-3 mRNA and the allied MAGI-1, but not MAGI-2, were expressed in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines.

We generated a diphtheria toxin (DT) fusion protein composed of the catalytic and translocation domains of DT (DT388) fused to interleukin-3 (IL-3). IL-3 receptors (IL-3R) are overexpressed on blasts from many AML patients. DT388IL-3 showed cytotoxicity to leukemic blasts in vitro and in vivo and minimal damage to normal tissues in nonhuman primate models. However, only a fraction of patient leukemic samples were sensitive to the agent. To enhance the potency and specificity of the DT388IL-3 molecule, we constructed variants with altered residues in the IL-3 moiety. Two of these variants, DT388IL-3[K116W] and DT388IL-3[Delta125-133], were produced and partially purified from Escherichia coli with excellent yields. They showed enhanced binding to the human IL-3R and greater cytotoxicity to human leukemia cell lines relative to wild-type DT388IL-3. Interestingly, the results support a previously hypothesized model for interaction of the C-terminal residues of IL-3 with a hydrophobic patch on the alpha-subunit of IL-3R. Rational modification of the targeting domain based on structural analysis can produce a fusion toxin with increased ability to kill tumor cells. One or both of these variant fusion proteins merit further development for therapy of chemotherapy refractory AML.","['Liu, Tie Fu', 'Urieto, Jeffrey O', 'Moore, Joseph E', 'Miller, Mark S', 'Lowe, A Corinne', 'Thorburn, Andrew', 'Frankel, Arthur E']","['Liu TF', 'Urieto JO', 'Moore JE', 'Miller MS', 'Lowe AC', 'Thorburn A', 'Frankel AE']","['Department of Medicine and Cancer Biology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (diphtheria toxin-interleukin-3 fusion protein, recombinant)']","['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2004/03/09 05:00,2004/05/07 05:00,['2004/03/09 05:00'],"['2003/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2003/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.exphem.2003.11.010 [doi]', 'S0301472X03003977 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Mar;32(3):277-81. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2003.11.010.,IM,,,,,"['R01CA090550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast with adult patients in whom surgical closure of perforation is preferred, non-operative treatment has been the usual approach in children. The present report aims at assessing whether this strategy stands the passage of time. We studied retrospectively the charts of patients treated at our institution for OP between 1991 and 2001. Between these years, we treated 19 episodes of OP in 17 patients aged 5.3 +/- 0,94 years. In 9 cases (4 lye burns, 3 oesophageal atresias, 1 bullous epidermolysis and 1 mucocutaneous candidiasis) OP occurred during dilatation of strictures. Foreign body extraction was the cause in 3 cases, and blunt trauma and sclerosis of varices were the causes in 2 cases each. The last child had multiple gastrointestinal perforation during treatment for leukaemia. Subcutaneous emphysema was seen in 7 instances, pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax in 14, pleural effusion in 9, dyspnoea in 9, severe thoracic pain in 1 and pericardial effusion in 1. The diagnosis was intraoperative in only 2 children but the symptoms and imaging signs prompted vigorous treatment within the first 24 hours in 15 instances. One or more pleural tubes were inserted in 11 cases and pericardial drainage was required once. Perforations closed without direct surgery in 18/19 episodes (16/17 children). Five gastrotomies and 2 jejunostomies were performed and several major abdominal operations were necessary to repair concurrent lesions in a child who sustained severe blunt abdominal trauma and in the one with leukaemic perforations. All these patients survive and all recovered oesophageal function although 2 with intractable lye structures ultimately required oesophageal replacement 6 and 10 months after OP. The only patient in whom direct approach for esophageal necrosis after variceal endosclerosis was unavoidable lost her organ and had a replacement after a successful porto-systemic shunt. CONCLUSIONS: Prompt and aggressive non-operative approach of oesophageal perforations in children allows survival and conservation of the organ and its function in most cases and should remain the first therapeutic choice at this age.","['Rivas, S', 'Martinez, L', 'Hernandez, F', 'Avila, L F', 'Lassaletta, L', 'Murcia, J', 'Olivares, P', 'Fernandez, A', 'Queizan, A', 'Lopez Santamaria, M', 'Tovar, J A']","['Rivas S', 'Martinez L', 'Hernandez F', 'Avila LF', 'Lassaletta L', 'Murcia J', 'Olivares P', 'Fernandez A', 'Queizan A', 'Lopez Santamaria M', 'Tovar JA']","['Departamento de Cirugia Pediatrica, Hospital Infantil ""La Paz"", Madrid.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Cir Pediatr,Cirugia pediatrica : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Pediatrica,8900492,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Esophageal Perforation/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",2004/03/09 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/03/09 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cir Pediatr. 2004 Jan;17(1):3-7.,IM,Perforaciones esofagicas: el tratamiento conservador agresivo como la mejor opcion en la edad pediatrica.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the study objectives was to analyze death causes in Plock and Kutno and in the Plock area--according to environmental criteria. The population of the non-petrochemic polluted city Kutno was chosen as the control group. The previous analysis in 1984-1993 showed increased lymphatic or erythrocyte line leukaemia mortality in Plock population vs Kutno population. Similar situation was observed between the area of increased environmental petrochemical pollution and non-polluted area.

Previously, we reported that arsenic trioxide (As2O3) could be a promising new drug against not only leukemia but also solid tumors. The cytotoxicity of As2O3 occurred through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus inhibiting radical scavenging systems would enhance the therapeutic efficacy of As2O3 provided that normal cells were relatively resistant to such a measure. Here, we report that the combination therapy of As2O3 with L-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO), which inhibits a critical step in glutathione synthesis, effectively enhanced in vitro growth inhibition effect of As2O3 on all 11 investigated cell lines arising from prostate, breast, lung, colon, cervix, bladder, and kidney cancers, compared with As2O3 treatment alone. Furthermore, this combination enhanced cytotoxicity to cell lines from prostate cancer with less toxicity to those from normal prostate. In vitro cytotoxic assay using ROS-related compounds demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a major cytotoxic mediator among ROS molecules. Biochemical analysis showed that combined use of As2O3 and BSO blocked H2O2-scavenging systems including glutathione, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, and that the degree of this blockade was well correlated with intracellular ROS levels and sensitivity to this treatment. Finally, the effectiveness of the combination therapy of As2O3 with BSO was demonstrated with an orthotopic model of prostate cancer metastasis. We propose that the combination therapy of As2O3 with BSO is a valid means of blockade of H2O2-scavenging system, and that the combination of a ROS-generating agent with an inhibitor of major scavenging systems is effective in terms of both efficacy and selectivity. Furthermore, because the effective doses of both compounds are within clinically achievable range, this report will lead to immediate benefit for the development of a new cancer therapy.","['Maeda, H', 'Hori, S', 'Ohizumi, H', 'Segawa, T', 'Kakehi, Y', 'Ogawa, O', 'Kakizuka, A']","['Maeda H', 'Hori S', 'Ohizumi H', 'Segawa T', 'Kakehi Y', 'Ogawa O', 'Kakizuka A']","['Laboratory of Functional Biology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Glutathione/analysis/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2004/03/06 05:00,2005/01/13 09:00,['2004/03/06 05:00'],"['2004/03/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.cdd.4401389 [doi]', '4401389 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2004 Jul;11(7):737-46. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401389.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has led to an increase in the variability of ocular presentations in the form of side effects of the treatment and the ways leukaemic relapses are being first identified as an ocular presentation. Leukaemia may involve many ocular tissues either by direct infiltration, haemorrhage, ischaemia, or toxicity due to various chemotherapeutic agents. Ocular involvement may also be seen in graft-versus-host reaction in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, or simply as increased susceptibility to infections as a result of immunosuppression that these patients undergo. This can range from simple bacterial conjunctivitis to an endophthalmitis. Leukaemia can present as pathology in the adnexae, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens, vitreous, retina, choroid, and optic nerve.

Several studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and the loss of gastrointestinal tract integrity contribute to GVHD, whereas the donor cytotoxic responses are critical for graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) preservation. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is currently in clinical trials as an antitumor agent; it inhibits the activity of histone deacetylases and at low doses exhibits antiinflammatory effects by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Using two well characterized mouse models of BMT, we have studied the effects of SAHA on GVHD severity and GVL activity. Administration of SAHA from day +3 to day +7 after BMT reduced serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines and decreased intestinal histopathology, clinical severity, and mortality from acute GVHD compared with vehicle-treated animals. However, SAHA had no effect on donor T cell proliferative and cytotoxic responses to host antigens in vivo or in vitro. When mice received lethal doses of tumor cells at the time of BMT, administration of SAHA did not impair GVL activity and resulted in significantly improved leukemia-free survival by using two different tumor and donor/recipient combinations. These findings reveal a critical role for histone deacetylase inhibition in the proinflammatory events contributing to GVHD and suggest that this class of pharmacologic agents may provide a strategy to reduce GVHD while preserving cytotoxic T cell responses to host antigens and maintaining beneficial GVL effects.","['Reddy, Pavan', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu', 'Hotary, Kevin', 'Liu, Chen', 'Reznikov, Leonid L', 'Dinarello, Charles A', 'Ferrara, James L M']","['Reddy P', 'Maeda Y', 'Hotary K', 'Liu C', 'Reznikov LL', 'Dinarello CA', 'Ferrara JL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Cancer Center, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0942, USA. reddypr@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']","['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Cytokines/drug effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Immune System/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Mice', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vorinostat']",2004/03/06 05:00,2004/04/24 05:00,['2004/03/06 05:00'],"['2004/03/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0400380101 [doi]', '0400380101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Mar 16;101(11):3921-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0400380101.

Previous studies suggested that pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells could be manipulated in vitro through the CD40-CD40L pathway to increase their immunostimulatory capacity. We extended the APC characterization of CD40L-activated BCP-ALL for their potential use in immunotherapy in a series of 19 patients. Engaging CD40 induced the up-regulation of CCR7 in 7 of 11 patients and then the migration to CCL19 in 2 of 5 patients. As accessory cells, CD40L-activated BCP-ALL induced a strong proliferation response of naive T lymphocytes. Leukemia cells, however, were unable to sustain proliferation over time, and T cells eventually became anergic. After CD40-activation, BCP-ALL cells released substantial amounts of interleukin-10 (IL-10) but were unable to produce bioactive IL-12 or to polarize TH1 effectors. Interestingly, adding exogenous IL-12 induced the generation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting TH1 effectors and reverted the anergic profile in a secondary response. Therefore, engaging CD40 on BCP-ALL cells is insufficient for the acquisition of full functional properties of immunostimulatory APCs. These results suggest caution against the potential use of CD40L-activated BCP-ALL cells as agents for immunotherapy unless additional stimuli, such as IL-12, are provided.","[""D'Amico, Giovanna"", 'Vulcano, Marisa', 'Bugarin, Cristina', 'Bianchi, Giancarlo', 'Pirovano, Gisella', 'Bonamino, Martin', 'Marin, Virna', 'Allavena, Paola', 'Biagi, Ettore', 'Biondi, Andrea']","[""D'Amico G"", 'Vulcano M', 'Bugarin C', 'Bianchi G', 'Pirovano G', 'Bonamino M', 'Marin V', 'Allavena P', 'Biagi E', 'Biondi A']","['Centro Ricerca M.

METHODS: HL-60 cell growth was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tertrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay. Cell cycle kinetics and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry and microscopic examination. In addition, DNA microarrays containing 14,400 EST elements were used to investigate the gene expression pattern of HL-60 cells exposed to paclitaxel 1 micromol/L. RESULTS: Paclitaxel inhibited HL-60 cell growth significantly in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (P<0.01). Marked cell accumulation in G2/M phase and multinucleated cells were also observed after treatment with paclitaxel 0.1 and 1 micromol/L. Among 14400 EST elements, 277 genes were found to be markedly up- or down-expressed in the HL-60 cells treated with paclitaxel 1 micromol/L for 0.5 h, comprising 210 known genes and 67 unknown genes. CONCLUSION: Paclitaxel suppresses the growth of HL-60 cells in vitro by causing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. The results of microarray suggest that paclitaxel initiates apoptosis through multiple mechanisms.","['Wan, Yun-feng', 'Guo, Xue-qing', 'Wang, Zheng-hua', 'Ying, Kang', 'Yao, Ming-hui']","['Wan YF', 'Guo XQ', 'Wang ZH', 'Ying K', 'Yao MH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']","['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology']",2004/03/06 05:00,2004/08/07 05:00,['2004/03/06 05:00'],"['2004/03/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2004 Mar;25(3):378-84.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have taken advantage of lentiviral vectormediated delivery of anti-bcr/abl short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) to downregulate the bcr/abl transcript in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) K562 leukemia cells. This downregulation caused complete inhibition of proliferation of these cells and was accompanied by >90% inhibition of the bcr/abl transcript and p210 protein. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using a lentiviral vector to stably transduce therapeutic shRNAs into leukemia cells for the potential ex vivo purging of Ph+ cells in an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant setting. Furthermore, the robust expression of the shRNAs from our lentiviral vector suggests that this system could be generally useful for the expression of other shRNAs.","['Li, Ming-Jie', 'McMahon, Ross', 'Snyder, David S', 'Yee, Jiing-Kuan', 'Rossi, John J']","['Li MJ', 'McMahon R', 'Snyder DS', 'Yee JK', 'Rossi JJ']","['Division of Molecular Biology, City of Hope Medical Center and Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oligonucleotides,Oligonucleotides,101188415,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/03/06 05:00,2004/04/10 05:00,['2004/03/06 05:00'],"['2004/03/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/154545703322617087 [doi]'],ppublish,Oligonucleotides. 2003;13(5):401-9. doi: 10.1089/154545703322617087.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a well-established and effective therapy for advanced hematologic malignancies. The apparent powerful graft-versus-leukemia effect of SCT led clinicians to apply SCT for the treatment of metastatic solid tumors. The SCT-based graft-versus-tumor reaction in the allogeneic human leukocyte antigen-matched SCT setting is mediated by allo-immune effectorcells directed against tumor-related target antigens. The target molecules involved in the allo-immune graft-versus-tumor reaction are tumor-specific antigens, tumor-associated antigens, and tissue- and cell-specific minor histocompatibility antigens. The power of the minor histocompatibility antigens in the human leukocyte antigen-identical, stem cell-based immunotherapy for malignancies is their ""allo-ness."" As opposed to tumor-associated self antigens, the complexes of MHC and allo-target peptide are likely to be more immunogeneic than the major histocompatibility complex and self-target peptide complexes. Moreover, minor histocompatibility allo-antigens are not subject to self tolerance. Earlier minor histocompatibility antigens were seen as alien entities, disturbing the success of the so ideally matched organ and SCT donor-recipient combinations. To date, minor histocompatibility antigens can be set in the favorable light of useful tools for immunotherapy for cancer. The first clinical application of the hematopoietic minor histocompatibility antigens HA-1 and HA-2 is currently being explored in a stem cell-based setting for hematologic malignancies. Because HA-1 is also expressed on carcinoma cells, a stem cell-based vaccination trial for patients with metastatic breast or renal cancer is about to start as well. The immunotherapeutic potential of minor histocompatibility antigens demands serious searches for new minor histocompatibility antigens and analyses of their phenotype frequency, tissue distribution, and functional membrane expression. The minor histocompatibility antigens meeting the prerequisites for specific immunotherapy for malignancies, such as membrane expression and tissue and/or cell specificity, may offer the curative tools for stem cell-based immunotherapy for various hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies.","['Goulmy, Els']",['Goulmy E'],"['Department of Immunohaematology and Bloodtransfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.

DNA methylation within gene promoters and alterations in histone modifications appear to be primary mediators of epigenetic inheritance in cancer cells. For selected genes, epigenetic changes are tightly related to neoplastic transformation in colorectal cancers (CRCs). In the colon, aberrant DNA methylation arises very early, initially in normal appearing mucosa, and may be part of the age-related field defect observed in sporadic CRCs. Aberrant methylation also contributes to later stages of colon cancer formation and progression through a hypermethylator phenotype termed CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP), which appears to be a defining event in about half of all sporadic tumors. CIMP+ CRCs are distinctly characterized by pathology, clinical and molecular genetic features. Histone modifications, recently recognized as a 'histone code' that affects chromatin structure and gene expression also play an important role in the establishment of gene silencing during tumorigenesis. DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 hypoacetylation and methylation appear to form a mutually reinforcing silencing loop that contributes to tumor-suppressor gene inactivation in CRCs. Understanding epigenetic alterations as a driving force in neoplasia opens new fields of research in epidemiology, risk assessment, and treatment in CRCs.","['Kondo, Yutaka', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Kondo Y', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']","['Chromatin/metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Risk']",2004/03/06 05:00,2004/10/09 09:00,['2004/03/06 05:00'],"['2004/03/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1025806911782 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2004 Jan-Jun;23(1-2):29-39. doi: 10.1023/a:1025806911782.,IM,,,,,"['P01 CA41108-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA59005-7/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA89245-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,90,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined whether these characteristics are acquired together with classical phenotypic markers of differentiated astrocytes. Differentiation of E14 mouse neurospheres into astrocytes was induced by the addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Degree of differentiation was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence for both GFAP and nestin. Neural stem cells expressed nestin but not GFAP, while differentiated astrocytes were immunopositive for GFAP but displayed low levels of nestin expression. A strong increase in the expression of the glutamate transporter GLAST and the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 accompanied phenotypic changes. In addition, active glutamate transport appeared in differentiated astrocytes, as well as their capacity to increase aerobic glycolysis in response to glutamate. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor, but not interleukin-6, triggered the expression of phenotypic and morphological characteristics of astrocytes. In addition, exposure to LIF led to the appearance of metabolic features typically associated with astrocytes. Altogether, our results show that acquisition of some specific metabolic features by astrocytes occurs early in their differentiation process and that LIF represents a candidate signal to induce their expression.","['Brunet, J F', 'Grollimund, L', 'Chatton, J-Y', 'Lengacher, S', 'Magistretti, P J', 'Villemure, J G', 'Pellerin, L']","['Brunet JF', 'Grollimund L', 'Chatton JY', 'Lengacher S', 'Magistretti PJ', 'Villemure JG', 'Pellerin L']","['Service of Neurosurgery, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland. jean-francois.brunet@chuv.hospvd.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,['62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)'],"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/glia.10348 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2004 Apr 1;46(1):8-17. doi: 10.1002/glia.10348.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

TRAIL is known to bind to 4 different receptors, 2 proapoptotic (DR4 and DR5), and 2 potentially antiapoptotic receptors lacking death domains (DcR1 and DcR2). Aberrant promoter methylation and resultant silencing of tumor suppressor genes play an important role in the pathogenesis of many tumor types. Recently aberrant methylation of TRAIL decoy receptors was reported in pediatric tumor cell lines and neuroblastomas. We examined the methylation and expression status of TRAIL receptor genes in cancers of breast, lung, mesothelioma, prostate, bladder, cervix, ovary, brain and in hematopoietic malignancies. Aberrant methylation of DcR1 or DcR2 was present in 70% of primary breast cancers, 31% of primary lung cancers, in 63% of primary malignant mesothelioma (MM), in 60% of prostate cancer, in 42% of bladder cancer, in 100% of cervical cancer, in 43% of ovarian cancer, in 41% of lymphoma, in 26% of leukemia and in 56% of multiple myeloma. Methylation of DR4 and DR5 was rare in all the tumor types examined. Methylation of all the 4 receptors was rare in non malignant tissues. In cell lines, aberrant methylation of DcR1 was present in 11 of 23 (48%) breast, 10 of 27 (37%) lung and 3 of 7 (43%) MM, whereas aberrant methylation of DcR2 was present in 17 of 23 (74%) breast, 13 of 27 (48%) lung and 5 of 7 (71%) MM. The concordance between loss of gene expression and aberrant methylation ranged from 70-100%. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored DcR1 and DcR2 expression in 9 methylated cell lines confirming that aberrant methylation was the cause for silencing of DcR1 and DcR2 expression. Our results demonstrate that DcR1 and DcR2 genes are frequently methylated in various tumor types, and that the role of decoy receptors in tumor pathogenesis needs to be re-evaluated.","['Shivapurkar, Narayan', 'Toyooka, Shinichi', 'Toyooka, Kiyomi O', 'Reddy, Jyotsna', 'Miyajima, Kuniharu', 'Suzuki, Makoto', 'Shigematsu, Hisayuki', 'Takahashi, Takao', 'Parikh, Gunjan', 'Pass, Harvey I', 'Chaudhary, Preet M', 'Gazdar, Adi F']","['Shivapurkar N', 'Toyooka S', 'Toyooka KO', 'Reddy J', 'Miyajima K', 'Suzuki M', 'Shigematsu H', 'Takahashi T', 'Parikh G', 'Pass HI', 'Chaudhary PM', 'Gazdar AF']","['Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 6000 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10D protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)']","['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/04/28 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20041 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 May 1;109(5):786-92. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20041.,IM,,,,,"['5U01 CA 84971-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI/AR 47230/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA 70907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was shown to exert antiapoptotic functions in rodent hepatocytes. We previously showed that primary human hepatocytes (PHH) are a valuable tool for the investigation of apoptotic processes in liver cells. In this study, we analyzed the influence of HGF on CD95-mediated apoptosis of PHH and its molecular determinants. HGF significantly inhibited CD95-mediated apoptosis of PHH as well as cleavage of caspase-8 and poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase. HGF transcriptionally induced the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). In contrary, HGF did not alter the expression levels of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L). HGF activated survival pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase/ERK and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Notably, HGF triggered serine(727)--but not tyrosine(705)--phosphorylation of STAT3. Pretreatment of PHH with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 as well as adenoviral transduction of dominant negative Akt1 prevented HGF-mediated Mcl-1 induction and reversed the antiapoptotic effects of HGF. In conclusion, HGF confers survival of PHH by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. PI3K/Akt activation by HGF results in the induction of antiapoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1. Thus, application of HGF may be a therapeutic approach to prevent CD95-mediated hepatocellular damage in human liver diseases.","['Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning', 'Brenner, Dirk', 'Krueger, Andreas', 'Suess, Dorothee', 'Fas, Stefanie C', 'Frey, Christian R', 'Dax, Andreas', 'Zink, Dorothea', 'Buchler, Peter', 'Muller, Martina', 'Krammer, Peter H']","['Schulze-Bergkamen H', 'Brenner D', 'Krueger A', 'Suess D', 'Fas SC', 'Frey CR', 'Dax A', 'Zink D', 'Buchler P', 'Muller M', 'Krammer PH']","['Tumor Immunology Program, Division of Immunogenetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']","['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hepatocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/04/10 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hep.20138 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2004 Mar;39(3):645-54. doi: 10.1002/hep.20138.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall CR rate equaled 72% for DAC-7 and 69% for DA-7 arm (P=NS). After a single course of DAC-7 induction, the CR rate equaled 64% and was significantly higher compared to 47% in the DA-7 arm (P=0.0009). Median hospitalization time during the induction was 7 days shorter for DAC-7 compared to the DA-7 group (33 vs 40 days, P=0.002). Toxicity was comparable in both groups. The probability of 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) for DAC-7 and DA-7 group equaled 43 and 34%, respectively (P=NS). There was a trend toward higher LFS rate for patients aged >40 years receiving DAC-7 compared with DA-7 regimen (44 vs 28%, P=0.05). This study proves that addition of 2-CdA increases antileukemic potency of DNR+AraC regimen, thus resulting in a higher CR rate after one induction cycle when compared to DA-7, without additional toxicity.

We demonstrated that primary MM cells have the capacity to transmigrate through basement membrane and that this invasiveness was considerably increased when assessed on Matrigel filters coated with BM endothelial cells (EC) (4LHBMEC line) (transendothelial invasion). The isolated MM cells were shown by zymography to secrete matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and anti-MMP-9 antibodies inhibited transendothelial invasion, indicating that MMP-9 is involved in this process. BM EC were found to increase the MMP-9 secretion in MM cells, indicating that EC enhance MM cell invasion through stimulation of MMP-9 secretion. BM EC were found to produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and this cytokine also stimulated MMP-9 secretion in MM cells, while anti-HGF antibodies significantly inhibited EC-stimulated MM cell invasion.

The gene for VPAC1 receptor, a receptor for the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), was thereby isolated and it was shown that this gene was expressed in both CD34+CD38- and CD34+CD38+ CB cells and that the expression levels were higher in CD34+CD38- CB cells. Next, we assessed the effects of VIP on the proliferation of CD34+ CB cells using in vitro culture systems. In serum-free single-cell suspension culture, VIP enhanced clonal growth of CD34+ CB cells in synergy with FLT3 ligand (FL), stem cell factor (SCF), and thrombopoietin (TPO). In serum-free clonogenic assays, VIP promoted myeloid (colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM)) and mixed (CFU-Mix) colony formations. Furthermore, in Dexter-type long-term cultures, VIP increased colony-forming cells at week 5 of culture. These results suggest that VIP functions as a growth-promoting factor of CB-derived hematopoetic progenitor cells.","['Kawakami, M', 'Kimura, T', 'Kishimoto, Y', 'Tatekawa, T', 'Baba, Y', 'Nishizaki, T', 'Matsuzaki, N', 'Taniguchi, Y', 'Yoshihara, S', 'Ikegame, K', 'Shirakata, T', 'Nishida, S', 'Masuda, T', 'Hosen, N', 'Tsuboi, A', 'Oji, Y', 'Oka, Y', 'Ogawa, H', 'Sonoda, Y', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Kawase, I', 'Soma, T']","['Kawakami M', 'Kimura T', 'Kishimoto Y', 'Tatekawa T', 'Baba Y', 'Nishizaki T', 'Matsuzaki N', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Yoshihara S', 'Ikegame K', 'Shirakata T', 'Nishida S', 'Masuda T', 'Hosen N', 'Tsuboi A', 'Oji Y', 'Oka Y', 'Ogawa H', 'Sonoda Y', 'Sugiyama H', 'Kawase I', 'Soma T']","['Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. mkawakami@cit.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide, Type I)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']","['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*analysis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*analysis', 'Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide, Type I', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*pharmacology']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403330 [doi]', '2403330 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 May;18(5):912-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403330.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with chemotherapy-naive stage IIIB or IV NSCLC were randomized to receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, plus either irinotecan 100 mg/m2 or docetaxel 40 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8. Treatment was administered every 3 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 80 enrolled patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, 78 were evaluable for activity and safety. Overall response rates, consisting of partial responses, were 12.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4% to 35%] for gemcitabine-irinotecan and 23.1% (95% CI 10% to 42%) for gemcitabine-docetaxel. Median overall survival was 7.95 months (95% CI 5.2-10.2) and 12.8 months (95% CI 7.9-17.1) for gemcitabine-irinotecan and gemcitabine-docetaxel, respectively. The corresponding estimated 1-year survivals were 23% and 51%, respectively. The 2-year survival rate in arm A (gemcitabine-irinotecan) is not currently estimable. The 2-year survival rate for arm B (gemcitabine-docetaxel) is 22% (95% CI 6% to 37%). Both combinations were well tolerated; the most common hematological toxicity was neutropenia, which occurred in 26% of patients in each treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that gemcitabine plus docetaxel or irinotecan is well tolerated in patients with chemotherapy-naive advanced NSCLC. The survival data with the combination gemcitabine-docetaxel are promising. Gemcitabine-docetaxel combination therapy may be particularly useful for patients who have experienced toxicities with a platinum regimen or in patients who may be more susceptible to platinum-related toxicity.","['Rocha Lima, C M', 'Rizvi, N A', 'Zhang, C', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Crawford, J', 'Govindan, R', 'King, G W', 'Green, M R']","['Rocha Lima CM', 'Rizvi NA', 'Zhang C', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Crawford J', 'Govindan R', 'King GW', 'Green MR']","['University of Miami and Sylvester Cancer Center, Miami, FL 33136, USA. crocha@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Taxoids)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Docetaxel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/07/13 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdh104 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)64150-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2004 Mar;15(3):410-8. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdh104.,IM,,,,,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29165/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,49,,,,['Cancer Leukemia Group B'],,,,,,,,

As a lectin component, the B-chain can also participate in cell signal transduction. It has been reported that abrin induces apoptosis, but the molecular mechanism(s) of this induction have been obscure and several alternative variants have been discussed. The present study demonstrates that abrin-a induces apoptosis in human cultured cell lines, derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Jurkat, CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4, HPB-ALL). The apoptosis was estimated by: phosphatidylserine (PSer) exposure at the cell surface, activation of caspase cascade, and DNA fragmentation. The penetrating of abrin-a into the cells was detected by fluorescent confocal microscopy, using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as a fluorescent marker. It was established that the effect of abrin-a on the apoptosis induction in leukemic cells was dose- and time-dependent. The process was initiated 1 h after abrin-a application (before its penetrating into the cells) and was characterized with PSer translocation from the inner to the outer monolayer of plasma membrane, caspase activation on the first to second hour after beginning of treatment, with maximum on the third to fourth hour, and DNA fragmentation on the fourth to sixth hour, depending of the cell line. The exposure of PSer on the cell surface was detected in Jurkat, CCRF-CEM, and MOLT-4 cells. In HPB-ALL, no significant changes in PSer exposure on the cell surface was observed. Activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 was detected in Jurkat, MOLT-4, and HPB-ALL. Surprisingly, the activity of caspase-3 increased on the first hour after beginning of treatment, while the activity of caspase-8 and -9 began to increase on the second hour. In CCRF-CEM, activation of caspases was not measured, but the apoptosis progressed to DNA fragmentation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. DNA fragmentation was also detected in Jurkat, but not in MOLT-4 and HPB-ALL cells. It seems that the mechanisms of abrin-a-induced apoptosis are different and the progress of apoptosis depends of the cell line. There was a very good positive correlation between the agglutinating activity of abrin-a and development of apoptosis to DNA fragmentation. The time-dependent effects of abrin-a on apoptosis as well as its time-dependent penetration into the cells suggest that the B-chain probably triggers the apoptosis, while the A-chain and breakage of the disulfide bond are responsible for its progress.","['Ohba, Hideki', 'Moriwaki, Sawako', 'Bakalova, Rumiana', 'Yasuda, Seiji', 'Yamasaki, Nobuyuki']","['Ohba H', 'Moriwaki S', 'Bakalova R', 'Yasuda S', 'Yamasaki N']","['Single-Molecule Bioanalysis Laboratory, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST-Shikoku, 2217-14 Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu, Kagawa 761-0395, Japan. h.ooba@aist.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '1393-62-0 (Abrin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['Abrin/isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Abrus/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology', 'Seeds/chemistry', 'Time Factors']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/04/13 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2003/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.taap.2003.11.018 [doi]', 'S0041008X03005428 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2004 Mar 1;195(2):182-93. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2003.11.018.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chlorambucil and then fludarabine were effective initially. However, large transformed cells started to increase in 2000, and the increment became uncontrollable and platelet transfusion dependence developed. He was admitted to our hospital in October 2001.

The genetic alterations or agents related with their pathogenesis are of great relevance to the diagnoses of these entities. Conversely, the category of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma occupies the largest percentage (33%), and is heterogeneous, including several subtypes. The diagnoses of lymphoma subtypes, except for the main entities described above, largely depends on the phenotypic analysis, in addition to their clinical manifestations and histologic evaluations. Therefore, much attention should be paid to the diagnostic pitfalls in the phenotypic analysis of T-cell lymphomas in regard to incorrect classification of lymphoma, due to lack of awareness or incomplete immunophenotypic evaluation; incorrect interpretation of immunophenotypic data, due to failure to correlate them with the other laboratory data; and suboptimal quality of immunohistochemical stains, leading to a wrong conclusion.","['Nakamura, Shigeo']",['Nakamura S'],"['Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Aichi Cancer Center, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The signaling pathways associated with this response to neural injury remain to be elucidated, but recent evidence implicates the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Here, we used the known dopaminergic neurotoxicant, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), to selectively damage striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals and elicit a glial response. We then analyzed changes in gene expression and protein phosphorylation, in vivo, to identify ligands and mediators of the JAK-STAT pathway that accompany glial activation. Administration of MPTP caused rapid tyrosine (Tyr-705) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 in striatal astrocytes, prior to the induction of glial fibrillary acidic protein mRNA and protein. Pharmacological protection of dopaminergic nerve terminals with nomifensine abolished MPTP-mediated phosphorylation and translocation of STAT3 and prevented induction of astrogliosis. Among the Janus kinase family of tyrosine kinases, only JAK2 was associated with the phosphorylation of STAT3 after MPTP and, inhibition of JAK2 by AG490, in vivo, attenuated both the phosphorylation of STAT3 and induction of GFAP. The p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK1/2) also was activated by MPTP, but was not associated with activation of STAT3, because serine (Ser-727) was not phosphorylated. The mRNA for ligands of the gp130-JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M were elevated prior to activation of STAT3 and induction of astrogliosis; neuroprotection with nomifensine blocked these effects of MPTP. Taken together, our results suggest that the gp130-mediated activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway may play a key role in the induction of astrogliosis.","['Sriram, Krishnan', 'Benkovic, Stanley A', 'Hebert, Meleik A', 'Miller, Diane B', ""O'Callaghan, James P""]","['Sriram K', 'Benkovic SA', 'Hebert MA', 'Miller DB', ""O'Callaghan JP""]","['HELD/TMBB, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dopamine Agents)', '0 (Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '1LGS5JRP31 (Nomifensine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9P21XSP91P (1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']","['1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/pharmacology', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism/physiology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Dopamine/metabolism', 'Dopamine Agents/pharmacology', 'Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Ligands', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Nomifensine/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', '*Up-Regulation']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M309304200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)67107-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 May 7;279(19):19936-47. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M309304200.

In the current studies, we used wild-type (WT) S49 T-lymphoma cells and the kin(-) variant (which lacks protein kinase A (PKA)) to examine cAMP/PKA-mediated apoptosis. The cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, increased phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), activated caspase-3, and induced apoptosis in WT but not in kin(-) S49 cells. Using an array of 96 apoptosis-related genes, we found that treatment of WT cells with 8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h induced expression of mRNA for the pro-apoptotic gene, Bim. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that 8-CPT-cAMP increased Bim RNA in WT cells in <2 h and maintained this increase for >24 h. Bim protein expression increased in WT but not kin(-) cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP or with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Both apoptosis and Bim expression were reversible with removal of 8-CPT-cAMP after <6 h. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone also promoted apoptosis and Bim expression in S49 cells. In contrast, both UV light and anti-mouse Fas monoclonal antibody promoted apoptosis in S49 cells but did not induce Bim expression. 8-CPT-cAMP also induced Bim expression and enhanced dexamethasone-promoted apoptosis in human T-cell leukemia CEM-C7-14 (glucocorticoid-sensitive) and CEM-C1-15 (glucocorticoid-resistant) cells; increased Bim expression in 8-CPT-cAMP-treated CEM-C1-15 cells correlated with conversion of the cells from resistance to sensitivity to glucocorticoid-promoted apoptosis. Induction of Bim appears to be a key event in cAMP-promoted apoptosis in both murine and human T-cell lymphoma and leukemia cells and thus appears to be a convergence point for the killing of such cells by glucocorticoids and agents that elevate cAMP.","['Zhang, Lingzhi', 'Insel, Paul A']","['Zhang L', 'Insel PA']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California-San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0636, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""41941-66-6 (8-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)cyclic-3',5'-AMP)"", '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/07/22 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M310643200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)66938-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 May 14;279(20):20858-65. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M310643200.

An early down-regulatory step is located proximal to syk and appears responsible for a transient syk phosphorylation in antigen-stimulated basophils. A second, more distal region appears responsible for the transient activation of the ras-extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway when syk phosphorylation is sustained in anti-IgE-stimulated basophils. As the actin cytoskeleton has been demonstrated to inhibit the early FcepsilonRI signaling in rat basophilic leukemia cells, we explored the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton was responsible for the transience of syk phosphorylation in antigen-stimulated basophils. The inhibition of F-actin polymerization with latrunculin A induced a sustained syk phosphorylation in basophils stimulated with an optimal dose of the antigen benzyl penicilloyl-human serum albumin. However, in the presence of latrunculin A, Erk phosphorylation remained transient after stimulation with the antigen or anti-IgE. Latrunculin A also increased downstream events such as histamine release, leukotriene C(4) release, and the intracellular calcium signal, although some of these effects were not specific for an immunologic stimulus. Our results suggest that the actin cytoskeleton is responsible for down-regulation of FcepsilonRI signaling at a point located proximal to syk phosphorylation. Moreover, the fact that latrunculin A did not result in sustained Erk phosphorylation supports the presence of a second down-regulatory step between syk and Erk that cannot be overcome by a sustained early signal.","['Vilarino, Natalia', 'MacGlashan, Donald W Jr']","['Vilarino N', 'MacGlashan DW Jr']","['Johns Hopkins Asthma and Allergy Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']","['Actins/*physiology', 'Basophils/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cytoskeleton/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1189/jlb.0903431 [doi]', 'jlb.0903431 [pii]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 May;75(5):928-37. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0903431.

It is believed that cyclin B1 accumulates in the S phase of the cell cycle and reaches the maximal level at mitosis but is absent in G(1)-phase cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that cyclin B1 was expressed in the arrested G(1)-phase MOLT-4 lymphocyte leukemia cells and in G(1) phase T-7 transitional tumor cells, as determined by flow cytometry. In addition, we showed that cyclin B1 was detected in the G(1) phase in breast cancer cells from patient tissues and in lymphocytes from patients with leukemia. These findings were confirmed for the first time by postsorting Western blot analysis and by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, by using postsorting Western blotting, we found that cyclin B1 was expressed in different time-window sections of the G(1) phase under different conditions. For the asynchronously growing T-7 cells, cyclin B1 was detected in early G(1) phase, whereas in MOLT-4 cells arrested in G(1)-S phase, cyclin B1 was mainly detected in late G(1) phase. We propose that the cyclin B1 expressed in the G(1) phase may differ from that expressed in the G(2)-M phase, and that this unscheduled type of cyclin B1 may play an important role in tumorigenesis and apoptosis.","['Shen, Manli', 'Feng, Yongdong', 'Gao, Chun', 'Tao, Deding', 'Hu, Junbo', 'Reed, Eddie', 'Li, Qingdi Q', 'Gong, Jianping']","['Shen M', 'Feng Y', 'Gao C', 'Tao D', 'Hu J', 'Reed E', 'Li QQ', 'Gong J']","[""Tongji Cancer Institute and Center for Molecular Medicine, Department of Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)']","['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin B/*analysis/physiology', 'Cyclin B1', 'Female', '*G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/04/01 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-3321 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Mar 1;64(5):1607-10. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-3321.,IM,,,,,"['P20 RR016440/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20RR16440-010003/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine zebrafish pu.1 (zpu.1) expression in subpopulations of blood cells during zebrafish development, we linked a 9-kb zebrafish genomic fragment upstream of the zpu.1 initiator codon to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and microinjected this construct to generate stable transgenic lines. GFP-positive fluorescent myeloid precursors were observed migrating from the anterolateral mesoderm in living embryos from 16 to 28 hours after fertilization (hpf) in a pattern that overlaps the expression pattern of endogenous zpu.1 mRNA. Analysis of larval histologic sections revealed GFP-expressing hematopoietic cells in the developing zebrafish kidney. Flow cytometric analysis of cells from adult whole kidney marrow revealed 2 discrete subpopulations of GFP-positive cells, which after cell sorting exhibited either myeloid or early lymphoid morphology. Thus, the zebrafish zpu.1 promoter fragment used here is capable of driving reporter gene expression in subsets of embryonic and adult hematopoietic cells. These transgenic lines will be useful to dissect the cellular and molecular control of myeloid cell differentiation, and this promoter fragment may prove useful in the development of zebrafish models of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Hsu, Karl', 'Traver, David', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Hagen, Andreas', 'Liu, Ting-Xi', 'Paw, Barry H', 'Rhodes, Jennifer', 'Berman, Jason N', 'Zon, Leonard I', 'Kanki, John P', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Hsu K', 'Traver D', 'Kutok JL', 'Hagen A', 'Liu TX', 'Paw BH', 'Rhodes J', 'Berman JN', 'Zon LI', 'Kanki JP', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Kidney/embryology/physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Zebrafish']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/10/05 09:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-09-3105 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43466-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Sep 1;104(5):1291-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-09-3105.

CLL B cells also express VEGF membrane receptors (VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2), suggesting that they use VEGF as a survival factor. To assess the mechanism of apoptosis resistance related to VEGF, we determined the impact of VEGF on CLL B cells, and we studied the impact of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a known receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, on VEGF receptor status and viability of CLL B cells. VEGF165 significantly increased apoptotic resistance of CLL B cells, and immunoblotting revealed that VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 are spontaneously phosphorylated on CLL B cells. EGCG significantly increased apoptosis/cell death in 8 of 10 CLL samples measured by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. The increase in annexin V/PI staining was accompanied by caspase-3 activation and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage at low concentrations of EGCG (3 microg/mL). Moreover, EGCG suppressed the proteins B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 protein (Bcl-2), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in CLL B cells. Finally, EGCG (3-25 microg/mL) suppressed VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 phosphorylation, albeit incompletely. Thus, these results suggest that VEGF signaling regulates survival signals in CLL cells and that interruption of this autocrine pathway results in caspase activation and subsequent leukemic cell death.","['Lee, Yean K', 'Bone, Nancy D', 'Strege, Ann K', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Lee YK', 'Bone ND', 'Strege AK', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Jelinek DF', 'Kay NE']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']","['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/drug effects/genetics/*physiology']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-08-2763 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43609-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Aug 1;104(3):788-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-08-2763.

Eighteen HBV carriers with malignancy, who were candidates for chemotherapy, were enrolled. Eight subjects (three with leukaemia, four with lymphoma and one with multiple myeloma) were enrolled for prophylactic lamivudine therapy. The remaining 10 patients (six with leukaemia, three with lymphoma and one with breast cancer) were not treated with lamivudine and were used as a control. Lamivudine was administered beginning on the same day as the chemotherapy and was maintained for a year after chemotherapy was discontinued. No HBV-related mortality was observed in either group. In the lamivudine-treated group, none of the subjects had clinical, biochemical or serological evidence of HBV reactivation during the time they were receiving chemotherapy and after their chemotherapy was discontinued. In contrast, five of the 10 HBV carriers not receiving lamivudine therapy experienced a reactivation of HBV infection. This reactivation of HBV was observed during the chemotherapy in four with one individual experiencing a HBV activation 12 months after chemotherapy was discontinued. No lamivudine-related major adverse effects were observed.

The success of radiation therapy using ionizing radiation relies upon the regulation of both the cell cycle and apoptosis, as conferred by the activation of DNA damage-responsive genes. To better understand the key players involved in this response, expression-profiling experiments were performed using custom-made cDNA microarrays. In MOLT-4 lymphoma tumor cells, the induction of target gene products following irradiation supports a major role for p53 as a transcriptional activator, but also invokes questions regarding conditional transcription regulation following irradiation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), p53 binding to chromatin was examined following irradiation using primers that are specific for p53 binding sites in target genes. PCR analysis indicates dynamic target gene binding. Thus, at 8 hours following radiation treatment, the p21 and puma promoter sites were characterized by relative increases in chromatin precipitation, while the bax promoter site was not. Because the binding of p53 to these sites only changed modestly following radiation, other studies were conducted to characterize the presence of constitutive binding to putative p53 DNA binding sites in several other genes.","['Crosby, Meredith E', 'Oancea, Marcela', 'Almasan, Alex']","['Crosby ME', 'Oancea M', 'Almasan A']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']","['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Antisense/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism/radiation effects']",2004/03/05 05:00,2004/03/18 05:00,['2004/03/05 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['72780bba1bf964e3,6048c97615285a9f [pii]', '10.1615/jenvpathtoxoncol.v23.i1.70 [doi]']",ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 2004;23(1):67-79. doi: 10.1615/jenvpathtoxoncol.v23.i1.70.,IM,,,,,"['R01 CA082858-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081504-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81504/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081504/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of mobilization of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow requires cooperative signaling through c-Kit and c-Kit ligand pathway, and these interactions are important in the retention of stem cells within the bone marrow. Therefore, we analyzed c-Kit density on the leukemic myeloblasts of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in relation to white blood cell count (WBC) in the peripheral blood. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates collected from patients with AML and bone marrow aspirates and leukapheresis products after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor blood mobilization from adult volunteers were studied. To determine the level of c-Kit receptor expression, we applied quantitative (relative fluorescence intensity and antibody binding per cell) cytometric methods. RESULTS: Our data showed negative correlation between the level of c-Kit expression intensity on myeloblasts and the number of leukocytes in blood of AML patients. The c-Kit receptor density on myeloblasts in patients with low WBC was significantly stronger than that on myeloblasts in patients with high WBC. In the latter patient group, the density c-Kit receptor on myeloblasts was similar to that on CD34(+) cells in mobilized peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data suggest an involvement of c-Kit receptor in the regulation of leukemic myeloblasts egress to the peripheral blood.","['Wozniak, Jolanta', 'Kopec-Szlezak, Joanna']","['Wozniak J', 'Kopec-Szlezak J']","['Department of Physiopathology, Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Warsaw, Poland. jolwoz@poczta.onet.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

L5178Y cells were exposed to monochromatic light at different wavelengths in the UV-B and UV-A regions. The frequencies of apoptosis induction and reproductive cell death were determined by counting cells with chromatin condensation and by a semi-solidified agarose colony formation assay, respectively. The measured action spectra for the two end-points were similar. The sensitivity decreased steeply with an increase of wavelength in the UV-B region, but showed no further decrement in the UV-A region. The action spectra were slightly steeper than that for the minimum erythematic dose (MED), and were similar to the light-absorption spectrum of DNA in the UV-B region. On the other hand, in the UV-A region, the spectra for both endpoints were close to the MED, but not to DNA absorption spectra. The difference between the measured spectra and that for MED may have been caused by the absorption of the light by the skin. Differences in the time course and morphological difference of apoptosis were found between the UV-B and UV-A region. These results suggest that although DNA damage induced by UV-B light can trigger apoptosis, or lead to reproductive cell death, other damage (membrane, protein and so on) may trigger those effects in the UV-A region.","['Aoki, Mizuho', 'Furusawa, Yoshiya', 'Higashi, Sho-ichi', 'Watanabe, Masakatsu']","['Aoki M', 'Furusawa Y', 'Higashi S', 'Watanabe M']","['National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Inage, Chiba 263-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Photochem Photobiol Sci,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,101124451,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Photobiology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', '*Ultraviolet Therapy']",2004/03/03 05:00,2005/01/13 09:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b313350h [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol Sci. 2004 Mar;3(3):268-72. doi: 10.1039/b313350h.

The main complication of DLI is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Decreasing the dose of DLI is associated with less GVHD but also with a longer interval between treatment and CCR. We postulated that combining alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) with DLI would enable us to decrease the dose of DLI, thereby limiting GVHD, and at the same time to decrease the interval between DLI and CCR for patients with either a hematologic or cytogenetic relapse. For molecular relapses, we hypothesized that because of a lower tumor load, very low doses of DLI without alpha-IFN could be an effective treatment. Two groups of CML-CP patients treated with DLI at a very low dose of 0.5 to 1.0 x 10(7) mononuclear cells per kilogram, containing 2 to 6 x 10(6) CD3+ T cells per kilogram, were analyzed: 13 patients with a cytogenetic or a hematologic relapse after allogeneic SCT (group A) were treated with additional alpha-IFN therapy at a dose of 3 x 10(6) U 5 d/wk, and 8 patients with a molecular relapse were treated without alpha-IFN (group B). Twelve patients from group A reached a CCR. The median interval between DLI and CCR was 7 weeks (range, 5-18 weeks) for group A. All patients with a CCR reached complete donor chimerism at a median of 10 weeks after DLI (range, 6-121 weeks). Eleven patients reached molecular remission at a median of 15 weeks after DLI (range, 8-34 weeks). In group B, all patients reached a molecular remission at a median of 14 weeks (range, 12-29 weeks). Five patients from group A developed acute GVHD grade II to IV and extensive chronic GVHD. In group B, 1 patient developed acute GVHD grade II to IV and subsequently developed extensive chronic GVHD. With a median follow-up of 62 months, 10 patients in group A are alive and in continuous CCR. One patient had a molecular relapse, for which she successfully received additional DLI; another patient reached molecular remission only after 5 doses of DLI. Two patients from group A died of a gram-negative sepsis, and 1 died of an acute myocardial infection. In group B, all patients are alive and in molecular remission with a median follow-up of 20 months. One patient's disease progressed but was successfully treated with DLI plus alpha-IFN. In conclusion, very-low-dose DLI in combination with alpha-IFN as treatment for cytogenetic or hematologic relapses of CML-CP after allogeneic SCT reduced the interval to obtain a CCR with acceptable GVHD when compared with the literature. Patients with a CCR also reached complete donor chimerism and complete molecular remissions. For patients with a molecular relapse, very-low-dose DLI alone is sufficient to induce molecular remissions in most patients and is associated with limited GVHD.","['Posthuma, Eduardus F M', 'Marijt, Erik W A F', 'Barge, Renee M Y', 'van Soest, Ronald A', 'Baas, Inge O', 'Starrenburg, C W J Ingrid', 'van Zelderen-Bhola, Shama L', 'Fibbe, Willem E', 'Smit, Wim M', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Posthuma EF', 'Marijt EW', 'Barge RM', 'van Soest RA', 'Baas IO', 'Starrenburg CW', 'van Zelderen-Bhola SL', 'Fibbe WE', 'Smit WM', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. posthuma@rdgg.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],"['Adult', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/genetics/physiopathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Chimera']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bbmt.2003.11.003 [doi]', 'S1083879103004774 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2004 Mar;10(3):204-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2003.11.003.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-four patients were in first complete remission (CR1), and 125 were in later stages of the disease. Most patients had an HLA-identical sibling donor. Conditioning consisted mainly of total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate. Acute GVHD developed in 143 patients and chronic GVHD in 67. The 5-year probability of relapse and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 32% and 49%, respectively, in patients in CR1, as compared with 53% and 33% in those with more advanced disease. In the multivariate risk factor analysis of relapse, we found that the absence of chronic GVHD (P<.001), absence of herpes simplex virus infection after HSCT (P=.003), combination prophylaxis with methotrexate and cyclosporine (P=.01), and >6 weeks from the diagnosis to CR (P=.025) were independent risk factors for relapse after HSCT. Factors associated with a better relapse-free survival were chronic GVHD (P<.001), ABO blood group mismatch (P=.006), younger patient age (P=.01), and an HLA-matched donor (P=.01). The association between herpes simplex virus infection and a low frequency of relapse is a new observation and may indicate that viral antigens play a role in the induction of an antileukemic effect.","['Nordlander, Anna', 'Mattsson, Jonas', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Leblanc, Katarina', 'Gustafsson, Britt', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Svenberg, Petter', 'Svennilson, Johan', 'Remberger, Mats']","['Nordlander A', 'Mattsson J', 'Ringden O', 'Leblanc K', 'Gustafsson B', 'Ljungman P', 'Svenberg P', 'Svennilson J', 'Remberger M']","['Center for Allogenic Stem Cell Transplantation and Department of Clinical Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/*etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Photopheresis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bbmt.2003.11.002 [doi]', 'S1083879103004762 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2004 Mar;10(3):195-203. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2003.11.002.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-five percent of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 39% of non-CML patients entered remission after DLI therapy. Remission and survival rates were similar for CML patients irrespective of their pre-DLI donor chimerism levels; however, remission occurred sooner in patients with > or =10% pre-DLI donor chimerism. None of the non-CML patients with <10% pre-DLI donor chimerism and 47% of those with > or =10% pre-DLI donor chimerism attained remission. The 2-year survival rates after DLI were 75% for CML and 17% for non-CML patients. We conclude that a low level of donor marrow chimerism is not an adverse prognostic factor for response to DLI in CML patients, but for non-CML patients it may confer worse outcomes. Better methods to augment the response to DLI for patients with hematologic malignancies other than CML that recur after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation are needed, whereas for relapsed CML patients, combination therapies including imatinib mesylate or other promising antileukemic agents may provide outcomes superior to those with DLI alone.","['Chiorean, Elena G', 'DeFor, Todd E', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'McGlave, Philip B', 'Burns, Linda J', 'Brown, Charlotte', 'Miller, Jeffrey S']","['Chiorean EG', 'DeFor TE', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Blazar BR', 'McGlave PB', 'Burns LJ', 'Brown C', 'Miller JS']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera/immunology']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bbmt.2003.10.004 [doi]', 'S1083879103003951 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2004 Mar;10(3):171-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2003.10.004.,IM,,,,,"['P01-CA-65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA-77598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NB originates before birth in the neural crest, which develops into the adrenal medullae and sympathetic ganglia. In the adrenal medulla, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the first enzyme in the pathway of catecholamine synthesis. We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to examine the expression of TH mRNA in NB and Ewing's sarcoma cell lines, small round cell tumors (SRCTs) containing NB, and other clinical tumor samples (osteosarcoma, osteochondroma, and Wilms' tumor). In total, we analyzed 33 clinical tumor samples. TH mRNA was expressed in all three NB cell lines examined, but not in two ES cell lines or in a breast cancer cell line. We detected TH mRNA in 23 of 25 NB tumor samples (92%), but in none of the SRCTs or other clinical tumor samples. This RT-PCR technique showed a sensitivity for TH mRNA of one NB cell per 10(5) negative cells. Based on these results, the detection of TH mRNA is very useful both as a tumor marker for NB and for detecting minimal residual disease.

BHA had cytotoxicity in human monocytic leukemia U937 cells. BHA at 0.75 mM caused nuclear condensation and fragmentation, structural damage in mitochondria, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and internucleosomal DNA cleavage. It induced the activities of caspase-3 and/or -7, -6, -8 and -9, especially high when DEVD-MCA was the substrate (caspase-3 and/or -7). DEVDase activity increased in time- and dose-dependent manner and high activity was observed in lysates of cells treated for 3 h at 0.75 mM. Addition of GSH (reduced glutathione) during the treatment of cells with BHA inhibited the induction of DEVDase activity, and the intracellular GSH level decreased as the concentration of BHA was raised. Intracellular ATP levels decreased in time- and dose-dependent manner when the cells were treated with BHA in the presence or absence of glucose. Enzyme activities involved in the respiratory chain were assayed with the mitochondrial fraction prepared from U937 cells. BHA distinctly inhibited NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) at low concentrations. Succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II) was also inhibited, but to somewhat less extent. Without mitochondrial enzymes, BHA stimulated the ubiquinol-dependent reduction of cytochrome c (complex III), but it might have some detrimental effects on the mitochondrial enzyme reaction of complex III. The inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation might corroborate the mechanistic evidence for apoptosis of leukemia cells by BHA. Cell death induced by BHA is primarily ascribable to apoptosis.","['Okubo, Tomoko', 'Yokoyama, Yoshiko', 'Kano, Kazutaka', 'Kano, Itsu']","['Okubo T', 'Yokoyama Y', 'Kano K', 'Kano I']","['Department of Environmental Health and Toxicology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health, Tokyo, Japan.

Expression of viral proteins and budding of retroviral particles was shown by specific immunostaining and electron microscopy. The viral particles mediated CD4- and co-receptor-specific infection of human cells as demonstrated by PCR and immunostaining in the respective target cells. However, no productive infection resulting in the generation of infectious virus was detected in these cells. Thus, these onco/lentivirus hybrids, although able to initiate single-round infection, were not replication competent.

RA is known to induce expression of the Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR1) gene which propels RA-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation of HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells, motivating the present analysis of transcriptional regulation of blr1 expression by RA. The RA-treated HL-60 cells used here expressed all RA receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) subtypes (as detected by Northern analysis) except RXRgamma. Treatment with RAR- and RXR-selective ligands showed that RARalpha synergized with RXRalpha to transcriptionally activate blr1 expression. A 5'-flanking region capable of supporting RA-induced blr1 activation in HL-60 cells was found to contain a 205-bp sequence in the distal portion that was necessary for transcriptional activation by RA. Within this sequence DNase I footprinting revealed that RA induced binding of a nuclear protein complex to an element containing two GT boxes. Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) and supershift assays showed that this element bound recombinant RARalpha and RXRalpha. Without RA there was neither complex binding nor transcriptional activation. Both GT boxes were needed for binding the complex, and mutation of either GT box caused the loss of transcriptional activation by RA. The ability of this cis-acting RAR-RXR binding element to activate transcription in response to RA also depended on downstream sequences where an octamer transcription factor 1 (Oct1) site and a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc) site between this element and the transcriptional start, as well as a cyclic AMP response element binding factor (CREB) site between the transcriptional start and first exon of the blr1 gene, were necessary. Each of these sites bound its corresponding transcription factor. A transcription factor-transcription factor binding array analysis of nuclear lysate from RA-treated cells indicated several prominent RARalpha binding partners; among these, Oct1, NFATc3, and CREB2 were identified by competition EMSA and supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays as components of the complex. RA upregulated expression of these three factors. In sum the results of the present study indicate that RA-induced expression of blr1 expression depends on a novel RA response element. This cis-acting element approximately 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start consists of two GT boxes that bind RAR and RXR in a nuclear protein complex that also contains Oct1, NFATc3, and CREB2 bound to their cognate downstream consensus binding sites.","['Wang, Jianrong', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Wang J', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (CXCR5 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']","['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutagenesis', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR5', 'Receptors, Chemokine', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.24.6.2423-2443.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Mar;24(6):2423-43. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.6.2423-2443.2004.,IM,,PMC355834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparing genome-wide gene expression profiles of BCR-ABL1+ pre-B ALL and normal bone marrow pre-B cells by serial analysis of gene expression, many genes involved in pre-B cell receptor signaling are silenced in the leukemia cells. Although normal pre-B cells are selected for the expression of a functional pre-B cell receptor, BCR-ABL1+ ALL cells mostly do not harbor a productively rearranged IGH allele. In these cases, we identified traces of secondary VH gene rearrangements, which may have rendered an initially productive VH region gene nonfunctional. Even BCR-ABL1+ ALL cells harboring a functional VH region gene are unresponsive to pre-B cell receptor engagement and exhibit autonomous oscillatory Ca2+ signaling activity. Conversely, leukemia subclones surviving inhibition of BCR-ABL1 by STI571 restore responsiveness to antigen receptor engagement and differentiate into immature B cells expressing immunoglobulin light chains. BCR-ABL1 kinase activity is linked to defective pre-B cell receptor signaling and the expression of a truncated isoform of the pre-B cell receptor-associated linker molecule SLP65. Also in primary leukemia cells, truncated SLP65 is expressed before but not after treatment of the patients with STI571.

Acute leukemia was suspected but bone marrow smear and medullary caryotype were not compatible. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome was thus diagnosed. Corticotherapy was started and failed.

Previous work suggests that the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) can act upstream of p53 to enhance transcription of p53 targets by recruiting p53 to nuclear bodies (NBs). We show that PML is itself a p53 target gene that also acts downstream of p53 to potentiate its antiproliferative effects. Hence, p53 is required for PML induction in response to oncogenes and DNA damaging chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, the PML gene contains p53 binding sites that confer p53 responsiveness to a heterologous reporter and can bind p53 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, cells lacking PML show a reduced propensity to undergo senescence or apoptosis in response to p53 activation, despite the induction of several p53 target genes. These results identify an additional element of PML regulation and establish PML as a mediator of p53 tumor suppressor functions.","['de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Querido, Emmanuelle', 'Narita, Masako', 'Davuluri, Ramana V', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Ferbeyre, Gerardo', 'Lowe, Scott W']","['de Stanchina E', 'Querido E', 'Narita M', 'Davuluri RV', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Ferbeyre G', 'Lowe SW']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1 Bungtown Road, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, p53', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/04/02 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2003/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1097-2765(04)00062-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1097-2765(04)00062-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2004 Feb 27;13(4):523-35. doi: 10.1016/s1097-2765(04)00062-0.,IM,,,,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AG16379/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although their immunosuppressive properties are mediated by the active AZA antimetabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TG), its mechanism of action is largely unknown. In IBD, a significant inverse correlation has been shown between erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels and disease activity, further supporting the proposed immunosuppressive role for 6-TG. Since leukocytes possess quantitatively different purine metabolic pathways compared to erythrocytes, this study aims to measure lymphocyte DNA 6-TG metabolites and correlate levels with the INF-gamma and IL-10 cytokine profile in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Forty-six adult patients with CD, either naive (17) or on long-term (>4-month) AZA therapy (29), had erythrocyte and lymphocyte DNA 6-TG levels measured by reverse-phase HPLC under UV detection (6-TG, 340 nm). Lymphocyte DNA 6-TG was expressed as picomoles per milligram of DNA. Lymphocyte DNA 6-TG metabolite levels were correlated with INF-gamma and IL-10 cytokine profiles using the OptEIA kit (Pharmigen). Lymphocyte DNA 6-TG metabolite levels correlate with erythrocyte 6-TG levels (P < 0.03) but not total patient leukocyte levels. Erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels correlated (P < 0.01) inversely with INF-gamma but not IL-10 cytokine levels. This study suggests a preferential dampening of the TH1 response on exposure to 6-TG and a possible immunosuppressive mechanism of action for AZA. Future studies are needed to determine if cytokine profiles can be used to predict recalcitrant CD to AZA therapy.","['Cuffari, C', 'Li, D Y', 'Mahoney, J', 'Barnes, Y', 'Bayless, T M']","['Cuffari C', 'Li DY', 'Mahoney J', 'Barnes Y', 'Bayless TM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology and Nutrition, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dig Dis Sci,Digestive diseases and sciences,7902782,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']","['Azathioprine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Crohn Disease/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'DNA/analysis', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/03/16 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/b:ddas.0000011614.88494.ee [doi]'],ppublish,Dig Dis Sci. 2004 Jan;49(1):133-7. doi: 10.1023/b:ddas.0000011614.88494.ee.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we demonstrate that, as with the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a classical inhibitor of neutrophil apoptosis, treatment of cells with 5 microM MeHgCl induces de novo protein synthesis and prevents the loss of expression of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein. The expression of the cytoskeletal proteins gelsolin, paxillin and vinculin was similar in MeHgCl- or GM-CSF-induced suppression of apoptosis. However, MeHgCl prevents the degradation of vimentin differently than GM-CSF. Apoptosis was further confirmed by flow cytometry (FITC annexin-V), and by monitoring CD16 cell surface expression. Curiously, unlike GM-CSF, MeHgCl did not prevent CD16 shedding. We conclude that, like GM-CSF, MeHgCl can delay neutrophil apoptosis by inducing de novo protein synthesis and by preventing the loss of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein.

Within the last 20 years, the frequency of autologous and allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells has increased. Hematopoietic growth factors allow the stem cells' mobilization from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood. Quantification of these hematopoietic stem cells by means of flow cytometry can be achieved within hours. A minimum quantity of 2.0 x 10(6) CD34-positive blood stem cells per kg body weight allows hematopoietic reconstitution within 14 days after infusion of the transplant. High-dose therapy followed by the transplantation of autologous blood stem cell transplantation is an established therapy for relapsed high-grade lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Especially in cases of subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative syndromes, myeloablative high-dose therapy followed by the transplantation of allogeneic stem cells leads to a better prognosis. Reduced conditioning before an allogeneic transplantation decreases early lethality. The combination of myeloablative high dose therapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and allogeneic stem cell transplantation will lead to maximum tumor reduction and development of a graft-versus-leukemia reaction with reduced toxicity. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is to be carried out in studies.","['Goldschmidt, Hartmut', 'Egerer, Gerlinde', 'Fruehauf, Stefan', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Goldschmidt H', 'Egerer G', 'Fruehauf S', 'Ho AD']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik V, Universitat Heidelberg. hartmut_goldschmidt@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*therapy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/03/27 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2003 Dec 15;98 Suppl 2:11-4.,IM,Die Stammzelle in der Hamatologie und Onkologie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human carcinomas, tumour cell-fibroblast interactions (TFIs) have been demonstrated to play a role in the up-regulation of MMP levels in tumours, and emmprin is a surface molecule on tumour cells that stimulates nearby fibroblasts to produce MMP-1, 2, and 3. T-cell lymphomas frequently show extranodal organ involvement and skin invasion, but a role for TFIs in their invasion has not been examined in detail. This study investigated TFIs in T-cell lymphomas with special reference to emmprin expression and MMP production. Immunohistochemically, only germinal centre cells and some histiocytes expressed emmprin in non-neoplastic lymph nodes (ten cases), while all T-cell lymphomas [14 cases of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), six cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma, seven cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and nine cases of angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma] expressed emmprin strongly and diffusely. FACS analysis of peripheral blood from normal individuals revealed that small fractions of B-cells, T-cells, and monocytes expressed emmprin, whereas emmprin-expressing T-cells were much increased in number, and expressed this protein to a higher level, in ATLL patients. In vitro co-cultures of emmprin-positive HTLV-1-transformed lymphocytes (MT-2) and emmprin-negative human fibroblasts enhanced the production of pro-MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and active MMP-2, compared with cultures of either cell type alone. This stimulation was inhibited by an activity-blocking peptide against emmprin. Moreover, in histopathological sections from patients with ATL skin involvement, MMP-2 was demonstrated in fibroblasts around infiltrating ATL cells, but not in fibroblasts in non-diseased areas. In conclusion, emmprin is overexpressed by T-lymphoma cells, when compared with normal counterparts, and facilitates MMP-2 production via interactions with fibroblasts, which could play a role in stromal invasion by lymphoma cells.","['Nabeshima, Kazuki', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Nagano, Mitsuyuki', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Toole, Bryan P', 'Tamura, Kazuo', 'Iwasaki, Hiroshi', 'Kikuchi, Masahiro']","['Nabeshima K', 'Suzumiya J', 'Nagano M', 'Ohshima K', 'Toole BP', 'Tamura K', 'Iwasaki H', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BSG protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '136894-56-9 (Basigin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antigens, CD', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Basigin', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Lymph Nodes/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/analysis', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*biosynthesis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Middle Aged']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/04/17 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1518 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2004 Mar;202(3):341-51. doi: 10.1002/path.1518.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Although exposure to environmental agents appears to predispose individuals to this disease, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic susceptibility to environmental exposures in the etiology of childhood ALL. The enzymes GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, CYP1A1, and CYP2E1 are involved in the bioactivation and detoxification of a variety of xenobiotics present in food, organic solvents, tobacco smoke, drugs, alcoholic drinks, pesticides, and environmental pollutants. Polymorphisms in the genes coding for these enzymes have been associated with increased susceptibility to different cancers, including hematologic malignancies. To investigate whether these polymorphisms represent risk-modifying factors for childhood ALL, a study was conducted involving 113 Brazilian patients of childhood ALL and 221 controls with similar ethnic backgrounds. The data revealed that carriers of the rare GSTP1 Val allele were at higher risk of ALL (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-6.8; P = 0.04). No difference was found in the prevalence of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes between ALL patients and the controls, and no association was found between CYP1A1*2 and CYP2E1*3 variants and ALL. However, when the mutant CYP1A1 and CYP2E1 alleles were considered together with the GSTM1 and GSTP1 risk-elevating genotypes, the risk of ALL was increased further (OR = 10.3; 95% CI = 1.0-111.8; P = 0.05), suggesting a combined effect. These results imply that genetic variants of xenobiotic metabolizing genes influence the risk of developing childhood ALL.","['Canalle, Renata', 'Burim, Regislaine V', 'Tone, Luiz G', 'Takahashi, Catarina S']","['Canalle R', 'Burim RV', 'Tone LG', 'Takahashi CS']","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']","['Adolescent', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/*genetics', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/04/13 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/em.20003 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2004;43(2):100-9. doi: 10.1002/em.20003.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Although all nonleukemic cell lines expressed Tax, it could not be detected in 3 of 5 leukemic cell lines, in which nonsense mutation or deletion (60 bp) of tax genes, and DNA methylation in 5'-LTR were identified as the responsible changes.

In ATL cases with genetic changes that could not produce Tax protein, the tax gene was frequently transcribed, suggesting that such cells do not need the transcriptional silencing. Although DNA methylation of 5'-LTR was detected in the fresh ATL cases (19 of 28 cases; 68%), the complete methylation associated with transcriptional silencing was observed only in 4 cases. Since partial methylation could not silence the transcription, and the tax gene transcription was not detected in 27 of 41 cases (66%), the epigenetic change(s) other than DNA methylation is considered to play an important role in the silencing.","['Takeda, Satoshi', 'Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Morikawa, Shigeru', 'Taniguchi, Yuko', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Takeda S', 'Maeda M', 'Morikawa S', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Yasunaga J', 'Nosaka K', 'Tanaka Y', 'Matsuoka M']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (Histones)']","['Acetylation', '*Codon, Nonsense', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, pX/*genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/virology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proviruses', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/04/20 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20007 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Apr 20;109(4):559-67. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20007.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we assessed NF-kappa B in a group of myeloid neoplasms by using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and immunofluorescence methods in freshly isolated leukemia cells. We analyzed 30 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 5 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 3 cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 15 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP), and 2 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC). Unstimulated cells (bone marrow and peripheral blood) from 17 normal donors and apheresis samples from 6 peripheral blood stem cell donors treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were used as controls. When EMSA was used, NF-kappa B was elevated in 14 of 30 (47%) cases of AML, in both cases of CML-BC, and in all reference donors treated with G-CSF, but it was at basal levels in all cases of MDS and CML-CP and in normal donors (P = <.01). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed strong nuclear RelA/NF-kappa B immunoreactivity in AML blasts but not in normal bone marrow. Bcl-2, a downstream molecule, was expressed in cases with elevated NF-kappa B, but not in cases with basal levels of NF-kappa B, suggesting that NF-kappa B is active and provides the cells with survival advantages in vivo.

We examined 22 cases of subcutaneous panniculitis-like lymphoma and classified these into CD56-positive and CD56-negative groups. The 11 CD56-negative cases were mainly in the younger age group and had systemic subcutaneous nodules without ulceration. They exhibited subcutaneous invasion by medium-sized lymphoma cells, scattered erythrophagocytosis, patchy necrosis, and little tumor invasion in the superficial dermis. Their lymphoma cells had characteristics of CD3 epsilon-, CD8-, TcR beta F1-, T-cell intracellular antigen (TIA)1-, and granenzyme B-positive cytotoxic T cells and were negative for apoptosis-promoting proteins CD95 (Fas), Bax, CPP32 (caspase 3), and p53 (DO7). Ten patients were alive despite clinical signs of hemophagocytic syndrome and relapses in 7 cases. The 11 CD56-positive cases had systemic ulcerative skin tumors composed of pleomorphic lymphoma cells with massive necrosis and little erythrophagocytosis involving the subcutis and also often the whole dermis. Their tumor cells were positive for CD3 epsilon, TIA1, granenzyme B, CD95, CD95L (Fas ligand), Bax, and CPP32. Three cases were of the TcR beta F1-positive phenotype, 1 was of the TcR gamma/delta-positive T-cell phenotype, and 6 were of the TcR beta F1- and TcR gamma/delta-negative NK/T-cell phenotype. Six cases were p53 (DO7) positive. Seven cases had complications of liver dysfunction and cytopenia, and 8 died of disease.

We isolated a total of 58 HTLV-1 integration sites using newly developed, adaptor-ligated PCR from 33 ATLL patients and five ATLL cell lines. We compared our data as well as the previously reported ones with the complete human genomic sequence for the location of its placement, structure, and expression of genes nearby the integration site. The chromosomal target for integration was selected at random, but the integration favorably occurred within the transcription units; more than 59.5% of total integration was observed within the transcriptional unit. All inserted genes by HTLV-1 integration were expressed in normal T cells. Upregulation of genes due to viral integration was found in two out of nine ATLL cases; about 4.4- and 102-fold elevated ankyrin-1 ( ANK-1) and gephyrin ( GPHN) gene expressions were observed, respectively. These data suggest that the preferential integration of HTLV-1 into an expressed locus occasionally causes deregulation of corresponding gene, which may lead to leukemogenesis of a fraction of ATLL.","['Ozawa, Tatsuhiko', 'Itoyama, Takahiro', 'Sadamori, Naoki', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Isobe, Masaharu']","['Ozawa T', 'Itoyama T', 'Sadamori N', 'Yamada Y', 'Hata T', 'Tomonaga M', 'Isobe M']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Materials and Biosystem Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama University, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama 930-8555, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Materials and Biosystem Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama University, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama 930-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Nursing, Siebold University of Nagasaki, Nagasaki 851-2195, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Materials and Biosystem Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama University, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama 930-8555, Japan. isobe@eng.toyama-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,"['0 (ANK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ankyrins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (gephyrin)']","['Ankyrins/biosynthesis', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Databases as Topic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'HTLV-I Infections/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*virology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation', '*Virus Integration']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2003/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10038-004-0126-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s10038-004-0126-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2004;49(3):154-165. doi: 10.1007/s10038-004-0126-7.

In general, gene locations and sequences were conserved between the three viruses. However the Californian Myxoma virus was more closely related to South American myxoma virus than to Rabbit fibroma virus based on sequence comparisons and the presence of three genes that have been lost from the Rabbit fibroma virus genome. Compared to the other two viruses, the main difference found in the MSW genome was that the terminal inverted repeats were extended with the duplication of 5 complete open reading frames (M151R, M152R, M153R, M154L, M156R) and partial duplication of one open reading frame (M150R).

We therefore investigated the involvement of TGF-beta1, a potent fibrogenic cytokine, in this process. Immunoassays revealed that TGF-beta1 is present at higher concentrations in BM, serum, and plasma of HCL patients in comparison with healthy donors (P < 0.001). RT-PCR and immunofluorescence studies showed that TGF-beta1 is overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels in peripheral blood, spleen, and BM mononuclear cells and that hairy cells (HCs) are the main source of TGF-beta1. Active TGF-beta1 correlated significantly with grades of BM fibrosis, infiltration with HCs, and serum procollagen type III aminoterminal propeptide (PIIINP). Ex vivo studies demonstrated that TGF-beta1 significantly enhances the production and deposition of reticulin and collagen fibers by BM fibroblasts. In addition, BM plasma of HCL patients increased the synthesis of type I and type III procollagens, the main components of reticulin fibers, at the mRNA and protein levels. This fibrogenic activity of BM plasma was abolished by neutralizing anti-TGF-beta1 antibodies. These results show, for the first time to our knowledge, that TGF-beta1 is highly expressed in HCs and is directly involved in the pathogenesis of BM reticulin fibrosis in HCL.","['Shehata, Medhat', 'Schwarzmeier, Josef D', 'Hilgarth, Martin', 'Hubmann, Rainer', 'Duechler, Markus', 'Gisslinger, Heinz']","['Shehata M', 'Schwarzmeier JD', 'Hilgarth M', 'Hubmann R', 'Duechler M', 'Gisslinger H']","['Department of Hematology, Clinic of Internal Medicine I, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Collagen Type III)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reticulin)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Collagen Type III/chemistry', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Reticulin/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI19540 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2004 Mar;113(5):676-85. doi: 10.1172/JCI19540.,IM,,PMC351317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite early immunological intervention relapse was still significantly more frequent in patients with increasing MC (9/19) than in patients with CC, low-level or decreasing MC (8/62, P<0.005). The probability of 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was 52% for all patients (n=81), 59% for patients with CC, low-level MC, 60% for patients with decreasing MC (n=62), and 28% for patients with increasing MC (n=19, P<0.005). Patients with increasing MC who received early immunological intervention showed a significantly enhanced probability for event-free survival (pEFS 36%, n=15) compared to patients with increasing MC without intervention (pEFS 0%, n=4, P<0.05). These results prove that pediatric AML patients with increasing MC are at highest risk for relapse and that early immunological intervention can prevent relapse in these patients.","['Bader, P', 'Kreyenberg, H', 'Hoelle, W', 'Dueckers, G', 'Kremens, B', 'Dilloo, D', 'Sykora, K-W', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Vormoor, J', 'Gruhn, B', 'Lang, P', 'Greil, J', 'Handgretinger, R', 'Niethammer, D', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Beck, J F']","['Bader P', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Hoelle W', 'Dueckers G', 'Kremens B', 'Dilloo D', 'Sykora KW', 'Niemeyer C', 'Reinhardt D', 'Vormoor J', 'Gruhn B', 'Lang P', 'Greil J', 'Handgretinger R', 'Niethammer D', 'Klingebiel T', 'Beck JF']","[""Department of Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany. peter.bader@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704444 [doi]', '1704444 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2004 Apr;33(8):815-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704444.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At Princess Margaret Hospital, every potential donor is screened with a bone marrow aspirate. The case histories of three asymptomatic potential donors who presented within 1 year with normal complete blood counts, history and physical examination are presented. A 65-year-old male patient was diagnosed with smouldering multiple myeloma, a 72-year-old male patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and a 42-year-old male patient with myelodysplastic syndrome. Bone marrow examination led to the diagnosis in each one of these cases. Of note is that each of the potential donors was discovered to have the same disease as the transplant recipient. In vitro clonogenic hemopoietic progenitor assays were compared to those of 20 normal volunteers. Inferior growth of hemopoietic progenitor colonies in all three was noted. In conclusion, particularly in older donors and donors with potential for familial malignancies, more screening investigations including bone marrow aspiration may be reasonable to investigate for occult hematological malignancies prior to stem cell donation. Clonogenic assays can contribute to detect hemopoietic abnormalities pre transplant.","['Kiss, T L', 'Chang, H', 'Daly, A', 'Messner, H A', 'Jamal, N', 'Spaner, D', 'Rubin, S', 'Lipton, J H']","['Kiss TL', 'Chang H', 'Daly A', 'Messner HA', 'Jamal N', 'Spaner D', 'Rubin S', 'Lipton JH']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital/University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. thomas.kiss@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Examination', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704430 [doi]', '1704430 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2004 Apr;33(8):855-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704430.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total body irradiation (TBI), which is known to generate ROS, is a routine preconditioning procedure prior to BMT. Several studies have demonstrated that amifostine protects normal tissues. In the present report, we investigated the oxidative state of plasma and erythrocytes in 21 patients with hematological malignancies undergoing TBI. The dose fraction was 160 cGy, twice daily (eight sessions). For ROS detection, we used electron spin resonance spectroscopy and spin-trapping technique. In all, 15 patients received amifostine prior to the irradiation and six did not. No free radical signal was detected in the plasma samples spectrum of 15 amifostine-treated patients, and five of six samples of nontreated patients showed ROS signal. Only two of 15 treated patients had mucositis degree higher than 2, whereas five of six nontreated patients suffered this complication. The average hospitalization days in treated and nontreated patients were 23.5 and 29.7, respectively. This work represents an original observation; we found by direct measurements of free radicals that ROS are released during TBI, and confirmed the amifostine radical scavenger activity.","['Facorro, G', 'Sarrasague, M M', 'Torti, H', 'Hager, A', 'Avalos, J S', 'Foncuberta, M', 'Kusminsky, G']","['Facorro G', 'Sarrasague MM', 'Torti H', 'Hager A', 'Avalos JS', 'Foncuberta M', 'Kusminsky G']","['Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Catedra de Fisica y LANAIS-RLBM, Buenos Aires, Argentina. gfacorro@ffyb.uba.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/metabolism', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704427 [doi]', '1704427 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2004 Apr;33(8):793-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704427.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which CDDO induces apoptosis are controversial. We have therefore sought to determine these mechanisms using primary chronic lymphocyte leukemic (CLL) cells and Jurkat cell lines with defined apoptotic abnormalities. In these cells, CDDO induced-apoptosis involved caspase-independent loss in mitochondrial membrane potential followed by caspase processing. The pattern of CDDO-induced caspase processing, defined by use of a caspase inhibitor, strongly suggested that caspase-9 was the apical caspase. Moreover, CDDO induced apoptosis in caspase-8 and FADD-deficient but not in Bcl-xL overexpressing Jurkat cells. In CLL cells, CDDO induced an early release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and Smac that preceded apoptosis. Thus, in both cell types, CDDO induced apoptosis primarily by the intrinsic pathway with caspase-9 as the apical caspase. This has important implications in the design of novel agents for the treatment of CLL and other malignancies.","['Inoue, S', 'Snowden, R T', 'Dyer, M J S', 'Cohen, G M']","['Inoue S', 'Snowden RT', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']","['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403328 [doi]', '2403328 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 May;18(5):948-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403328.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By varying the concentration of tetracycline in growth media, we found that increasing levels of MLL-AF4 expression result in a progressive decrease in growth rate and fraction of S phase cells, paralleled by an increase in percentage of cells expressing CD11b.

We sought to define the frequency and spectrum, and possible prognostic importance, of N- and K-RAS mutations in children with ALL treated with contemporary therapy. Leukemic blast DNA from 870 children was analyzed for the presence of activating mutations in the N- or K-RAS oncogenes using a sensitive mutation detection algorithm. RAS mutations were present in the blasts of 131 (15.1%) pediatric ALL patients. The spectrum of mutations included 81 (9.3%) mutations of codons 12/13 of N-RAS, 12 (1.4%) mutations of codon 61 of N-RAS, 39 (4.5%) mutations of codons 12/13 of K-RAS, and 2 (0.2%) mutations of codon 61 of K-RAS. The presence of N- or K-RAS mutations was not associated with white blood cell count at diagnosis, sex, race, extramedullary testicular involvement, central nervous system disease, or NCI/CTEP ALL Risk Group. Patients with an exon 1 K-RAS mutation (codons 12/13) were significantly younger at diagnosis (P=0.001) and less frequently B-lineage phenotype (P=0.01).

Here we present a fluorescent mitosis biosensor that monitors the time between nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) and re-formation using parallel total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. By tracking tens to hundreds of mitotic events per experiment, we found that the mitotic clock of unsynchronized rat basophilic leukemia cells has a marked precision with 80% of cells completing mitosis in 32 +/- 6 min. This assay further allowed us to observe delays in mitotic timing at Taxol concentrations 100 times lower than previous minimal effective doses, explaining why Taxol is clinically active at low concentrations. Inactivation of the spindle checkpoint by targeting the regulator Mad2 with RNAi consistently shortened mitosis, providing direct evidence that the internal mitotic timing mechanism is much faster in cells that lack the checkpoint.","['Jones, Joshua T', 'Myers, Jason W', 'Ferrell, James E', 'Meyer, Tobias']","['Jones JT', 'Myers JW', 'Ferrell JE', 'Meyer T']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, W200 Clark, 318 Campus Drive, Stanford University Medical School, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,Nat Biotechnol,Nature biotechnology,9604648,,"['Animals', 'Biosensing Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Cell Culture Techniques/instrumentation/methods', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/instrumentation/*methods', 'Microscopy, Video/instrumentation/*methods', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Rats']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2003/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nbt941 [doi]', 'nbt941 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Biotechnol. 2004 Mar;22(3):306-12. doi: 10.1038/nbt941.

We examined the relationship between engraftment, CXCR4 expression on CD34+ and CD34+CD38- cells, and patient (Pt) clinical/laboratory characteristics in 44 samples from 11 Pts. Engraftment, evaluated by Southern blot and CD45 flow cytometric analyses, was observed in murine bone marrow of 6 of 11 Pt samples, ranging from 0.1% to 73.9% by Southern blot and from 0.1%-36.8% by flow cytometry. Poor Pt prognosis was inversely correlated with engraftment; the median overall survival was 95.9 weeks for Pts whose cells did not engraft and 26.1 weeks for those whose cells did engraft (p = 0.012, log-rank test). No other clinical/laboratory variable predicted engraftment. No correlation between the level of CXCR4 expression on AML cells and engraftment was observed. Cells with virtually absent CXCR4 expression were able to engraft, and cells from two Pts with high expression levels of CXCR4 did not engraft. Furthermore, anti-CXCR4 antibody failed to block the engraftment of AML cells into NOD/SCID mice. In conclusion, we demonstrated that CXCR4 is not critical for the engraftment of AML CD34+ cells in NOD/SCID mice.

We therefore hypothesized that cytokine-stimulated EC would induce hematopoietic progenitor cells to develop into mature dendritic cells. To test this theory, human CD34+ cells derived from cord blood or leukapheresis products were cultured with a monolayer of either interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-stimulated human umbilical cord EC. The cells in suspension were analyzed weekly over a period of 6 weeks. IL-1beta supported cell expansion, whereas IL-4 had no effect on cell expansion or DC differentiation. Only TNF-alpha-stimulated EC induced the development of mature, allostimulatory DC with a high expression of CD83, HLA-DR, CD1a, and costimulatory molecules like CD80 and CD86. Acute myeloid leukemia cells from the cell line Kasumi-1 also developed DC-like features when cocultured with TNF-alpha-stimulated EC. Direct contact between endothelial and progenitor cells increased the number of developing DC. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis studies demonstrated a reduced G2M fraction, an increased S fraction, and a decrease in TNF-alpha-dependent apoptosis of DC developing in the presence of endothelial cells. As shown by electron and confocal microscopic studies, intimate interactions between EC and DC occurred, resulting in the internalization of the developing DC within the EC monolayer and a bidirectional exchange of proteins. We conclude that, via the action of TNF-alpha, inflamed human endothelium can induce CD34+ and leukemic cells to differentiate into dendritic cells.","['Moldenhauer, Anja', 'Nociari, Marcelo', 'Lam, George', 'Salama, Abdulgabar', 'Rafii, Shahin', 'Moore, Malcolm A S']","['Moldenhauer A', 'Nociari M', 'Lam G', 'Salama A', 'Rafii S', 'Moore MA']","['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Charite, Universitatsmedizen Berlin, Berlin, Germany. anja.moldenhauer@charite.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD1a antigen)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']","['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.22-2-144 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2004;22(2):144-57. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.22-2-144.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the effects of alpha IFN (IFN-alpha), IFN-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) on replication of Lassa virus compared to the related, but less pathogenic, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Three low-passage Lassa virus strains (AV, NL, and CSF), isolated from humans with mild to fulminant Lassa fever, were tested. Lassa virus replication was inhibited by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, but not TNF-alpha, in Huh7 and Vero cells. The degree of IFN sensitivity of a Lassa virus isolate did not correlate with disease severity in human patients. Furthermore, cytokine effects observed for Lassa virus and LCMV (strains CH-5692, Armstrong, and WE) were similar. To address the mechanisms involved in the IFN effect, we used cell lines in which overexpression of IFN-stimulated proteins promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and Sp100 could be induced. Both proteins reside in PML bodies, a cellular target of the LCMV and Lassa virus Z proteins. Overexpression of PML or Sp100 did not affect replication of either virus. This, together with the previous finding that PML knockout facilitates LCMV replication in vitro and in vivo (M. Djavani, J. Rodas, I. S. Lukashevich, D. Horejsh, P. P. Pandolfi, K. L. Borden, and M. S. Salvato, J. Virol. 75:6204-6208, 2001; W. V. Bonilla, D. D. Pinschewer, P. Klenerman, V. Rousson, M. Gaboli, P. P. Pandolfi, R. M. Zinkernagel, M. S. Salvato, and H. Hengartner, J. Virol. 76:3810-3818, 2002), describes PML as a mediator within the antiviral pathway rather than as a direct effector protein. In conclusion, the high pathogenicity of Lassa virus compared to LCMV is probably not due to increased resistance to the effects of IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma. Both cytokines inhibit replication which is relevant for the design of antiviral strategies against Lassa fever with the aim of enhancing the IFN response.","['Asper, Marcel', 'Sternsdorf, Thomas', 'Hass, Meike', 'Drosten, Christian', 'Rhode, Antje', 'Schmitz, Herbert', 'Gunther, Stephan']","['Asper M', 'Sternsdorf T', 'Hass M', 'Drosten C', 'Rhode A', 'Schmitz H', 'Gunther S']","['Department of Virology, Bernhard-Nocht-Institute of Tropical Medicine, 20359 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Lassa Fever/virology', 'Lassa virus/*drug effects/physiology', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/*drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Vero Cells', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.6.3162-3169.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Mar;78(6):3162-9. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.6.3162-3169.2004.,IM,,PMC353741,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The PK and PD properties of imatinib were investigated during a phase I trial that included 64 adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias. Patients received imatinib orally once or twice daily. PK parameters of imatinib, derived from the plasma concentration-time curves, were determined. PD response, defined as the WBC after 1 month of treatment with imatinib, was used to develop an efficacy model. A maximum inhibition-effect model was used to describe the relationship between reduction in WBC and drug exposure parameters. RESULTS: Imatinib exposure was dose proportional after oral administration for the dose range of 25 to 1,000 mg. There was a 1.5- to three-fold drug accumulation after repeated once-daily dosing. Mean plasma trough concentration was 0.57 microg/mL (approximately 1 micromol/L) 24 hours after administration of 350 mg of imatinib at steady-state, which exceeds the 50% inhibitory concentration required to inhibit proliferation of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic cells. Analysis of PK/PD relationships indicates that the initial hematologic response depends on the administered dose for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: Drug exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) is dose proportional for the dose range of 25 to 1,000 mg, and there is a 1.5- to three-fold drug accumulation at steady-state after once-daily dosing. Analysis of the relationship between PD (WBC reduction) and PK parameters at steady-state indicates that a dose of 400 mg or greater is required for maximal PD effect.","['Peng, Bin', 'Hayes, Michael', 'Resta, Debra', 'Racine-Poon, Amy', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Sawyers, Charles L', 'Rosamilia, Marianne', 'Ford, John', 'Lloyd, Peter', 'Capdeville, Renaud']","['Peng B', 'Hayes M', 'Resta D', 'Racine-Poon A', 'Druker BJ', 'Talpaz M', 'Sawyers CL', 'Rosamilia M', 'Ford J', 'Lloyd P', 'Capdeville R']","['Clinical Pharmacology, Novartis, One Health Plaza, Building 419, Room 2368, East Hanover, NJ 07936-1080, USA. bin.peng@pharma.novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']","['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Biological Availability', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', '*Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.03.050 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.03.050 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Mar 1;22(5):935-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.03.050.,IM,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 1;23(16):3855-6; author reply 3857-8.

This report describes a 48 year old man with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and a type t(8;21) cytogenetic abnormality. Associated bone marrow mastocytosis (a defined subtype of SM) was only detected after successful polychemotherapy in the state of bone marrow aplasia, and persisted after complete remission of AML. The diagnosis of mastocytosis was based on the demonstration of a multifocal dense mastocytic infiltrate. The atypical mast cells showed prominent spindling and an aberrant immunophenotype, with coexpression of tryptase, chymase, KIT, and CD25-which is expressed only on neoplastic (not normal) mast cells. In addition, the transforming somatic mutation D816V of the c-kit gene was detected. Re-examination of the pretherapeutic (initial) bone marrow revealed a slight diffuse increase in partially spindle shaped mast cells also exhibiting an abnormal immunophenotype, with CD25 expression, although compact mastocytic infiltrates were not detected. Because the D816V mutation was detected in the initial bone marrow specimen, strict application of three minor diagnostic criteria (spindling, CD25, D816V) enabled a diagnosis of SM-AML to be confirmed retrospectively in the initial bone marrow tissue.","['Bernd, H-W', 'Sotlar, K', 'Lorenzen, J', 'Osieka, R', 'Fabry, U', 'Valent, P', 'Horny, H-P']","['Bernd HW', 'Sotlar K', 'Lorenzen J', 'Osieka R', 'Fabry U', 'Valent P', 'Horny HP']","['Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Lubeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']","['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/04/01 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.2003.012864 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2004 Mar;57(3):324-8. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2003.012864.,IM,,PMC1770248,,,,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the nucleus, Daxx is a component of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) and interacts with a number of transcription factors, yet its precise role in transcription remains elusive. To further define the function of Daxx, we have isolated its interacting proteins in the nucleus using epitope-tagged affinity purification and identified X-linked mental retardation and alpha-thalassaemia syndrome protein (ATRX), a putative member of the SNF2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins that is mutated in several X-linked mental retardation disorders. We show that substantial amounts of endogenous Daxx and ATRX exist in a nuclear complex. Daxx binds to ATRX through its paired amphipathic alpha helices domains. ATRX has ATPase activity that is stimulated by mononucleosomes, and patient mutations in the ATPase domain attenuate this activity. ATRX strongly represses transcription when tethered to a promoter. Daxx does not affect the ATPase activity of ATRX, however, it alleviates its transcription repression activity. In addition, ATRX is found in the PML-NBs, and this localization is mediated by Daxx. These results show that the ATRX.Daxx complex is a novel ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, with ATRX being the core ATPase subunit and Daxx being the targeting subunit. Moreover, the localization of ATRX to the PML-NBs supports the notion that these structures may play an important role in transcription regulation.","['Tang, Jun', 'Wu, Shaobo', 'Liu, Hongtu', 'Stratt, Rachael', 'Barak, Orr G', 'Shiekhattar, Ramin', 'Picketts, David J', 'Yang, Xiaolu']","['Tang J', 'Wu S', 'Liu H', 'Stratt R', 'Barak OG', 'Shiekhattar R', 'Picketts DJ', 'Yang X']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute and Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ATRX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/chemistry', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA/chemistry', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M401321200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)67154-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 May 7;279(19):20369-77. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M401321200.

This study investigated the clinical and immunologic effects of parenteral glycyl-glutamine supplementation in patients with acute leukemia receiving intensive conventional chemotherapy without bone marrow transplantation. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, controlled study compared a standard glutamine-free parenteral nutrition with a glycyl-glutamine-supplemented parenteral nutrition (Glamin, Baxter, Erlangen, Germany) containing 20 g of glutamine in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Clinical end points included the duration of neutropenia and the incidence and duration of neutropenic fever. To analyze the effects of glutamine on immunocompetent cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and HLA-DR expression on monocytes were assessed by flow cytometry throughout the treatment course. RESULTS: Fifty-four adult patients entered the study and were randomized. In 45 of 127 chemotherapy cycles, parenteral nutrition was given, and 40 cycles (20 with and 20 without glutamine) were evaluated for comparison. The median durations of neutropenia were 18 d (range, 9-29 d) in the glutamine group and 22.5 d (range, 13-48 d) in the control group (P = 0.052), whereas the median durations of neutropenic fever were 5.5 d (range, 0-13 d) and 5 d (range, 0-31 d), respectively (P = 0.74). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis and controlling for the type of chemotherapy, we found a significantly faster neutrophil recovery in patients receiving glutamine than in the control group (P = 0.040) in patients receiving a high-dose cytarabine regimen. There was no significant difference in the recovery of CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes or monocyte activation between groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with acute myeloid leukemia requiring parenteral nutrition, glycyl-glutamine supplementation could hasten neutrophil recovery after intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

METHODS: Seven IgHV gene families were respectively amplified by PCR and directly sequenced for 108 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. Sequences available were translated into amino acid sequences. Bioinformatics were applied for analyzing recombination patterns and gene mutations of the IgHV genes. Softwares SYFPEITHI and BIMAS were used for predicting the T cell epitopes in the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions. To determine whether the predicted peptides have immunogenicity, a IgHV1 family nonapeptide QLVQSGAEV was synthesized as a representation and T2 binding assay of this peptide was performed, inducing proliferation of T cells from normal HLA-A * 0201 peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with QLVQSGAEV-loaded antigen presenting cells, and detecting the proliferating T cells by HLA-A * 0201/QLVQSGAEV tetramers. RESULTS: Complete IgHV gene rearrangements were identified in 66% cases. Among 40 B-ALL IgHV sequences available, 26 were predicted for antigenic nonapeptides that are likely to bind to HLA-A * 0201 molecule. Twelve peptides were acquired. Except one peptide derived from CDR3, 10 (83%) peptides were located in the immunoglobulin heavy chain framework regions. Moreover B-ALL belonging to the same IgHV family shared 1 - 2 peptides. Synthesized peptide QLVQSGAEV up-regulated HLA-A * 0201 expression 1.63 times on T2 cell surface. PBLs from a normal HLA-A * 0201 donor were stimulated with QLVQSGAEV-loaded autologous PBMCs and T2, the CD8(+) tetramer(+) cells in gated lymphocyte population increased from 1.64% after the first stimulation to 82.57% after the third stimulation.

This study sought to investigate whether the numbers of CD(34)(+)CD(62L)(+) cells infused affect the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and the time to neutrophil and platelet recovery after unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation for the treatment of childhood acute leukemia. METHODS: Twenty-three children with acute leukemia who received unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation of mostly mismatched HLA locus were included in this study. Flow cytometry was used to count the numbers of CD(34)(+)CD(62L)(+) cells after freezing-thawing by labelling the cells with anti-CD(34) and anti-CD62L. The patients' clinical data including body weight, engraftment of the HSC, times to neutrophil and platelet recovery were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients who received CD(34)(+)CD(62L)(+) cell infusion at a number ranging from 1.37 x 10(5)/kg to 2.68 x 10(6)/kg (median, 3.567 x 10(5)/kg) had successful engraftment of the unrelated umbilical HSC. The numbers of CD(34)(+)CD(62L)(+) cells infused were statistically different between patients who had successful engraftment of the umbilical HSC and those who had not (P < 0.05). The engraftment occurred more commonly in patients who received > 1.3 x 10(5) CD(34)(+)CD(62L)(+) cells/kg. The time of neutrophil recovery (> 500/ microl) ranged from 11 days to 32 days (median, 17.5 days). The data of the time to platelet recovery (> 2 x 10(5)/ microl) were obtained in 18 patients, and it ranged from 12 days to 118 days (median, 14 days). There seemed to be a tendency of correlation between the numbers of CD(34)(+)CD(62L)(+) cells infused and time to platelet recovery (gamma = -0.324, 0.05 < P < 0.1), whereas the numbers of CD(34)(+)CD(62L)(+) cells infused correlated with the time to platelet recovery (gamma = -0.470, P < 0.05).

The lengths and DNA sequences of CDR3s are different according to different T cell clones. This leads to a diverse TCR CDR3 repertoires which can reflects the functional status of T cells precisely. This study aimed at elucidating the abnormality of TCR beta chain variable region (BV) CDR3 repertoires of children with acute B lymphoblastic leukemia, the pathogenesis of leukemia associated with T cell dysfunction and the immuno-reconstruction of T cells after the chemotherapy. METHODS: Twelve children aged from 3 to 13 years (average 4.50 +/- 3.78 years) with acute B lymphoblastic leukemia before chemotherapy and 8 healthy control donors aged from 6 to 16 years (average 10.30 +/- 3.00 years) were enrolled. Four of 12 patients were studied for the second time 3 months after complete remission (CR). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and polyacrylamide sequencing gel electrophoresis were used to detect the diversity of TCR BV CDR3 repertoires of these children. RESULTS: (1) The expression of BV2 and BV3 in 12 children increased and BV17 and BV18 decreased before the chemotherapy as compared with controls (P < 0.05). There were 4 children with a lower level expression of BV21 before the chemotherapy, and much lower level expression was found after the remission. (2) Normally each lane contained eight to ten bands, which represented unique CDR3 sizes for a given TCR BV family. Bands differed in size by 3 nucleotides and generally form a Gaussian distribution. There were 14% TCR BV families with abnormal CDR3 length distribution in 12 patients before therapy, which was significantly higher than that of controls (5.5%, P < 0.05). Restricted CDR3 length distribution was observed in BV14, BV1, BV16, BV20, BV13.1, BV13.2 and BV6. Every abnormal BV family recovered to normal Gaussian distribution 3 months after CR. CONCLUSION: T lymphocytes in children with acute B lymphoblastic leukemia revealed markedly skewed repertoires, which suggests the abnormality of T cell functions. Most abnormal T cell repertoires recovered to normal Gaussian distribution 3 months after the first CR, which suggests the immunological reconstitution of T cell repertoires.","['Zhang, Rui', 'Li, Zhi-gang', 'Wu, Min-yuan', 'Zhu, Ping', 'Hu, Ya-mei']","['Zhang R', 'Li ZG', 'Wu MY', 'Zhu P', 'Hu YM']","[""Hematology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital University of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100045, China.""]",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']","['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/06/17 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2004 Jan;42(1):66-9.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: t(12;21)/TEL-AML1 fusion gene was examined in bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 51 newly diagnosed childhood ALL patients by conventional cytogenetic R-banding analysis (CCA), dual colour interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH), and nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: t(12; 21)/TEL-AML1 fusion gene was found in 11 cases by FISH or PCR, accounting for 21.6% and 26.9% in childhood ALLs and in non-T lineage ALL cases, respectively. The median age at diagnosis was 6.8 (2.9 to 12) years. All of the t(12;21) patients expressed non-T lineage immunophenotype, and most of them were common-ALL. High myeloid antigen coexpression was not found. In 11 CCA cases, normal karyotype was found in 7, and a dubious t(12;21) in one. TEL allele deletion was found in 8 (72.7%) of t(12;21) positive cases by FISH. By comparison, no statistic difference was found in sex, anemia, hemorrhage, organ enlargement, and initial WBC count between the positive and negative non-T lineage ALLs, but the platelet count and the frequency of IgH gene rearrangement were much lower in positive cases (P = 0.008 and 0.007, respectively).

METHODS: Seven IgHV gene families were respectively amplified by PCR and directly sequenced in 108 childhood ALL. The amino acid sequences were deducted from sequenced nucleotides. Bioinformatics was applied to analyses of recombination patterns, somatic mutations and germline gene segments usage, and to prediction of epitopes recognized by CTL. RESULTS: IgHV gene rearrangements were identified in 66% of the cases, including 37 (52.1%) monoallelic rearrangements, 26 (36.6%) biallelic rearrangements and 8 (11.3%) oligoclonal rearrangements. Among the obtained 40 B-ALL IgHV gene sequences, 8 (20.0%) were in frame rearrangements without stop codons. V(H3) (11/40), V(H4) (11/40) and V(H1) (8/40) amounted to 75% rearranged V(H) families. V(H)(4-59) and V(H)(4-34) were the most frequently rearranged V(H)(4) family gene segments. Usage of D2 and D3 families was most prominent (35.9% and 28.2%, respectively). Increased frequency of D7-27 (15.4%) was found as compared to that of normal peripheral B lymphocytes (P = 0.02). J(H)(6) was found in 47.5% rearrangements followed by J(H)(4) (27.5%). 8/40 (20.0%) DJ(H) junctions lacked N nucleotides, which was higher than that reported for normal peripheral B lymphocytes (P = 0.02). 17.5% B-ALL IgHV contained scattered replacement mutations with replacement (R) to silent (S) substitution ratio (R/S ratio) <or= 1 in complementarity determining region (CDR). Above 80% potential HLA class I molecule-binding peptides were derived from framework regions of immunoglobulin heavy chains in 26 B-ALL cases and 1 - 2 peptides of the same IgHV family were shared by B-ALL.

RESULTS: Culture supernatant of AML bone marrow mononuclear cells showed higher amount of VEGF (425.31 ng/L) than that of control (140.12 ng/L). The VEGF and KDR expressions and MVD were significantly higher in newly diagnosed AML patients (78.6%, 78.6% and 7.1%, respectively) than that of control group (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between VEGF, KDR and MVD. The positive rate of VEGF, KDR and MVD reduced to normal after the patients achieved complete remission, while in non-remission patients did not.

METHODS: Of the 100 ALL patients, 69 were male and 31 female, with a median age of 29.5 (4 - 47) years. Sixty-nine cases were in the first complete remission (CR(1)), 13 in more than CR(1) and 18 in relapse before transplant. Allo-HSCT from HLA identical siblings was performed for 86 patients, of whom 64 received bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and 22 peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). HLA matched unrelated BMT was performed for 8 patients, cord-blood transplantation from unrelated donor for 6 patients. Forty-five patients underwent allo-HSCT with conditioning regimen of Cy/TBI, 55 with BUCY. Prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) included long-term MTX regimen (4 cases) and CsA + MTX regimen (96 cases). The average follow-up was 38.1 months. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of the 100 cases of ALL was 53.4% and 50.5%. The 5-year OS and DFS were significantly longer for patients in CR(1) than in >CR(1) and relapse patients before allo-HSCT (P < 0.001). The outcome of PBSCT seemed superior to that of BMT, but there was no difference between them. Multivariate analysis showed the most significant factor associated with long post allo-HSCT survival was that the patient underwent transplantation in CR(1).

Lethally irradiated 615 leukemia mice were transplanted with BALB/c bone marrow plus CD(+)TK(+)T cells. GVHD prophylaxis was by administration of ganciclovir (GCV) and 5-Fluoride cytosine (5-FC). RESULTS: The pseudotyped lentivirus-mediated gene transfer system could efficiently transfer CD and TK double suicide genes into donor T cells.

METHODS: Thirty-one patients received bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NST) were evaluated. Peripheral blood and bone marrow were co-llected before and after transplantation in different period. Nine different STR markers were co-amplified in a single reaction by using a commercial AmpF/STR Profiler Plus PCR amplification kit. Separation of the PCR products and fluorescence detection were performed by ABI prism 310 Genetic Analyzer with capillary electrophoresis. The Genescan and Genotype software were used for size calling and quantification of peak areas. The formula to calculate donor chimerism values was based on the different allelic distribution type between donor and recipient. RESULTS: 48.4% of the patients received sex-matched transplantation and the quantification of donor chimerism could only be performed by STR-PCR method. Comparison of values obtained by FISH analysis with that by STR-PCR in patients transplanted from sex-mismatched donors showed an excellent correlation. The median number of informative alleles was 6.7 (range 2 - 10). The donor's alleles appeared in all the patients on day 7 post-transplant. The median values of donor chimerism in BMT group were inferior to that in NST group on day 7, day 14 and 1 month post-transplant. However the difference disappeared in the midterm or later period of transplant. On day 21, all of the 31 patients had stable engraftment and the percentage of donor chimerism was more than 92%. Median follow-up was 17 (3.5 - 29.0) months after transplantation. Twenty-six of 31 patients had durable engraftment and donor chimerism ratio was more than 90%. So for all of them survived leukemia-freely. Four of the 31 patients had unstable mixed chimerism and relapsed within 6 months post allo-HSCT. Another patient with unstable mixed chimerism appeared graft rejection. Decreasing values of donor chimerism were detected prior to the occurrence of graft rejection and disease relapse. The incidence of GVHD was much higher in the group of full donor chimerism. CONCLUSION: Sequential and quantitative monitoring of STR is a valuable tool for studying engraftment dynamics, graft rejection, and relapse and for predicting GVHD.

The results showed that the complete remission rates after the first course of chemotherapy were 60 vs 55.6 vs 27.3% respectively in the three groups which WBC counts were <or= 0.4 x 10(9)/L, (0.4 - 0.9) x 10(9)/L and > 0.9 x 10(9)/L. The total efficaciousness rates were 90 vs 92.6 vs 66.7 respectively in the three groups. The efficaciousness rate of the first two groups significantly differed from the third group (P < 0.01). However, no significant difference was shown between the first and second groups. It is concluded that the leukocyte count after the first course of chemotherapy may be an early indicator to predict the efficaciousness of chemotherapy.","['Fu, Mei-Lan', 'Guo, Xin-Hong', 'Yasen, Halida', 'Jiang, Ming', 'Wang, Lei']","['Fu ML', 'Guo XH', 'Yasen H', 'Jiang M', 'Wang L']","['Department of Hemotology, The First Affiliated Hospital, XingJiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054 China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2004)01-0105-03 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Feb;12(1):105-7.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As donors and recipients are usually HLA matched, the public HLA epitopes that are recognized by natural killer (NK) cells (NK epitopes) are rarely mismatched, and therefore there is rarely potential for NK alloreactivity arising from the absence of ligands for inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Transplants using related donors sharing only one haplotype (haploidentical donors) represent a setting in which NK epitopes are often mismatched, thus resulting in the potential for NK alloreactivity. We have analyzed engraftment, acute graft vs host disease (GVHD), leukemia relapse, and survival in 62 haploidentical transplants in relationship with potential NK alloreactivity, inhibitory, and activating KIR genes of class I HLA NK epitopes. Potential NK alloreactivity in the rejection direction was not associated with any outcome variable. Potential NK alloreactivity in the GVHD direction was associated with an increased incidence of severe GVHD and poorer patient survival but not with non-engraftment nor leukemia relapse. A higher number of activating KIR receptors in the genome of the donor was associated with a higher prevalence of GVHD. These results suggest that lack of extensive T-cell depletion in haploidentical transplantation is associated with high GVHD rates and diminishes the benefits of NK-cell alloreactivity.","['Bishara, A', 'De Santis, D', 'Witt, C C', 'Brautbar, C', 'Christiansen, F T', 'Or, R', 'Nagler, A', 'Slavin, S']","['Bishara A', 'De Santis D', 'Witt CC', 'Brautbar C', 'Christiansen FT', 'Or R', 'Nagler A', 'Slavin S']","['Tissue Typing Unit, Hadassah University, Jerusalem, Israel. amal@hadassah.org.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Genes, MHC Class I/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Haploidy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation Immunology']",2004/03/03 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/03/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.0001-2815.2004.00182.x [doi]', 'TAN182 [pii]']",ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 2004 Mar;63(3):204-11. doi: 10.1111/j.0001-2815.2004.00182.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unconjugated antibodies have a complex mechanism of action, dependent on the nature of the target structure. Antibodies can activate the immune system (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [ADCC], complement-dependent cytotoxicity [CDC], induction of tumor immunity [idiotype network]). ADCC appears to be one of the most important immune effector functions. Antibodies may also induce apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, inhibition of cell proliferation as well as angiogenesis and metastatic spread. For most antibodies there is no clear dose-response relationship in vivo. The effect of antibodies can be enhanced by combination with chemotherapy and/or by agents which activate the immune system. The best therapeutic effect may be obtained if MABs are used early in the course of the disease. Rituximab (anti-CD20) was the first registered MAB for the therapy of follicular lymphoma. Impressive results have been seen in combination with CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) in follicular and high-grade lymphomas. In other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes, promising results are also seen in combination with chemotherapy. Trastuzumab (anti-Her2) is a breakthrough in the treatment of breast cancer in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. This antibody is also in clinical testing for adjuvant treatment. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) has shown impressive results both in refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and as up-front therapy. There are many other antibodies in late stages of testing for registration. Interesting MABs include cetuximab (anti-epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), especially in combination with radiotherapy in head and neck cancer; ABX-EGF (anti-EGFR) in renal carcinoma; bevacizumab (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) in several solid tumors. Antiepithelial cell adhesion molecule antibodies show promise in combination with chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting of colorectal carcinoma.

We assessed 123 MBCLD samples containing 80% or more tumor cells. TRF length was evaluated by Southern blot analysis using a chemiluminescence-based assay. GC status was assessed through screening for stable and ongoing somatic mutations within the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Median TRF length was 6170 bp (range, 1896-11 200 bp) and did not correlate with patient age or sex. TRF length was greater in diffuse large cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma (medians: 7789 bp, 9471 bp, and 7383 bp, respectively) than in mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (medians: 3582 bp and 4346 bp, respectively). GC-derived MBCLDs had the longest telomeres, whereas those arising from GC-inexperienced cells had the shortest (P < 10(-9)). We conclude that (1) TRF length in MBCLD is highly heterogeneous; (2) GC-derived tumors have long telomeres, suggesting that minimal telomere erosion occurs during GC-derived lymphomagenesis; and (3) the short TRF lengths of GC-inexperienced MBCLDs indicates that these neoplasms are good candidates for treatment with telomerase inhibitors, a class of molecules currently the subject of extensive preclinical evaluation.","['Ladetto, Marco', 'Compagno, Mara', 'Ricca, Irene', 'Pagano, Marco', 'Rocci, Alberto', 'Astolfi, Monica', 'Drandi, Daniela', 'di Celle, Paola Francia', ""Dell'Aquila, Maria"", 'Mantoan, Barbara', 'Vallet, Sonia', 'Pagliano, Gloria', 'De Marco, Federica', 'Francese, Roberto', 'Santo, Loredana', 'Cuttica, Alessandra', 'Marinone, Carlo', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Tarella, Corrado']","['Ladetto M', 'Compagno M', 'Ricca I', 'Pagano M', 'Rocci A', 'Astolfi M', 'Drandi D', 'di Celle PF', ""Dell'Aquila M"", 'Mantoan B', 'Vallet S', 'Pagliano G', 'De Marco F', 'Francese R', 'Santo L', 'Cuttica A', 'Marinone C', 'Boccadoro M', 'Tarella C']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Medicina ed Oncologia Sperimentale, Universita di Torino, Azienda Ospedaliera San Giovanni Battista, Via Genova 3, 10126 Turin, Italy. marco.ladetto@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/*pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/pathology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Telomere/pathology/*ultrastructure']",2004/02/28 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/02/28 05:00'],"['2004/02/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4412 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54591-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 15;103(12):4644-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4412.

Although HLA-mismatched donors can mount high-avidity CTLs against HLA-A2-presented peptides of WT1, a dominant anti-alloimmune response usually obscures detection of peptide-specific CTLs. Here we explored the feasibility of using recombinant HLA-A2 monomers containing single peptide epitopes as immunogens to generate peptide-specific CTLs from allogeneic donors. We demonstrate that the coating of HLA-A2(-) B lymphocytes with A2/peptide monomers provides a strong stimulus for autologous peptide-specific CTLs. After 3 to 5 rounds of stimulation a population of CD8(+) T cells binding A2/peptide tetramers is easily detectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Furthermore, sorted A2/WT1 tetramer-positive CTLs display strong cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells expressing WT1 endogenously but not against WT1(-) human tumor cells. Thus, HLA/peptide monomers may be useful to isolate peptide-specific donor lymphocytes for treatment of patients with leukemia after HLA-mismatched transplantation.","['Savage, Philip', 'Gao, Liquan', 'Vento, Kevin', 'Cowburn, Pam', 'Man, Stephen', 'Steven, Neil', 'Ogg, Graham', 'McMichael, Andrew', 'Epenetos, Agamemnon', 'Goulmy, Els', 'Stauss, Hans J']","['Savage P', 'Gao L', 'Vento K', 'Cowburn P', 'Man S', 'Steven N', 'Ogg G', 'McMichael A', 'Epenetos A', 'Goulmy E', 'Stauss HJ']","['Alexis Biotechnology Ltd., London, England, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']","['Antibody Affinity/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",2004/02/28 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/02/28 05:00'],"['2004/02/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-11-3903 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54585-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 15;103(12):4613-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-11-3903.

This Bcr-Abl protein tyrosine kinase mediates an array of effects on signal transduction pathways affecting cell survival, proliferation, adhesion and genetic stability. The end-result of these abnormal signalling processes is a bi- or triphasic clinical disease. Initially, CML is characterised by the presence of an excess of myeloid progenitor cells and their mature progeny. This chronic phase of CML is followed, either directly or with an intervening 'accelerated phase', by a stage where primitive blast cells predominate (acute transformation).

There is also a risk of therapy-related secondary haematopoietic malignancy as well as acute and longer term effects in other tissues. Clinical strategies have been established to address some of these problems, particularly toxic effects on the bone marrow (acute myelotoxicity); however, there is still substantial scope for improving the management of chronic toxicity and mutagenicity to haematopoietic cells and collateral damage to non-haematopoietic cells during chemotherapy. In this review, we have discussed a novel strategy that involves the transfer and expression of drug-resistance functions into haematopoietic stem cells and more-mature blood progenitor cells, to overcome both the acute and long-term deleterious effects of anti-tumour treatment in bone marrow. The potential advantages of this approach include: (1) the in vivo selection of protected cell populations, which offers the possibility of intensification or escalation of chemotherapeutic drug doses; (2) a reduction in the frequency of therapy-related leukaemia and (3) tumour sensitisation to chemotherapy at the same time as haematopoietic protection.","['Baum, C', 'Fairbairn, L J', 'Hildinger, M', 'Lashford, L S', 'Hegewisch-Becker, S', 'Rafferty, J A']","['Baum C', 'Fairbairn LJ', 'Hildinger M', 'Lashford LS', 'Hegewisch-Becker S', 'Rafferty JA']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur Experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie, Department of Cell and Virus Genetics, Hamburg, Germany. cbaum@hpi.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],['News'],England,Expert Rev Mol Med,Expert reviews in molecular medicine,100939725,,,2004/02/28 05:00,2004/02/28 05:01,['2004/02/28 05:00'],"['2004/02/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/28 05:01 [medline]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1017/S1462399499000769 [doi]', 'S1462399499000769 [pii]']",epublish,Expert Rev Mol Med. 1999 Aug 12;1999:1-28. doi: 10.1017/S1462399499000769.,,,,,,,,,,19990812,,,,,,,10.1017/S1462399499000769 [doi],,,,

Recently, the activity of bruceantin has been studied with a number of leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma cell lines. Cell differentiation was induced and c-MYC was down-regulated, suggesting a mechanistic correlation between c-MYC down-regulation and induction of cell differentiation or cell death. Treatment of HL-60 and RPMI 8226 cell lines induced apoptosis, and this involved the caspase and mitochondrial pathways. Moreover, an in vivo study using RPMI 8226 human-SCID xenografts demonstrated that bruceantin induced regression in early as well as advanced tumors, and these significant antitumor responses were facilitated in the absence of overt toxicity. Apoptosis was significantly elevated in tumors derived from animals treated with bruceantin.

(2) Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was initially approved for second-line treatment of adults with chronic myeloid leukaemia and in the accelerated phase or blast crisis. This indication has now been extended to cover first-line treatment and children. (3) An unblinded trial in 1106 adults compared imatinib (400 mg/day by mouth) as a first-line treatment with the combination of interferon (5 MIU/m2/day) and cytarabine (20 mg/m2/day, 10 days a month) subcutaneously. After 18 months, imatinib significantly increased progression-free survival rate (92.1% versus 73.5%) and quality of survival, but not overall survival. (4) In the paediatric setting, there are follow-up data from only 17 children who received imatinib as a first- or second-line treatment. The results were similar to those obtained in adults. (5) In the only available trial in adults, the number of treatment withdrawals for adverse events was lower among patients taking imatinib. Fatigue and depression were the two serious adverse events reported more commonly by people taking interferon + cytarabine. (6) Imatinib is given by mouth, which is more convenient than subcutaneous route required for interferon + cytarabine. (7) In practice, pending a second comparative trial and further follow-up, imatinib seems a therapeutic advance in the first-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia.",,,,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",France,Prescrire Int,Prescrire international,9439295,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']","['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/02/28 05:00,2004/03/26 05:00,['2004/02/28 05:00'],"['2004/02/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prescrire Int. 2003 Dec;12(68):216-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean time weighted average formaldehyde exposure at the plants in the early 1980s was 0.15 ppm but past exposures may have been substantially higher. METHODS: Vital status was updated through 1998, and life table analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Mortality from all causes (2206 deaths, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.96) and all cancers (SMR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97) was less than expected based on US mortality rates. A non-significant increase in mortality from myeloid leukaemia (15 deaths, SMR 1.44, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.37) was observed. Mortality from myeloid leukaemia was greatest among workers first exposed in the earliest years when exposures were presumably higher, among workers with 10 or more years of exposure, and among workers with 20 or more years since first exposure. No nasal or nasopharyngeal cancers were observed. Mortality from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer (147 deaths, SMR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.15) was not increased. Multiple cause mortality from leukaemia was increased almost twofold among workers with both 10 or more years of exposure and 20 years or more since first exposure (15 deaths, SMR 1.92, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.17). Multiple cause mortality from myeloid leukaemia among this group of workers was also significantly increased (8 deaths, SMR 2.55, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.03). CONCLUSIONS: Results support a possible relation between formaldehyde exposure and myeloid leukaemia mortality. Previous epidemiological studies supporting a relation between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia mortality have been primarily of formaldehyde exposed professional groups, not formaldehyde exposed industrial workers. Limitations include limited power to detect an excess for rare cancers such as nasal and nasopharyngeal cancers and lack of individual exposure estimates.","['Pinkerton, L E', 'Hein, M J', 'Stayner, L T']","['Pinkerton LE', 'Hein MJ', 'Stayner LT']","['Industrywide Studies Branch, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, USA.

Recently, drugs designed to inhibit Ras have shown promise in preclinical myeloma models and in clinical trials. In this report, we characterize the pathways by which the clinically tested farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) R115777 induces apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. Contrary to the proposed mechanistic action of FTIs, we found that R115777 induces cell death despite Ras prenylation implying participation of Ras-independent mechanism(s). Apoptosis proceeded via an intrinsic cascade and was associated with an increase in the expression and activity of Bax. Bax activation correlated with a loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. These pathways activate caspase-9 and consistent with this, cell death was prevented by caspase-9 blockade. Interestingly, cells overexpressing Bcl-X(L) remained partially sensitive to R115777 despite suppression of mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and ER-related stress. Taken together, these results indicate that R115777 induces apoptosis in a Ras-independent fashion via multiple intrinsic pathways.","['Beaupre, Darrin M', 'Cepero, Enrique', 'Obeng, Esther A', 'Boise, Lawrence H', 'Lichtenheld, Mathias G']","['Beaupre DM', 'Cepero E', 'Obeng EA', 'Boise LH', 'Lichtenheld MG']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Sylvester Cancer Center, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NPBWR1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Neuropeptide)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']","['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Prenylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Quinolones/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription Factor CHOP', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2004/02/27 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/02/27 05:00'],"['2004/02/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2004 Feb;3(2):179-86.,IM,,,,,"['CA77824-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 GM20435/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA55811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of small interfering RNAs on the ligand-induced endocytosis of EGFR were compared with those effects on the constitutive internalization of the transferrin receptor. The knock-downs of clathrin heavy chain and dynamin produced maximal inhibitory effects on the internalization of both receptors. Depletion of alpha, beta2, or micro2 subunits of AP-2 reduced EGF and transferrin internalization rates by 40-60%. Down-regulation of several accessory proteins individually had no effect on endocytosis but caused significant inhibition of EGF and transferrin endocytosis when the homologous proteins were depleted simultaneously. Surprisingly, knockdown of clathrin-assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein, CALM, did not influence transferrin endocytosis but considerably affected EGFR internalization. Thus, CALM is the second protein besides Grb2 that appears to play a specific role in EGFR endocytosis. This study demonstrates that the efficient gene silencing by rationally designed small interfering RNA can be used as an approach to functionally analyze the entire cellular machineries, such as the clathrin-coated pits and vesicles.","['Huang, Fangtian', 'Khvorova, Anastasia', 'Marshall, William', 'Sorkin, Alexander']","['Huang F', 'Khvorova A', 'Marshall W', 'Sorkin A']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado 80111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Clathrin)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']","['Clathrin/physiology', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'ErbB Receptors/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering']",2004/02/27 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/02/27 05:00'],"['2004/02/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.C400046200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)88396-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Apr 16;279(16):16657-61. doi: 10.1074/jbc.C400046200.

MABL scFv-15 dimer strongly induced apoptosis of hCD47-introduced mouse leukemic cells in vitro and exhibited anti-tumor effect in a myeloma transplanted mice model. However, MABL scFv-15 monomer scarcely exhibited these activities. These results strongly demonstrate that the ligation of CD47 antigen by two antigen-binding sites of MABL dimer is needed for inducing apoptosis.

The study aimed to compare transplant-related mortality (TRM) and survival for patients reported to the BSBMT with patients transplanted in the rest of Europe, reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). The outcomes for 104 allogeneic transplants for CML in 24 UK/Irish centres were compared with 775 allografts in 145 other European centres. For HD, 241 autografts from 38 UK/Irish centres were compared with 1145 transplants in 239 other European centres. For both diseases, the cohorts were broadly matched with the exception of CML, where 85% of patients were transplanted <1 year from diagnosis in the UK/Ireland compared with 68% in the EBMT (P = 0.001). Cox regression analysis was undertaken using known delineated variables affecting transplant outcome in addition to the registry of origin. The adjusted survival curves for CML showed no significant differences between the two groups, with 3-year survival probabilities of 70.2% and 67.1% for the EBMT and BSBMT cohorts respectively. Likewise, the analysis for HD showed overlapping survival curves, with 3-year survival probabilities of 71.8% (EBMT) and 70.8% (BSBMT). TRM was not statistically different in either disease.

Secondary aims included comparison of duration of remission, survival and infectious complications and the impact of maintenance therapy with thioguanine. Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 64% of patients without GM-CSF, and by 65% of patients who received GM-CSF, the median remission duration was 13 vs. 6 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 14 vs. 9 months, the mean time to neutrophil recovery was 25 vs. 17 d (P = 0.03) and the number of positive blood cultures was 46 vs. 39 (P = 0.05) respectively.

In the present study, we examined whether the transduction of leukaemia-DCs with OX40 ligand (OX40L), a member of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family, resulted in augmentation of their antigen presenting activity. Bicistronic retroviral vectors expressing both human OX40L and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or EGFP alone were generated and used for transduction. Fresh leukaemic cells from five patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were isolated and retrovirally transduced with OX40L during the culture with a combination of cytokines from stem cell factor, fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt)-3 ligand, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and TNF-alpha. After 7 d, the majority of cells showed DC-like morphology, and expressed higher levels of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR than fresh leukaemic cells. The transduction efficiency was 8.5-27.2%. Leukaemia-DCs transduced with OX40L elicited higher proliferative response of allogeneic CD4+ T cells than fresh leukaemic cells, non-transduced, or mock-transduced leukaemia-DCs. Co-culture of allogeneic CD4+ T cells with OX40L-transduced leukaemia-DCs was superior in the generation of interferon (IFN)-gamma producing CD4+ T cells and in production of IFN-gamma. Furthermore, OX40L-transduced leukaemia-DCs could elicit significant proliferative response of human leucocyte antigen-matched T cells from the donor in allogeneic stem cell transplantation. These results indicate that retroviral transduction of leukaemia-DCs with OX40L augments their antigen presenting cell activity and thus renders them more suitable for tumour vaccines or ex vivo stimulation of leukaemia-specific T cells.","['Yanagita, Soshi', 'Hori, Toshiyuki', 'Matsubara, Yasushi', 'Ishikawa, Takayuki', 'Uchiyama, Takashi']","['Yanagita S', 'Hori T', 'Matsubara Y', 'Ishikawa T', 'Uchiyama T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OX40 Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF4 protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology', 'OX40 Ligand', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/02/27 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/27 05:00'],"['2004/02/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['4791 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04791.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Feb;124(4):454-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04791.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a mitochondrion-mediated apoptotic pathway was demonstrated as another cytotoxic mechanism for DODC action. METHODS: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and DNA laddering assays were performed to exhibit the cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activity of DODC. Telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay was used to evaluate the effect of DODC on cellular telomerase. The mitochondrial uptake of probe 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide was measured by flow cytometry. The mitochondrial proteomes were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Western blot analyses were adopted to demonstrate the change of the distribution of mitochondrial proteins. RESULTS: DODC alone was able to induce apoptotic cell death but not decrease of telomerase activity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC-TW01 cells. Instead, we found evidence that DODC significantly affected cellular mitochondria. DODC inhibited the uptake of another mitochondrial probe 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide. By proteomic comparative analysis, we found that DODC induced the increase of prohibitin level in the mitochondria, indicating the occurrence of mitochondrial perturbation. Moreover, DODC was found to induce the levels of p53 and an 18-kDa truncated Bax on mitochondria, which in turn potentiated the release of cytochrome c for activation of caspases. CONCLUSIONS: DODC induces NPC-TW01 cell apoptosis via a mitochondrion-mediated mechanism. This paper demonstrates another cytotoxic mechanism of DODC other than inhibition of telomerase.","['Li, Chung-Pin', 'Huang, Jen-Hsin', 'Chang, Ai-Chi', 'Hung, Yi-Mei', 'Lin, Chao-Hsiung', 'Chao, Yee', 'Lee, Shou-Dong', 'Whang-Peng, Jacqueline', 'Huang, Tze-Sing']","['Li CP', 'Huang JH', 'Chang AC', 'Hung YM', 'Lin CH', 'Chao Y', 'Lee SD', 'Whang-Peng J', 'Huang TS']","['Cooperative Laboratory, Cancer Research Division, National Health Research Institutes, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Ligands)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', ""14806-50-9 (3,3'-diethyloxadicarbocyanine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']","['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Carbocyanines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G-Quadruplexes', 'Guanosine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology/*physiology', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2004/02/27 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/02/27 05:00'],"['2004/02/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/b:pham.0000012166.44521.1f [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Res. 2004 Jan;21(1):93-100. doi: 10.1023/b:pham.0000012166.44521.1f.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The least mature cells (double-negative) expressed low-density CD2 and CD5, high-density CD7, CD10, CD34, and heterogeneous CD4 and CD8. They had the lowest density CD45 expression and were surface CD3-. The immature cells (double-positive) expressed CD2, CD5, CD7, CD4, CD8, heterogeneous surface CD3, and intermediate-density CD45. They were CD10- and CD34-. The mature cells (single-positive) expressed CD2, surface CD3, CD5, CD7, and CD4 or CD8. The heterogeneous expression of surface CD3, CD4, and CD8 also created a characteristic smearing pattern for these antigens. In all 15 T-cell ALL/LBL cases, the lymphoblasts formed a tight cluster without discrete subpopulations or smearing pattern. Of 5 double-negative cases, 4 demonstrated loss of CD2, CD10, or CD34 expression. Of 7 double-positive cases, 5 showed complete loss of surface CD3, CD2, and/or CD5; 4 were CD10+; and 2 were CD34+. Of 3 single-positive cases, 2 showed loss of CD2 and/or aberrant expression of CD34. Analysis of antigen expression pattern, the presence or absence of T cell-associated antigen deletion, and the expression of CD10 and CD34 by 4-color flow cytometry can help differentiate thymoma from T-cell ALL/LBL.","['Li, Shiyong', 'Juco, Jonathan', 'Mann, Karen P', 'Holden, Jeannine T']","['Li S', 'Juco J', 'Mann KP', 'Holden JT']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thymoma/metabolism/*pathology']",2004/02/27 05:00,2004/03/10 05:00,['2004/02/27 05:00'],"['2004/02/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1309/K2FY-1TED-8GEG-FLNG [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2004 Feb;121(2):268-74. doi: 10.1309/K2FY-1TED-8GEG-FLNG.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the low incidence of ATL among HTLV-I-infected carriers, together with a long latent period, suggests that multiple host-viral events are involved in the progression of HTLV-I-dependent transformation and subsequent development of ATL. Human thioredoxin (TRX) is a redox active protein highly expressed in HTLV-I-transformed cell lines, whereas the TRX-binding protein-2/vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 (TBP-2/VDUP1) was recently identified as a negative regulator of TRX. We report here that expression of TBP-2 is lost in HTLV-I-positive, interleukin-2-independent T-cell lines but maintained in HTLV-I-positive, interleukin-2-dependent T-cell lines, as well as HTLV-I-negative T-cell lines. Ectopic overexpression of TBP-2 in HTLV-I-positive T cells resulted in growth suppression. In the TBP-2-overexpressing cells, a G1 arrest was observed in association with an increase of p16 expression and reduction of retinoblastoma phosphorylation. The results suggest that TBP-2 plays a crucial role in the growth regulation of T cells and that the loss of TBP-2 expression in HTLV-I-infected T cells is one of the key events involved in the multistep progression of ATL leukemogenesis.","['Nishinaka, Yumiko', 'Nishiyama, Akira', 'Masutani, Hiroshi', 'Oka, Shin-ichi', 'Ahsan, Kaimul Md', 'Nakayama, Yukie', 'Ishii, Yasuyuki', 'Nakamura, Hajime', 'Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Yodoi, Junji']","['Nishinaka Y', 'Nishiyama A', 'Masutani H', 'Oka S', 'Ahsan KM', 'Nakayama Y', 'Ishii Y', 'Nakamura H', 'Maeda M', 'Yodoi J']","['Biomedical Special Research Unit, Human Stress Signal Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Midorigaoka, Ikeda, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']","['Carrier Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/*virology', '*Thioredoxins']",2004/02/27 05:00,2004/04/03 05:00,['2004/02/27 05:00'],"['2004/02/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-0908 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Feb 15;64(4):1287-92. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-0908.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia had fever on the third day of the initial chemotherapy cycle. Empiric antibiotic treatment with cefepime 2 g every 8 hours was started; fluconazole and vancomycin were subsequently added due to the persistence of fever. Ten days after initiation of cefepime, the patient developed acute renal failure followed by altered consciousness (Glasgow coma scale 6) associated with nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Cefepime was discontinued. Epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram disappeared with clonazepam, and the patient regained consciousness 48 hours after cefepime withdrawal. DISCUSSION: Acute renal impairment combined with the use of cefepime may account for nonconvulsive status epilepticus. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse event was probably due to cefepime. Cefepime's neurotoxic effects derive from high serum concentrations resulting from decreased renal clearance, increased unbound antibiotic, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction during uremia. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cefepime treatment and acute renal failure may induce drug-related neurotoxicity. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus frequently passes unnoticed in severely ill patients without a history of epilepsy. This disorder should be included in the list of potential causes of coma. In this patient, early detection of nonconvulsive status epilepticus and withdrawal of the antibiotic resulted in full recovery.","['Abanades, Sergio', 'Nolla, Juan', 'Rodriguez-Campello, Ana', 'Pedro, Carme', 'Valls, Antonio', 'Farre, Magi']","['Abanades S', 'Nolla J', 'Rodriguez-Campello A', 'Pedro C', 'Valls A', 'Farre M']","[""Pharmacology Unit, Institut Municipal d'Investigacio Medica, Barcelona, Spain. sabanades@imim.es""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '807PW4VQE3 (Cefepime)']","['Acute Kidney Injury/complications', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood', 'Cefepime', 'Cephalosporins/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood', 'Coma/*chemically induced', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electroencephalography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*etiology']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/05/18 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1345/aph.1D322 [doi]', 'aph.1D322 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2004 Apr;38(4):606-8. doi: 10.1345/aph.1D322.

Herein, we investigated the potential antiapoptotic role of newly synthesized proteins released into the external milieu in IL-15-induced neutrophils. We found that IL-15 induces the de novo synthesis of an approximately 23-kDa protein, representing the predominant protein detected in the milieu, and identified it as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) by Western blot and immunoprecipitation. We quantified IL-1Ra, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in intracellular and extracellular fractions from IL-15-induced neutrophils and found that IL-15 does not increase IL-1alpha or IL-1beta production but induces IL-1Ra release. Also, we demonstrated that IL-1Ra does not modulate apoptosis, even at a concentration 250 times greater than that measured in the external milieu. In contrast to granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, the supernatant harvested from IL-15-induced neutrophils was devoid of antiapoptotic activity. Addition of cycloheximide demonstrates that IL-15 delays apoptosis via de novo synthesis of intracellular proteins and that it increases myeloid cell differentiation factor-1 stability. We demonstrated also that IL-15 decreases the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-8, resulting in an inhibition of vimentin cleavage. Our results indicate that IL-15 can activate an anti-inflammatory loop, based on its ability to induce the synthesis of IL-1Ra by neutrophils. We conclude that IL-15 delays human neutrophil apoptosis by intracellular events and not via extracellular factors.","['Bouchard, Amelie', 'Ratthe, Claude', 'Girard, Denis']","['Bouchard A', 'Ratthe C', 'Girard D']","['INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Universite du Quebec, Pointe-Claire, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-1/analysis', 'Interleukin-15/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Sialoglycoproteins/metabolism']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1189/jlb.1103585 [doi]', 'jlb.1103585 [pii]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 May;75(5):893-900. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1103585.

Between 20% and 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have either an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane region or a point mutation of the Flt3 receptor leading to the constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways and aberrant cell growth. The silencing mediator of retinoic and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) corepressor mediates transcriptional repression by interacting with transcription factors such as the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein. Previous reports indicate that SMRT interaction with transcription factors can be disrupted by phosphorylation through activation of RTK pathways. We report here that the Flt3-ITD interferes with the transcriptional and biologic action of the PLZF transcriptional repressor. In the presence of Flt3-ITD, PLZF-SMRT interaction was reduced, transcriptional repression by PLZF was inhibited, and PLZF-mediated growth suppression of leukemia cells was partially blocked. Furthermore, overexpression of Flt3-ITD led to a partial relocalization of SMRT protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Nuclear export was dependent on the SMRT receptor interaction domain (RID), and Flt3-ITD enhances the binding of nuclear-cytoplasm shuttling protein nuclear factor-kappaB-p65 (NFkappaB-p65) to this region. These data suggest that activating mutations of Flt3 may disrupt transcriptional repressor function resulting in aberrant gene regulation and abnormal leukemia cell growth.","['Takahashi, Shinichiro', 'McConnell, Melanie J', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Kaku, Mitsuo', 'Sasaki, Takeshi', 'Melnick, Ari M', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['Takahashi S', 'McConnell MJ', 'Harigae H', 'Kaku M', 'Sasaki T', 'Melnick AM', 'Licht JD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Box 1079, One Gustave Levy Place, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Ncor2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']","['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-08-2759 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54592-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 15;103(12):4650-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-08-2759.

Although the pathogenic effects of most CML blast crisis secondary changes are still poorly understood, ample evidence suggests that the phenotype of CML blast crisis cells (enhanced proliferation and survival, differentiation arrest) depends on cooperation of BCR/ABL with genes dysregulated during disease progression. Most genetic abnormalities of CML blast crisis have a direct or indirect effect on p53 or Rb (or both) gene activity, which are primarily required for cell proliferation and survival, but not differentiation. Thus, the differentiation arrest of CML blast crisis cells is a secondary consequence of these abnormalities or is caused by dysregulation of differentiation-regulatory genes (ie, C/EBPalpha). Validation of the critical role of certain secondary changes (ie, loss of p53 or C/EBPalpha function) in murine models of CML blast crisis and in in vitro assays of BCR/ABL transformation of human hematopoietic progenitors might lead to the development of novel therapies based on targeting BCR/ABL and inhibiting or restoring the gene activity gained or lost during disease progression (ie, p53 or C/EBPalpha).","['Calabretta, Bruno', 'Perrotti, Danilo']","['Calabretta B', 'Perrotti D']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA. b_calabretta@lac.jci.tju.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/*physiopathology']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4111 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55390-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 1;103(11):4010-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4111.

However, effective GVL remains difficult to separate from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and many neoplasms are GVL resistant. Murine studies aimed at solving these problems have been limited by the use of leukemia cell lines with limited homology to human leukemias and by the absence of loss-of-function leukemia variants. To address these concerns, we developed a GVL model against murine chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (mCP-CML) induced with retrovirus expressing the bcr-abl fusion cDNA, the defining genetic abnormality of chronic-phase CML (CP-CML). By generating mCP-CML in gene-deficient mice, we have studied GVL T-cell effector mechanisms. mCP-CML expression of Fas or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors is not required for CD8-mediated GVL. Strikingly, maximal CD4-mediated GVL requires cognate interactions between CD4 cells and mCP-CML cells as major histocompatibility complex-negative (MHC II(-/-)) mCP-CML is relatively GVL resistant. Nevertheless, a minority of CD4 recipients cleared MHC II(-/-) mCP-CML; thus, CD4 cells can also kill indirectly. CD4 GVL did not require target Fas expression. These results suggest that CPCML's GVL sensitivity may in part be explained by the minimal requirements for T-cell killing, and GVL-resistance may be related to MHC II expression.","['Matte, Catherine C', 'Cormier, James', 'Anderson, Britt E', 'Athanasiadis, Ioanna', 'Liu, Jinli', 'Emerson, Stephen G', 'Pear, Warren', 'Shlomchik, Warren D']","['Matte CC', 'Cormier J', 'Anderson BE', 'Athanasiadis I', 'Liu J', 'Emerson SG', 'Pear W', 'Shlomchik WD']","['Yale University School of Medicine, Section of Medical Oncology, PO Box 208032, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor/immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-10-3735 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55436-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 1;103(11):4353-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-10-3735.

Fos, which is stably induced during normal myeloid differentiation, is not induced upon differentiation of M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells. Establishing M1 cells that express a beta-estradiol-conditional FosER chimera, we show that in the absence of the differentiation inducer interleukin-6 (IL-6), Fos expression in M1 myeloblasts promoted apoptotic cell death, entailing cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation. In contrast, in the presence of IL-6, Fos-mediated apoptosis was abrogated, and Fos promoted terminal differentiation, increasing the sensitivity of M1 cells to be induced for differentiation by IL-6. Fos-mediated apoptosis was accelerated by deregulated c-Myc. Furthermore, restoring Fos expression in M1 partially abrogated the block imparted by deregulated c-Myc on the myeloid differentiation program, increased the sensitivity of the cells to be induced for differentiation, and curtailed their leukemic phenotype. These data provide evidence that Fos/Jun transcription factor complexes play a role in modulating both myeloid cell survival and differentiation and suggest that genetic lesions that alter Fos expression may cooperate with deregulated c-Myc in leukemogenesis.","['Shafarenko, Marianna', 'Amanullah, Arshad', 'Gregory, Bernard', 'Liebermann, Dan A', 'Hoffman, Barbara']","['Shafarenko M', 'Amanullah A', 'Gregory B', 'Liebermann DA', 'Hoffman B']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, and Department of Biochemistry, Temple University School of Medicine, 3307 N Broad St, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2704 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55424-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 1;103(11):4259-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2704.

SHP-2 is required during development, and germline mutations in PTPN11, the gene encoding SHP-2, cause Noonan syndrome. SHP-2 plays a crucial role in hematopoietic cell development. We recently demonstrated that somatic PTPN11 mutations are the most frequent lesion in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and are observed in a smaller percentage of children with other myeloid malignancies. Here, we report that PTPN11 lesions occur in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Mutations were observed in 23 of 317 B-cell precursor ALL cases, but not among 44 children with T-lineage ALL. In the former, lesions prevalently occurred in TEL-AML1(-) cases with CD19(+)/CD10(+)/cyIgM(-) immunophenotype. PTPN11, NRAS, and KRAS2 mutations were largely mutually exclusive and accounted for one third of common ALL cases. We also show that, among 69 children with acute myeloid leukemia, PTPN11 mutations occurred in 4 of 12 cases with acute monocytic leukemia (FAB-M5). Leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations were missense and were predicted to result in SHP-2 gain-of-function. Our findings provide evidence for a wider role of PTPN11 lesions in leukemogenesis, but also suggest a lineage-related and differentiation stage-related contribution of these lesions to clonal expansion.","['Tartaglia, Marco', 'Martinelli, Simone', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Cordeddu, Viviana', 'Iavarone, Ivano', 'Spinelli, Monica', 'Palmi, Chiara', 'Carta, Claudio', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Sorcini, Mariella', 'Gelb, Bruce D', 'Biondi, Andrea']","['Tartaglia M', 'Martinelli S', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Cordeddu V', 'Iavarone I', 'Spinelli M', 'Palmi C', 'Carta C', 'Pession A', 'Arico M', 'Masera G', 'Basso G', 'Sorcini M', 'Gelb BD', 'Biondi A']","['Dipartimento di Biologia cellulare e Neuroscienze, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena, 299-00161 Rome, Italy. mtartaglia@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']","['Adolescent', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-11-3876 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55121-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jul 15;104(2):307-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-11-3876.

BHA-induced cytotoxicity was enhanced by horseradish peroxidases, suggesting that BHA was oxidizable and produced cytotoxic BHA radicals. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation of HL-60 cells was preferably induced by BHA/BHT and BMP, followed by BHA. The MnSOD mRNA expression in HL-60 cells assayed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was highly inhibited by BHA/BHT or BMP, accompanied by the change in the electrophoretic mobility of MnSOD on polyacryamide gel. These compounds activated caspase-3, 8 and 9 in HL-60 cells. Activations of caspases, particularly caspase-3, declined in the order of BHA/BHT > BHA > BMP > BHT. The most cytotoxic BMP activated caspase-3 activity to the least extent, possibly in part due to the occurrence of necrosis. The great cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction by BHA/BHT may be due to reactive intermediates derived from the interaction between BHA phenoxyl radical and BHT or BHT phenoxyl radical.","['Saito, Masatoshi', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Fujisawa, Seiichiro']","['Saito M', 'Sakagami H', 'Fujisawa S']","['Department of Oral Diagnosis, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '1P9D0Z171K (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)', '25013-16-5 (Butylated Hydroxyanisole)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']","['Antioxidants/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Butylated Hydroxyanisole/*toxicity', 'Butylated Hydroxytoluene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'NAD/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/04/02 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2003 Nov-Dec;23(6C):4693-701.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3-ITD receptors exhibit constitutive tyrosine kinase activity in the absence of FLT3 ligand (FL) binding, and when expressed in cytokine-dependent cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells suppress programmed cell death and increase cell division. However, the signaling pathways important for transformation, in particular the nuclear targets, are unknown. Here we demonstrate that FLT3-ITD expression in Ba/F3 cells results in activation of Akt and concomitant phosphorylation of the Forkhead family member Foxo3a. Phosphorylation of Foxo proteins through FLT3-ITD signaling promotes their translocation from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, which requires the presence of conserved Akt phosphorylation sites in Forkhead transcription factors and PI3K activity. Induction of Foxo3a phosphorylation by FLT3-ITD receptors in Ba/F3 cells correlates with the suppression of Foxo-target genes p27Kip1 and the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim. Specifically, FLT3-ITD expression prevents Foxo3a-mediated apoptosis and upregulation of p27Kip1 and Bim gene expression. These data indicate that the oncogenic tyrosine kinase FLT3 can negatively regulate Foxo transcription factors, thereby promoting cell survival and proliferation.","['Scheijen, Blanca', 'Ngo, Hai T', 'Kang, Hyun', 'Griffin, James D']","['Scheijen B', 'Ngo HT', 'Kang H', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Mayer 540, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/08/07 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207456 [doi]', '1207456 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Apr 22;23(19):3338-49. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207456.,IM,,,,,['R01 CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Copyright 2004 Nature Publishing Group'],,,,,,,,,,

Immunotherapy with biological agents, such as bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), may represent a promising approach to overcome the emergence of drug resistance. Here we constructed a recombinant BsAb, a diabody, with specificities to both CD3 on human T-lymphocyte and Pgp on cancer cells. The diabody was produced in Escherichia coli in a soluble functional form and purified by an affinity chromatography with a yield of >4 mg/l culture medium in shaker flask. The diabody binds to both CD3 on T-lymphocytes and Pgp on multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells with affinities that are comparable to its respective parental single chain Fv molecules. In the presence of activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), the diabody mediates effectively the lysis of the Pgp-overexpressing human leukemia K562/A02 and epidermoid carcinoma KBv(200) cells, but is much less potent in mediating the lysis of the parent K562 and KB cells. Further, the diabody localized selectively within the K562/A02 xenografts in mice. When combined with activated PBL, the diabody significantly inhibited the growth of K562/A02 and KBv(200), but had no effect on K562 and KB xenografts. In contrast, treatment with doxorubicin, a standard chemotherapeutic agent, only inhibited the growth of K562 and KB, but had no effect on K562/A02 and KBv(200) xenografts. Taken together, our results suggest that the anti-Pgp x anti-CD3 diabody may have a great potential in the treatment of various MDR cancers.","['Gao, Y', 'Xiong, D', 'Yang, M', 'Liu, H', 'Peng, H', 'Shao, X', 'Xu, Y', 'Xu, C', 'Fan, D', 'Qin, L', 'Yang, C', 'Zhu, Z']","['Gao Y', 'Xiong D', 'Yang M', 'Liu H', 'Peng H', 'Shao X', 'Xu Y', 'Xu C', 'Fan D', 'Qin L', 'Yang C', 'Zhu Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Tianjin Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403267 [doi]', '2403267 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Mar;18(3):513-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403267.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, taking into account the controversial data about how arsenic compounds are able to induce genetic damage, we investigated the possible genotoxic activity of different arsenic compounds in the TK6 human lymphoblastoid cell line using the alkaline Comet assay. Eight different inorganic and organic arsenical compounds have been selected as follows: three inorganic (sodium arsenite, sodium arsenate and sodium hexafluorarsenate) and five organic (monomethylarsonic and dimethylarsinic acids, arsenobetaine, tetramethylarsonium iodide and tetraphenylarsonium chloride). According to their toxicity and genotoxicity, the highest concentration tested was 10 mM, and the duration of the treatments was 30 min or 3 h.

Putative targets for HLA-G are the uterine natural killer cells (uNK) that are abundantly present at the time of implantation. Since NK cells are potent producers of a variety of cytokines, interaction with HLA-G may result in the production of cytokines involved in trophoblast differentiation or tissue remodelling. In the present study we investigated the effect of membrane-bound HLA-G (mHLA-G) on the uterine mononuclear cell population (UMC) as a whole and on uNK cells in particular by measuring proliferation and cytokine production [interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/interleukin-3 (IL-3)]. Uterine cells were isolated from endometrium of non-pregnant women at the time that the endometrium is thought to be receptive to implantation, and then co-cultured with HLA-class I(-)/HLA-class II(+) 721.221 B-LCL cells transfected with mHLA-G. HLA-G suppressed the alloproliferative response of unfractionated UMC to 721.221 cells. Also, IFN-gamma and IL-3 production was strongly reduced. In contrast, purified uNK cells were stimulated by mHLA-G. Proliferation as well as IFN-gamma production was increased after co-culture with mHLA-G transfected 721.221 cells. HLA-G stimulated VEGF production by UMC as well as purified uNK cells. LIF-levels were below the detection level of our enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In conclusion, our data show that mHLA-G stimulates proliferation and cytokine production by NK cells, while down-modulating the response of unfractionated UMC.","['van der Meer, A', 'Lukassen, H G M', 'van Lierop, M J C', 'Wijnands, F', 'Mosselman, S', 'Braat, D D M', 'Joosten, I']","['van der Meer A', 'Lukassen HG', 'van Lierop MJ', 'Wijnands F', 'Mosselman S', 'Braat DD', 'Joosten I']","['Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology (603), University Medical Centre Nijmegen, PO Box 9101, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

The prolonged Ca2+ flux is required for activation of transcription factors and for subsequent activation of the T cell. Ca2+ influx requires as yet unidentified Ca2+ channels, which potentially play a role in T cell activation. Here we present evidence that human T cells express a non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channel related to L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Drugs that block classical L-type channels inhibited the initial phase of the antigen receptor-induced Ca2+ flux and could also inhibit the sustained phase of the Ca2+ signal suggesting a role for the L-type Ca2+ channel in antigen receptor signaling. T cells expressed transcripts for the alpha(1) 1.2 and alpha(1) 1.3 pore-forming subunits of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and transcripts for all four known beta-subunits including several potential new splice variants. Jurkat T leukemia cells expressed a small amount of full-length alpha(1)1.2 protein but the dominant form was a truncated protein identical in size to a truncated alpha(1) 1.2 protein known to be expressed in B lymphocytes. They further expressed a truncated form of the alpha(1) 1.3 subunit and auxiliary beta1- and beta3-subunit proteins. Our data strongly suggest that functional but non-voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels are expressed at the plasma membrane in T cells and play a role in the antigen receptor-mediated Ca2+ flux in these cells.","['Stokes, Leanne', 'Gordon, John', 'Grafton, Gillian']","['Stokes L', 'Gordon J', 'Grafton G']","['Medical Research Council Centre for Immune Regulation, Institute of Biomedical Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cacna1d protein, mouse)', '0 (Calcium Channels, L-Type)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (L-type calcium channel alpha(1C))', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['Alternative Splicing', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channels, L-Type/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA Primers/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Neuroblastoma/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M401481200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)67063-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 May 7;279(19):19566-73. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M401481200.

We previously showed that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) primes NB4 cells to mature along the monocyte/macrophage pathway in response to the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). This maturation response involves protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NFkB), and intracellular calcium and calpain activity. The natural compound, bryostatin-1, exhibits some of the effects of TPA but lacks its tumor-promoting nature. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment followed by bryostatin-1 induces monocytic differentiation of NB4 cells, however,this effect is less pronounced than the combination of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and TPA. Maturation is accompanied by decreased proliferation, changes in cellular morphology, increased plastic adherence, and expression of the cell surface marker CD14. Changes in the cell cycle traverse occur before the morphological and biochemical changes associated with differentiation. Within 24 h of bryostatin-1 addition, NB4 cells begin arresting, predominantly in G(1) phase. Changes in the cell cycle traverse were accompanied by changes in the expression of several cell cycle regulatory proteins. Combination 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and bryostatin-1 treatment, resulted in decreased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2, Cdk1, and Cdk4, of cyclins E and D3, and of the retinoblastoma binding protein (RBBP). Levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 as well as Cyclin D1 were undetectable in NB4 cell lysates, suggesting that they do not participate in the differentiation response or cell cycle control in this model.","['Clark, Christina S', 'Konyer, Janet E', 'Meckling, Kelly A']","['Clark CS', 'Konyer JE', 'Meckling KA']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Monocytes/*cytology']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/03/31 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yexcr.2003.11.013 [doi]', 'S0014482703006128 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2004 Mar 10;294(1):301-11. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2003.11.013.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examination of the impacts of these growth factors individually or in combinations on stromal cell M-CSF, RANKL, and OPG expression revealed a complex pattern involving alterations in the ratio of RANKL to OPG and/or M-CSF expression as candidate mechanisms of action.","['Gorny, Genevieve', 'Shaw, Aubie', 'Oursler, Merry Jo']","['Gorny G', 'Shaw A', 'Oursler MJ']","['Department of Biology, University of Minnesota Duluth, Duluth, MN 55812, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Somatomedins)', '0 (Tnfrsf11a protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']","['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'RANK Ligand', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Somatomedins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/03/31 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2003/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yexcr.2003.11.009 [doi]', 'S0014482703005950 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2004 Mar 10;294(1):149-58. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2003.11.009.,IM,,,,,['DE14680/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the target gene(s) of PU.1 in MEL cells, we carried out differential display (DD) analysis and isolated a novel gene whose expression was up-regulated after overexpression of PU.1 in MEL cells. Because the gene exhibited about 90% homology with the human calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase I-like kinase (CKLiK) gene, it was identified as a mouse homologue of human CKLiK. The mCKLiK gene was mapped to the mouse chromosome 2A1-A3 region and shown to be expressed predominantly in T cells lymphoma and embryonal carcinoma cell lines and primary thymus and brain. Two types of transcripts were present showing a difference in the 3' portion of the coding region and CREB-activating ability. Overexpression of each isoform of mCKLiK in MEL cells revealed that one of them induces, while the other inhibits apoptosis under low serum condition. Differentiation inhibition and lineage switch to myelomonocytes, which were previously observed in MEL cells overexpressing PU.1, were not provoked in the cells overexpressing mCKLiK. These results suggest that mCKLiK is up-regulated by PU.1 in MEL cells and involved in apoptosis of the cells.","['Yamada, Toshiyuki', 'Suzuki, Mitsuhiro', 'Satoh, Hitoshi', 'Kihara-Negishi, Fumiko', 'Nakano, Hiroyasu', 'Oikawa, Tsuneyuki']","['Yamada T', 'Suzuki M', 'Satoh H', 'Kihara-Negishi F', 'Nakano H', 'Oikawa T']","['Department of Cell Genetics, Sasaki Institute, Tokyo 101-0062, Japan. oikawa@sasaki.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (CAMK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (CAMK1D protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Camk1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Camk1d protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Pnck protein, mouse)']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 1', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/*genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression', 'Globins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Isoforms/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/03/31 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2003/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yexcr.2003.10.023 [doi]', 'S0014482703005457 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2004 Mar 10;294(1):39-50. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2003.10.023.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Affymetrix microarrays, representing 8618 genes, were used to compare mammary tissue from 12 time points (one virgin, three gestation, three lactation and five involution stages). Six animals were used for each time point. Common patterns of gene expression across all time points were identified and related to biological function. RESULTS: The majority of significantly induced genes in involution were also differentially regulated at earlier stages in the pregnancy cycle. This included a marked increase in inflammatory mediators during involution and at parturition, which correlated with leukaemia inhibitory factor-Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of signalling-3) signalling. Before involution, expected increases in cell proliferation, biosynthesis and metabolism-related genes were observed. During involution, the first 24 hours after weaning was characterized by a transient increase in expression of components of the death receptor pathways of apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines and acute phase response genes. After 24 hours, regulators of intrinsic apoptosis were induced in conjunction with markers of phagocyte activity, matrix proteases, suppressors of neutrophils and soluble components of specific and innate immunity. CONCLUSION: We provide a resource of mouse mammary gene expression data for download or online analysis. Here we highlight the sequential induction of distinct apoptosis pathways in involution and the stimulation of immunomodulatory signals, which probably suppress the potentially damaging effects of a cellular inflammatory response while maintaining an appropriate antimicrobial and phagocytic environment.","['Clarkson, Richard W E', 'Wayland, Matthew T', 'Lee, Jennifer', 'Freeman, Tom', 'Watson, Christine J']","['Clarkson RW', 'Wayland MT', 'Lee J', 'Freeman T', 'Watson CJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. rwec2@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']","['Acute-Phase Reaction/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Genes/physiology', 'Immunity, Innate/physiology', 'Lactation/genetics/physiology', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Weaning']",2004/02/26 05:00,2005/07/28 09:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2003/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/bcr754 [doi]', 'bcr754 [pii]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2004;6(2):R92-109. doi: 10.1186/bcr754.

The median age was 28.5 years (range, 4-51 years). All but one patient achieved engraftment. Grade II-to-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in 32.5% of patients, and chronic GVHD developed in 40.5%. The incidences of relapse and treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 5 years were 65% and 26%, respectively. The estimated overall survival rate at 5 years was 23%. Univariate analysis showed that improved disease-free survival (DFS) was independently associated with complete remission (CR) at transplantation (39%), compared with non-CR (8%) (P = .023). Non-CR at transplantation was associated with a higher risk of relapse. Donor type, acute GVHD, and time from diagnosis to HSCT all had a significant effect on TRM. In a multivariate analysis, 9 months or more from diagnosis to HSCT was the only variable statistically significant for DFS (relative risk, 3.22; P = .01). This study demonstrates that allogeneic HSCT cures a significant population of patients with Ph+ ALL. Relapse is the major obstacle limiting the success of HSCT. Early transplantation during CR from donors, including unrelated persons or mismatched relatives, may offer improved long-term DFS.","['Iida, Hiroatsu', 'Sao, Hiroshi', 'Kitaori, Kenjiro', 'Gotoh, Seiichi', 'Yazaki, Makoto', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Wakita, Atsushi', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa', 'Morishita, Yoshihisa']","['Iida H', 'Sao H', 'Kitaori K', 'Gotoh S', 'Yazaki M', 'Kojima S', 'Wakita A', 'Morishima Y', 'Kodera Y', 'Morishita Y']","['Department of Hematology, Meitetsu Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/05/08 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02983538 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Jan;79(1):79-84. doi: 10.1007/BF02983538.,IM,,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effects of concurrent and sequential combinations of ZOL with several commonly used antileukemic agents, including imatinib, on the in vitro growth of leukemia cell lines. As a complement to our previous finding that ZOL synergistically augments the effects of imatinib, we report here that ZOL acts additively when administered concurrently with hydroxyurea (HU), cytarabine (Ara-C), or daunorubicin (DNR) in some leukemic cell lines. Furthermore, one day of ZOL pretreatment augmented the sensitivity of imatinib and Ara-C.

AIM AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and December 2001 160 patients were treated with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Treatment results were analysed according to the age and cytogenetics. Different types of induction and postremission protocols were applied. The median age was 42.2 +/- 12.8 (16-60) years. RESULTS: Complete remission was reached in 113 (70.6%) patients. 25/160 (15.6%) individuals were refractory to treatment, 22/160 (13.8%) patients died within one month. One hundred and ten out of 113 who went into remission were given postremission therapy. Twelve out of 50 relapsed patients achieved a second complete remission. The complete remission rate and cumulative survival of patients below the age of forty years were significantly higher than of those above the age of 40 years. Four fifths of refractory patients as well as nearly all patients with secondary leukemia were older than 40 years. Similarly to studies published in the literature, the expected survival was the best in patients who had a favourable cytogenetics. In contrast, all patients who fell into the unfavourable cytogenetic group died within three years. Intensification of the postremission treatment resulted in an improved survival. CONCLUSION: Classification of acute myeloid leukemia and careful determination of prognostic factors are necessary at the time of diagnosis. This predicts outcome, as well as provides means for application of individualized therapy.","['Nahajevszky, Sarolta', 'Kapas, Balazs', 'Adam, Emma', 'Lovas, Nora', 'Halm, Gabriella', 'Gopcsa, Laszlo', 'Tamaska, Julia', 'Poros, Anna']","['Nahajevszky S', 'Kapas B', 'Adam E', 'Lovas N', 'Halm G', 'Gopcsa L', 'Tamaska J', 'Poros A']","['Orszagos Gyogyintezeti Kozpont, Hematologiai es Immunologiai Intezet, Budapest.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/02/26 05:00,2004/03/26 05:00,['2004/02/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2004 Jan 25;145(4):167-72.,IM,Az eletkor es a karyotypus prognosztikai jelentosege az akut myeloid leukaemia kezeleseben: centrumunk eredmenyei.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From an AML-M5 with a t(9;11)(q34;q23), we identified a novel MLL fusion partner, AF9Q34. The AF9Q34 protein shows high homology with nGAP, a RAS GTPase-activating protein (RASGAP), and contains the highly conserved GRD and FLR motifs characteristic of RASGAPs. Recently, the rat homologue (DAB2IP) also was identified and reported to act as a RASGAP both in vivo and in vitro. RASGAPs negatively regulate the activity of RAS proteins that modulate diverse cellular processes by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. In addition, the NH(2) terminus harbors an amino acid stretch with homology to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain implicated in regulating the interaction between RAS and the catalytic domain of RASGAP. As a result of the breakpoint in the AF9Q34-MLL fusion protein, this PH domain is disrupted. This suggests that because of the translocation, the normal function of the AF9Q34 gene is aborted. Thus, AF9Q34 encodes a novel RASGAP gene that appears to be deregulated as a result of the translocation. The identification of this RASGAP protein in a novel MLL fusion implies that an indirect RAS-deregulating mechanism could be involved in leukemic transformation.","['von Bergh, Anne R M', 'Wijers, Pauline M', 'Groot, Arjan J', 'van Zelderen-Bhola, Shama', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Kluin, Philip M', 'Schuuring, Ed']","['von Bergh AR', 'Wijers PM', 'Groot AJ', 'van Zelderen-Bhola S', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Kluin PM', 'Schuuring E']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DAB2IP protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FNBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']","['Amino Acid Sequence/genetics', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'U937 Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins/*genetics']",2004/02/24 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/24 05:00'],"['2004/02/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20004 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Apr;39(4):324-34. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20004.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['GENBANK/AY032952'],,,,,,,,,

We investigated the Mf in 16 leukemic cell lines to determine whether these cell lines showed evidence of genomic instability. Although some leukemic cell lines had markedly elevated Mfs, the Mfs at the HPRT locus in leukemic cell lines were not always higher than those of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and T lymphocytes from normal individuals. We were able to identify the HPRT mutation for 159 of 160 individual HPRT mutants. The HPRT mutations were characterized at a molecular level and classified as either gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) or point mutations, such as single-nucleotide substitutions, insertions, or deletions.

Therefore, we implemented a strategy to characterize comprehensively 11q amplicons in a series of 13 AML/MDS patients with MLL amplification. Analysis of 4 of the 13 cases by restriction landmark genomic scanning in combination with virtual genome scan and by matrix-based comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated that the 11q amplicon in these four cases consisted of at least three discontinuous sequences derived from different regions of the long arm of chromosome 11. We defined a maximally 700-kb sequence around the MLL gene that was amplified in all cases. Apart from the core MLL amplicon, we detected two additional 11q regions that were coamplified. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, we demonstrated that sequences in 11q13.5 and 11q23-24 were amplified in 8 of 13 and 10 of 12 AML/MDS cases, respectively. Both regions harbor a number of potentially oncogenic genes. In all 13 cases, either one or both of these regions were coamplified with the MLL amplicon.

Lentiviral vectors should be preferred gene delivery vehicles over vectors derived from onco-retroviruses such as murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) that cannot transduce non-proliferating target cells. Generating lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with different viral glycoproteins (GPs) may modulate the physicochemical properties of the vectors, their interaction with the host immune system and their host range. There are however important gene transfer restrictions to some non-proliferative tissues or cell types and recent studies have shown that progenitor hematopoietic stem cells in G(0), non-activated primary blood lymphocytes or monocytes were not transducible by lentiviral vectors. Moreover, lentiviral vectors that have the capacity to deliver transgenes into specific tissues are expected to be of great value for various gene transfer applications in vivo. Several innovative approaches have been explored to overcome such problems that have given rise to novel concepts in the field and have provided promising results in preliminary evaluations in vivo. Here we review the different approaches explored to upgrade lentiviral vectors, aiming at developing vectors suitable for in vivo gene delivery.","['Verhoeyen, Els', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic']","['Verhoeyen E', 'Cosset FL']","['Laboratoire de Vectorologie Retrovirale et Therapie Genique, INSERM U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, IFR128 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland.

Electron microscopic examination showed that most of the lymphocytes had a parallel tubular array and dense core granules in their cytoplasm. Flow cytometry and Southern blotting of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) genes using the peripheral blood species showed monoclonal proliferation of LGLs with a CD3+, TCRgammadelta+, CD4-, CD8-, CD16+, CD56-, CD57-, HLA-DR+ phenotype, and a TCR gamma gene rearrangement, respectively, suggesting that the patient was diagnosed as having gammadelta T-cell LGL leukemia.

Seven of 9 patients who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy for CLL and autoimmune hemolytic anemia achieved a complete response. One patient who initially responded relapsed 12 weeks postoperatively. Therefore, six of 9 patients showed sustained responses with a mean follow-up of 2 years, consistent with other published series. Two patients had no response, one of whom died within 3 weeks of surgery from transformed Hodgkin's disease. The only other postoperative complication occurred in a patient who developed pneumonia.

To gain insight concerning key intracellular signals governing these behavioral responses, we employ a multivariate systems analysis of proteomic data generated from combinatorial stimulation of mouse embryonic stem cells by fibronectin, laminin, leukemia-inhibitory factor, and fibroblast growth factor 4. Phosphorylation states of 31 intracellular signaling network components were obtained across 16 different stimulus conditions at three time points by quantitative Western blotting, and partial-least-squares modeling was used to determine which components were most strongly correlated with cell proliferation and differentiation rate constants obtained from flow cytometry measurements of Oct-4 expression levels. This data-driven, multivariate (16 conditions x 31 components x 3 time points = approximately 1,500 values) proteomic approach identified a set of signaling network components most critically associated (positively or negatively) with differentiation (Stat3, Raf1, MEK, and ERK), proliferation of undifferentiated cells (MEK and ERK), and proliferation of differentiated cells (PKB alpha, Stat3, Src, and PKC epsilon). These predictions were found to be consistent with previous in vivo literature, along with direct in vitro test here by a peptide inhibitor of PKC epsilon.

Coexposure of leukemic cells to FP blocked SB-mediated induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial injury, activation of procaspases-3 and -8, Bid cleavage, and PARP degradation. Enforced expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) (i.e., in Jurkat cells inducibly expressing p21(WAF1/CIP1) under the control of a doxycycline-responsive promoter) partially but significantly reduced cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor release, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 and -8 activation, Bid cleavage, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) degradation, and apoptosis in response to SB/FP. Furthermore, increasing expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) (i.e., by culturing cells in the presence of higher concentrations of doxycycline) rendered cells more resistant to SB/FP-mediated lethality. Enforced expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) did not modify SB/FP-mediated JNK activation or generation of reactive oxygen species. Consistent with these results, Jurkat cells stably expressing a p21(WAF1/CIP1) nuclear localization mutant (p21DeltaNLS) were also resistant to SB/FP-mediated mitochondrial injury, activation of procaspases-3 and -8, PARP cleavage, and apoptosis. Finally, enforced expression of full-length or ectopic expression of DeltaNLS p21(WAF1/CIP1) increased the amount of p21(WAF1/CIP1) coimmunoprecipitating with procaspase-3. Together, these findings suggest that interruption of HDAC-mediated p21(WAF1/CIP1) induction by FP plays a significant functional role in potentiating apoptosis, possibly by preventing the formation of a procaspase-3/p21(WAF1/CIP1) complex.","['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Yu, Chunrong', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Almenara JA', 'Yu C', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2004/02/24 05:00,2004/03/24 05:00,['2004/02/24 05:00'],"['2004/02/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/mol.65.3.571 [doi]', '65/3/571 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Mar;65(3):571-81. doi: 10.1124/mol.65.3.571.,IM,,,,,"['CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our in vitro studies indicate that at high cell densities, binding of rituximab to human CD20(+) cells leads to loss of complement activity and consumption of component C2. Infusion of rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients also depletes complement; sera of treated patients have reduced capacity to C3b opsonize and kill CD20(+) cells unless supplemented with normal serum or component C2. Initiation of rituximab infusion in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients leads to rapid clearance of CD20(+) cells. However, substantial numbers of B cells, with significantly reduced levels of CD20, return to the bloodstream immediately after rituximab infusion. In addition, a mAb specific for the Fc region of rituximab does not bind to these recirculating cells, suggesting that the rituximab-opsonized cells were temporarily sequestered by the mononuclear phagocytic system, and then released back into the circulation after the rituximab-CD20 complexes were removed by phagocytic cells.

A lipoprotein fraction prepared from B. forsythus cells by Triton X-114 phase separation (BfLP) activated human gingival fibroblasts and a human monocytic cell line, THP-1, to induce interleukin-6 production and tumor necrosis factor alpha production. BfLP was found to be capable of inducing nuclear factor-kappaB translocation in human gingival fibroblasts and THP-1 cells. By using Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells transfected with Toll-like receptor genes together with a nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent CD25 reporter plasmid, it was found that signaling by BfLP was mediated by Toll-like receptor 2 but not by CD14 or Toll-like receptor 4. BfLP induced apoptotic cell death in human gingival fibroblasts, KB cells (an oral epithelial cell line), HL-60 cells (a human myeloid leukemia cell line), and THP-1 cells but not in MOLT4 cells (a T-cell leukemia cell line).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Asp(835) mutation was analyzed by DNA PCR amplification of exon 20 of FLT3 gene followed by EcoRV digestion. All of the mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Mutant to wild-type allelic ratio was determined by Genescan analysis. The Expand Long Template PCR System was used to determine the allelic location of internal tandem duplication of FLT3 (FLT3/ITD) and Asp(835) mutations. RESULTS: Thirteen patients had Asp(835) mutations at diagnosis, of them 8 lost the mutations at relapse, and the remaining 5 patients carrying Asp(835) mutations at diagnosis relapsed with the identical mutation types. Another 6 patients acquired Asp(835) mutations at relapse. Five samples harbored both FLT3/ITD and Asp(835) mutations that were found on different alleles by cloning analysis in the 3 patients studied. There were no differences in WBC count, French-American-British subtype, percentage of marrow blasts, or circulating blasts between patients with and without Asp(835) mutations, whereas the difference in the prevalence of Asp(835) mutations among cytogenetic/molecular subgroups was statistically significant (P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that patients with AML had heterogeneous patterns of FLT3 Asp(835) mutations, either acquisition or loss of the mutations at relapse.

We have used quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR reactions (n = 23000) to analyze expression of all human receptor tyrosine kinases (n = 56) in malignant tumors (n = 313) of different origins and normal control samples (n = 58). The different tumor types expressed very different numbers of receptor tyrosine kinases: whereas brain tumors and testicular cancer expressed 50 receptor tyrosine kinases, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples expressed only 20 different ones. Specimens of similar tumor origin exhibited characteristic receptor tyrosine kinase expression patterns and were grouped together in hierarchical cluster analyses. When we focused on specific tumor entities, receptor tyrosine kinases were identified that were disease and/or stage specific. Leukemic blasts from AML bone marrow samples differed significantly in receptor tyrosine kinase expression compared with normal bone marrow and purified CD34+ cells. Among the differentially expressed receptor tyrosine kinases, we found FLT3, c-kit, CSF1 receptor, EPHB6, leukocyte tyrosine kinase, and ptk7 to be highly overexpressed in AML samples. Whereas expression changes of some of these were associated with altered differentiation patterns (e.g., CSF1 receptor), others, such as FLT3, were genuinely overexpressed in leukemic blasts.

Further, the nature of these math difficulties has not been adequately investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the performance of ALL survivors using multiple measures of math skills. Performance was compared to a group of healthy controls matched for age and sex as well as to normative levels. Other measures of neuropsychological function were also administered, and the relationships between these measures and the math measures were explored. Converging evidence for math difficulties in ALL survivors compared to healthy controls and normative levels was found. While ALL survivors generally performed within the average range on measures of math skills, math performance was mostly related to memory function and dominant-hand psychomotor speed. By contrast, math performance of healthy children was mostly related to basic reading skills and visual-motor integration.

Recently, we have established a new method for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation using chimerism-resistant autoimmune-prone MRL/lpr mice. In this method, whole bone marrow cells containing a small number of T cells and mesenchymal stem cells are directly injected into the bone marrow cavity. MRL/lpr mice treated by injection of stem cells survived more than 2 years without showing symptoms of autoimmune disease. To apply this method to humans, we established a new method for bone marrow cell harvesting using cynomolgus monkeys. In this method, cells are harvested from the long bones using a perfusion method and are then injected directly into the bone marrow cavity of recipients.

This antimetabolite has been employed in the clinic for several decades but in recent years the leukemogenic potential of HU has been suspected. In the present study, a B-lymphoblastoid cell line transformed by the Epstein-Barr virus was used to investigate the apoptotic effects of HU and delineate some of the molecular pathways implicated in the cytotoxic action. The cell line, characterized by immunophenotyping, cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies, showed no chromosomal abnormalities, even after a prolonged exposure to HU. Different flow cytometry assays were used to measure HU-induced impairment of the cell cycle, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and the occurrence of apoptosis. The treatment with HU leads to the appearance of a hypo-diploid DNA content peak (sub-G1) characteristic of the apoptotic cell population. The drug also induces a cell block in S phase as measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis precedes induction of apoptosis by HU. A drug-induced loss of plasma membrane asymmetry was characterized by flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC to stain phosphatidylserine residues. The implication of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the tumor suppressor p53 in the development of HU-mediated apoptosis was also evidenced. The drug appears to promote cell death by regulating the expression levels of these two proteins. Different criteria define the apoptotic response of the lymphoblastoid cells to the treatment with HU. However, the extent of drug-induced cell death is limited, and no DNA fragmentation and no activation of the caspase cascade was observed in this model. Beyond the specific interest in HU-induced apoptosis, the work reported here illustrates the utility of the EBV immortalization process to investigate the pharmacological activity of specific drugs from clinical samples.","['Huyghe, Pauline', 'Dassonneville, Laurent', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Bailly, Christian']","['Huyghe P', 'Dassonneville L', 'Fenaux P', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U-524, Institut de Recherches sur le Cancer de Lille, 1 Place de Verdun, 59045 Lille cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']","['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology/*virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2004/02/24 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/02/24 05:00'],"['2004/02/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/000000003772505362 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2004;14(4-5):235-45. doi: 10.3727/000000003772505362.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two members of this class, imatinib (Gleevec) and gefitinib (Iressa), are currently approved for market use in the United States. This review discusses the scientific history behind these two PTKI drugs, including the role of the targeted kinase in cancer etiology, the biochemistry of selective inhibition, the evaluation of clinical efficacy, and the mechanisms whereby drug resistance has emerged. Other PTKIs undergoing clinical evaluation are also described, including epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, PKI166, and CI-1033) and PTKIs designed to disrupt tumor vascularization (SU5416, SU6668, SU11248, PTK787, and ZD6474). How might one apply current knowledge to the efficient development of new agents that would target as-yet-unexploited oncogenic PTKs such as chimeric anaplastic leukemia kinases or Janus kinases? Ideally, the targets should contain structurally distinct drug interaction epitopes, although it is not necessary that these epitopes be unique to a single target, because effective drugs may inhibit multiple kinases involved in an oncogenic process. Oral availability is a highly desirable feature because daily oral administration can maintain a sustained efficacious plasma concentration, whereas intermittent parenteral administration may not. Perhaps most importantly, one must verify the presence of an appropriate molecular target on a case-by-case basis before selecting a patient for PTKI therapy. Thus, the development of molecularly targeted diagnostic tools will be crucial to the ultimate success of molecularly targeted PTKI therapy.","['Smith, John K', 'Mamoon, Naila M', 'Duhe, Roy J']","['Smith JK', 'Mamoon NM', 'Duhe RJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216-4505, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']","['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2004/02/24 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/02/24 05:00'],"['2004/02/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/000000003772462298 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2004;14(4-5):175-225. doi: 10.3727/000000003772462298.,IM,,,,,,,,422,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples were taken before treatment and on days 4, 8, 15 and 22 following CP injection to determine leukocytosis and cell types in blood smears. RESULTS: Mice treated with CP showed severe leukopenia, strong eosinophilia (day 4), and an altered lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio (days 8-22). Treatment of mice with LF for 21 days partially normalized the cell composition in CP-treated mice (increased percentage of lymphocytes and decreased eosinophil content). The content of leukocytes increased upon LF treatment on days 4, 8, 15 and 22 (by 36.8, 39.5, 72 and 70.7%, respectively). More importantly, LF partly normalized the neutrophil and lymphocyte composition on day 22 (neutrophils: 29.2% in control mice, 50.6% in CP-treated, and 39.16% in CP/LF-treated; lymphocytes: 66.18% in control mice, 35% in CP-treated and 48.8% in CP/LF-treated). Administration of LF alone did not change the cell numbers or composition. CONCLUSIONS: LF given orally to CP-immunocompromised mice accelerates reconstitution of lymphopoiesis and myleopoiesis.","['Artym, Jolanta', 'Zimecki, Michal', 'Kruzel, Marian']","['Artym J', 'Zimecki M', 'Kruzel M']","['Department of Experimental Therapy, Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy of the Polish Academy of Science, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']","['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/drug effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Lactoferrin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytosis/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Lymphopenia/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/05/08 05:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2003/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['3621 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2004 Mar;10(3):BR84-9.

The present study was undertaken to examine various characteristics of children who developed SMNs following successful therapy for primary leukemia or Hodgkin's disease (HD). MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 3252 children with various forms of leukemia and 849 children with HD treated between, 1970-1997 at 7 pediatric centers of the Polish Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Group and subsequently followed-up entered the study. A second malignancy was diagnosed in 36 of these children. RESULTS: Of the 3252 patients diagnosed as having acute leukemia during this period, 16 developed SMNs (estimated frequency 0.49%). SMNs developed in 20 of the 849 children treated for HD (2.36%). The most frequent SMNs were soft tissue sarcoma and thyroid carcinomas, mainly following Hodgkin's disease. Other tumors occurred at about the same frequencies in both groups. The interval from the end of initial treatment to diagnosis of an SMN ranged from 2 years 7 months to 17 years 6 months, with a median of 7 yrs 4 mo. for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and 10 years for children with HD. The estimated accumulated risk of SMN following acute leukemia is 0.95% at 15 years and, for HD, 5.1% at 20 yrs and 7% at 25 yrs. CONCLUSIONS: Children who have been successfully treated for one cancer have a higher than expected incidence of additional tumors.","['Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Nurzynska-Flak, Joanna', 'Armata, Jerzy', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska, Janina', 'Rokicka-Milewska, Roma', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, Danuta', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Chybicka, Alicja', 'Kaczmarek-Kanold, Malgorzata', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Pawelec, Katarzyna']","['Kowalczyk J', 'Nurzynska-Flak J', 'Armata J', 'Boguslawska-Jaworska J', 'Rokicka-Milewska R', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk D', 'Balwierz W', 'Chybicka A', 'Kaczmarek-Kanold M', 'Wachowiak J', 'Matysiak M', 'Pawelec K']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Lublin, Poland. jkowalcz@dsk.lubin.pl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/*therapy', 'Sarcoma/secondary', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/secondary', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/secondary', 'Time Factors']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/05/08 05:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2002/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['3057 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2004 Mar;10(3):CR117-22.

Certain benzene metabolites, including benzoquinone (BQ), are genotoxic and mutagenic. Bone marrow stem cells are targets for benzene-induced cytotoxicity and DNA damage that could result in changes to the genome of these progenitor cells, thereby leading to hematopoietic disorders and cancers. Human bone marrow CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) were exposed in vitro to 1,4-BQ to assess cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and DNA damage responses and the molecular mechanisms associated with these events. CD34(+) HPC from 10 men and 10 women were exposed to 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 microM of 1,4-BQ and analyzed 72 h later. Apoptosis and cytotoxicity were dose-dependent, with exposure to 10 microM 1,4-BQ resulting in approximately 60% cytotoxicity relative to untreated controls. A significant increase in the percentage of micronucleated CD34(+) cells was detected in cultures treated with 1,4-BQ. In addition, the p21 mRNA level was elevated in 1,4-BQ-treated cells, suggesting that human CD34(+) cells utilize the p53 pathway in response to 1,4-BQ-induced DNA damage. However, there were no significant changes in mRNA levels of the DNA repair genes ku80, rad51, xpa, xpc, and ape1 as well as p53 following treatment with 1,4-BQ. Although interindividual variations were evident in the cellular response to 1,4-BQ, there was no gender difference in the response overall. These results show that human CD34(+) cells are sensitive targets for 1,4-BQ toxicity that use the p53 DNA damage response pathway in response to genotoxic stress. Human CD34(+) HPC will be useful for testing the toxicity of other benzene metabolites and various hematotoxic chemicals.","['Abernethy, Diane J', 'Kleymenova, Elena V', 'Rose, Jason', 'Recio, Leslie', 'Faiola, Brenda']","['Abernethy DJ', 'Kleymenova EV', 'Rose J', 'Recio L', 'Faiola B']","['CIIT Centers for Health Research, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)']","['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzoquinones/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/drug effects/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/02/21 05:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/toxsci/kfh095 [doi]', 'kfh095 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2004 May;79(1):82-9. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfh095.

For example, BCR/ABL causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), whereas FLT3 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia. The ABL inhibitor Imatinib (Gleevec, STI571) has remarkable efficacy for treating chronic phase CML, and FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., PKC412) show similar promise in preclinical studies. However, resistance to PTK inhibitors is a major emerging problem that may limit long-term therapeutic efficacy. Development of rational combination therapies will probably be required to effect cures of these and other neoplastic disorders. Here, we report that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin synergizes with Imatinib against BCR/ABL-transformed myeloid and lymphoid cells and increases survival in a murine CML model. Rapamycin/Imatinib combinations also inhibit Imatinib-resistant mutants of BCR/ABL, and rapamycin plus PKC412 synergistically inhibits cells expressing PKC412-sensitive or -resistant leukemogenic FLT3 mutants. Biochemical analyses raise the possibility that inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation may be particularly important for the synergistic effects of PTK inhibitor/rapamycin combinations. Addition of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor to rapamycin or rapamycin plus PTK inhibitor further increases efficacy. Our results suggest that simultaneous targeting of more than one signaling pathway required by leukemogenic PTKs may improve the treatment of primary and relapsed CML and/or acute myelogenous leukemia caused by FLT3 mutations. Similar strategies may be useful for treating solid tumors associated with mutant and/or overexpressed PTKs.","['Mohi, M Golam', 'Boulton, Christina', 'Gu, Ting-Lei', 'Sternberg, David W', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Griffin, James D', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Neel, Benjamin G']","['Mohi MG', 'Boulton C', 'Gu TL', 'Sternberg DW', 'Neuberg D', 'Griffin JD', 'Gilliland DG', 'Neel BG']","['Cancer Biology Program, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, New Research Building, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, USA. gmohi@bidmc.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']","['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Piperazines/toxicity', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/toxicity', 'Sirolimus/*toxicity', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0400063101 [doi]', '0400063101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Mar 2;101(9):3130-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0400063101.

Using these mutant mice, we sought to determine the importance of Msx-1 (another homeobox gene formerly known as Hox-7.1) and of Wnt4 (a ligand of the Wnt family) signaling in implantation because of their reported functions during development. We observed that Msx-1, Wnt4, and a Wnt antagonist sFRP4 are differentially expressed in the mouse uterus during the periimplantation period, suggesting their role in implantation. In addition, we observed an aberrant uterine expression of Msx-1 and sFRP4 in Lif mutant mice, and of Wnt4 and sFRP4 in Hoxa-10 mutant mice, further reinforcing the importance of these signaling pathways in implantation.

This differentiation therapy propelled interest in uncovering molecular mechanisms for RA-dependent APL differentiation. We previously identified the ubiquitin-activating enzyme-E1-like protein (UBE1L) as an RA-regulated target gene in APL that triggers PML/RARalpha degradation and apoptosis. This study reports that conjugation of the ubiquitin-like species, interferon-stimulated gene, 15-kDa protein (ISG15), also occurs during RA-induced APL differentiation. Knock-down of UBE1L expression inhibited this conjugation. RA treatment of APL and other RA-responsive leukemic cells induced expression of UBE1L and ISG15 as well as intracellular ISG15 conjugates. Notably, ISG15 conjugation did not occur in RA-resistant NB4-R1 APL cells. Induction of UBE1L and ISG15 along with ISG15 conjugation in RA-sensitive NB4-S1 APL cells were detected following treatment with specific retinoids and type I interferon (IFN). UBE1L and ISG15 mRNAs were co-expressed in normal human tissues that were examined. In contrast, UBE1L mRNA expression was markedly repressed in several cancer cell lines. A physical association was found between UBE1L and ISG15 in vivo. This required the conserved diglycine motif in the carboxyl terminus of ISG15. Targeting UBE1L expression with small inhibitory RNA or small hairpin RNA inhibited IFN and RA-induced ISG15 conjugation. Formation of ISG15 conjugates through induction of an activating enzyme represents a novel pharmacologic mechanism for regulation of this ubiquitin-related species. Taken together, the observed rela tionship between expression of UBE1L and ISG15, their physical association and coordinate regulation, and induced ISG15 conjugation during leukemic cell differentiation implicate an important role for these proteins in retinoid response.","['Pitha-Rowe, Ian', 'Hassel, Bret A', 'Dmitrovsky, Ethan']","['Pitha-Rowe I', 'Hassel BA', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA. ipr@dartmouth.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (UBA1 protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '60267-61-0 (ISG15 protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)']","['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/physiology', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/genetics/*physiology', '*Ubiquitins/*analogs & derivatives']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M309259200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)75362-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Apr 30;279(18):18178-87. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M309259200.

The mammalian cell nucleus is organized into distinct nuclear domains or compartments that are essential for diverse physiological processes. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body or nuclear domain 10 is one of the nuclear domains and is involved in tumor suppression and regulation of transcription. Here, we investigate the role of PML nuclear body in MEF transactivation. We show that PML, but not Sp100, induced the accumulation of MEF in PML nuclear bodies and that MEF and PML physically interacted. This interaction stimulated MEF transcriptional activity, resulting in the up-regulation of endogenous lysozyme expression. Amino acids 348-517 of MEF were required for the accumulation of MEF in PML nuclear bodies and up-regulation of lysozyme transcription, which is enhanced by PML. Moreover, the C-terminal region of MEF spanning amino acids 477-517 was the putative region required for interaction between MEF and PML as determined with the use of the mammalian two-hybrid system. In addition, heat-shock treatment induced the accumulation of MEF in endogenous PML nuclear bodies and enhanced MEF transactivation of lysozyme gene. Thus, the recruitment of MEF to PML nuclear bodies may partly regulate lysozyme transcription in epithelial cells.","['Suico, Mary Ann', 'Yoshida, Hiroki', 'Seki, Yoshiyuki', 'Uchikawa, Tomoko', 'Lu, Zhuo', 'Shuto, Tsuyoshi', 'Matsuzaki, Kazuhito', 'Nakao, Mitsuyoshi', 'Li, Jian-Dong', 'Kai, Hirofumi']","['Suico MA', 'Yoshida H', 'Seki Y', 'Uchikawa T', 'Lu Z', 'Shuto T', 'Matsuzaki K', 'Nakao M', 'Li JD', 'Kai H']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 862-0973, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELF4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Muramidase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M312439200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)75472-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Apr 30;279(18):19091-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M312439200.

In human acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), it is inactivated with high frequency. To gain insight into the regulatory pathways leading to the normal activation of p15(Ink4b) expression, we examined interferon beta (IFNbeta)-induced transcription. Using reporter gene assays in murine myeloid cells M1, we determined that a 328-bp fragment, located 117 to 443 bp upstream of the translation initiation site, was sufficient to activate transcription. Both the interferon consensus sequence-binding protein/interferon regulatory factor 8 (ICSBP/IRF-8) and PU.1 were able to increase transcription from this region. It was determined that both ICSBP and PU.1 must bind to DNA to form a stable PU.1/ICSBP binding complex. Interestingly, introduction of the ICSBP into ICSBP-null Tot2 cells led to a significant increase in p15(Ink4b) RNA expression. This regulation of the Ink4b promoter is apparently myeloid specific because both ICSBP and PU.1 are myeloid commitment factors. Importantly, this provides a mechanism to explain in part the tumor suppressor activity of ICSBP, since ICSBP-deficient mice develop a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-like disease and a high percentage of human AML and CML lack ICSBP transcripts.","['Schmidt, Martina', 'Bies, Juraj', 'Tamura, Tomohiko', 'Ozato, Keiko', 'Wolff, Linda']","['Schmidt M', 'Bies J', 'Tamura T', 'Ozato K', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-4263, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cdkn2b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']","['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cells/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0285 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55407-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 1;103(11):4142-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0285.

ABL oncogenes trigger multiple signaling pathways whose contribution to transformation varies among cell types. Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is essential for ABL-dependent proliferation and survival in some cell types, and global PI3K inhibitors can enhance the antileukemia effects of the Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib. Although a significant fraction of BCR-ABL-induced human leukemias are of B-cell origin, little is known about PI3K signaling mechanisms in B-lineage cells transformed by ABL oncogenes. Here we show that activation of class I(A) PI3K and downstream inactivation of FOXO transcription factors are essential for survival of murine pro/pre-B cells transformed by v-ABL or BCR-ABL. In addition, analysis of mice lacking individual PI3K genes indicates that products of the Pik3r1 gene contribute to transformation efficiency by BCR-ABL.

Recently, the therapeutic strategy in CML has been totally modified with the development of a new drug: imatinib mesylate (STI571), a specific inhibitor of Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase activity. The aim of our study was to determine, in patients with CML, the capacity of imatinib mesylate to modulate one of the most potent regulators of angiogenesis, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In newly diagnosed CML, we observed significantly increased VEGF secretion by CML BM cells and significantly increased VEGF plasma concentrations. We showed that low plasma VEGF concentrations could be one of the characteristics of complete cytogenetic remission. To understand the molecular mechanisms leading to the inhibition of VEGF production by imatinib, we focused our experiments on the human cell line K562, which is Bcr/Abl positive. We demonstrated that imatinib inhibits VEGF gene transcription by targeting the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors.

Furthermore, we show that incubation of normal mouse bone marrow cells with a JAK3-specific inhibitor results in profound inhibition of myeloid colony formation in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or the combination of stem cell factor, IL-3, and IL-6. In addition, mutagenesis of the Jak3 promoter has revealed that Sp1 binding sites within a -67 to -85 element and a signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) binding site at position -44 to -53 are critical for activation of Jak3 transcription in murine M1 myeloid leukemia cells stimulated with IL-6. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis has demonstrated that Sp1 can bind to the -67 to -85 element and Stat3 can bind to the -44 to -53 STAT site in IL-6-stimulated M1 cells. Additionally, ectopic overexpression of Stat3 enhanced Jak3 promoter activity in M1 cells. This mechanism of activation of the murine Jak3 promoter in myeloid cells is distinct from a recently reported mechanism of activation of the human JAK3 promoter in activated T cells.","['Mangan, James K', 'Rane, Sushil G', 'Kang, Anthony D', 'Amanullah, Arshad', 'Wong, Brian C', 'Reddy, E Premkumar']","['Mangan JK', 'Rane SG', 'Kang AD', 'Amanullah A', 'Wong BC', 'Reddy EP']","['Temple University School of Medicine, Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, 3307 N Broad St, AHP Room 154, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']","['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-06-2165 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55401-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 1;103(11):4093-101. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-06-2165.

Four gene expression ""signatures"" were identified as correlated with patient outcome, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes (eg, HLA-DRA) which correlated with better survival. We further analyzed the effects of HLA-DRA on survival and correlated gene expression with protein status and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The 5-year overall survival was 24% in the lowest 10% of HLA-DRA expression, 37% in the 10% to 25% group, 50% in the 25% to 50% group, and 55% for patients in the highest 50%. Further analysis demonstrated that the hazard ratio of death was a nonlinear function of HLA-DRA expression. Adjustment for the International Prognostic Index did not alter the impact of HLA-DRA on survival. Other MHC class II genes were found to predict survival similarly. Microarray HLA-DRA expression correlated with the presence or absence of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) protein in 20 of 22 cases assessed. Fewer tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells were detected in MHC class II-negative cases compared with positive cases (2.8% versus 11.0%; P =.001), supporting the hypothesis that loss of tumor immunosurveillance has a devastating effect on patient outcome in DLBCL.","['Rimsza, Lisa M', 'Roberts, Robin A', 'Miller, Thomas P', 'Unger, Joseph M', 'LeBlanc, Michael', 'Braziel, Rita M', 'Weisenberger, Dennis D', 'Chan, Wing C', 'Muller-Hermelink, H Konrad', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Campo, Elias', 'Fuchs, Deborah A', 'Spier, Catherine M', 'Fisher, Richard I', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Staudt, Louis M', 'Grogan, Thomas M']","['Rimsza LM', 'Roberts RA', 'Miller TP', 'Unger JM', 'LeBlanc M', 'Braziel RM', 'Weisenberger DD', 'Chan WC', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Jaffe ES', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Campo E', 'Fuchs DA', 'Spier CM', 'Fisher RI', 'Delabie J', 'Rosenwald A', 'Staudt LM', 'Grogan TM']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, 1501 N Campbell Ave, PO Box 245043, Tucson, AZ 85724-5043, USA. rimsza@ahsc.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']","['Follow-Up Studies', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/*mortality', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-07-2365 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55423-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 1;103(11):4251-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-07-2365.

African Americans were younger than whites (48 versus 54 years, P <.001). African Americans also had different cytogenetic risk group distributions than whites (P <.001): they were more commonly classified in the favorable (23% versus 14%) and unfavorable (31% versus 23%) groups, and less commonly classified in the intermediate group (47% versus 63%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed CT scans of the lung in 87 patients with adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma who had undergone chest CT between January 1996 and March 2002 at two institutions. The CT scans were interpreted by two chest radiologists working in consensus. Parenchymal abnormalities (ground-glass attenuation, consolidation, nodules, thickening of bronchovascular bundles, interlobular septal thickening, honeycombing, crazy-paving appearance, and bronchiectasis) were evaluated, as were enlarged lymph nodes, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening. In 46 patients who underwent surgical biopsy or autopsy, CT-pathologic correlation was performed with the actual specimens by a pathologist and two chest radiologists. RESULTS: On the CT scans, abnormal findings were seen in 60 patients (69.0%). CT findings consisted of ground-glass attenuation (n = 37), centrilobular nodules (n = 25), thickening of bronchovascular bundles (n = 22), and consolidation (n = 13). These abnormalities were predominantly seen in the peripheral lung parenchyma (n = 26). Pathologically, these findings corresponded with atypical lymphocyte infiltration along the interstitium and the alveolar spaces. Pleural effusion and enlarged lymph nodes were found in 22 and 27 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: CT findings in patients with adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma consisted mainly of ground-glass attenuation, centrilobular nodules, and thickening of the bronchovascular bundles in the peripheral lung. These findings, although nonspecific, are considered suggestive of thoracic involvement in patients with adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma.","['Okada, Fumito', 'Ando, Yumiko', 'Kondo, Yoshiyuki', 'Matsumoto, Shunro', 'Maeda, Toru', 'Mori, Hiromu']","['Okada F', 'Ando Y', 'Kondo Y', 'Matsumoto S', 'Maeda T', 'Mori H']","['Department of Radiology, Oita Medical University, Idaigaoka 1-1, Hasama-machi, Oita 879-5593, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

STAT3 has also been demonstrated to mediate cellular transformation and is found in numerous cancers. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a diverse group of chemicals that bind to estrogen receptors (ERs), mimic estrogenic actions, and may have adverse effects on human health. In our previous study, we demonstrated that estrogens suppressed the STAT3-mediated transcription activity through ERs. In this study, we examined the effects of EDCs on STAT3-mediated signaling through ERs. Surprisingly, some of EDCs enhanced STAT3-mediated transcription activity through ERs.

Spontaneous apoptosis of B-CLL cells by in vitro culture resulted in decreased bcl-2, bcl-w, bfl-1, mcl-1, bak, bax, and bcl-2/bax expression. The pro-apoptotic member bik was only expressed in 5/19 cases and was not modulated during apoptosis, suggesting that bik is not involved in this process.

We found that inhibition of heme synthesis causes cell cycle arrest and induces the expression of molecular markers associated with senescence and apoptosis, such as increased formation of PML nuclear bodies. Our data show that succinyl acetone-induced heme deficiency increases the protein levels of the tumor suppressor gene product p53 and CDK inhibitor p21, and decreases the protein levels of Cdk4, Cdc2, and cyclin D2.

Our results show that heme is a versatile molecule that can effectively control cell growth and survival by acting on multiple regulators.","['Ye, Weizhen', 'Zhang, Li']","['Ye W', 'Zhang L']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health, 60 Haven Avenue, B-1 New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.17 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 3)']","['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heme/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/deficiency/*physiology', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 3/biosynthesis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/03/31 05:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2004/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.01.092 [doi]', 'S0006291X04001433 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Mar 12;315(3):546-54. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.01.092.,IM,,,,,['HL65568/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: As the population ages, physicians are increasingly required to make decisions concerning patients with multiple co-existing illnesses (comorbidity). Many trials of CAD therapy have excluded patients with significant comorbidity, such that there are limited data to guide the management of those patients. METHODS: To consider the long-term prognostic importance of comorbid illness, we examined a cohort of 1471 patients with CAD who underwent cardiac catheterization between 1985 and 1989 and were followed up through 2000 in the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Diseases. Weights were assigned to individual diseases according to their prognostic significance in Cox proportional hazards models, thus creating a new CAD-specific index. The new index was compared with the widely used Charlson index, according to prevalence of conditions, individual and overall associations with survival, and agreement. RESULTS: The Charlson index and the CAD-specific index were highly associated with long-term survival and almost equivalent to left ventricular ejection fraction. When considering the components of the Charlson index, diabetes, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral vascular disease had greater prognostic significance among CAD patients, whereas peptic ulcer disease, connective tissue disease, and lymphoma were less significant. Hemiplegia, leukemia, lymphoma, severe liver disease, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were rarely identified among patients undergoing coronary angiography. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid disease is strongly associated with long-term survival in patients with CAD. These data suggest co-existing illnesses should be measured and considered in clinical trials, disease registries, quality comparisons, and counseling of individual patients.","['Sachdev, Molly', 'Sun, Jie Lena', 'Tsiatis, Anastasios A', 'Nelson, Charlotte L', 'Mark, Daniel B', 'Jollis, James G']","['Sachdev M', 'Sun JL', 'Tsiatis AA', 'Nelson CL', 'Mark DB', 'Jollis JG']","['Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. mollysachdev@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Coll Cardiol,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,8301365,,"['Blacks/statistics & numerical data', 'Cardiac Catheterization', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Artery Disease/epidemiology/ethnology/*mortality', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Stroke Volume/physiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Ventricular Function, Left/physiology', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/03/16 05:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2002/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2003/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jacc.2003.10.031 [doi]', 'S073510970301550X [pii]']",ppublish,J Am Coll Cardiol. 2004 Feb 18;43(4):576-82. doi: 10.1016/j.jacc.2003.10.031.,IM,,,,,,['J Am Coll Cardiol. 2004 Feb 18;43(4):583-4.

Genetic modification of islets offers a powerful molecular tool for improving our understanding of islet biology. Moreover, efficient genetic engineering of islets could allow for evaluation of new strategies aimed at preventing islet destruction. The present study evaluated the ability of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based lentiviral vector pseudotyped with various viral envelopes to target human islets ex vivo, with the goal of improving efficiency while minimizing toxicity. Transfer of the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene in human islets was first evaluated with an HIV-based vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), murine leukemia virus, Ebola, rabies, Mokola, or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) envelope glycoprotein to optimize transduction efficiency. Results indicated that LCMV-pseudotyped vector transduced insulin-secreting beta cells with the highest efficiency. Moreover, toxicity associated with transduction of islets was found to be lower with LCMV-pseudotyped vector than with VSV-G-pseudotyped vector, the second most efficient vector for islet transduction. Overall, our study describes an improved methodology for achieving safe and efficient gene transfer into cells of human islets.","['Kobinger, Gary P', 'Deng, Shaoping', 'Louboutin, Jean-Pierre', 'Vatamaniuk, Marko', 'Matschinsky, Franz', 'Markmann, James F', 'Raper, Steven E', 'Wilson, James M']","['Kobinger GP', 'Deng S', 'Louboutin JP', 'Vatamaniuk M', 'Matschinsky F', 'Markmann JF', 'Raper SE', 'Wilson JM']","['Gene Therapy Program, Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Health System, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']","['*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Insulin/biosynthesis', 'Islets of Langerhans/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",2004/02/21 05:00,2004/10/13 09:00,['2004/02/21 05:00'],"['2004/02/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303404772680010 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2004 Feb;15(2):211-9. doi: 10.1089/104303404772680010.,IM,,,,,"['DK 54207/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK 47757/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report aims towards the identification of the molecular mechanism leading to defective MHC class II expression in a B-cell lymphoma cell line, Rec-1. We evidenced a coordinated alteration of HLA-D gene transcription, reminiscent of B lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with MHC class II deficiency. Genetic complementation performed between these cell lines and the lymphoma cells indicated that Rec-1 is altered in the MHC2TA gene. MHC2TA encodes the class II transactivator (CIITA), the master regulator of HLA-D gene expression. However, the coding sequence of the Rec-1 CIITA transcript did not reveal any mutation that could hamper the activity of the encoded protein. In agreement with the genetic complementation analysis, we evidenced a highly residual CIITA protein expression in the Rec-1 cell line resulting from a transcriptional defect affecting MHC2TA expression. Anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody treatment has proved efficient in the destruction of B lymphoma cells. Our data indicate that the appearance of variants losing CIITA, and thereby HLA-DR, expression will require a thorough monitoring during such immunotherapy protocols.","[""Prod'homme, T"", 'Drenou, B', 'De Ruyffelaere, C', 'Barbieri, G', 'Wiszniewski, W', 'Bastard, C', 'Charron, D', 'Alcaide-Loridan, C']","[""Prod'homme T"", 'Drenou B', 'De Ruyffelaere C', 'Barbieri G', 'Wiszniewski W', 'Bastard C', 'Charron D', 'Alcaide-Loridan C']","['INSERM U396, Centre de Recherches Biomedicales des Cordeliers, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (MHC class II transactivator protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'HLA-D Antigens/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403315 [doi]', '2403315 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):832-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403315.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively characterized 17 patients fulfilling WHO criteria for idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHES) or CEL, using nested RT-PCR and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Eight had FIP1L1-PDGFRA (+) CEL, three had FIP1L1-PDGFRA (-) CEL and six had IHES. FIP1L1-PDGFRA (+) CEL responded poorly to steroids, hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha, and had a high probability of eosinophilic endomyocarditis (n=4) and disease-related death (n=4). In FIP1L1-PDGFRA (+) CEL, palpable splenomegaly was present in 5/8 cases, serum vitamin B(12) was always markedly increased, and marrow biopsies revealed a distinctively myeloproliferative aspect. Imatinib induced rapid complete hematological responses in 4/4 treated FIP1L1-PDGFRA (+) cases, including one female, and complete molecular remission in 2/3 evaluable cases. In the female patient, 1 log reduction of FIP1L1-PDGFRA copy number was reached as by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). Thus, correlating IHES/CEL genotype with phenotype, FIP1L1-PDGFRA (+) CEL emerges as a homogeneous clinicobiological entity, where imatinib can induce molecular remission.

We developed an RT-PCR-based denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC) assay to detect mutations of the ABL KD. Validation experiments using mixtures of wild type and mutant amplicons showed that the D-HPLC assay could detect mutant transcripts when they represented at least 15% of the total, and was thus twice as sensitive as automated sequencing. When D-HPLC was applied to 30 cDNAs from patients with imatinib resistance that had previously been characterized for KD mutations by direct sequencing of BCR-ABL RT-PCR products, there was concordance in 97% of samples. Resequencing confirmed the original mutations in all cases. In addition, sequencing of individual clones detected a mutation in one sample that had been mutation-positive by D-HPLC but wild type by conventional sequencing. In serial samples from the same individuals, D-HPLC detected mutations as early as 260 days before hematological relapse. D-HPLC is suitable for routine clinical monitoring of CML patients for emergence of KD mutations and may be useful for optimizing therapy. Early detection of emerging mutant clones may aid in guiding decisions regarding alternative treatment options.","['Deininger, M W N', 'McGreevey, L', 'Willis, S', 'Bainbridge, T M', 'Druker, B J', 'Heinrich, M C']","['Deininger MW', 'McGreevey L', 'Willis S', 'Bainbridge TM', 'Druker BJ', 'Heinrich MC']","['Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute, Portland, OR 97201-L592, USA. deninge@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods/standards', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods/standards', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403307 [doi]', '2403307 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):864-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403307.,IM,,,,,"['1R01 CA65823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 CA82445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed mRNA expression levels of 18 cell cycle-related genes in bone marrow samples from 78 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and six controls using high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR. Samples of AML patients contained significantly increased mRNA expression levels of the mdm2 and c-myc oncogenes. Also, the average expression levels of p14ARF and p16INK4A were higher in patient samples compared to controls. Leukemic blasts and control bone marrow samples did not differ significantly in the expression levels of proliferation-associated genes such as cyclin A2 and pcna. When single genes were analyzed for prognostic significance in Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, a low p14ARF level emerged as a strong and independent predictor for poor survival (P=0.04 and 0.029). Subsequently, p14ARF mRNA levels were analyzed in a second, independent patient population (n=57). Again, low p14ARF levels were associated with a worse outcome. Finally, immunohistochemistry analysis of AML tissue arrays confirmed the widespread expression of c-myc and p14ARF in AML on the protein level. Taken together, the expression of the p53 regulators mdm2 and p14ARF are altered in AML, and low p14ARF levels indicate a poor prognosis.","['Muller-Tidow, C', 'Metzelder, S K', 'Buerger, H', 'Packeisen, J', 'Ganser, A', 'Heil, G', 'Kugler, K', 'Adiguzel, G', 'Schwable, J', 'Steffen, B', 'Ludwig, W-D', 'Heinecke, A', 'Buchner, T', 'Berdel, W E', 'Serve, H']","['Muller-Tidow C', 'Metzelder SK', 'Buerger H', 'Packeisen J', 'Ganser A', 'Heil G', 'Kugler K', 'Adiguzel G', 'Schwable J', 'Steffen B', 'Ludwig WD', 'Heinecke A', 'Buchner T', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster and the AMLCG study group, Munster, Germany. muellerc@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*analysis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403296 [doi]', '2403296 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):720-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403296.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs exert their activity by inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Roscovitine, a cdk2-inhibitor that is in preclinical evaluation, induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells at doses that were not cytotoxic for normal human B cells. At 20 microM, Roscovitine induced apoptosis in 21 of 28 B-CLL samples and was equally effective in zap-70-positive or -negative samples. Caspase-3 was cleaved in B-CLL cells exposed to Roscovitine and the pancaspase inhibitor z.VAD.fmk-blocked Roscovitine-induced apoptosis. Expression of the proapoptotic protein Bak was increased and Bax cleavage and conformational change was observed in Roscovitine-treated B-CLL cells. Antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP were downregulated, but the expression of Bcl-2 remained unchanged. In contrast to previous reports in cancer cell lines, Roscovitine treatment was not accompanied by nuclear accumulation of p53. Cyc202 (R-Roscovitine) is in early clinical trials in cancer patients. Given its powerful effects on zap-70-positive and -negative B-CLL cells, but not on normal lymphocytes, Roscovitine might be an attractive drug to be tested in this incurable disease.","['Hahntow, I N', 'Schneller, F', 'Oelsner, M', 'Weick, K', 'Ringshausen, I', 'Fend, F', 'Peschel, C', 'Decker, T']","['Hahntow IN', 'Schneller F', 'Oelsner M', 'Weick K', 'Ringshausen I', 'Fend F', 'Peschel C', 'Decker T']","['Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Caspases', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Roscovitine', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403295 [doi]', '2403295 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):747-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403295.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate, in B-CLL patients and in healthy subjects by flow cytometry, B cell expression of surface molecules involved in cell activation, differentiation, T-B cooperation and apoptosis. METHODS: The study population consisted of 29 patients (16 men and 13 women; mean age: 66.5 years) with B-CCL. The control group consisted of 16 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects. The results are reported as percentages and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD19+ cells coexpressing each analyzed molecule. RESULTS: We found that the lymphocyte activation markers, CD69, CD25 and CD11c, were more expressed in B-CLL patients than controls. CD38 and CD95 expressions were higher on normal B lymphocytes than leukemic B cells. Finally, CD80 and CD86, molecules involved in T-B cooperation, showed an inverse expression between lymphocytes of B-CLL patients and healthy subjects. CD80 was higher on normal than leukemic B cells, while CD86 expression was higher on CLL B cells. Linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation between CD80 and CD95 expression on leukemic B cells; a reverse correlation was observed between CD69 and CD11c. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that common mechanisms may regulate the simultaneous expression of CD80 and CD95 or the reverse expression of CD69 and CD11c, respectively, in different stages of B cell activation and/or differentiation.","['Sellitto, A', 'De Fanis, U', 'Romano, C', 'Dalla Mora, L', 'Guastafierro, S', 'Tirelli, A', 'Lucivero, G']","['Sellitto A', 'De Fanis U', 'Romano C', 'Dalla Mora L', 'Guastafierro S', 'Tirelli A', 'Lucivero G']","['V Division of Internal Medicine and Immunoallergology, Second University of Naples, Naples, Italy.']","['eng', 'ita']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Minerva Med,Minerva medica,0400732,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers)']","['Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Linear Models', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Male']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/04/02 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Minerva Med. 2003 Oct;94(5):331-6, 336-9.",IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PCR product, which represents a pool of approximately 15 000 genomic loci, could be used for direct sequencing, selective restriction digestion or pyrosequencing, in order to quantitate DNA methylation. By restriction digestion or pyrosequencing, the assay was reproducible with a standard deviation of only 2% between assays. Using this method we found that almost two-thirds of the CpG methylation sites in Alu elements are mutated, but of the remaining methylation target sites, 87% were methylated. Due to the heavy methylation of repetitive elements, this assay was especially useful in detecting decreases in DNA methylation, and this assay was validated by examining cell lines treated with the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (DAC), where we found a 1-16% decrease in Alu element and 18-60% LINE methylation within 3 days of treatment. This method can be used as a surrogate marker of genome-wide methylation changes. In addition, it is less labor intensive and requires less DNA than previous methods of assessing global DNA methylation.","['Yang, Allen S', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Doshi, Ketan', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Tajara, Eloiza H', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Yang AS', 'Estecio MR', 'Doshi K', 'Kondo Y', 'Tajara EH', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Sulfites)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'OJ9787WBLU (hydrogen sulfite)']","['Alu Elements/genetics', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'Sulfites']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/05/14 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/nar/gnh032 [doi]', '32/3/e38 [pii]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Feb 18;32(3):e38. doi: 10.1093/nar/gnh032.,IM,,PMC373427,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33CA89837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 CA089837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,20040218,,,,,,,,,,,

To further investigate the possible involvement of miRs in human cancers on a genome-wide basis, we have mapped 186 miRs and compared their location to the location of previous reported nonrandom genetic alterations. Here, we show that miR genes are frequently located at fragile sites, as well as in minimal regions of loss of heterozygosity, minimal regions of amplification (minimal amplicons), or common breakpoint regions. Overall, 98 of 186 (52.5%) of miR genes are in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites. Moreover, by Northern blotting, we have shown that several miRs located in deleted regions have low levels of expression in cancer samples.

However, most studies on DHEA have been performed in rodents, and there is little direct evidence for biological effects on the human nervous system. Furthermore, the mechanism of its action is unknown. Here, we show that DHEA significantly increased the growth rates of human neural stem cells derived from the fetal cortex and grown with both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). However, it had no effect on cultures grown in either factor alone, suggesting a specific action on the EGF/LIF-responsive cell. Precursors of DHEA such as pregnenolone or six of its major metabolites, had no significant effect on proliferation rates. DHEA did not alter the small number (<3%) of newly formed neuroblasts or the large number (>95%) of nestin-positive precursors. However, the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells, its mRNA, and protein were significantly increased by DHEA. We found both N-methyl-d-aspartate and sigma 1 antagonists, but not GABA antagonists, could completely eliminate the effects of DHEA on stem cell proliferation. Finally we asked whether the EGF/LIF/DHEA-responsive stem cells had an increased potential for neurogenesis and found a 29% increase in neuronal production when compared to cultures grown in EGF/LIF alone. Together these data suggest that DHEA is involved in the maintenance and division of human neural stem cells. Given the wide availability of this neurosteroid, this finding has important implications for future use.","['Suzuki, Masatoshi', 'Wright, Lynda S', 'Marwah, Padma', 'Lardy, Henry A', 'Svendsen, Clive N']","['Suzuki M', 'Wright LS', 'Marwah P', 'Lardy HA', 'Svendsen CN']","['Department of Anatomy and the Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin, 1500 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705-2280, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']","['Base Sequence', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/*embryology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Mitotic Index', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects', 'Neuropeptides/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0307325101 [doi]', '0307325101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Mar 2;101(9):3202-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0307325101.

Wnts are a large family of secreted glycoproteins involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis. The classical Wnt signaling cascade inhibits the activity of the enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, augmenting beta-catenin translocation to the nucleus, and the transcription of target genes. Little is known about the potential roles of Wnt signaling in CLL. In this study, we quantified the gene expression profiles of the Wnt family, and their cognate frizzled (Fzd) receptors in primary CLL cells, and determined the role of Wnt signaling in promoting CLL cell survival. Wnt3, Wnt5b, Wnt6, Wnt10a, Wnt14, and Wnt16, as well as the Wnt receptor Fzd3, were highly expressed in CLL, compared with normal B cells. Three lines of evidence suggested that the Wnt signaling pathway was active in CLL. First, the Wnt/beta-catenin-regulated transcription factor lymphoid-enhancing factor-1, and its downstream target cyclin D1, were overexpressed in CLL. Second, a pharmacological inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, SB-216763, activated beta-catenin-mediated transcription, and enhanced the survival of CLL lymphocytes. Third, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was diminished by an analog of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (R-etodolac), at concentrations that increased apoptosis of CLL cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Wnt signaling genes are overexpressed and are active in CLL. Uncontrolled Wnt signaling may contribute to the defect in apoptosis that characterizes this malignancy.","['Lu, Desheng', 'Zhao, Yandong', 'Tawatao, Rommel', 'Cottam, Howard B', 'Sen, Malini', 'Leoni, Lorenzo M', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Corr, Maripat', 'Carson, Dennis A']","['Lu D', 'Zhao Y', 'Tawatao R', 'Cottam HB', 'Sen M', 'Leoni LM', 'Kipps TJ', 'Corr M', 'Carson DA']","['Rebecca and John Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SB 216763)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']","['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Multigene Family', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Wnt Proteins', '*Zebrafish Proteins', 'beta Catenin']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0308648100 [doi]', '0308648100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Mar 2;101(9):3118-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0308648100.

Resveratrol (RSV) triggers apoptosis in some systems and inhibits the death signal in others. In this regard, the inhibitory effect on hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis is attributed to its antioxidant property. We provide evidence that exposure of human leukemia cells to low concentrations of RSV (4-8 micro M) inhibits caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and translocation of cytochrome c induced by hydrogen peroxide or anticancer drugs C2, vincristine, and daunorubicin. Interestingly, at these concentrations, RSV induces an increase in intracellular superoxide and inhibits drug-induced acidification. Blocking the activation of NADPH oxidase complex neutralized RSV-induced inhibition of apoptosis. Furthermore, our results implicate intracellular hydrogen peroxide as a common effector mechanism in drug-induced apoptosis that is inhibited by preincubation with RSV. Interestingly, decreasing intracellular superoxide with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium reversed the inhibitory effect of RSV on drug-induced hydrogen peroxide production. These data show that low concentrations of RSV inhibit death signaling in human leukemia cells via NADPH oxidase-dependent elevation of intracellular superoxide that blocks mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production, thereby resulting in an intracellular environment nonconducive for death execution.","['Ahmad, Kashif Adil', 'Clement, Marie-Veronique', 'Hanif, Ismail Muhamad', 'Pervaiz, Shazib']","['Ahmad KA', 'Clement MV', 'Hanif IM', 'Pervaiz S']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']","['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'NADPH Oxidases/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/04/03 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2414 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Feb 15;64(4):1452-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2414.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer Res. 2015 Apr 1;75(7):1537.

The mechanism of renal tumor suppression by VHL protein is only partly elucidated. VHL loss increases expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha transcription factors. However, clinical and biochemical data indicate that the hypoxia-inducible factors are necessary but not sufficient for renal tumorigenesis, which suggests other VHL effector pathways are involved. Jade-1 protein interacts strongly with VHL and is most highly expressed in renal proximal tubules, precursor cells of renal cancer. Short-lived Jade-1 protein contains plant homeodomain (PHD) and candidate PEST degradation motifs and is substantially stabilized by VHL. The effect of VHL on Jade-1 protein abundance and relative protein stability was further examined in immunoblots and metabolic labeling experiments using two time points. VHL-Jade-1 binding was tested in coimmunoprecipitations. In cotransfection studies with wild-type VHL, the Jade-1 PHD-extended PHD module, not the candidate PEST domain, was required for full VHL-mediated stabilization. This module is also found in leukemia transcription factors AF10 and AF17, as well as closely related Jade-like proteins, which suggests all might be VHL regulated. Intriguingly, naturally occurring truncations and mutations of VHL affected wild-type Jade-1 binding and stabilization. Although the VHL beta domain was sufficient for Jade-1 binding, both the alpha and beta domains were required for Jade-1 stabilization. Thus, truncating VHL mutations, which are severe and associated with renal cancer development, prevented Jade-1 stabilization. Moreover, well-controlled cotransfection and metabolic labeling experiments revealed that VHL missense mutations that cause VHL disease without renal cancer, such as Tyr98His and Tyr112His, stabilized Jade-1 fully. In contrast, like the VHL truncations, VHL missense mutations commonly associated with renal cancer, such as Leu118Pro or Arg167Trp, did not stabilize Jade-1 fully. Therefore, loss of Jade-1 stability may correlate with renal cancer risk. Endogenous Jade-1 in stable renal cancer lines also exhibited VHL mutation-dependent regulation. As in the cotransfections, VHL truncations did not increase endogenous Jade-1 abundance, whereas the VHL missense mutations tested partially increased Jade-1 expression. Additional studies with non-PHD proteins indicated that Jade-1 stabilization by VHL is highly specific. Fibronectin was not stabilized like Jade-1 by VHL, nor were candidate VHL interactors from a yeast screen. Thus, protein stabilization likely reflects the biological activity of largely intact VHL protein on the PHD-extended PHD module of Jade-1. Dysregulation of the VHL protein stabilization pathway or of Jade-1 itself may therefore contribute to VHL renal disease and renal cancer pathogenesis.","['Zhou, Mina I', 'Wang, Hongmei', 'Foy, Rebecca L', 'Ross, Jonathan J', 'Cohen, Herbert T']","['Zhou MI', 'Wang H', 'Foy RL', 'Ross JJ', 'Cohen HT']","['Renal and Hematology/Oncology Sections, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Boston University School of Medicine, 650 Albany Street, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (JADE1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (VHL protein, human)']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/etiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*physiology', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein', '*Zinc Fingers']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/04/03 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-0884 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Feb 15;64(4):1278-86. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-0884.,IM,,,,,"['R01 CA079830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK067569/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 79830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax1 PBM mediated the interaction of Tax1 with the discs large (Dlg) tumor suppressor containing PDZ domains, and the interaction correlated well with the transforming activities of Tax1 and the mutants. Through this interaction, Tax1 altered the subcellular localization of Dlg from the detergent-soluble to the detergent-insoluble fraction in a fibroblast cell line as well as in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines.

However, retroviruses are distinct from other retroelements in that their ""transposition"" is not confined to single cells but extends to neighboring cells and organisms. As such, the ""transposition"" of these elements is defined as infection. It appears that a key step in the conversion of a retrotransposon into a retrovirus is the modular acquisition or capture of an envelope glycoprotein (Env) which facilitates dissemination from its initial host cell. Here we present several examples of retroviruses for which envelope capture has been identified. Indeed, capture may explain the notable conservation of env sequences among otherwise phylogenetically distant retroviruses. In a recent example, sequence homologies reported between the env of the phylogenetically distant murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and human T cell leukemia viruses (HTLV) argue in favor of an env capture by the latter. Env acquisition can provide new adaptive properties to replication-competent viruses in addition to altering their host range. Also, the captured env can alter the spectrum of physiological affects of infection in new host cells and organisms. The elucidation of such envelope exchanges and properties thereof should contribute significantly to the clarification of retroviral phylogeny, insight into retroviral pathogenesis, and to the discovery of new retroviruses.","['Kim, Felix J', 'Battini, Jean-Luc', 'Manel, Nicolas', 'Sitbon, Marc']","['Kim FJ', 'Battini JL', 'Manel N', 'Sitbon M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), CNRS-UMR5535, IFR122, F-34293 Montpellier, cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Retroelements)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']","['Animals', 'Cats', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroelements/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Vertebrates/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/04/06 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2003/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2003/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.virol.2003.09.026 [doi]', 'S0042682203006998 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Jan 5;318(1):183-91. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2003.09.026.,IM,,,,,,,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,

The central core domain of IN contains the catalytic site of the enzyme and is involved in binding viral ends and cell DNA as well as dimerization. We previously performed single amino acid substitutions in the core domain of an Avian Leukemia and Sarcoma Virus (ALSV) IN [Arch. Virol. 147 (2002) 1761]. Here, we modeled the resulting IN mutants and analyzed the ability of these mutants to mediate concerted DNA integration in an in vitro assay, and to form dimers by protein-protein cross-linking and size exclusion chromatography. The N197C mutation resulted in the inability of the mutant to perform concerted integration that was concomitant with a loss of IN dimerization. Surprisingly, mutations Q102G and A106V at the dimer interface resulted in mutants with higher efficiencies than the wild-type IN in performing two-ended concerted integration of viral DNA ends. The G139D and A195V mutants had a trend to perform one-ended DNA integration of viral ends instead of two-ended integration. More drastically, the I88L and L135G mutants preferentially mediated nonconcerted DNA integration although the proteins form dimers. Therefore, these mutations may alter the formation of IN complexes of higher molecular size than a dimer that would be required for concerted integration. This study points to the important role of core domain residues in the concerted integration of viral DNA ends as well as in the oligomerization of the enzyme.","['Moreau, Karen', 'Faure, Claudine', 'Violot, Sebastien', 'Gouet, Patrice', 'Verdier, Gerard', 'Ronfort, Corinne']","['Moreau K', 'Faure C', 'Violot S', 'Gouet P', 'Verdier G', 'Ronfort C']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Universite Claude Bernard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,['EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)'],"['Alpharetrovirus/enzymology/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'Integrases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Virus Integration', '*Virus Replication']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/04/02 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2003/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2003/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.virol.2003.09.037 [doi]', 'S0042682203007323 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Jan 20;318(2):566-81. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2003.09.037.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Virology. 2004 Oct 10;328(1):159'],,,

Tax regulates transcription via direct interaction with some members of the activating transcription factor/CRE-binding protein (ATF/CREB) family including CREM, CREB, and CREB-2. By interacting with their ZIP domain, Tax stimulates the binding of these cellular factors to the CRE-like sequence present in the TxREs. Recent observations have shown that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) forms stable complexes on the CRE site in the presence of CREB-2. Given that C/EBPbeta has also been found to interact with Tax, we analyzed the effects of C/EBPbeta on viral Tax-dependent transcription. We show here that C/EBPbeta represses viral transcription and that Tax is no more able to form a stable complex with CREB-2 on the TxRE site in the presence of C/EBPbeta. We also analyzed the physical interactions between Tax and C/EBPbeta and found that the central region of C/EBPbeta, excluding its ZIP domain, is required for direct interaction with Tax. It is the first time that Tax is described to interact with a basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) factor without recognizing its ZIP domain. Although unexpected, this result explains why C/EBPbeta would be unable to form a stable complex with Tax on the TxRE site and could then down-regulate viral transcription. Lastly, we found that C/EBPbeta was able to inhibit Tax expression in vivo from an infectious HTLV-I molecular clone. In conclusion, we propose that during cell activation events, which stimulate the Tax synthesis, C/EBPbeta may down-regulate the level of HTLV-I expression to escape the cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte response.","['Hivin, P', 'Gaudray, G', 'Devaux, C', 'Mesnard, J-M']","['Hivin P', 'Gaudray G', 'Devaux C', 'Mesnard JM']","['Laboratoire Infections Retrovirales et Signalisation Cellulaire, CNRS/UM I UMR 5121/IFR 122, Institut de Biologie, 34960 Montpellier, cedex 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']","['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Response Elements', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/04/02 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2003/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.virol.2003.10.027 [doi]', 'S0042682203008146 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Jan 20;318(2):556-65. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2003.10.027.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Four equal groups of Balb/c young male mice (6 animals in each group; mean body weight 11.9 +/- 0.25 g, in their rapid growth phase) were subjected to the following drug treatment for a period of 3 wk. Group 1 was given intraperitoneal MTX (3.5 mg kg(-1) body weight) every second day. Group 2 received folinic acid (7.0 mg kg(-1) body weight) intraperitoneally every second day. Group 3 was given both drugs (MTX every second day and folinic acid 8 h post-MTX injection). Group 4 was injected with physiological saline every other day to serve as a control group. Total body weight of the animals in each group was monitored every second day for the entire study period. The animals were sacrificed, the bilateral femurs and tibias of each animal were harvested and X-rays of the bones were taken. The length of each femur and tibia was measured using a micrometer. Measurements from the radiographs were also recorded using image analysis software. The MTX concentrations in the plasma and the folate levels in erythrocytes were determined. The heights of the distal femoral and the proximal tibial growth plate for each animal were measured on histological tissue sections. RESULTS: Mean lengths of both the tibia and femur of animals were compared in the four treatment groups. A significant decrease in the mean lengths (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.005) was observed in the group receiving MTX alone. Similarly, there was a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the height of the femoral and tibial growth plate in this group when compared with the other groups. The main effect of MTX seemed to be on the hypertrophic proliferative zone of chondrocytes in the growth plate. Furthermore, animals in this MTX-treated group also showed increased levels of MTX in plasma and low levels of erythrocyte folate. CONCLUSION: These data show that chronic administration of MTX induces suppression of skeletal growth in mice, possibly through the inhibition of the pathway of de novo DNA synthesis. Folinic acid treatment following MTX administration appears to reverse this growth inhibition. Based on these observations, children suffering from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteosarcoma or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and receiving MTX over long periods of time could be at risk of short-term suppression of skeletal growth. If this is the case, it is possible that they could benefit from dietary supplementation with folinic acid.","['Iqbal, M P', 'Ahmed, M', 'Umer, M', 'Mehboobali, N', 'Qureshi, A A']","['Iqbal MP', 'Ahmed M', 'Umer M', 'Mehboobali N', 'Qureshi AA']","['Department of Biological & Biomedical Sciences, The Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. perwaiz.iqbal@aku.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Antirheumatic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Bone Development/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry', 'Femur/growth & development', 'Folic Acid/blood', 'Growth Plate/drug effects', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Tibia/growth & development']",2004/02/20 05:00,2004/06/02 05:00,['2004/02/20 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2003 Dec;92(12):1438-44.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the anticancer potential of immunotherapy not yet fully exploited, patients with leukemia, malignant lymphoma, and other hematologic malignancies for which high-dose chemoradiotherapy is frequently recommended in conjunction with stem cell transplantation (SCT) can now benefit from the advantages of immunotherapy mediated by cytokines or alloreactive donor lymphocytes, while minimizing procedure-related toxicity and mortality. The feasibility of applying allogeneic cell-mediated immunotherapy in conjunction with allogeneic SCT following reduced-intensity conditioning, with minimal toxicity and no serious transplant-related complications, makes it possible to undertake such procedures on an outpatient basis as well as to offer an option for cure to elderly individuals and patients with less than optimal performance status. Being well tolerated, reduced-intensity transplants also offer a chance for cure to patients with otherwise resistant leukemia and malignant lymphoma who have relapsed after autologous SCT. Thus, the traditional obstacle of very high transplant-related toxicity and mortality due to multiorgan failure from cumulative toxicity of multiple anticancer agents and radiation therapy is overcome. Although immunotherapy mediated by allogeneic lymphocytes can be most effective, the immune potential of donor lymphocytes should be maximized by nonspecific or specific activation in vitro or in vivo, or both, for more effective eradication of resistant tumor cells, including in patients with bulky disease. More important is the challenge to target donor lymphocytes to the tumor and minimize their capacity to induce responses against normal host tissues, which frequently results in severe acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Alternatively, donor lymphocytes should be eliminated as soon as tumor eradication is completed, or as soon as severe GVHD becomes prohibitive. Based on available experience, clinical application of innovative therapy, especially at the stage of minimal residual disease (MRD), may open new horizons for the treatment of malignancies considered until recently to be incurable. The feasibility of controlling cancer by targeted chemotherapy, best illustrated by the phenomenal activity of imatinib in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and, more recently, in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (including in patients fully resistant to all known anticancer agents) suggests that in the future, tumor-specific chemotherapy may represent the ultimate goal for achieving a stage of MRD with minimal multiorgan toxicity. Together, the combination of immunotherapy and targeted chemotherapy may provide the most logical approach for making real progress in controlling resistant hematologic malignancies and metastatic solid tumors.","['Slavin, Shimon', 'Morecki, Shoshana', 'Weiss, Lola', 'Shapira, Michael Y', 'Resnick, Igor', 'Or, Reuven']","['Slavin S', 'Morecki S', 'Weiss L', 'Shapira MY', 'Resnick I', 'Or R']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah University Hospital, Ein Kerem, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,,"['Animals', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods']",2004/02/19 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0093775403005591 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2003.10.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2004 Feb;31(1):4-21. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2003.10.016.,IM,,,,,,,,95,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether expressed constitutively or induced by interferon-gamma, expression of MHC class II molecules is regulated via coactivator class II transactivator (CIITA); moreover, suppression of their expression is one mechanism by which cancer cells escape host immunity. In this study, we surveyed the relationship between the expression of one MHC class II antigen, HLA-DR, and its coactivators in a group of haematopoietic cell lines, and explored the role of the aberrant DNA methylation in silencing HLA-DR expression. Among 26 cell lines studied, HLA-DR expression was lost from eight T-cell and two myeloid leukaemia cell lines, and this loss was closely associated with suppression of CIITA-PIV expression. Notably, nine of the 10 cell lines that lost CIITA-PIV expression showed methylation of the gene's 5' CpG island. Thus, DNA methylation is believed to inhibit the expression of MHC class II molecules in haematopoietic tumour cells by silencing its coactivator, CIITA-PIV. Furthermore, methylation of CIITA-PIV was detected in seven of 32 primary acute myeloid leukaemia specimens, indicating that epigenetic alteration is not a cell line-specific phenomenon. Collectively, these data suggest that, by suppressing expression of MHC class II molecules, epigenetic inactivation of CIITA provides a survival advantage to a subset of haematopoietic tumours.","['Morimoto, Y', 'Toyota, M', 'Satoh, A', 'Murai, M', 'Mita, H', 'Suzuki, H', 'Takamura, Y', 'Ikeda, H', 'Ishida, T', 'Sato, N', 'Tokino, T', 'Imai, K']","['Morimoto Y', 'Toyota M', 'Satoh A', 'Murai M', 'Mita H', 'Suzuki H', 'Takamura Y', 'Ikeda H', 'Ishida T', 'Sato N', 'Tokino T', 'Imai K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Cancer Research Institute, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.

Although the prevalence of obesity varies by race, few studies of obesity-related cancer risk have included non-white subjects. METHODS: In a large cohort of male US veterans (3,668,486 whites; 832,214 blacks) hospitalized with a diagnosis of obesity between 1969 and 1996, we examined risk for all major cancer sites and subsites. Person-years accrued from the date of first obesity diagnosis until the occurrence of a first cancer, death, or the end of the observation period (September 30, 1996). We calculated age- and calendar-year adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cancer among white and black veterans, comparing obese men to men hospitalized for other reasons, with obesity status as time-dependent. For selected cancers, we performed additional analyses stratified by specific medical conditions related to both obesity and risk of those cancers. To determine whether obesity-related cancer risks differed significantly between white and black men, we evaluated heterogeneity of risk for each cancer site. RESULTS: Among white veterans, risk was significantly elevated for several cancers, including cancers of the lower esophagus, gastric cardia, small intestine, colon, rectum, gallbladder and ampulla of vater, male breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid, and connective tissue, and for malignant melanoma, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Excess risks initially observed for cancers of the liver and pancreas persisted among men without a history of diabetes or alcoholism. Among black veterans, risks were significantly elevated for cancers of the colon, extrahepatic bile ducts, prostate, thyroid, and for malignant melanoma, multiple myeloma, CLL and AML. CONCLUSIONS: Obese men are at increased risk for several major cancers as well as a number of uncommon malignancies, a pattern generally similar for white and black men. Due to the increasing prevalence of obesity and overweight worldwide, it is important to clarify the impact of excess body weight on cancer and to elucidate the mechanisms involved.","['Samanic, Claudine', 'Gridley, Gloria', 'Chow, Wong-Ho', 'Lubin, Jay', 'Hoover, Robert N', 'Fraumeni, Joseph F Jr']","['Samanic C', 'Gridley G', 'Chow WH', 'Lubin J', 'Hoover RN', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Room 8115, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. samanicc@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,"['*African Americans', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/ethnology/*etiology', 'Obesity/*complications/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Veterans', '*Whites']",2004/02/19 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/B:CACO.0000016573.79453.ba [doi]', '5252184 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2004 Feb;15(1):35-43. doi: 10.1023/B:CACO.0000016573.79453.ba.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA from microdissected tumor samples and cell lines was analyzed for PML mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). For some tumor types, the association between PML expression and tumor stage and grade was analyzed. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: All normal tissues expressed PML protein. PML protein expression was reduced or abolished in prostate adenocarcinomas (63% [95% confidence interval [CI] = 48% to 78%] and 28% [95% CI = 13% to 43%], respectively), colon adenocarcinomas (31% [95% CI = 22% to 40%] and 17% [95% CI = 10% to 24%]), breast carcinomas (21% [95% CI = 8% to 34%] and 31% [95% CI = 16% to 46%]), lung carcinomas (36% [95% CI = 15% to 57%] and 21% [95% = 3% to 39%]), lymphomas (14% [95% CI = 10% to 18%] and 69% [95% CI = 63% to 75%]), CNS tumors (24% [95% CI = 13% to 35%] and 49% [95% CI = 36% to 62%]), and germ cell tumors (36% [95% CI = 24% to 48%] and 48% [95% CI = 36% to 60%]) but not in thyroid or adrenal carcinomas. Loss of PML protein expression was associated with tumor progression in prostate cancer (the progression from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive carcinoma was associated with complete PML loss; P<.001), breast cancer (complete PML loss was associated with lymph node metastasis; P =.01), and CNS tumors (complete PML loss was associated with high-grade tumors; P =.003). PML mRNA was expressed in all tumor and cell line samples. The PML gene was rarely mutated and was not subject to LOH. CONCLUSIONS: PML protein expression is frequently lost in human cancers of various histologic origins, and its loss associates with tumor grade and progression in some tumor histotypes.","['Gurrieri, Carmela', 'Capodieci, Paola', 'Bernardi, Rosa', 'Scaglioni, Pier Paolo', 'Nafa, Khedoudja', 'Rush, Laura J', 'Verbel, David A', 'Cordon-Cardo, Carlos', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Gurrieri C', 'Capodieci P', 'Bernardi R', 'Scaglioni PP', 'Nafa K', 'Rush LJ', 'Verbel DA', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Molecular Biology Program and Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']","['Adenocarcinoma/genetics', 'Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Carcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Germinoma/genetics', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/02/19 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/djh043 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2004 Feb 18;96(4):269-79. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djh043.,IM,,,,,"['92629/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA47179/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA009207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA080618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2004 Feb 18;96(4):248-9.

In adults, TAL-1 protein is undetectable in quiescent endothelium but it is present in newly formed vessels including tumoral vasculature, indicating its involvement in angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that TAL-1 expression is tightly regulated during in vitro angiogenesis: it is low during the initial step of migration and is upregulated during formation of capillary-like structures. We investigated whether ectopic expression of either wild-type TAL-1 or a dominant-negative mutant lacking the DNA-binding domain (Delta-bas) modulates the activity of human primary endothelial cells in the angiogenic processes of migration, proliferation and cell morphogenesis. Overexpression of either wild-type or Delta-bas TAL-1 affected chemotactic migration of primary endothelial cells without modifying their proliferative properties. Ectopic expression of wild-type TAL-1 accelerated the formation of capillary-like structures in vitro and, in vivo, enhanced vascularisation in mice (Matrigel implants) associated with a general enlargement of capillary lumens. Importantly, transduction of the mutant Delta-bas completely impaired in vitro angiogenesis and strongly inhibited vascularisation in mice. Taken together, our data show that TAL-1 modulates the angiogenic response of endothelial cells by stimulating cell morphogenesis and by influencing their behavior in migration. This study highlights the importance of TAL-1 regulation in postnatal vascular remodeling and provides the first physiological evidence that links TAL-1 activity to endothelial cell morphogenic processes.","['Lazrak, Monia', 'Deleuze, Virginie', 'Noel, Daniele', 'Haouzi, Delphine', 'Chalhoub, Elias', 'Dohet, Christiane', 'Robbins, Ian', 'Mathieu, Daniele']","['Lazrak M', 'Deleuze V', 'Noel D', 'Haouzi D', 'Chalhoub E', 'Dohet C', 'Robbins I', 'Mathieu D']","['UMR 5535, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, IFR122, 1919 Route de Mende, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/*growth & development/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology']",2004/02/19 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/jcs.00969 [doi]', 'jcs.00969 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2004 Mar 1;117(Pt 7):1161-71. doi: 10.1242/jcs.00969.

In contrast to the inhibitory isoforms NERF-1a and NERF-1b, NERF-2 acts as a transactivator of the B cell-specific blk promoter. We now report that NERF-2 and NERF-1 physically interact with AML1 (RUNX1), a frequent target for chromosomal translocations in leukemia. NERF-2 bound to AML1 via an interaction site located in a basic region upstream of the Ets domain. This is in contrast to most other Ets factors such as Ets-1 that bind to AML1 via the Ets domain, suggesting that different Ets factors utilize different domains for interaction with AML1. The interaction between AML1 and NERF-2 led to cooperative transactivation of the blk promoter, whereas the interaction between AML1 and NERF-1a led to repression of AML1-mediated transactivation. To delineate the differences in function of the different NERF isoforms, we determined that the transactivation domain of NERF-2 is encoded by the N-terminal 100 amino acids, which have been replaced in NERF-1a by a 19-amino acid transcriptionally inactive sequence. Furthermore, acidic domains A and B, which are conserved in NERF-2 and the related proteins ELF-1 and MEF/ELF-4, but not in NERF-1a, are largely responsible for NERF-2-mediated transactivation. Because translocation of the Ets factor Tel to AML1 is a frequent event in childhood pre-B leukemia, understanding the interaction of Ets factors with AML1 in the context of a B cell-specific promoter might help to determine the function of Ets factors and AML1 in leukemia.","['Cho, Je-Yoel', 'Akbarali, Yasmin', 'Zerbini, Luiz F', 'Gu, Xuesong', 'Boltax, Jay', 'Wang, Yihong', 'Oettgen, Peter', 'Zhang, Dong-Er', 'Libermann, Towia A']","['Cho JY', 'Akbarali Y', 'Zerbini LF', 'Gu X', 'Boltax J', 'Wang Y', 'Oettgen P', 'Zhang DE', 'Libermann TA']","['BIDMC Genomics Center and the New England Baptist Bone and Joint Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 4 Blackfan Circle, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '181233-60-3 (ELF2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (protein-tyrosine kinase p55(blk))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'src-Family Kinases/*biosynthesis']",2004/02/19 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M309074200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)67057-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 May 7;279(19):19512-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M309074200.

In this report, we describe the capacity of myocardin to physically associate with megakaryoblastic leukemia factor-1 (MKL1) and characterize the function of MKL1 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The MKL1 gene is expressed in most human tissues and myocardin and MKL are co-expressed in SMCs. MKL1 and myocardin physically associate via conserved leucine zipper domains. Overexpression of MKL1 transactivates serum response factor (SRF)-dependent SMC-restricted transcriptional regulatory elements including the SM22alpha promoter, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter/enhancer, and SM-alpha-actin promoter/enhancer in non-SMCs. Moreover, forced expression of MKL1 and SRF in undifferentiated SRF(-/-) embryonic stem cells activates multiple endogenous SMC-restricted genes at levels equivalent to, or exceeding, myocardin. Forced expression of a dominant-negative MKL1 mutant reduces myocardin-induced activation of the SMC-specific SM22alpha promoter. In NIH3T3 fibroblasts MKL1 localizes to the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus in response to serum stimulation, actin treadmilling, and RhoA signaling. In contrast, in SMCs MKL1 is observed exclusively in the nucleus regardless of serum conditions or RhoA signaling. However, when actin polymerization is disrupted MKL1 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in SMCs. Together, these data were consistent with a model wherein MKL1 transduces signals from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus in SMCs and regulates SRF-dependent SMC differentiation autonomously or in concert with myocardin.","['Du, Kevin L', 'Chen, Mary', 'Li, Jian', 'Lepore, John J', 'Mericko, Patricia', 'Parmacek, Michael S']","['Du KL', 'Chen M', 'Li J', 'Lepore JJ', 'Mericko P', 'Parmacek MS']","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (myocardin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']","['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/*cytology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2004/02/19 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M400961200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)75588-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Apr 23;279(17):17578-86. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M400961200.

We also found that a histone-encoding gene cluster, which is transcribed only in S-phase, is more strongly associated with PML bodies in S-phase than in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, visualization of specific RNA transcripts for several genes showed that PML bodies were not themselves sites of transcription for these genes. Furthermore, knock-down of PML bodies by RNA interference did not preferentially change the expression of genes closely associated with PML bodies.

This study was designed to compare the outcome of patients with M5 to that of other subtypes of AML, and to identify differences in M5a and M5b. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed all patients with AML M5 entered in three clinical trials for newly diagnosed AML conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group between 1989 and 1998. Eighty-one patients, 21 with M5a and 60 with M5b, were identified. RESULTS: The complete remission rate was 62% for all patients with M5; 52% for patients with M5a and 65% for patients with M5b (P =.3), and 60% for the 1122 patients with non-M5 AML entered on the same clinical trials (P =.8 for M5 v non-M5). The 3-year disease-free survival was 26% for all M5 patients; 18% for M5a and 28% for M5b (P =.31), and 33% for non-M5 patients (P =.13 for M5 v non-M5). The 3-year overall survival was 31% for all M5 patients; 33% for M5a and 30% for M5b (P =.65), and 30% for non-M5 (P =.74 for M5 v non-M5). The karyotypes of patients with AML M5 were heterogeneous.

Four months after BMT, he became comatose and died. MR imaging revealed multifocal brain lesions that were progressive but produced no edema. Postcontrast studies revealed that most of the lesions were nonenhancing. There was only discrete, irregular leptomeningeal enhancement with possible minimal enhancement of the cortex and subcortical white matter. Autopsy showed overwhelming toxoplasmosis encephalitis. This case illustrates that toxoplasmosis lesions may lack obvious contrast enhancement in the brain of the immunocompromised patients, despite severe involvement. Recognition of this unusual MR imaging manifestation of toxoplasmosis should lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.","['Ionita, Catalina', 'Wasay, Mohammed', 'Balos, Lucia', 'Bakshi, Rohit']","['Ionita C', 'Wasay M', 'Balos L', 'Bakshi R']","['Department of Neurology and Pathology, University at Buffalo, SUNY, Buffalo, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

We assessed whether the occurrence of neurotoxicity was affected by the choice of conditioning regimen used before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). METHODS: An allo-BMT was performed in 290 patients conditioned before transplantation with myeloablative therapy. Neurotoxicity from cyclosporine or FK-506 developed in 21 (7.2%) of these patients, as confirmed with CT or MR imaging. Two hundred seventy-four (94%) of these 290 patients were conditioned with minor variations of one of five fundamental regimens: cyclophosphamide (Cy)/busulfan (n = 97), Cy/total body irradiation (TBI) (n = 122), Cy/thiotepa/TBI (n = 40), bischloroethylnitrosourea/etoposide/cytarabine/melphalan, or BEAM (n = 10), and Cy/thiotepa/busulfan (n = 5). The remaining 16 patients were prepared with variable regimens. The rates of occurrence of cyclosporine or FK-506 neurotoxicity relative to these conditioning regimens were compared. RESULTS: The lowest rate of cyclosporine or FK-506 neurotoxicity was found in those patients conditioned with Cy (2 days)/busulfan (4 days) (5.1%) or Cy (2 days)/TBI (4 days) (5.9%). Rate of neurotoxicity increased with lengthier conditioning regimens. A high rate of neurotoxicity was present in those patients conditioned with Cy (4 days)/TBI (4 days) (13.7%), and this was statistically significant (P <.05) when compared with Cy (2 days)/busulfan (4 days). CONCLUSION: The rate of occurrence of cyclosporine or FK-506 neurotoxicity varies with the conditioning regimen used, with lengthier regimens associated with a higher rate of neurotoxicity. As the length of the conditioning regimen equates to the total dose of chemotherapy administered, it suggests that the intensity of the regimen is correlated to the predisposition to neurotoxicity from cyclosporine or FK-506.","['Bartynski, Walter S', 'Zeigler, Zella R', 'Shadduck, Richard K', 'Lister, John']","['Bartynski WS', 'Zeigler ZR', 'Shadduck RK', 'Lister J']","['Department of Radiology, The Western Pennsylvania Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

Trihalomethanes (THMs) are by-products formed when chlorine is used to disinfect drinking water. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of the THMs, trichloromethane (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM), and tribromomethane (TBM), to induce DNA strand breaks (SB) in (1) CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemia cells, (2) primary rat hepatocytes (PRH) exposed in vitro, and (3) rats exposed by gavage or drinking water. METHODS: DNA SB were measured by the DNA alkaline unwinding assay (DAUA). CCRF-CEM cells were exposed to individual THMs for 2 hr. Half of the cells were immediately analyzed for DNA SB and half were transferred into fresh culture medium and incubated for an additional 22 hr before testing for DNA SB. PRH were exposed to individual THMs for 4 hr then assayed for DNA SB. F344/N rats were exposed to individual THMs for 4 hr, 2 weeks, and to BDCM for 5 wk then tested for DNA SB. RESULTS: CCRF-CEM cells exposed to 5- or 10-mM brominated THMs for 2 hr produced DNA SB. The order of activity was TBM>DBCM>BDCM; TCM was inactive. Following a 22-hr recovery period, all groups had fewer SB except 10-mM DBCM and 1-mM TBM. CCRF-CEM cells were found to be positive for the GSTT1-1 gene, however no activity was detected. No DNA SB, unassociated with cytotoxicity, were observed in PRH or F344/N rats exposed to individual THMs. CONCLUSION: CCRF-CEM cells exposed to the brominated THMs at 5 or 10 mM for 2 hr showed a significant increase in DNA SB when compared to control cells. Additionally, CCRF-CEM cells exposed to DBCM and TBM appeared to have compromised DNA repair capacity as demonstrated by an increased amount of DNA SB at 22 hr following exposure. CCRF-CEM cells were found to be positive for the GSTT1-1 gene, however no activity was detected. No DNA SB were observed in PRH or F344/N rats exposed to individual THMs.","['Geter, David R', 'Chang, Lina W', 'Hanley, Nancy M', 'Ross, Matthew K', 'Pegram, Rex A', 'DeAngelo, Anthony B']","['Geter DR', 'Chang LW', 'Hanley NM', 'Ross MK', 'Pegram RA', 'DeAngelo AB']","['National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 USA. geter.david@epa.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Carcinog,Journal of carcinogenesis,101153623,,,2004/02/19 05:00,2004/02/19 05:01,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2003/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/19 05:01 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1477-3163-3-2 [doi]', '1477-3163-3-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Carcinog. 2004 Feb 17;3(1):2. doi: 10.1186/1477-3163-3-2.,,,PMC395841,,,,,,,20040217,,,,,,,,,,,

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100, 4269-4274]. In the present study, we show that FAAH alone cannot account for the facilitated diffusion of AEA across the cell membrane. In particular, (i) using a short incubation time (90 s) to avoid AEA hydrolysis by FAAH, AEA accumulation into rat basophilic leukaemia or C6 cells was saturable at low microM concentrations of substrate and non-saturable at higher concentrations; (ii) time-dependent and, at low microM concentrations of substrate, saturable AEA accumulation was observed also using mouse brain synaptosomes; (iii) using synaptosomes prepared from FAAH-deficient mice, saturable AEA accumulation was still observed, although with a lower efficacy; (iv) when 36 AEA and N -oleoylethanolamine analogues, most of which with phenyl rings in the polar head group region, were tested as inhibitors of AEA cellular uptake, strict structural and stereochemical requirements were needed to observe significant inhibition, and in no case the inhibition of FAAH overlapped with the inhibition of AEA uptake; and (v) AEA biosynthesis by cells and sensory neurons was followed by AEA release, and this latter process, which cannot be facilitated by FAAH, was still blocked by an inhibitor of AEA uptake. We suggest that at least one protein different from FAAH is required to facilitate AEA transport across the plasma membrane in a selective and bi-directional way.","['Ligresti, Alessia', 'Morera, Enrico', 'Van Der Stelt, Mario', 'Monory, Krisztina', 'Lutz, Beat', 'Ortar, Giorgio', 'Di Marzo, Vincenzo']","['Ligresti A', 'Morera E', 'Van Der Stelt M', 'Monory K', 'Lutz B', 'Ortar G', 'Di Marzo V']","['Endocannabinoid Research Group, Institute of Biomolecular Chemistry, National Research Council, Via Campi Flegrei 34, Comprensorio Olivetti, Bldg. 70, 80078 Pozzuoli (NA), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (methyl arachidonylfluorophosphonate)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']","['Amidohydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Organophosphonates/pharmacology', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Rats', 'Synaptosomes/metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology']",2004/02/19 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2004/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2003/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20031812 [doi]', 'BJ20031812 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2004 May 15;380(Pt 1):265-72. doi: 10.1042/BJ20031812.,IM,,PMC1224156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown that principal component analysis (PCA) has the disadvantage that the resulting principal factors are not very informative, while correspondence factor analysis (CFA) has difficulties interpreting distances between objects. Spectral map analysis (SMA) is introduced as an alternative approach to the analysis of microarray data. Weighted SMA outperforms PCA, and is at least as powerful as CFA, in finding clusters in the samples, as well as identifying genes related to these clusters. SMA addresses the problem of data analysis in microarray experiments in a more appropriate manner than CFA, and allows more flexible weighting to the genes and samples. Proper weighting is important, since it enables less reliable data to be down-weighted and more reliable information to be emphasized.","['Wouters, Luc', 'Gohlmann, Hinrich W', 'Bijnens, Luc', 'Kass, Stefan U', 'Molenberghs, Geert', 'Lewi, Paul J']","['Wouters L', 'Gohlmann HW', 'Bijnens L', 'Kass SU', 'Molenberghs G', 'Lewi PJ']","['Center for Statistics, Limburgs Universitair Centrum, transnationale Universiteit Limburg, Universitaire Campus, gebouw D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium. luc.wouters@luc.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,"['Biometry/*methods', '*Gene Expression', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2004/02/19 05:00,2004/06/30 05:00,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.0006-341x.2003.00130.x [doi]'],ppublish,Biometrics. 2003 Dec;59(4):1131-9. doi: 10.1111/j.0006-341x.2003.00130.x.,IM,,,,,,['Biometrics. 2005 Jun;61(2):630-2; discussion 632-4.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of patients with AMegL and MegBC-CML attended in our institution between July 1993 and December 2000 were revised. Megakaryocytic lineage was established by the presence of one or more megakaryocyte/platelet associated antigens (CD41, CD42b, and CD61) in > 20% blast cells. RESULTS: In 90 months, 277 patients with acute leukemia were admitted and 25 with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis (BC) were identified. Twelve of 125 patients (9.6%) with acute myeloid leukemia were AMegL and 32% of cases with CML-BC were MegBC-CML. Leukemic cells of patients with AMegL expressed more frequently CD15 antigen than blast cells of those with MegBC-CML (83% and 37.5%; p < 0.05). In contrast, blast cells expressing myeloperoxidase were present in 50% and 10% of cases with MegBC-CML and AMegL, respectively (p < 0.05). Only one patient in each group obtained remission. Although median survival in patients with AMegL was lower (70 days) than in those with MegBC-CML (175 days) the difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: AMegL and MegBC-CML differ in some clinical and laboratory characteristics and are diseases with poor treatment response and short survival.","['Crespo, Erick', 'Lopez-Karpovitch, Xavier', 'Abraham-Simon, Jesus', 'Lome-Maldonado, Carmen', 'Piedras, Josefa']","['Crespo E', 'Lopez-Karpovitch X', 'Abraham-Simon J', 'Lome-Maldonado C', 'Piedras J']","['Departamentos de Hematologia y Oncologia, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*diagnosis/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2004/02/19 05:00,2004/03/31 05:00,['2004/02/19 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2003 Sep-Oct;55(5):494-501.,IM,"Supervivencia, caracteristicas clinicas y de laboratorio en leucemias megacarioblasticas de novo y secundaria.",,,,,['Rev Invest Clin. 2004 May-Jun;56(3):410-1; author reply 412.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: HTLV-1 seroprevalence and risk associated factors were first studied in all the pregnant women having delivered at St. Laurent between July 1991 and June 1993. Then, a retrospective analysis was performed in the children, aged between 18 months and 12 years old, born from HTLV-1 infected mothers, focusing especially on the duration of breast feeding and the level of HTLV-1 anti body titers and proviral load. RESULTS: The global HTLV-1 seroprevalence was 4.4% (75/1727) but it was more prevalent among ethnic groups of African origin such as the Noir Marron population (5.5%) and Haitians (6.3%). In the Noir-Marron population, which represents 70% of the studied population, HTLV-1 seropositivity was associated with a maternal age of>35 years, prior miscarriage, prior cesarean section, parity>4, gravidity>6 and negative rhesus factor. After logistic regression, HTLV-1 seropositivity remained associated with gravidity>6 and negative rhesus factor. Out of the 216 children born from 81 HTLV-1 infected mothers, only 21 were found to be HTLV-1 seropositive, giving a crude HTLV-1 transmission rate of 9.7% while among the 180 breast-fed children 10.6% were HTLV-1 seropositive. HTLV-1 seropositivity in children was associated with elevated maternal anti HTLV-1 antibody titer, high maternal HTLV-1 proviral load and child's gender, girls being more frequently HTLV-1 infected than boys. CONCLUSION: HTLV-1 infection, which can be responsible for severe pathologies in adults (adult T cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy) should be screened during pregnancy in women originating from high HTLV-1 endemic areas, as for France, mainly the French West Indies, French Guyana and Intertropical Africa. In case of HTLV-1 seropositivity, mothers should be informed on the risk of transmission and promotion of bottle feeding of their children should be strongly proposed.","['Carles, G', 'Tortevoye, P', 'Tuppin, P', 'Ureta-Vidal, A', 'Peneau, C', 'El Guindi, W', 'Gessain, A']","['Carles G', 'Tortevoye P', 'Tuppin P', 'Ureta-Vidal A', 'Peneau C', 'El Guindi W', 'Gessain A']","['Service de Gynecologie-Obstetrique, Centre Hospitalier Franck Joly, 97320 Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, Guyane.']",['fre'],['Journal Article'],France,J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris),"Journal de gynecologie, obstetrique et biologie de la reproduction",0322206,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],"['Adult', 'Breast Feeding', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Gravidity', 'Guyana/epidemiology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/statistics & numerical data', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rh Isoimmunization/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Viral Load']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0368-2315(04)96307-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0368-2315(04)96307-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris). 2004 Feb;33(1 Pt 1):14-20. doi: 10.1016/s0368-2315(04)96307-7.,IM,Infection par le retrovirus HTLV-1 et grossesse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is of prime importance to determine the characteristic features of a receptive endometrium. Embryo implantation is a complex event involving apposition followed by the adhesion of the blastocyst to the maternal endometrium, and finally the invasion of this endometrium. Though implantation could occur in any human tissue, the endometrium is the only tissue where embryo implantation cannot occur except during a restricted period called the ""implantation window"". During this window, the endometrium is highly receptive to the embryo. Maternal-embryo crosstalk is favored by the implantation window. The molecular basis of the implantation window remains to be defined In the present study, we investigated the role of hCG, TGFbeta1, IGF1 and IGF2 in the secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by human epithelial endometrial cells in culture. Epithelial endometrial cells were obtained from endometrial biopsy in 28 fertile women. HCG and TGFbeta1 added to primary cultures of human epithelial endometrial cells showed a stimulatory effect on LIF secretion and a reducing effect on IL-6 secretion.

The decision to proceed with this treatment depends on the drugs used, the time of exposure for the fetus and the gestational age at the time of exposure. The mutagenic potential of the chosen drug has to be known. The risk for the child can then be established without compromising the mother's chances of survival or well-being. This type of situation generally arises in women with breast cancer, leukemia or lymphoma. The first trimester of pregnancy, which corresponds to organogenesis is the most critical period for the fetus. The greatest risk of malformation occurs with anti-metabolite drugs. Chemotherapy can also expose the child to direct in utero toxicity. Myelosuppression is the most common toxic effect, sometimes giving rise to infections and/or fetal hemorrhage. The long-term risks of cancer on the mother's subsequent fertility or the child's intellectual development are not well-known. Such factors must be examined in prospective studies and registered in a specific database.","['Pautier, P', 'Lhomme, C', 'Morice, P']","['Pautier P', 'Lhomme C', 'Morice P']","['Service de Gynecologie, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif. pautier@igr.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris),"Journal de gynecologie, obstetrique et biologie de la reproduction",0322206,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/etiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Outcome']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0368-2315(04)96660-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0368-2315(04)96660-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris). 2004 Feb;33(1 Suppl):S23-8. doi: 10.1016/s0368-2315(04)96660-4.,IM,Cancer et grossesse: chimiotherapie pendant la grossesse.,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,

The feather follicle cells were isolated from growing feathers of adult White Leghorn chicken. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was used to maintain the characterization of the keratinocyte colony-forming cells (KCFCs). The EGFPN1 plasmid DNA retroviral vector was used to deliver Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene, which was introduced to the KCFCs by lipofection. After removal of the fibroblast-like cells, the feather KCFCs attached to the substrate within 24 h of seeding. The cells continued to proliferate for at least 30 days in the presence of LIF. The cell-adhesion molecules such as integrin beta1 and CD49c were immunocytochemically positive in the cells. The KCFCs differentiated into barbular cells and pennaceous feather vane in the LIF-free medium. The GFP gene-transfected KCFCs stably expressed GFP. The present results indicate that the KCFCs derived from feather follicles are closely related to multipotent stem cells. In addition, gene manipulation of such stem cells may be useful for the production of chimera in avian species.","['Xi, Yongmei', 'Nada, Yoichi', 'Soh, Tomoki', 'Fujihara, Noboru', 'Hattori, Masa-aki']","['Xi Y', 'Nada Y', 'Soh T', 'Fujihara N', 'Hattori MA']","['Laboratory of Reproductive Physiology and Biotechnology, Department of Animal and Marine Bioresource Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Graduate School Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Reprod Dev,The Journal of reproduction and development,9438792,['147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)'],"['Animals', 'Birds/*anatomy & histology/*genetics', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chickens', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Feathers/*cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Hair Follicle/*cytology', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",2004/02/18 05:00,2006/07/28 09:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1262/jrd.49.213 [doi]'],ppublish,J Reprod Dev. 2003 Jun;49(3):213-9. doi: 10.1262/jrd.49.213.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is little information on its expression in gastric carcinoma. We sought to investigate the expression of PTTG1 in gastric carcinoma and to explore the relationship between its expression and clinicopathological factors. METHODS: We studied 75 primary human gastric adenocarcinomas, including 17 mucosal carcinomas, 21 submucosal infiltrative carcinomas, 12 carcinomas invading proprial muscle layers, 6 carcinomas reaching the subserosa, and 19 carcinomas penetrating the serosal surface. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using paraffin-embedded sections of gastric adenocarcinomas. RESULTS: PTTG1 was expressed heterogeneously in carcinomas. Positive PTTG1 staining was observed in 65.3% of the carcinomas (49 of 75). Its expression did not correlate significantly with either the histological type or the depth of infiltration of the gastric carcinomas. However, a statistical analysis showed significant differences between the primary adenocarcinomas and the associated metastatic lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that PTTG1 expression is enhanced in metastatic lymph nodes in comparison to that in primary carcinomas. We suggest that PTTG1 may contribute to lymph node metastases in gastric carcinoma.","['Wen, Chun-Yang', 'Nakayama, Toshiyuki', 'Wang, Ai-Ping', 'Nakashima, Masahiro', 'Ding, Yi-Tao', 'Ito, Masahiro', 'Ishibashi, Hiromi', 'Matsuu, Mutsumi', 'Shichijo, Kazuko', 'Sekine, Ichiro']","['Wen CY', 'Nakayama T', 'Wang AP', 'Nakashima M', 'Ding YT', 'Ito M', 'Ishibashi H', 'Matsuu M', 'Shichijo K', 'Sekine I']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan. cywen518@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Securin)', '0 (pituitary tumor-transforming protein 1, human)']","['Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism/secondary', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Securin', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3748/wjg.v10.i4.481 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2004 Feb 15;10(4):481-3. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v10.i4.481.,IM,,PMC4716965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first study to evaluate proven fertility among adult male survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In a retrospective cohort study, proven fertility (ever fathered a pregnancy) was evaluated by self-report among 213 men treated for ALL before age 18 on protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG). Controls (N = 145) were drawn from among male siblings. Overall, with a proportional hazards analysis, proven fertility of male survivors was not different from that of controls (relative fertility (RF) = 0.95, 95% CI 0.63-1.43). However, married men treated before age 10 with high dose (24 cGy) cranial radiotherapy (RT), without spinal RT, had only 9% of the fertility of controls (Relative risk, RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.82). High dose cranial RT at older ages was not associated with a statistically significant fertility deficit (RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.25-1.28). In this first study of proven fertility among men treated for childhood leukemia, the majority of survivors showed no evidence of fertility impairment compared to controls. However, men treated at a young age with high dose cranial RT may have impaired fertility. These results suggest that further investigation of men with these treatments is needed to confirm and extend these findings.","['Byrne, Julianne', 'Fears, Thomas R', 'Mills, James L', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie K', 'Sklar, Charles', 'Meadows, Anna T', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Byrne J', 'Fears TR', 'Mills JL', 'Zeltzer LK', 'Sklar C', 'Meadows AT', 'Reaman GH', 'Robison LL']","[""The Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA. jbyrne@cnmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fertility', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/radiotherapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Survivors']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/04/24 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.10449 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Apr;42(4):364-72. doi: 10.1002/pbc.10449.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested, on the basis of findings in epidemiological studies, that ALL may be initiated by an in utero infection of the fetus. The human parvovirus B19 (B19) is etiologically related to human diseases, including erythema infectiosum and aplastic crisis, but it has not yet been considered to be involved in the development of ALL. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate, whether prenatal B19 infection could still be indirectly correlated with the development of childhood ALL. PROCEDURES: Fifty-four Guthrie cards, collected at 3-5 days of age, from Swedish children who subsequently developed ALL, as well as from 50 healthy controls, were investigated by nested PCR for the presence of B19 DNA. RESULTS: B19 DNA was not detected in any of the Guthrie cards from ALL patients or from healthy controls, although all tested samples had amplifiable cellular DNA as confirmed by an HLA DQ specific PCR. CONCLUSION: B19 DNA was not found in any of the Guthrie cards from children who later developed ALL or in the healthy controls. These findings suggest that it is less likely that childhood ALL is associated with an in utero in fection with B19.","['Isa, Adiba', 'Priftakis, Peter', 'Broliden, Kristina', 'Gustafsson, Britt']","['Isa A', 'Priftakis P', 'Broliden K', 'Gustafsson B']","['Department of Immunology, Microbiology, and Pathology, Division of Clinical Virology, Huddinge University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']","['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/virology', '*Neonatal Screening', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/virology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*virology', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/04/24 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20001 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Apr;42(4):357-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20001.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Because chemotherapy also causes cell malfunction and death, for identifying a neurologic effect, we studied the activity of beta-glucuronidase in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of leukemic children during treatment. PROCEDURE: The beta-glucuronidase activity in CSF was determined in 13 patients with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with the medium risk arm of ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 95 protocol. Plasma methotrexate (MTX) levels were determined at 24 and 48 hr after the infusion of high-dose (5 g/m(2)/24 hr) MTX (MCA phase). RESULTS: The mean (SD) beta-glucuronidase activity prior to the onset of chemotherapy was 19.9 (5.6) nmoles/4-methylumbelliferone/ml/hr. No significant changes in activity were noted during the phases of the protocol except of the MCA3. The activity was 24.4 (6.8) on MCA2, 28.4 (9.3) on MCA3, and 24.1 (9.5) on MCA4. The beta-glucuronidase activity was positively correlated with the plasma MTX levels at both 24 hr (r = 0.483, P = 0.006) and 48 hr (r = 0.676, P < 0.0001). No progressive changes were noted during the different phases of the protocol. The greatest beta-glucuronidase activity was measured in two patients with neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The beta-glucuronidase activity is increased in the CSF of leukemic children receiving high-dose MTX and particularly in neurotoxicity. It is positively correlated with plasma MTX levels. No cumulative effect of the chemotherapy was observed. The increased beta-glucuronidase activity is most likely due to enzyme leakage through the cell membranes caused mainly by a toxic effect of MTX on the cells of the central nervous system (CNS).","['Vlacha, Vasiliki', 'Eliopoulou, Maria', 'Haidas, Stavros', 'Beratis, Nicholas G']","['Vlacha V', 'Eliopoulou M', 'Haidas S', 'Beratis NG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Patras, School of Medicine, General University Hospital, Patras, Greece. vasovlaka@mail.gr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Female', 'Glucuronidase/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inflammation/chemically induced', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/*blood/toxicity', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/*drug therapy']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/04/24 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20002 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Apr;42(4):350-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20002.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

All these hemato-oncologic malignancies occurred in the background of a secondary immunodeficiency, most likely caused by cytotoxic treatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Using a stepwise molecular approach, we were able to demonstrate that the liver infiltrates were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive, contained monoclonal mature B-cells with immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) gene rearrangements unrelated to the primary ALL, and thus represented a true secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In contrast, the skin infiltrates consisted of myelo-monocytic cells with clonal IGH and T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangements, identical to the precursor-B-ALL blasts at diagnosis. Thus, the disease course of the precursor-B-ALL patient was complicated by two different isolated extramedullary relapses (brain and skin) and a secondary EBV(+) B-NHL.","['Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'de Vaan, Gerard A M', 'Beishuizen, Auke', 'Bogman, Jose', 'Jansen, Mieke W J C', 'van Wering, Elisabeth R', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M']","['Szczepanski T', 'de Vaan GA', 'Beishuizen A', 'Bogman J', 'Jansen MW', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']","['Child', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/etiology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/etiology/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/04/24 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.10466 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Apr;42(4):343-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.10466.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Central line data was collected on all children with ALL referred to the National Guard Hospital, Jeddah. Data was collected retrospectively from 1996 to September 1999 and prospectively thereafter. Only ECs were inserted prior to 1999 subsequently TIDs were preferred. RESULTS: One hundred forty eight children with ALL, mean age 5.1 years had 129 ECs and 70 TIDs inserted for a total of 41,382 catheter days. The overall rate of infective episodes (infections/1,000 catheter days) was 3.43. Of the initial 148 lines 100 developed complications of which 76 (51%) were secondary to an infective episode. Only young age and treatment protocol were risk factors for first line infections (P < 0.05). There was weak evidence that ECs had an earlier time to infection compared to TIDs (P = 0.056).

Chronic, low-dose, oral VP-16 has also been shown to be active in some recurrent malignancies mostly in adults. The aim of this prospective, single institution study is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of oral VP-16 in children with progressive or recurrent (P/R) sarcomas. PROCEDURE: Twenty-one children (10 girls and 11 boys) with R/P sarcomas and a median age of 11 years (range 3-16 years) were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis was Ewing sarcoma family tumor (ESFT) in seven, osteosarcoma in eight, rhabdomyosarcoma in four, clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue in one, fibrosarcoma in one patient. Oral VP-16 was administered at a dose of 50 mg/m(2)/daily for 20 days. The next course was initiated after a 10 day rest. Response to oral VP-16 was assessed after two courses. RESULTS: There was an objective response (one complete response [CR], two partial responses [PR]) in three patients (14%) by two courses of oral VP-16 alone. One of these patients with PR achieved CR by the use of radiotherapy (RT) and further oral VP-16. Two more patients (9.5%) achieved CR by RT and oral VP-16. Eight (38%) patients had disease stabilization for 2-15 months. Two patients (9.5%) are long-term survivors. They are alive with no evidence of disease (NED) 79 and 94 months from time of relapse/progressive disease (PD). A patient developed acute myeloid leukemia and died. There was no major acute toxicity related to oral VP-16 in a total of 126 courses. CONCLUSIONS: Oral VP-16 therapy is simple, relatively nontoxic, and does not necessitate hospitalization. The cure rate is small. Given the risk of second malignancy, especially in children with previous exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents, this regimen may be used as a palliative treatment or in patients with poor prognosis.","['Kebudi, Rejin', 'Gorgun, Omer', 'Ayan, Inci']","['Kebudi R', 'Gorgun O', 'Ayan I']","['Istanbul University, Oncology Institute, Division of Pediatric Oncology, Capa, Istanbul, Turkey. rejinkebudi@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']","['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Palliative Care', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/04/24 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.10393 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Apr;42(4):320-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.10393.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Previously, the role of oncogenic ras in cancer was assessed in model systems overexpressing oncogenic ras from heterologous promoters. However, there is increasing evidence that subtle differences in gene dosage and regulation of gene expression from endogenous promoters play critical roles in cancer pathogenesis. We characterized the role of oncogenic K-ras expressed from its endogenous promoter in the hematopoietic system using a conditional allele and IFN-inducible, Cre-mediated recombination. Mice developed a completely penetrant myeloproliferative syndrome characterized by leukocytosis with normal maturation of myeloid lineage cells; myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow; and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and liver. Flow cytometry confirmed the myeloproliferative phenotype. Genotypic and Western blot analysis demonstrated Cre-mediated excision and expression, respectively, of the oncogenic K-ras allele. Bone marrow cells formed growth factor-independent colonies in methylcellulose cultures, but the myeloproliferative disease was not transplantable into secondary recipients. Thus, oncogenic K-ras induces a myeloproliferative disorder but not AML, indicating that additional mutations are required for AML development. This model system will be useful for assessing the contribution of cooperating mutations in AML and testing ras inhibitors in vivo.","['Chan, Iris T', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Cohen, Sarah', 'Kelly, Lauren', 'Shigematsu, Hirokazu', 'Johnson, Leisa', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Tuveson, David A', 'Jacks, Tyler', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Chan IT', 'Kutok JL', 'Williams IR', 'Cohen S', 'Kelly L', 'Shigematsu H', 'Johnson L', 'Akashi K', 'Tuveson DA', 'Jacks T', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,,"['Adenoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, ras', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Papilloma/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/03/27 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI20476 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2004 Feb;113(4):528-38. doi: 10.1172/JCI20476.,IM,,PMC338267,,,"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK51564/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with the normal controls, ET patients have a greater tendency to express the bcr-abl transcript in PBLs (P=.06, Fisher's exact test). Further semiquantitative analysis showed that the intensity of bcr-abl transcript expression in 4 ET patients and a normal individual was 10(3) to 10(4) times less than that in the CML patients.

However, the precise mechanisms for GvHD prevention and the effect on graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) activity are unknown. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of FK506, given at clinically relevant doses, on donor T-cell functions responsible for GvHD and GvL activity. METHODS: The effect of FK506 on GvHD prevention and GvL activity was investigated using a murine model of allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation in which mice were injected with a P815 leukemic cell line. The regulatory role of FK506 on donor T cells was tested by analysis of donor T-cell expansions in the spleen and donor anti-host T-cell proliferative and cytotoxic responses. mRNA expression of type 1 T helper (Th1), Fas ligand (L), and granzyme B were also evaluated in target organs of GvHD. RESULTS: FK506 significantly prolonged the survival of GvHD mice when given at the trough level of 17.6 ng/mL, whereas it also blocked GvL effect in P815-injected GvHD mice. FK506 reduced the expansion of donor CD8+ and, to a lesser extent, CD4+ T cells in the spleen and inhibited donor anti-host T-cell proliferative and cytotoxic responses. It also inhibited the induction of Th1, FasL, and granzyme B mRNA expression in target organs of GvHD. CONCLUSIONS: FK506 inhibits both GvHD and GvL activity when given at clinical doses by inhibiting donor T-cell expansion, donor anti-host T-cell reactivity, and Th1 immune responses.","['Imado, Takehito', 'Iwasaki, Tsuyoshi', 'Kuroiwa, Takanori', 'Sano, Hajime', 'Hara, Hiroshi']","['Imado T', 'Iwasaki T', 'Kuroiwa T', 'Sano H', 'Hara H']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']","['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Endopeptidases/genetics', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/*physiology', 'Granzymes', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Tacrolimus/*pharmacology', '*Tissue Donors', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/03/30 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.TP.0000111759.48240.F5 [doi]', '00007890-200402150-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2004 Feb 15;77(3):391-8. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000111759.48240.F5.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of these genes has an obligatory role in lymphopoiesis. In addition, while null mutations of Lmo1 or Lmo3 have no discernible phenotype, null mutation of Lmo4 alone causes perinatal lethality due to a severe neural tube defect which occurs in the form of anencephaly or exencephaly. Since the Lmo1 and Lmo3 gene sequences are highly related and have partly overlapping expression domains, we assessed the effect of compound Lmo1/Lmo3 null mutations. Although no anatomical defects were apparent in compound null pups, these animals also die within 24 h of birth, suggesting that a compensation between the related Lmo1 and 3 proteins can occur during embryogenesis to negate the individual loss of these genes.

Intriguingly, only Abd-B Hox genes have been reported as fusion partners, indicating that they may have unique overlapping leukemogenic properties. To address this hypothesis, we engineered novel NUP98 fusions with Hox genes not previously identified as fusion partners: the Abd-B-like gene HOXA10 and two Antennepedia-like genes, HOXB3 and HOXB4. Notably, NUP98-HOXA10 and NUP98-HOXB3 but not NUP98-HOXB4 induced leukemia in a murine transplant model, which is consistent with the reported leukemogenic potential ability of HOXA10 and HOXB3 but not HOXB4. Thus, the ability of Hox genes to induce leukemia as NUP98 fusion partners, although apparently redundant for Abd-B-like activity, is not restricted to this group, but rather is determined by the intrinsic leukemogenic potential of the Hox partner. We also show that the potent leukemogenic activity of Abd-B-like Hox genes is correlated with their strong ability to block hematopoietic differentiation.

The scl/tal-1 transcription factor is essential for lineage commitment to blood cell formation and previous studies identified an scl enhancer (the +18/19 element) which was sufficient to target the vast majority of hematopoietic stem cells, together with hematopoietic progenitors and endothelium. Moreover, expression of scl under control of the +18/19 enhancer rescued blood progenitor formation in scl(-/-) embryos. However, here we demonstrate by using a knockout approach that, within the endogenous scl locus, the +18/19 enhancer is not necessary for the initiation of scl transcription or for the formation of hematopoietic cells. These results led to the identification of a bifunctional 5' enhancer (-3.8 element), which targets expression to hematopoietic progenitors and endothelium, contains conserved critical Ets sites, and is bound by Ets family transcription factors, including Fli-1 and Elf-1. These data demonstrate that two geographically distinct but functionally related enhancers regulate scl transcription in hematopoietic progenitors and endothelial cells and suggest that enhancers with dual hematopoietic-endothelial activity may represent a general strategy for regulating blood and endothelial development.","['Gottgens, Berthold', 'Broccardo, Cyril', 'Sanchez, Maria-Jose', 'Deveaux, Sophie', 'Murphy, George', 'Gothert, Joachim R', 'Kotsopoulou, Ekaterini', 'Kinston, Sarah', 'Delaney, Liz', 'Piltz, Sandie', 'Barton, Linda M', 'Knezevic, Kathy', 'Erber, Wendy N', 'Begley, C Glenn', 'Frampton, Jonathan', 'Green, Anthony R']","['Gottgens B', 'Broccardo C', 'Sanchez MJ', 'Deveaux S', 'Murphy G', 'Gothert JR', 'Kotsopoulou E', 'Kinston S', 'Delaney L', 'Piltz S', 'Barton LM', 'Knezevic K', 'Erber WN', 'Begley CG', 'Frampton J', 'Green AR']","['Department of Hematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. bg200@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELF1 protein, human)', '0 (Elf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/anatomy & histology/physiology', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/04/02 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.24.5.1870-1883.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Mar;24(5):1870-83. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.5.1870-1883.2004.,IM,,PMC350551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of the critical role calcium plays in T cell function coupled with previous findings demonstrating disruption of the calcium-regulated transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells, by cannabinoid treatment, the objective of the present investigation was to perform an initial characterization of the role of the cannabinoid receptors in the regulation of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) by delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta(9)-THC) in T lymphocytes. Here, we demonstrate that delta(9)-THC robustly elevates [Ca(2+)](i) in purified murine splenic T cells and in the human peripheral blood acute lymphoid leukemia (HPB-ALL) human T cell line but only minimally elevates [Ca(2+)](i) in Jurkat E6-1 (dysfunctional cannabinoid receptor 2-expressing) human T cells. Removal of extracellular calcium severely attenuated the delta(9)-THC-mediated rise in [Ca(2+)](i) in murine splenic T cells and HPB-ALL cells. Pretreatment with cannabinoid receptor antagonists, SR144528 and/or SR141716A, led to an attenuation of delta(9)-THC-mediated elevation in [Ca(2+)](i) in splenic T cells and HPB-ALL cells but not in Jurkat E6-1 cells. Furthermore, pretreatment of HPB-ALL cells with SR144528 antagonized the small rise in [Ca(2+)](i) elicited by delta(9)-THC in the absence of extracellular calcium. These findings suggest that delta(9)-THC induces an influx of extracellular calcium in resting T cells in a cannabinoid receptor-dependent manner.","['Rao, Gautham K', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Kaminski, Norbert E']","['Rao GK', 'Zhang W', 'Kaminski NE']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, National Food Safety and Toxicology Center, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Camphanes)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '0 (SR 144528)', '7J8897W37S (Dronabinol)', 'RML78EN3XE (Rimonabant)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Camphanes/pharmacology', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Antagonists', 'Cannabinoids/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dronabinol/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid/*physiology', 'Rimonabant', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1189/jlb.1203638 [doi]', 'jlb.1203638 [pii]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 May;75(5):884-92. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1203638.

Here we demonstrate that chemokines also serve to potentiate effector cell-mediated antineoplastic immune responses in vaccination strategies. As a critical mediator of inflammation, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (CCL3/MIP-1alpha) attracts and stimulates both antigen-presenting and cytotoxic cells. In the A20 leukemia/lymphoma vaccine model, we explored the efficacy of MIP-1alpha in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). After subcutaneous injection of the MIP-1alpha + IL-2 or MIP-1alpha + GM-CSF combination vaccine, focal but pronounced infiltrates of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed at the vaccination sites. In mice with preestablished leukemia/lymphoma, survival is significantly improved in animals treated with MIP-1alpha + GM-CSF- and MIP-1alpha + IL-2-secreting vaccines. Protection is superior in the MIP-1alpha + GM-CSF group, with the effects of MIP-1alpha and GM-CSF being synergistic. In contrast, suppression of lymphoblast proliferation by single-immunogen vaccines secreting MIP-1alpha, GM-CSF, or IL-2 alone does not translate to improved survival. The systemic protective effects afforded by the MIP-1alpha + IL-2 or MIP-1alpha + GM-CSF combination are mediated by different effector cell populations. In the MIP-1alpha + IL-2 group, antineoplastic defense is mediated by CD8+ T and NK cells, whereas in the MIP-1alpha + GM-CSF group CD4+ T cells are involved in addition to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, underscoring that T cell help is critical for long-term protection. Thus combination of MIP-1alpha with different cytokines recruits different sets of effector cells into a potent antineoplastic immune response.","['Zibert, Andree', 'Balzer, Stefan', 'Souquet, Manfred', 'Quang, Trong Hung', 'Paris-Scholz, Cristina', 'Roskrow, Marie', 'Dilloo, Dagmar']","['Zibert A', 'Balzer S', 'Souquet M', 'Quang TH', 'Paris-Scholz C', 'Roskrow M', 'Dilloo D']","['Clinic for Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*pharmacology', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Cross-Priming', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Time Factors']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430340460732436 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2004 Jan;15(1):21-34. doi: 10.1089/10430340460732436.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we studied the effects of ZOL on various cell cycle regulators, including p53, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK inhibitors and cyclins, using BV173 leukemia and HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell lines, harboring wild-type (wt-) p53. ZOL induced the accumulation of neither p53 nor p21(WAF1/CIP1) during the execution of apoptosis in BV173 cells. Therefore, we investigated the dependence of ZOL-induced apoptosis on intact p53 by using wt-p53 HCT116 and a p53-degraded HCT116 subline, and observed no significant difference. p57(KIP2) was upregulated by ZOL in BV173 cells, but not in HCT116 cells. Flow cytometric analyses showed that ZOL also impaired the cell cycle-dependent expression patterns of cyclins A, B and D3 in BV173. In conclusion, the p53-independent anti-tumor activities of ZOL suggest that it may be an attractive agent for treating cancers, including those with chemoresistance resulting from the loss of p53 function.

Cell viability was determined by means of the Trypan blue dye exclusion test immediately after sonication. Apoptosis was measured after 6-h incubation post-sonication by flow cytometry. Free radicals generated by AAPH, a temperature-dependent free radical generator, or US or both were also investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping. The results showed that US-induced cell lysis and apoptosis were enhanced in the presence of AAPH regardless of the temperature at the time of sonication. At 40.0 degrees C, US alone induced increased cell killing, while AAPH alone is capable of inducing significant but minimal apoptosis at this temperature. Although free radicals were increased in the combined treatment, this increase did not correlate well with cell killing.

The antiproliferative effects of ASD seem attributable to its induction of apoptosis in the cells, as it blocked the cell cycle, induced hypodiploidity and bound annexin V and also cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in these cell lines. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of ASD on MOLT-4, THP-1 and Jurkat T cells were found to be 60, 85 and 60 ng/ml, respectively. ASD arrested the cell cycle at the G1/S transition and showed hypodiploidity due to the accumulation of sub-G0 population. Annexin V binding was increased in the presence of ASD in the MOLT-4 cell line in a time-dependent manner. ASD and three of its derivatives also induced cleavage of PARP in both MOLT-4 and Jurkat T cell lines. From these data, it is suggested that ASD exerts its cytotoxic activity by inducing apoptosis in leukaemia cell lines in vitro.","['Han, H C', 'Lindequist, U', 'Hyun, J W', 'Kim, Y H', 'An, H S', 'Lee, D H', 'Kim, H W']","['Han HC', 'Lindequist U', 'Hyun JW', 'Kim YH', 'An HS', 'Lee DH', 'Kim HW']","['Department of Life Science, University of Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0 (4beta-acetoxyscirpendiol)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'I3FL5NM3MO (T-2 Toxin)']","['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics', 'Diploidy', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Paecilomyces/*chemistry', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'T-2 Toxin/analogs & derivatives/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2004/02/18 05:00,2004/03/09 05:00,['2004/02/18 05:00'],"['2004/02/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2004 Jan;59(1):42-9.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ddNTP primer extension technique is based on the extension, in the presence of fluorescence-labeled dideoxy nucleotides (ddNTP, terminators), of an unlabeled oligonucleotide primer that binds to the complementary template immediately adjacent to the mutant nucleotide position. Given that there are no unlabeled dNTPs, a single ddNTP is added to its 3' end, resulting in a fluorescence-labeled primer extension product which is readily separated by capillary electrophoresis. On the other hand, the non-radioisotopic version of SSCP established in this study uses fluorescent dye to label the PCR products, which are also analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. These procedures were used to identify a well-defined SNP in exon 7 of the human p53 gene in DNA samples isolated from two human cell lines (CEM and THP-1 cells). The results revealed a heterozygous single-base transition (G to A) at nucleotide position 14071 in CEM cells, proving that both fluorescence-based ddNTP primer extension and SSCP are rapid, simple, robust, specific and with no ambiguity in interpretation for the detection of well-defined SNPs.","['Bernat, Montse', 'Titos, Esther', 'Claria, Joan']","['Bernat M', 'Titos E', 'Claria J']","[""DNA Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institut d' Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona 08036, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Dideoxynucleosides)']","['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA Primers/*genetics', 'Dideoxynucleosides/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary/*methods', 'Exons', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",2004/02/14 05:00,2004/04/30 05:00,['2004/02/14 05:00'],"['2004/02/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['0026 [pii]'],epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2002 Mar 31;1(1):72-8.,IM,,,,,,,,,20020331,,,,,,,,,,,

This is strongly desirable when a large number of gene expression profiles have to be analyzed and proper clusters of genes need to be identified for further analysis, such as the search for meaningful patterns, identification of gene functions or gene response analysis. RESULTS: We propose a new cluster quality method, called stability, by which unsupervised learning of gene expression data can be performed efficiently. The method takes into account a cluster's stability on partition. We evaluate this method and demonstrate its performance using four independent, real gene expression and three simulated datasets. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other techniques listed in the literature. The method has applications in evaluating clustering validity as well as identifying stable clusters.

Within the adult hematopoietic system, it allows for tight regulation of hematopoietic cell subsets. Previously, it was shown that B-cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) overexpression in the adult increases the viability and activity of hematopoietic cells under normal and/or stressful conditions. However, a role for apoptosis in the embryonic hematopoietic system has not yet been established. Since the first hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are generated within the aortagonad-mesonephros (AGM; an actively remodeling tissue) region beginning at embryonic day 10.5, we examined this tissue for expression of apoptosis-related genes and ongoing apoptosis. Here, we show expression of several proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes in the AGM. We also generated transgenic mice overexpressing Bcl-2 under the control of the transcriptional regulatory elements of the HSC marker stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1), to test for the role of cell survival in the regulation of AGM HSCs. We provide evidence for increased numbers and viability of Sca-1(+) cells in the AGM and subdissected midgestation aortas, the site where HSCs are localized. Most important, our in vivo transplantation data show that Bcl-2 overexpression increases AGM and fetal liver HSC activity, strongly suggesting that apoptosis plays a role in HSC development.","['Orelio, Claudia', 'Harvey, Kirsty N', 'Miles, Colin', 'Oostendorp, Robert A J', 'van der Horn, Karin', 'Dzierzak, Elaine']","['Orelio C', 'Harvey KN', 'Miles C', 'Oostendorp RA', 'van der Horn K', 'Dzierzak E']","['Erasmus University Medical Centre, Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, PO Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics/metabolism', 'Aorta/embryology/physiology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gestational Age', 'Gonads/embryology/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Liver/embryology/physiology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mesonephros/embryology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism']",2004/02/14 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/02/14 05:00'],"['2004/02/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-06-1827 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55400-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 1;103(11):4084-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-06-1827.

To address this issue, we analyzed the clinical, hematologic, and molecular characteristics of 81 unrelated patients with SCN (n = 54) or CN (n = 27). We identified mutations in 31 patients, two thirds of whom had sporadic forms. Familial cases were consistent with dominant inheritance. Seventeen novel mutations were identified, showing that the mutational spectrum encompasses not only the region encoding the mature enzyme but also the prodomains and promoter region. Genotype-phenotype analysis strongly suggested that ELA2 mutations correlate with more severe expression of neutropenia, specifically in patients diagnosed with SCN. This study underlines the importance of ELA2 molecular screening to identify patients who may be at particular risk of severe bacterial infections and/or acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia.

We previously showed that AML blasts from GO refractory patients frequently express the drug transporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and/or multidrug resistance protein (MRP). We also previously reported that inhibition of drug transport by the Pgp modulator, cyclosporine A (CSA), can increase GO sensitivity in Pgp(+) AML cells and that the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, PK11195, sensitizes AML cells to standard chemotherapeutics both by inhibiting Pgp-mediated efflux and by promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. We now show that PK11195 also can overcome multiple resistance mechanisms to increase GO sensitivity in AML cells, including resistance associated with expression of drug transporters and/or antiapoptotic proteins. PK11195 substantially increases GO cytotoxicity in AML cells from many different cell lines and primary patient samples, often more effectively than CSA. We also show that PK11195 is nontoxic in NOD/SCID mice and can sensitize xenografted human AML cells to GO.

Antigen encounter by the cell of origin is indicated in both subsets by selective but distinct expression of V genes, with evidence for continuing stimulation after transformation. The key to distinctive tumor behavior likely relates to the differential ability of the B-cell receptor (BCR) to respond. Both subsets may be undergoing low-level signaling in vivo, although analysis of blood cells limits knowledge of critical events in the tissue microenvironment. Analysis of signal competence in vitro reveals that unmutated CLL generally continues to respond, whereas mutated CLL is anergized. Differential responsiveness may reflect the increased ability of post-germinal center B cells to be triggered by antigen, leading to long-term anergy. This could minimize cell division in mutated CLL and account for prognostic differences. Unifying features of CLL include low responsiveness, expression of CD25, and production of immunosuppressive cytokines. These properties are reminiscent of regulatory T cells and suggest that the cell of origin of CLL might be a regulatory B cell. Continuing regulatory activity, mediated via autoantigen, could suppress Ig production and lead to disease-associated hypogammaglobulinemia.","['Stevenson, Freda K', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico']","['Stevenson FK', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Tenovus Laboratory, Cancer Sciences Division, Southampton University Hospitals Trust, Southampton SO16 6YD, United Kingdom. fs@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Superantigens)']","['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Communication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Stromal Cells/immunology', 'Superantigens/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2004/02/14 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/02/14 05:00'],"['2004/02/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4312 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54554-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Jun 15;103(12):4389-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4312.

During the treatment, no deterioration of liver parameters was observed, and the virus load decreased. After therapy with campath, hemoglobin and platelet counts increased markedly.

Median survival after diagnosis is 10 yr, with chemotherapy resistance being a major problem in advanced disease. Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a monoclonal antibody directed against the lymphocytic antigen CD52, expressed on B- and T-cells. Alemtuzumab is approved for relapsing chronic B-cell leukemia and seems to be active also in T-cell lymphomas such as T-cell prolymphocytic lymphoma, SS and mycosis fungiodes. CASE HISTORY: A 32-yr-old male patient presented with advanced stage, extensively pretreated SS with heavily itching erythroderma, peripheral lymphadenopathy, circulating Sezary cells and bone marrow infiltration. The disease had not responded to PUVA/interferon-alpha and progressed on chemotherapy with CHOP, 2-CDA, vinorelbine, etoposide and liposomal doxorubicin. Following treatment with alemtuzumab (30 mg i.v. three times per week for 10 wk), itching resolved rapidly and an almost complete remission was achieved within 3 months after starting this treatment. At 12-month follow up, no disease progression was present. CONCLUSION: In accordance with previous data, this single case underlines the potent activity of alemtuzumab in advanced, chemotherapy-refractory SS.","['Gautschi, O', 'Blumenthal, N', 'Streit, M', 'Solenthaler, M', 'Hunziker, T', 'Zenhausern, R']","['Gautschi O', 'Blumenthal N', 'Streit M', 'Solenthaler M', 'Hunziker T', 'Zenhausern R']","['Institute of Medical Oncology, University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland. oliver.gautschi@insel.ch']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']","['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Sezary Syndrome/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy']",2004/02/14 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2004/02/14 05:00'],"['2004/02/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1046/j.0902-4441.2004.00169.x [doi]', 'EJH169 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Jan;72(1):61-3. doi: 10.1046/j.0902-4441.2004.00169.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WT1 has been shown in vitro to interact with the promoter of the MDR1, a gene involved in the multidrug resistance phenomenon. The aim of this study was to measure, by real-time polymerase chain reaction, levels of WT1 and MDR1 expression, in order to find a possible association between these genes, in a series of 50 newly diagnosed AML cases. Twenty-five percent of patients carried very high (>75 degrees percentile) MDR1- and 23.3%WT1-mRNA levels. Interestingly, high levels of WT1 were significantly correlated with correspondent high levels of MDR1 gene. Nevertheless, the co-expression of these genes did not significantly influence the complete response rate to the induction therapy. Reported data confirm the existence of a co-expression of WT1 and MDR1 genes even in vivo; this may be relevant because one consequence could be the positive selection by chemotherapeutic regimens of cells with higher MDR1 levels already present before treatment. Thus, the association between these genes could suggest avoiding the use of drugs involved in the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon in patients carrying high levels of WT1 at diagnosis.","['Galimberti, S', 'Guerrini, F', 'Carulli, G', 'Fazzi, R', 'Palumbo, G A', 'Morabito, F', 'Petrini, M']","['Galimberti S', 'Guerrini F', 'Carulli G', 'Fazzi R', 'Palumbo GA', 'Morabito F', 'Petrini M']","['Department of Oncology, Transplant and Advances in Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']","['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Wilms Tumor/genetics']",2004/02/14 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2004/02/14 05:00'],"['2004/02/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1046/j.0902-4441.2003.00185.x [doi]', 'EJH185 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Jan;72(1):45-51. doi: 10.1046/j.0902-4441.2003.00185.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that pretransplant DC1 and DC2 were lower in leukemic patients than in healthy subjects (P = 0.003 and P = 0.004, respectively) and that the number of DC2 (but not DC1) infused with the graft was higher in patients receiving peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) (P = 0.03). Patients recovered to the pretransplant DC1 and DC2 levels within day +60; however, a normal DC1 number was reached on day +365, while DC2 remained lower than in controls up to 1 yr after transplant. DC1 reconstitution did not differ significantly between patients receiving bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) or PBSC, while patients receiving PBSC presented increased levels of DC2 on day +30 (P = 0.008) and +100 (P = 0.047) and a higher number of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells until day +365. The occurrence of graft vs. host disease (GVHD) was not influenced in our cases by DC1/DC2 graft composition, but patients with acute GVHD when compared with patients without acute GVHD presented a significantly less rapid DC recovery (DC1 P = 0.03, DC2 P = 0.009 on day +30, and DC1 P = 0.012, DC2 P = 0.006 on day +100). At the moment of relapse, a decrease of DC1/DC2 numbers was observed in four patients and the presence of two different DC populations one with a normal karyotype, and the other with the same cytogenetic abnormality as the malignant clone was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. In conclusion, these observations suggest that in allogeneic HSCT recipients, DC recovery is a slow process possibly contributing to the high risk of infections in the post-transplant period and is possibly influenced by the source of HSC, the occurrence of GVHD and relapse. Further studies are warranted to investigate the significance of DC reconstitution in the transplant setting.","['Porta, Matteo Della', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Alessandrino, Emilio Paolo', 'Maiocchi, Mariangela', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Vanelli, Laura', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Rumi, Elisa', 'Ciccone, Maria', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Lazzarino, Mario', 'Castoldi, Gianluigi']","['Porta MD', 'Rigolin GM', 'Alessandrino EP', 'Maiocchi M', 'Malcovati L', 'Vanelli L', 'Barate C', 'Rumi E', 'Ciccone M', 'Cuneo A', 'Lazzarino M', 'Castoldi G']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Italy. sse@dns.unife.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2004/02/14 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2004/02/14 05:00'],"['2004/02/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1046/j.0902-4441.2004.00172.x [doi]', 'EJH172 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Jan;72(1):18-25. doi: 10.1046/j.0902-4441.2004.00172.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is evidence to suggest, that those receptors (R) could play a role in leukemia with respect to cell differentiations and its regulation, prognosis, and pathobiology. Knowledge of individual cytokine receptor (CKR) profiles could provide new discoveries about CKR-supported therapeutic considerations. METHODS: We have studied the expression of CKR on mononuclear bone marrow (BM) cells of 89 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at first diagnosis, three patients at relapse or with persisting AML and eight healthy probands by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis using directly fluorescein-conjugated antibodies: CD114 (hG-CSF-R), CD116 (hGM-CSF-R), CD117 (hSCF-R), CD123 (hIL-3-R), CD130 (gp130subunit), CD135 (hFL-R). A case was defined as positive, if more than 20% of the cells expressed the regarding CKR. RESULTS: All investigated CKR were more frequently expressed in AML-samples than in healthy BM-samples, except CD130, which was only expressed on 5-6% of AML-blasts in all and with only one healthy BM-sample being CD130(+). Within the French-American-British (FAB) types we observed a maturation- and lineage (granulocytic/monocytic)-committed expression profile. Monocytic subtypes (FAB-type M4/M5) showed significantly more GM-CSF-R(+) (P = 0.001) and FL-R(+) (P = 0.001) and significantly less stem cell factor-R (SCF-R(+)) (P = 0.02) cases. Highest proportions of G-CSF-R(+) blasts were observed in FAB-type M3. In undifferentiated leukemias (FAB-type M1, M2) high amounts of SCF-R(+), IL-3-R(+), and FL-R(+) blasts could be detected. FL-R was the only CKR, which was positive in FAB-type M0 (n = 2). No differences in CKR-expression were detected between primary (p) and secondary (s). Separating our patient cohorts in cytogenetic risk groups we could detect a significant higher proportion of G-CSF-R(+) blasts in the cytogenetic good risk group than in the bad risk group (P = 0.027), but G-CSF-R-expression did not correlate with remission-rate or relapse-free survival probability of the patients. For clinical evaluation only patients treated by the AML-CG-protocol, were included (n = 53). There were no differences of CKR-expression in the responder and non-responder group, however, significant lower relapse-free survival probabilities for patients with more than 85.5% FL-R(+) (P = 0.001) and more than 45.5% SCF-R(+) blasts were found (P = 0.02). Patients with more than 32.5% IL-3-R(+) cells also showed a tendency to a lower relapse-free survival probability (P = 0.26), whereas patients with more than 33% GM-CSF-R(+) (P = 0.06) and patients with more than 52% G-CSF-R(+) (P = 0.175) blasts tended to have a higher relapse-free survival probability. CONCLUSION: We can conclude, that CKR-expression in AML is maturation- and lineage-committed and the proportions of especially early acting CKR have influence on relapse-free survival probability of AML-patients, independently of the karyotype. With respect to the individual CKR status the benefit of cytokines as priming agents, as agents to treat neutropenia or to influence the metabolism of chemotherapy can be discussed under new points of view.","['Graf, Michaela', 'Hecht, Karin', 'Reif, Susanne', 'Pelka-Fleischer, Renate', 'Pfister, Karin', 'Schmetzer, Helga']","['Graf M', 'Hecht K', 'Reif S', 'Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Pfister K', 'Schmetzer H']","['Medical Department III, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/*blood', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",2004/02/14 05:00,2004/03/17 05:00,['2004/02/14 05:00'],"['2004/02/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1046/j.0902-4441.2003.00184.x [doi]', 'EJH184 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Feb;72(2):89-106. doi: 10.1046/j.0902-4441.2003.00184.x.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through recombination-activating gene (RAG)-mediated recombination between a cryptic recombination signal sequence (RSS) present in almost all VH genes and the flanking 23 base pair RSS of an upstream VH gene, VH replacement renews the entire VH-coding region, while leaving behind a short stretch of nucleotides as a VH replacement footprint. In addition to extending the CDR3 region, the VH replacement footprints preferentially contribute charged amino acids. VH replacement rearrangement in immature B cells may either eliminate a self-reactive B-cell receptor or contribute to the generation of self-reactive antibodies. VH replacement may also rescue non-productive or dysfunctional VHDJH rearrangement in pro-B and pre-B cells. Conversely, VH replacement of a productive immunoglobulin H gene may generate non-productive VH replacement to disrupt or temporarily reverse the B-cell differentiation process.

Melatonin has been shown to prevent paralysis and death in mice infected with the encephalomyocarditis virus and to decrease viremia. Melatonin also postpones the onset of the disease produced by Semliki Forest virus inoculation and reduces the mortality of West Nile virus-infected mice stressed by either isolation or dexamethasone injection. An increase in the host resistance to the virus via a peripheral immunostimulatory activity is considered responsible for these effects. It has also been demonstrated that melatonin protects some strains of mink against Aleutian disease, and prevents the reduction of B- and T-cells as well as Th1 cytokine secretion in mice infected with leukemia retrovirus. In VEE-infected mice, melatonin postpones the onset of the disease and death for several days and reduces the mortality rate. This protective effect seems to be due to the increase in the production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), as 100% of the infected mice treated with melatonin die when IL-1beta is blocked with antimurine IL-1beta antibodies. Although melatonin administration raises serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the mortality observed in neutralization experiments with the corresponding anticytokine antibodies, suggests that neither TNF-alpha nor IFN-gamma are essential for the protective effect of melatonin on murine VEE virus infection. Melatonin treatment also enhances the efficiency of immunization against the VEE virus. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the dissemination of this virus, and their deleterious effects may be diminished by melatonin. This indole inhibits nitric oxide synthetase activity and it is a potent scavenger of nitric oxide, which also plays an important role in the spread of the VEE virus. In conclusion, the immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects of melatonin suggest that this indole must be considered as an additional therapeutic alternative to fight viral diseases.","['Bonilla, Ernesto', 'Valero, Nereida', 'Chacin-Bonilla, Leonor', 'Medina-Leendertz, Shirley']","['Bonilla E', 'Valero N', 'Chacin-Bonilla L', 'Medina-Leendertz S']","[""Instituto de Investigaciones Clinicas 'Dr. Americo Negrette', Facultad de Medicina, Universidad del Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela. ebonillaro@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']","['Animals', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Encephalitis Virus, Venezuelan Equine/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lighting', 'Melatonin/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Virus Diseases/immunology/*metabolism']",2004/02/14 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/02/14 05:00'],"['2004/02/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/02/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['105 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1600-079x.2003.00105.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2004 Mar;36(2):73-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1600-079x.2003.00105.x.,IM,,PMC7166828,,,,,,89,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aggregation of breast cancer occurs also in families diagnosed for cancer at sites different from the breast. Therefore, the familial association of histology specific breast cancers with cancers at other sites is of great interest. The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to calculate standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for breast cancer when parents or sibling were diagnosed with cancer at the most common sites. Significant SIRs were found when parents had breast, ovarian, laryngeal, endometrial, prostate, lung and colon cancers. If women were diagnosed before the age of 50 years, the SIRs were significant when parents were diagnosed with breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers, and leukaemia, and when siblings were diagnosed with squamous cell skin, pancreatic, breast and endometrial cancers. If mothers were diagnosed with breast cancer, histology-specific SIRs were ranked as comedo > tubular > ductal > lobular; SIR for medullary carcinoma was not significant but it was high when mothers presented with ovarian cancer. Other associations were between the upper aerodigestive tract and lobular, colon and comedo, larynx and ductal cancer. Moreover, cervical cancer was associated with comedo and endometrial cancer with the medullary histology. In conclusion, histology-specific breast cancers were associated with specific cancer sites and the strength of the association varied among histologies.","['Lorenzo Bermejo, Justo', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Lorenzo Bermejo J', 'Hemminki K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,"['Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Histology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11713 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Apr 10;109(3):430-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11713.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

CD1d is a restriction element structurally related to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and capable of presenting lipid antigens to CD1d-restricted T cells (also defined as natural killer-T [NKT] cells). The synthetic lipid alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) has been characterized as a potent stimulator of CD1d-restricted T cells. We have investigated the expression of CD1d on B-CLL cells. CD1d was detected by flow cytometric analyses on leukemic cells of all B-CLL cases studied (n = 38) and was expressed at higher density on cells carrying unmutated immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes. In addition, CD1d on B-CLL cells mediated the presentation of alpha-GalCer to CD1d-restricted T cells, which in turn induced B-CLL cell death. At variance with another study (Metelitsa et al., Leukemia 2003;17:1068-77), no correlation between expression levels of CD1d and susceptibility to NKT cell lysis was observed. Proliferation and production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by CD1d-restricted T cells, in the presence of B-CLL cells loaded with alpha-GalCer, were also observed. Our study demonstrates that B-CLL cells express a monomorphic restriction element that is functionally capable of antigen presentation and can be useful to design novel B-CLL immunotherapies.","['Fais, Franco', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Stelitano, Caterina', 'Callea, Vincenzo', 'Zanardi, Sabrina', 'Scudeletti, Marco', 'Varese, Paola', 'Ciccone, Ermanno', 'Grossi, Carlo Enrico']","['Fais F', 'Morabito F', 'Stelitano C', 'Callea V', 'Zanardi S', 'Scudeletti M', 'Varese P', 'Ciccone E', 'Grossi CE']","['Human Anatomy Section, Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, Genova, Italy. franco.fais@unige.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Galactosylceramides)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD1/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cohort Studies', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Galactosylceramides/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11723 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Apr 10;109(3):402-11. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11723.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

However, there is little direct evidence from patient material that this is so. Here we show that full-length PKR is present but not active in 21 of 28 patient samples from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). PKR from these patients was unable to auto-activate or phosphorylate substrates but was able to bind dsRNA. Furthermore, the lack of PKR activation was not due to differing levels of the PKR activator, PACT nor of the PKR inhibitor, p58(IPK). We compared PKR status with clinical parameters and disease staging. No differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of staging (modified Rai or Binet), age, CD38 status, p53 status, 11q23 deletion status or CEP12 deletion status. However, there was a significant correlation between deletion in 13q14.3 and lack of PKR activity. We show that B-CLL cells appear to contain a soluble inhibitor of PKR, as lysates from cells lacking PKR activity were able to inhibit exogenous PKR in mixing experiments. Finally, we show suppression of PKR activity was still present following ultrafilitration through a 10,000 Da cutoff filter but was lost upon extraction with phenol/chloroform or by high salt washing. This data suggests loss of PKR activity may contribute to the formation and/or maintenance of CLL.","['Hii, Su Ing', 'Hardy, Lani', 'Crough, Tania', 'Payne, Elizabeth J', 'Grimmett, Karen', 'Gill, Devinder', 'McMillan, Nigel A J']","['Hii SI', 'Hardy L', 'Crough T', 'Payne EJ', 'Grimmett K', 'Gill D', 'McMillan NA']","['Cancer Biology Programme, Centre for Immunology and Cancer Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNAJC3 protein, human)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (PRKRA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']","['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly I-C', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'eIF-2 Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11714 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Apr 10;109(3):329-35. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11714.,IM,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

However, low frequency or limited diversity of these markers restricts the number of evaluable patients, particularly because two markers are recommended for MRD monitoring. Hence, we developed a new strategy implementing the TCR beta (TCRB) locus for MRD quantification. The frequency and characteristics of complete and incomplete TCRB rearrangements were investigated in 53 childhood and 100 adult T-ALL patients using the BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR assay. Clonal rearrangements were identified in 92% both childhood and adult T-ALL (Vbeta-Dbeta-Jbeta rearrangements in 80%, Dbeta-Jbeta rearrangements in 53%). Comparative sequence analysis of 203 TCRB recombinations revealed preferential usage of the 'end-stage' segment Jbeta2.7 in childhood T-ALL (27%), whereas Jbeta2.3 was most frequently involved in adult T-ALL (24%). In complete rearrangements, three downstream Vbeta segments (19-1/20-1/21-1) were preferentially used. Subsequently, a TCRB real-time quantitative PCR assay to quantify MRD with 13 germline Jbeta primer/probe combinations and allele-specific oligonucleotides was developed and applied to 60 clonal TCRB rearrangements.

In this study, we evaluated the role of Notch4 in immature hematopoietic progenitors by inducing, with retroviral transduction, enforced expression of Int-3, the oncogenic and constitutively active form of mouse Notch4. Int-3-transduced human myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells demonstrated significantly delayed expression of differentiation markers following retinoic acid and 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate treatment. Furthermore, HL-60 cells expressing Int-3 displayed a slower growth rate than cells infected with void virus, and accumulation in the G0/G1 phases of cell cycle. Transduction with deletion mutants of Int-3 defined the importance of individual domains of the protein (in particular, the ANK domain and the C-terminal domain) in the inhibition of differentiation and growth arrest of HL-60 cells. When mouse bone marrow enriched for stem cells (5-fluorouracil-resistant, lineage negative) was transduced and cultured for two weeks, the Int-3-transduced population displayed a lower expression of differentiation markers and a three- to five-fold higher frequency of colony-forming cells (CFU-GM/BFU-E) than control cultures. These results strongly support the notion that Notch signaling inhibits differentiation and promotes expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.","['Ye, Q', 'Shieh, J-H', 'Morrone, G', 'Moore, M A S']","['Ye Q', 'Shieh JH', 'Morrone G', 'Moore MA']","['James Ewing Laboratory of Developmental Hematopoiesis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (NOTCH4 protein, human)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch4)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloid Cells', '*Myelopoiesis', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptor, Notch4', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403291 [doi]', '2403291 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):777-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403291.,IM,,,,,"['HL61401/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA59350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we identify 120 genes whose expression patterns differed between reactive lymph node tissue and three types of SBCL: follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Whereas previously published studies have generally analyzed the gene expression profiles of one type of SBCL, work presented in this paper was intended to identify genes that are differentially expressed between three SBCL subtypes. This analysis was performed using mRNA pooled from multiple specimens representing each tissue type. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the differential expression of 23 of these genes. Among the 23 validated genes were cyclin D1 (CCND1) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2, which have well-known roles in lymphoma pathogenesis. The remaining 21 genes have no currently established role in lymphoma development. Using qRT-PCR, the expression of CCND1 and seven additional genes was further studied in a panel of individual specimens. Genes identified in this study are of biological interest and represent candidate diagnostic markers.","['Schmechel, S C', 'LeVasseur, R J', 'Yang, K H-J', 'Koehler, K M', 'Kussick, S J', 'Sabath, D E']","['Schmechel SC', 'LeVasseur RJ', 'Yang KH', 'Koehler KM', 'Kussick SJ', 'Sabath DE']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']","['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pseudolymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403293 [doi]', '2403293 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):841-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403293.,IM,,,,,['5T32HL007312-25/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the antileukemic activity mediated by a novel receptor ('anti-CD19-BB-zeta') containing the signaling domain of 4-1BB (CD137; a crucial molecule for T-cell antitumor activity) to that of a receptor lacking costimulatory molecules. Retroviral transduction produced efficient and durable receptor expression in human T cells. Lymphocytes expressing anti-CD19-BB-zeta receptors exerted powerful and specific cytotoxicity against ALL cells, which was superior to that of lymphocytes with receptors lacking 4-1BB. Anti-CD19-BB-zeta lymphocytes were remarkably effective in cocultures with bone marrow mesenchymal cells, and against leukemic cells from patients with drug-resistant ALL: as few as 1% anti-CD19-BB-zeta-transduced T cells eliminated most ALL cells within 5 days. These cells also expanded and produced interleukin-2 in response to ALL cells at much higher rates than those of lymphocytes expressing equivalent receptors lacking 4-1BB. We conclude that anti-CD19 chimeric receptors containing 4-1BB are a powerful new tool for T-cell therapy of B-lineage ALL and other CD19+ B-lymphoid malignancies.","['Imai, C', 'Mihara, K', 'Andreansky, M', 'Nicholson, I C', 'Pui, C-H', 'Geiger, T L', 'Campana, D']","['Imai C', 'Mihara K', 'Andreansky M', 'Nicholson IC', 'Pui CH', 'Geiger TL', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD3 antigen, zeta chain)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNFRSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']","['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'CD3 Complex/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'CD8 Antigens/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/genetics/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/pharmacology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403302 [doi]', '2403302 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):676-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403302.,IM,,,,,"['R01 AI056153/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We postulated that this marker could be used to assess minimal residual disease (MRD) in T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In diagnostic bone marrow (BM) samples from 27 children with T-ALL, expression of CD99 on leukemic lymphoblasts by flow cytometry was in median 7.7 times higher than on normal T lymphocytes from within the same sample. In 85% of cases, leukemic MFI values were higher than the mean MFI+2 s.d. of normal populations. We applied CD99 to study MRD in 39 follow-up samples from 15 consecutive T-ALL patients, and compared the results with those obtained with the well-established MRD-marker terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Either antibody was combined in four-color flow cytometry with CD7, surfaceCD3, and cytoplasmicCD3. We found that CD99 was a valid complement to TdT in quantifying T-ALL MRD. Given a considerable interpatient variability, CD99 could be favorably used in nine patients, and TdT in other five patients. Both approaches showed a similar very low nonspecific background throughout 12 weeks from diagnosis (in median 0.002% of nucleated BM cells in patients with non-T ALL). We conclude that CD99 is a highly informative tool for MRD detection in T-ALL, bearing the advantage of surface expression in contrast to TdT.","['Dworzak, M N', 'Froschl, G', 'Printz, D', 'Zen, L De', 'Gaipa, G', 'Ratei, R', 'Basso, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Ludwig, W-D', 'Gadner, H']","['Dworzak MN', 'Froschl G', 'Printz D', 'Zen LD', 'Gaipa G', 'Ratei R', 'Basso G', 'Biondi A', 'Ludwig WD', 'Gadner H']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria. dworzak@ccri.univie.ac.at""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']","['12E7 Antigen', 'Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403303 [doi]', '2403303 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):703-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403303.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the distribution of IgVH and BCL-6 gene mutations in 95 well-characterized patients with Binet stage A B-CLL, and correlated them with clinical, laboratory, cytogenetic findings and disease progression. Mutations of the BCL-6 gene were observed only in cases harboring mutated IgVH. Unexpectedly, coexistence of IgVH and BCL-6 mutations was correlated with shorter treatment-free interval (TFI) compared to cases harboring only IgVH mutation (median, 55 months vs not reached; P=0.01), resembling the clinical course of unmutated IgVH cases (median TFI, 44 months).

Although alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is a critical determinant of a cell's protein repertoire, it has not been associated with CML pathogenesis. We identified a BCR/ABL-dependent increase in expression of multiple genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing (eg SRPK1, RNA Helicase II/Gu, and hnRNPA2/B1) by subtractive hybridization of cDNA from p210BCR/ABL-eGFP vs eGFP-transduced umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells. beta1-integrin signaling is important to HSC maintenance and proliferation/differentiation, and is abnormal in CML. As an example of how changes in pre-mRNA processing might contribute to CML pathogenesis, we observed alternative splicing of a gene for a beta1-integrin-responsive nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (PYK2), resulting in increased expression of full-length Pyk2 in BCR/ABL-containing cells. Treatment of p210BCR/ABL-positive cells with the Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 reverted PYK2 splicing to a configuration more consistent with normal cells, and correlated with decreased expression of BCR/ABL-induced proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. Whether altered PYK2 splicing contributes to CML pathogenesis remains undetermined; however, we propose that generic changes in pre-mRNA splicing as a result of p210BCR/ABL kinase activity may contribute to CML pathogenesis.","['Salesse, S', 'Dylla, S J', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Salesse S', 'Dylla SJ', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Stem Cell Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Antigens, CD34', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 2', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'RNA Precursors/genetics', '*RNA Splicing']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403310 [doi]', '2403310 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):727-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403310.,IM,,,,,"['CA09138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK-53673/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-49930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 1995, dozens of proteins have been discovered to possess intrinsic lysine acetyltransferase activity. Although most of these enzymes were first identified as histone acetyltransferases and then tested for activities towards other proteins, acetyltransferases only modifying non-histone proteins have also been identified. Lysine acetyltransferases form different groups, three of which are Gcn5/PCAF, p300/CBP and MYST proteins. While members of the former two groups mainly function as transcriptional co-activators, emerging evidence suggests that MYST proteins, such as Esa1, Sas2, MOF, TIP60, MOZ and MORF, have diverse roles in various nuclear processes. Aberrant lysine acetylation has been implicated in oncogenesis. The genes for p300, CBP, MOZ and MORF are rearranged in recurrent leukemia-associated chromosomal abnormalities. Consistent with their roles in leukemogenesis, these acetyltransferases interact with Runx1 (or AML1), one of the most frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in leukemia. Therefore, the diverse superfamily of lysine acetyltransferases executes an acetylation program that is important for different cellular processes and perturbation of such a program may cause the development of cancer and other diseases.","['Yang, Xiang-Jiao']",['Yang XJ'],"['Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1A1, Canada. yangxj@molonc.mcgill.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']","['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/chemistry/*classification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/05/13 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/nar/gkh252 [doi]', '32/3/959 [pii]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Feb 11;32(3):959-76. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkh252.

It has the potential to be developed as a unique chemotherapeutic agent that may provide dual therapeutic benefits against cancer, e.g., enhancing tumor cell death while protecting normal tissues from damage. However, D609 contains a dithiocarbonate (xanthate) group [O-C(=S)S(-)/O-C(=S)SH], which is chemically unstable, being readily oxidized to form a disulfide bond with subsequent loss of all biological activities. Therefore, we developed the synthesis of a series of S-(alkoxyacyl) D609 prodrugs by connecting the xanthate group of D609 to an ester via a self-immolative methyleneoxyl group. These S-(alkoxylacyl)-D609 prodrugs are designed to release D609 in two steps: esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the acyl ester bond followed by conversion of the resulting hydroxymethyl D609 to formaldehyde and D609. Three S-(alkoxyacyl) D609 prodrugs were synthesized by varying the steric bulkiness of the acyl group. These prodrugs are stable to ambient conditions, but readily hydrolyzed by esterases to liberate D609 in a controlled manner. More importantly, the lead prodrug methyleneoxybutyryl D609 is biologically more effective than D609 in inhibiting sphingomyelin synthase, thereby increasing the level of ceramide and inducing apoptosis in U937 leukemia cells. The prodrug has a significantly lower LD(50) value than that of D609 (56.6 versus 117 microM) against U937 cells. These findings demonstrate that prodrug modification of the xanthate moiety with an alkoxyacyl group can improve D609 oxidative stability and enhance its antitumor activity.","['Bai, Aiping', 'Meier, G Patrick', 'Wang, Yong', 'Luberto, Chiara', 'Hannun, Yusuf A', 'Zhou, Daohong']","['Bai A', 'Meier GP', 'Wang Y', 'Luberto C', 'Hannun YA', 'Zhou D']","['Department of Pathology, Medical University of South Carolina, 165 Ashley Ave., Suite 309, P.O.

The inhibition activity of 8-CA (8-chloroadenosine, a new anti-tumor drug synthesized in our lab) in sarcoma 180, hepatocarcinoma 22, and human gastric carcinoma xenograft tumor has been confirmed. However,the relationship between the mechanism of the inhibition and proteasome is still unclear. The present study was designed to explore the effect of 8-CA on 3 kinds of enzyme activities (chymotrypsin-like activity, trypsin-like activity, and peptidyl-glutamyl- peptide hydrolyzing activity) of 20S proteasome in human progranulocyte leukemia HL-60 cells. METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated with 8-CA at different concentrations for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Then total protein of HL-60 cells was extracted, and the three enzyme activities of 20S proteasomes in the total protein was examined. And the chymotrypsin-like activity of the purified proteasome from the total protein was also examined by immunoprecipitation. The enzyme activity was indicated by fluorescence absorbance (A) produced by degradation of specific substrates by proteasomes. RESULTS: In HL-60 cells, three enzyme activities of the proteasomes were significantly inhibited after exposure to 0.1 micromol/L 8-CA for 48 hours; and the inhibition effect was concentration dependent. When the concentration of 8-CA reached 5 micromol/L, the inhibition rates of three proteasome activities (chymotrypsin-like activity,trypsin-like activity,and peptidyl- glutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing activity) were 44.96%, 54.52%, 48.36% for 48 hours and 67.53%, 70.48%, 64.08% for 72 hours, respectively. The inhibition rate of 1 micromol/L and 5 micromol/L 8-CA on chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity of HL-60 cells for 48 hours were 68.14% (P< 0.01) and 92.75% (P< 0.001), respectively.

This study was designed to investigate gene expression differences among lung cancer tissues, lung paracancerous tissues,matched peripheral normal lung tissues and the metastases of lymph nodes, and to seek the relatively high expressed genes in lung carcinoma tissues, providing possible theoretical basis for early diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary carcinoma. METHODS: Fresh lung cancer tissue, lung paracancerous tissue, matched normal lung tissue and metastases of lymph nodes were deep-frozen in liquid nitrogen; their total RNA were extracted for reversed transcription cDNA probes, which were labeled and subsequently used to hybridize with cDNA microarray with 588 genes. Different gene expression profiles were obtained by analyzing the integrated density (ID) of spot images on the X-ray. RESULTS: In lung cancer tissues, 40 genes were detected to be differentially expressed, 36 of which such as early growth response protein 1 (EGR1), secreted apoptosis related protein 1 (SARP1) were upregulated while the others such as myeloid cell leukemia protein 1 (MCL1) were downregulated. The upregulated genes were mainly oncogene/suppressor gene, cell cycle regulatory gene, growth factors and apoptosis-related genes. In lung paracancerous tissues, 33 genes had different expression, 20 of which such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were upregulated, and the other 13 such as MCL1,endothelin 2 (ET2) were downregulated. In metastases of lymph nodes, there were 21 genes found to be differently expressed, 15 of which such as CD40 receptor-associated factor 1 (CRAF1) were downregulated while the rest were upregulated, and the upregulated genes (6 in 15) were mainly the genes associated with adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases and collagen.

Previous studies suggested that the mechanism of treating premyeloid leukemia with ATRA is inducing premyeloid leukemia cells to differentiate along myelocyte lineage, but the fate of differentiated tumor cells is not clear. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between the differentiation of HL-60 induced by ATRA and apoptosis. METHODS: HL-60 cells influenced by ATRA (10 micromol/L) capable of inducing differentiation for different time were used as the subject. The differentiation marker on the cell surface and cell cycle were analyzed using flow cytometry. The differentiated cells were identified by confocal microscope after having been stained with propidium iodide (PI). Meanwhile,the changes of the apoptosis of the cells induced by ATRA at different time were analyzed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: (1)With drug-inducing time increasing, the volume of the differentiated cells was enlarged gradually. After 72 hours, the differentiated cells began to express differentiating marker CD11b and the nuclei morphology of the differentiated cells was changed. (2)After 96 hours of drug-inducing, the induced cells began to show apoptosis peak, but when the cells was washed once after 72 hours of drug-inducing with RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and then cultured in 5%CO2, 37 centigrade for 8 hours,the cells began to show apoptosis peak,and the apoptosis peak was higher than that of the cells after 96 hours of drug-inducing.

Subsequently, he presented with a 6-month history of weight loss and fatigue, and 6 weeks of fever, a progressively enlarged liver and elevated serum LDH level. An inguinal lymph node biopsy revealed both classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosing type grade 2 and CLL. A bone marrow biopsy showed no Reed-Steinberg cells and an infiltrate composed of only scattered small lymphocytes consistent with CLL. Immuno-histochemical studies of the lymph node were consistent with both CLL and HL phenotypes. A cytogenic examination of the bone marrow revealed an abnormal karyotype (Y-) in 15% of the cell population. Treatment with MOPP/ABVD was started and fever subsided within 3 days. Our case is one of the very few descriptions of a rare Richter's variant of CLL with progression to HL in a CLL patient treated with fludarabine. Since fludarabine has become standard therapy in CLL such Richter's variant could be the result of therapy, an induced prolonged and severe immunosuppression.

In two ATRA-treated APL patients, bone marrow showed the striking phagocytosis of differentiated APL cells by histiocytes just before the achievement of complete remission. Histiocytes phagocytosed APL cells at the terminal stage of differentiation prior to the late apoptotic event of cell lysis. Engulfed APL cells then undergo morphological features of late apoptosis and finally fragmentation in the cytoplasm of histiocytes.

Inactivation of Ras may be achieved with farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitors a class of drugs which have shown promise in clinical trials particularly in patients with acute leukemia. This report investigates the efficacy of two distinct classes of FTase inhibitors in diverse myeloma cell lines and primary isolates. While Ras signaling has traditionally been linked to myeloma cell growth, we found that these compounds also potently triggered cell death. Death induced by perillic acid (PA) was caspase dependent without evidence of death receptor activation. Apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization and activation of caspase-9 and 3 but proceeded despite over-expression of Bcl-XL a known correlate of relapsed and chemorefractory myeloma. In addition, Fas ligand and TRAIL mediated apoptosis was potentiated in death receptor resistant (U266) and sensitive (RPMI 8226/S) cell lines. Of clinical relevance, the FTase inhibitor R115777 induced cell death in myeloma lines at doses observed in clinical trials. Furthermore, both R115777 and PA induced cell death in primary isolates with relative specificity. Taken together these preclinical data provide evidence that FTase inhibitors may be an effective therapeutic modality for the treatment of multiple myeloma.","['Beaupre, Darrin M', 'McCafferty-Grad, Jennifer', 'Bahlis, Nizar J', 'Boise, Lawrence H', 'Lichtenheld, Mathias G']","['Beaupre DM', 'McCafferty-Grad J', 'Bahlis NJ', 'Boise LH', 'Lichtenheld MG']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Sylvester Cancer Center, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclohexenes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '7694-45-3 (perillic acid)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']","['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclohexenes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Monoterpenes/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819031000116652 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Dec;44(12):2123-34. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000116652.,IM,,,,,"['K12 CA77824-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA55811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to investigate the immunological effects of interferon-alpha in CML patients. Markers of cellular activation and apoptosis, natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and production of intracellular cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-4) were determined by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 26 CML-CP patients before and 3, 6 and 9 months after IFN-alpha treatment. The results were correlated with the hematological response. In the whole group of patients, INF-alpha use was followed by a significant increase of lymphocytes producing IL-2 and IFN-gamma, an increase in NK activity and a decrease in the number of CD34+ cells. Out of 26 CML patients, 15 achieved hematological remission and 7 achieved partial cytogenetic remission after 9 months of IFN-alpha treatment. There was an increase in the percentage of CD8/FasL+, DR/CD3+, DQ/CD3+, CD34/Fas+, DR/CD56+, CD56/FasL+ cells and of IFN-gamma- and IL-2-producing lymphocytes and an increase in NK cytotoxicity only in the group of patients who achieved complete hematological remission. Our results indicate that IFN-alpha use in CML-CP reduces the number of CD34+ cells, activates T cells, enhances stem cell apoptotic markers and increases the production of intracellular IFN-gamma and IL-2 by lymphocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that the therapeutic effect of IFN-alpha in CML-CP is mediated at least in part by immunological mechanisms.","['de Castro, Fabiola Attie', 'Palma, Patricia Vianna Bonini', 'Morais, Fabiana Rossetto', 'Simoes, Belinda Pinto', 'Carvalho, Paulo Villas-Boas', 'Ismael, Sebastiao Jose', 'Lima, Carmen Passos', 'Voltarelli, Julio Cesar']","['de Castro FA', 'Palma PV', 'Morais FR', 'Simoes BP', 'Carvalho PV', 'Ismael SJ', 'Lima CP', 'Voltarelli JC']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Interleukin-2/blood', 'Interleukin-4/blood', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/immunology', 'Time Factors']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819031000110973 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Dec;44(12):2061-7. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000110973.,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on clinical risk criteria and modern laboratory investigations including immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and molecular genetics, patients can be divided into prognostic groups and assigned to risk-adjusted treatment protocols. The karyotype is an independent prognostic indicator and has for some aberrations that are associated with a poor outcome a direct impact on the choice of treatment. Cytogenetic analysis in ALL is often hampered by poor chromosome morphology, few malignant metaphases, undetectable chromosomal rearrangements due to regions of a similar size and banding pattern and sometimes only normal metaphases derived from normal cells are found after cell culture. Structural as well as numerical aberrations may therefore remain undetected using conventional G-banding. The application of modern molecular cytogenetic techniques including a broad set of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) methods and recent developments in comparative genomic hybridisation to DNA microarrays, together with molecular methods such as Southern blotting and RT-PCR has greatly improved the detection rate of genetic changes in ALL. This review emphasises the value of increasing the resolving power of the cytogenetic investigation by spectral karyotyping (SKY) and interphase FISH in identifying prognostically important and novel chromosomal rearrangements as a complement to conventional banding analysis. The results of investigations performed on cases with ALL have shown that interphase FISH is valuable and in many cases even mandatory for the detection of prognostically important genetic abnormalities and should therefore consistently be employed in the routine cytogenetic investigations in ALL. Likewise, SKY is a valuable tool for the cytogenetic analysis. Thus, the results of several different investigations described in this review revealed that SKY yielded additional information in 97/157 (62%) cases with chromosomal aberrations detected by G-banding, and in 10/66 (15%) cases with normal G-banding.","['Nordgren, Ann']",['Nordgren A'],"['Department of Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, L8-02, Karolinska Hospital SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. ann.nordgren@cmm.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819031000083361 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Dec;44(12):2039-53. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000083361.,IM,,,,,,,,129,,,,,,,,,,,,

APL cells are notable for differentiation block and resistance to apoptosis. While increasing evidence suggests that N-RARalpha fusion proteins interfere with normal RARalpha transcription function at retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) resulting in inhibition of normal myeloid differentiation, the mechanism for apoptosis resistance remains unexplained. Recently, we and others have reported that APL-fusion proteins can augment STAT3 transcriptional activity. Constitutive STAT3 activation has been observed in a number of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic malignancies where it contributes to apoptosis resistance. In this review, we summarize a series of recent observations concerning cross talk between the retinoic acid and STAT3 signaling pathways in APL cells. These findings support the hypothesis that apoptosis resistance in APL may be mediated through the effects of APL fusion proteins on STAT3 signaling and suggest that targeting of STAT3 may be a useful adjunctive treatment strategy in APL.","['Dong, Shuo', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Tweardy, David J']","['Dong S', 'Chen SJ', 'Tweardy DJ']","['Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*embryology', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/02/13 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/02/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819031000116670 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Dec;44(12):2023-9. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000116670.,IM,,,,,['CA86430/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,
