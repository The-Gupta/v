The increase seems to be related to the longer survival rates made possible by more intensive treatment protocols. The predictive elements appear to be the tumour mass, cytomorphological variety M5, splenomegaly and serum LDH. Prophylaxis with craniospinal radiotherapy or spinal chemotherapy does not modify the course of the leukaemia or diminish the frequency of neuromeningeal complications. Six cases of AML involving the central nervous system were examined, two at onset and 4 at first relapse. Neuromeningeal complications are to be feared since they are extremely difficult to eradicate completely and the prognosis is extremely unfavourable especially if a bone marrow relapse occurs simultaneously.","['Pagano, L', 'Marra, R', 'De Stefano, V', 'Di Donfrancesco, A', 'Leone, G']","['Pagano L', 'Marra R', 'De Stefano V', 'Di Donfrancesco A', 'Leone G']",['ita'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Le complicanze neurologiche in corso di leucemia mieloide acuta nell'adulto.,Italy,Minerva Med,Minerva medica,0400732,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Cranial Nerve Diseases/etiology', 'Female', 'Headache/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Middle Aged', 'Paralysis/etiology', 'Paraplegia/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Skull/radiation effects', 'Spine/radiation effects']",1986/01/14 00:00,1986/01/14 00:01,['1986/01/14 00:00'],"['1986/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Minerva Med. 1986 Jan 14;77(1-2):13-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of a relation between concentration and effect.,471-7,"High-dose methotrexate (500 to 33,600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) with leucovorin rescue is a common component of therapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia. To increase understanding of the relation between the serum concentration and the effect of methotrexate, we conducted a randomized, prospective study of 108 children with ""standard-risk"" acute lymphocytic leukemia who were treated with 15 doses of methotrexate (1000 mg per square meter) that were infused over 24 hours. The median length of follow-up was 3.5 years from diagnosis for patients still in remission. Variability between patients in methotrexate clearance produced steady-state serum concentrations that ranged from 9.3 to 25.4 microM. Patients with median methotrexate concentrations of less than 16 microM (n = 59) had a lower probability of remaining in remission (P less than 0.05) than patients with concentrations of 16 microM or more (n = 49). Multivariate analyses indicated that patients with methotrexate concentrations of less than 16 microM were 3 times more likely to have any kind of relapse during therapy (P = 0.01) and 7 times more likely to have a hematologic relapse during therapy (P = 0.001). Stepwise Cox's regression identified leukemic-cell DNA content, methotrexate concentration, and hemoglobin as significant prognostic variables for hematologic relapse (P = 0.0005). We conclude that there is a concentration-effect relation for high-dose methotrexate in acute lymphocytic leukemia and that 1000 mg per square meter infused over a period of 24 hours may not be optimal for patients with relatively fast drug clearance.","['Evans, W E', 'Crom, W R', 'Abromowitch, M', 'Dodge, R', 'Look, A T', 'Bowman, W P', 'George, S L', 'Pui, C H']","['Evans WE', 'Crom WR', 'Abromowitch M', 'Dodge R', 'Look AT', 'Bowman WP', 'George SL', 'Pui CH']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Recurrence']",1986/02/20 00:00,1986/02/20 00:01,['1986/02/20 00:00'],"['1986/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1986 Feb 20;314(8):471-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198602203140803.,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1056/NEJM198602203140803 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

These neoplasms are clonal or oligoclonal and contain a small number of F-MuLV insertions in high-molecular-weight DNA. To investigate whether different tumors have proviral insertions in the same region, a provirus-cellular DNA junction fragment from an F-MuLV-induced myelogenous leukemia was cloned in lambda gtWES, and a portion of the flanking cellular DNA sequence was used in blot-hybridization studies of 34 additional F-MuLV-induced neoplasms. Three of these additional neoplasms (one myelogenous leukemia and two lymphomas) were found to have altered copies of the flanking cellular sequence. Restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA from these tumors revealed that in each case a proviral copy of F-MuLV had inserted into the same 1.5-kilobase region; all proviruses had the same orientation. Using mouse-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids, we mapped this common integration region, designated Fis-1, to mouse chromosome 7. Fis-1 is distinct from three oncogenes on mouse chromosome 7, Ha-ras, fes, and Int-2, based on restriction enzyme analysis and blot hybridization.

Implications for prostaglandin E resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia.,13-20,"The expression of HLA-DR antigens by normal myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) has been linked to inhibition of colony growth by prostaglandin E (PGE), while resistance to the inhibitory effects of PGE in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been attributed to a lower fraction of HLA-DR+ CFU-GM in this disease. However, we have previously shown that virtually all CFU-GM in normal bone marrow (NBM) as well as CML peripheral blood express HLA-DR antigens, which raises the possibility that these surface molecules may not be the sole determinants of a progenitor cell's sensitivity to PGE. In order to evaluate the relationship between HLA-DR expression and prostaglandin inhibition, we partially purified NBM progenitor cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to prepare cell fractions with high and low HLA-DR antigen density. Normal progenitor cells with high DR density tended to form monocyte colonies in agar culture, whereas the low DR density fraction was enriched for granulocyte colony-forming cells. Inhibition by PGE was greatest in the high DR+ fraction and was largely restricted to monocyte progenitor cells. Inhibition of CFU-GM by PGE was less in CML than in NBM, but this decreased inhibition correlated with a significantly lower number of monocyte-CFU in CML. These data suggest that high HLA-DR antigen density may select for normal progenitor cells that are committed to monocyte differentiation and are, therefore, more likely to be inhibited by PGE. The relative deficit of monocyte progenitor cells in CML may partially explain the phenomenon of PGE resistance in this disease.","['Cannistra, S A', 'Herrmann, F', 'Davis, R', 'Nichols, K', 'Griffin, J D']","['Cannistra SA', 'Herrmann F', 'Davis R', 'Nichols K', 'Griffin JD']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Suspensions)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)']",IM,"['Alprostadil/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Granulocytes/classification/cytology/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/classification/cytology/immunology', 'Suspensions', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 Jan;77(1):13-20. doi: 10.1172/JCI112267.,"['5T32CA09172-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1172/JCI112267 [doi]'],PMC423301,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation was induced with 1/microgram/ml tunicamycin. Undifferentiated cells did not display phagocytic ability, and less than 5% of these cells had Fc receptors. After exposure to tunicamycin for 40 hr, 40% of these differentiated cells had Fc receptors, and 35% showed phagocytic activity after 160 hr. The majority of the LDH activity in the undifferentiated cells was found in fraction 3, and following differentiation almost a 50% reduction in LDH activity was observed in this fraction. In addition, LDH 3 isoenzyme levels were found to be greater in patients containing a high percentage of undifferentiated cells than in patients containing a high percentage of differentiated cells. Differentiated cells displayed LDH isoenzyme fraction pattern, Michaelis constant, and reaction with substrate similar to those found in the normal granulocytes. Differences in the dissociation of LDH into subunits with guanidine hydrochloride were found between undifferentiated and differentiated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Treatment with 0.75 M guanidine hydrochloride caused complete inactivation of LDH derived from normal differentiated cells, whereas similar treatment caused complete inactivation of LDH derived from AML or normal granulocytes. LDH isoenzymes derived from normal granulocytes and differentiated AML cells were also more sensitive to guanidine hydrochloride depression of fluorescence intensity. The sedimentation constant for single peak LDH at 5.5 M guanidine hydrochloride was calculated as 1.65 sec for differentiated and 1.70 sec for undifferentiated cells. The molecular weight of the polypeptide subunits for undifferentiated cells was 30,000 and for differentiated cells was 39,000. The apparent parallel between leukemic cells after induction of differentiation and normal granulocytes indicates that the leukemic cells retain their maturation potential when exposed to an inducer of differentiation.","['Pavelic, K', 'Pekic, B']","['Pavelic K', 'Pekic B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Urea/pharmacology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1986 Feb;126(2):307-11. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041260222.,,['10.1002/jcp.1041260222 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of DNA histograms of treated cells indicated that cells accumulated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle after 8 h of exposure to either inducer, with maximum accumulation occurring by 20 h; this arrest was observed prior to the phenotypic appearance of mature cells. The minimum interval of time necessary to commit cells to a differentiation pathway, which was less than one doubling time (9.2 h), closely paralleled the initial accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

Thus, butyrate blocks the ability of HMBA to accumulate the intracellular signals for terminal cell division. A 48-h pretreatment of cells with butyrate did not inhibit the ability of subsequent HMBA treatment, after butyrate removal, to induce terminal cell division. These results might suggest that cells do not generate a memory of exposure to HMBA in the presence of butyrate or a memory of exposure to butyrate when used as a pretreatment under these conditions.

Successful cytogenetic preparations exhibiting long and well banded chromosomes were obtained from all of them. The standard t(9;22) was seen in 23 patients, four had variant translocations, and two were Ph-negative. Of the four patients with variant translocations, one had a simple translocation in which the missing segment of chromosome #22 was translocated onto the short arm of chromosome #9. The remaining three patients had complex translocations. The first involved chromosomes #11, #19, and #22, the second involved chromosomes #9, #11, and #22, and the third involved chromosomes #9, #14, and #22. Karyotypic abnormalities in addition to the Ph chromosome were seen in four patients: in three these changes developed during the chronic phase and in one during the blastic phase. Using Q-, R-, and G-banding techniques, we found that the breakpoint on chromosome #22 is just below the centromere, namely in band 22q11.2 and on chromosome #9 in band 9q34.1.

These patients received relatively low total doses of IT Ara-C and standard doses of IV Ara-C. Previous studies have shown that Ara-C equilibrates readily between serum and cerebrospinal fluid; this implies that total IV and IT doses of Ara-C may be additive in relation to development of neurotoxicity.

In this study, microscopic testicular involvement by lymphoblasts occurred in 21% of newly diagnosed boys with ALL; this occurred only if the leukocyte count exceeded 25,000/microliter. These patients in general had a poor prognosis, probably reflecting the overall heavy tumor burden. However, it was not possible to predict accurately those patients who would have leukemic testicular infiltrates at the cessation of chemotherapy by performing biopsy of the testes at the time of initial diagnosis or after induction therapy.","['Kim, T H', 'Hargreaves, H K', 'Chan, W C', 'Brynes, R K', 'Alvarado, C', 'Woodard, J', 'Ragab, A H']","['Kim TH', 'Hargreaves HK', 'Chan WC', 'Brynes RK', 'Alvarado C', 'Woodard J', 'Ragab AH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Testis/*pathology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Mar 1;57(5):1038-41. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860301)57:5<1038::aid-cncr2820570527>3.0.co;2-1.,['CA-20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1002/1097-0142(19860301)57:5<1038::aid-cncr2820570527>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Prior therapy for the complication included systemic antiblastic chemotherapy and low doses of radiation (3.9 Gy) to the affected eye. In July 1979, 2 months after chemotherapy was stopped for the second time, she presented with recurrent leukemic hypopyon in the left eye and was treated again with antiblastic chemotherapy followed in 1 year by high-dose (20 Gy) local irradiation. After a third recurrence, which was diagnosed as pre-B/B-cell ALL with a variable position of maturation arrest, enucleation was performed. The patient remains in complete remission for 26+ months after an additional course of systemic chemotherapy.

From these correlations it emerged that severe cytopenia is centrally positioned with regard to clinical course in RA and RA-S. Positive correlations were found to initial diagnosis, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, progression to RA with an excess of blasts (RAEB) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the percentage of bone marrow blast cells and prolonged half life for radioactively labeled iron. The degree of peripheral blood granulocytopenia, alone, was correlated to bone marrow hypoplasia. Moreover, the frequency of abnormal karyotypes was inversely correlated to bone marrow cellularity and proportional to the frequency of bone marrow blast cells. From these relationships it may be proposed that chromosome abnormalities are associated with prolonged blast cell generation times and inhibition of blast cell maturation resulting in reduced marrow cellularity and blast cell accumulation, and, in the peripheral blood, falling percentages of neutrophil granulocytes. With the blast cell accumulation the bone marrow cellularity again becomes hyperplastic and the preleukaemic condition is transformed into RAEB or AML.","['Kerndrup, G', 'Pedersen, B', 'Ellegaard, J', 'Hokland, P']","['Kerndrup G', 'Pedersen B', 'Ellegaard J', 'Hokland P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/complications/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/etiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1986 Jan;52(1):35-43. doi: 10.1007/BF00320140.,,['10.1007/BF00320140 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Karyotype was an independent prognostic factor for duration of first CR and survival, even when age, initial leukocyte count (WBC), French-American-British (FAB) type, and immunologic phenotype were considered. Among adults, prolonged remission and survival were uncommon in all chromosome groups. Only in the normal karyotype group was median survival even two years. Among children, striking differences in long-term remission and survival were seen depending upon karyotype. Children in the greater than 50 group did best, with 70% remaining in first CR for a median duration in excess of five years. Children in the 47-50, 6q-, and normal karyotype groups also had prolonged survivals. In contrast, certain translocations [t(9;22)(q34;q11), t(4;11)(q21;q14-23), t(8;14)(q24;q32)] identified children who had short survivals, even in the presence of favorable prognostic factors including a low WBC, L1 morphology, and non-T, non-B immunologic phenotype.

Although the mechanism of this drug-induced hypomethylation of DNA is not known, the methyl analogue (CCRG 81045) also appeared to reduce template activity of isolated DNA to a greater extent than the ethyl analogue, suggesting that the extent or position of alkylation of DNA bases be important in inhibiting DNA-recognition enzymes.","['Tisdale, M J']",['Tisdale MJ'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '97716-74-0 (ethazolastone)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', '*Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Methylation', 'Temozolomide', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Time Factors']",1986/01/15 00:00,1986/01/15 00:01,['1986/01/15 00:00'],"['1986/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1986 Jan 15;35(2):311-6. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(86)90531-9.,,"['0006-2952(86)90531-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(86)90531-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

This study was concerned with the pathogenesis of this second phase of thrombocytopenia. During this period, the number of marrow megakaryocytes was increased. A peripheral platelet destruction was further indicated by reduced platelet life span. It was shown that radiolabeled platelets, either normal or infected, were submitted to a more rapid clearance in infected recipients than in normal recipients. This might be due to the splenomegaly observed in infected recipients. However, the immediate clearance of gp70+ platelets was more accelerated in infected recipients with high titers of serum anti-gp70 antibodies than in infected recipients without detectable serum anti-gp70 antibodies. In addition, the passive transfer of anti-RMuLV serum to normal BALB/c mice induced a rapid and specific clearance of previously injected radiolabeled platelets expressing RMuLV antigens. In H-2d mice, viral gp70 antigen expression on platelets correlated with the development of delayed thrombocytopenia; but H-2k strains of mice, although susceptible to RMuLV and expressing RMuLV-related antigens on their platelets, did not develop any anti-RMuLV antibodies nor any delayed thrombocytopenia. These results suggest that specific clearance of gp70+ platelets in the presence of significant amounts of serum antiviral antibodies and nonspecific hypersplenism play a role in the development of delayed thrombocytopenia in RMuLV-infected mice.","['Grau, G E', 'Morrow, D', 'Izui, S', 'Lambert, P H']","['Grau GE', 'Morrow D', 'Izui S', 'Lambert PH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immune Sera)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/administration & dosage/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Female', 'Immune Sera/administration & dosage', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/*etiology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Platelet Count', 'Preleukemia/etiology/immunology', 'Rauscher Virus/*immunology', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/*etiology/immunology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jan;136(2):686-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 3 of 11 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, in 1 of 2 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and in 2 of 4 patients with polycythemia vera, a higher proportion of the more immature CFU-GM (type 1) was detected in bone marrow cells. The more differentiated CFU-GM (type 2) is not detectable in normal peripheral blood. By contrast, in 14 of 15 chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, in 1 of 2 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients and in 3 of 8 patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis, it was present in high to very high proportions. It is clear from these findings that the antigens present on normal CFU-GM are expressed in chronic myeloproliferative disorders. The proportion and distribution of type 1 and 2 CFU-GM, on the other hand, are very different from those observed in the normal subjects.","['Ferrero, D', 'Tarella, C', 'Pregno, P', 'Pileri, A', 'Gallo, E']","['Ferrero D', 'Tarella C', 'Pregno P', 'Pileri A', 'Gallo E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*immunology/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/immunology/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/immunology/pathology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/immunology/pathology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Feb;46(2):975-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with the parent CCRF-CEM cells, CEM/VLB100 cells are approximately equal to 200- to 800-fold resistant to vinblastine and express cross-resistance to vincristine, doxorubicin, and other ""natural product"" drugs, as determined by comparing 50% inhibitory concentrations in a 48-h growth inhibition assay. Verapamil (10 microM) decreased the 50% inhibitory concentrations for Vinca alkaloids in CEM/VLB100 cells by approximately equal to 75- to 85-fold but caused only slight (approximately equal to 2- to 5-fold) decreases in 50% inhibitory concentrations for anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, and other tubulin-binding drugs (colchicine and podophyllotoxin). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with doxorubicin-resistant cells, termed CEM/DOX; verapamil caused a 19-fold increase in doxorubicin toxicity but 67- and 3500-fold increases in the toxicities of vinblastine and vincristine, respectively. These results indicate that the effect of verapamil is relatively greater for Vinca alkaloids, with less pronounced effects for the other natural product drugs against which these cells express multiple drug resistance. In flow cytometric studies, individually nontoxic or minimally toxic concentrations of vinblastine plus verapamil caused measurable accumulation in the G2 + M phase as early as 4 h after the drug combination was added to cultures of CEM/VLB100 cells; this finding correlated with a comparable increase in the number of cells in mitosis and measurable decreases in the total number of cells. Since similar effects on cell cycle distribution, percentage of cells in mitosis, and cell number were seen when CEM/VLB100 cells were treated with toxic concentrations of vinblastine alone, we conclude that the primary toxicity of the vinblastine-verapamil combination stems from the alkaloid. Further, the rapid lytic effect of the drug combination was associated with cellular vacuolization. The vacuoles did not stain for lipids, and increases in their number were evident within 2 to 4 h after drug treatment. We suggest that verapamil enhances Vinca alkaloid cytotoxicity by altering ""cryptic"" cytotoxic targets, possibly related to these vacuoles, through some as yet undefined membrane effect.","['Beck, W T', 'Cirtain, M C', 'Look, A T', 'Ashmun, R A']","['Beck WT', 'Cirtain MC', 'Look AT', 'Ashmun RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/toxicity', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/toxicity', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/toxicity']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Feb;46(2):778-84.,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Case report and literature review.,92-9,"Hand mirror cell (HMC) lymphoid leukemia is an unusual variant of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in which the bone marrow lymphoblasts manifest distinctive hand mirror morphologic features. Reported here is a 66-year-old woman with HMC lymphoid leukemia whose clinical course was characterized by 12 months of initial disease stability while she was receiving no chemotherapy; a prompt response to cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone therapy once instituted; and a hyperleukocytic episode (leukocyte count 607,000/mm3), which resulted in her death after 22 months of disease. This patient and 13 other reported adults (15 years and older) with HMC lymphoid leukemia (greater than 40% bone marrow HMC) are reviewed. HMC lymphoid leukemia appears to differ from typical adult ALL in that it has a female predominance, a relatively indolent early clinical course that lasts 1 year or longer, and it manifests the possibility of survival for 1 or 2 years despite the failure to achieve a complete remission with chemotherapy. Phenotypically, the HMC leukemic cells from all adults evaluated were null cells, Ia-positive, TdT-positive, and stained positively with acid phosphates, which suggests that HMC lymphoid leukemia is a variant of non-T, non-B-ALL.

Surface immunoglobulin intensity appears to be greater on the prolymphocytes than on the small lymphocyte in the same case, suggesting a clonal differentiation. At the time of transformation, the spleen is generally larger than at the time of diagnosis of CLL, and lymphadenopathy is variable. Transformation is thought to be associated with increasing refractoriness to treatment and shorter survival, although most of the deaths occurred in clinical Stages III and IV, known to have a poor prognosis. Similar features between PLL-trs CLL and so-called de novo PLL also suggest an evolutionary process. However, additional morphologic and immunologic studies in transforming CLL cases are necessary to answer this question.","['Ghani, A M', 'Krause, J R', 'Brody, J P']","['Ghani AM', 'Krause JR', 'Brody JP']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Jan 1;57(1):75-80. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860101)57:1<75::aid-cncr2820570116>3.0.co;2-x.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19860101)57:1<75::aid-cncr2820570116>3.0.co;2-x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

All of these translocations have breakpoints in 22q11. Using a molecular cytogenetic approach and various cloned portions of the lambda light chain gene as probe, we have assigned a linear order within 22q11 to these breakpoints. Using chromosomal in situ hybridization we have determined that the 22q11 breakpoint in BL2, a t(8;22) Burkitt's lymphoma is proximal to the breakpoint of the t(9;22) of CML. We have demonstrated that the 22q11 breakpoint of PA682, another t(8;22) BL cell line, interrupts the lambda light chain locus. Using a combination of variable and constant region probes and PA682 cells, we have shown that the lambda light chain locus is oriented such that V lambda is proximal to C lambda in 22q11. Our results for the constitutional t(11;22) indicate that the 22q11 breakpoint is distal to that of BL, proximal both to that of CML and ES and, in addition, it interrupts the C lambda gene cluster. Our studies of the 22q11 breakpoint of the t(11;22) of ES and NE suggest that they are the most distal of the breakpoints we studied on chromosome #22.","['Emanuel, B S', 'Nowell, P C', 'McKeon, C', 'Croce, C M', 'Israel, M A']","['Emanuel BS', 'Nowell PC', 'McKeon C', 'Croce CM', 'Israel MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Fibroblasts/ultrastructure', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive, Peripheral/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1986 Jan 1;19(1-2):81-92. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(86)90375-4.,"['CA39926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM32592/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0165-4608(86)90375-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(86)90375-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Different chromosome patterns are found within individual tumors and among phenotypically similar tumors. Some tumor cell populations contain mixtures of diploid and cytogenetically aberrant cells; others display multiple aberrant clones. The extent and biological significance of chromosomal heterogeneity is contrasted between examples of leukemias and of selected solid tumors (mainly of breast and central nervous system origin). Increasing degrees of chromosomal aberration appear correlated with increasingly malignant biological properties of tumors. Genic and chromosomal instability are potential sources for genetic diversity within all tumors. However, variations in local selective forces and differential survival within an expanding solid lesion may contribute to maintenance of a mixed cell population within the primary tumor. In turn, the resulting heterogeneity may permit selection and increase of aberrant cells that are responsible for tumor progression and metastasis.","['Wolman, S R']",['Wolman SR'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Meningioma/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Ploidies']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1986 Jan 1;19(1-2):129-40. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(86)90380-8.,,"['0165-4608(86)90380-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(86)90380-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

In situ hybridization of metaphase spread showed that this gene is located on human chromosome 17 at q21, a specific breakpoint observed in a translocation associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The c-erbB-2 DNA probe hybridized with a 4.6 kb mRNA which directs the synthesis of a 185 kd glycoprotein. The 185 kd c-erbB-2 protein is associated with tyrosine kinase activity and is possibly phosphorylated by C-kinase on its serine and threonine residues. In addition, the c-erbB-2 protein is suggested to be a substrate for EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, since EGF binding to the EGF receptor rapidly induced phosphorylation of the c-erbB-2 protein on its tyrosine residue. Southern blot hybridization analysis of DNAs from human tumors demonstrated amplification of the c-erbB-2 gene restricted to adenocarcinomas. Finally, the promoter of the c-erbB-2 gene contains the typical TATA box and CAAT box as well as a GC box-like sequence. This is in contrast with the promoter of the EGF receptor gene, since the latter contains only GC-boxes. Therefore, it is suggested that the two genes are under different transcriptional control.","['Yamamoto, T', 'Akiyama, T', 'Yokota, J', 'Mori, S', 'Toyoshima, K']","['Yamamoto T', 'Akiyama T', 'Yokota J', 'Mori S', 'Toyoshima K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1986;17:203-10.,,,,"['Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 138 treatment periods of 108 patients. The intensified chemotherapy resulted in severe granulocytopenia below 0.1 X 10(9) l for over 25.2 days. In 19 patients there was a suspect of major fungal infection, for which they were given antimycotics (in 15 cases amphotericin B and 5-fluocytosin). Fourteen of them died. Major fungal infections were documented in 5 cases. In 18% of the deceased we found major fungal infection (7 cases of Candida sp., 5 cases of Aspergillus, one case of Candida as well as mucor). There was a correlation between fungal infection, the late stages of the haematological malignancy and the lesions appearing on the oropharyngeal mucosa. However, no correlation appeared to exist in the serological and culture findings between the groups with and without fungal infection. The SD-regime is meant to suppress the Candida cell concentration in the digestive tract but has no influence on Aspergillus in the respiratory tract. The clinical occurrence of major fungal infections published in the E.O.R.T.C.--Gnotobiotic Project Group was 8.2%. According to the literature there is in the eighties a tendency for an increased incidence of aspergillosis. The use of the SD-regime as prophylaxis as well as early antifungal therapy appear to be of great advantage in reducing the frequency of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.","['Gunther, I', 'Kaben, U', 'Dunker, H', 'Brijmohan-Gunther, R', 'Konrad, H']","['Gunther I', 'Kaben U', 'Dunker H', 'Brijmohan-Gunther R', 'Konrad H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Tokai J Exp Clin Med,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,7704186,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Fungal)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Agranulocytosis/chemically induced', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Fungal/analysis', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Cross Infection/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Digestive System/*microbiology', 'Fungi/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tokai J Exp Clin Med. 1986;11 Suppl:15-22.,,,,"['Clinic of Internal Medicine, Wilhelm Pieck University, Rostock, GDR.']",,,,,,,,,

In vitro selectivity, as measured by the logarithmic ratio of IC50 growth inhibition assays against P388 leukaemia and Lewis lung carcinoma cells, was significantly correlated with the increase in life span in vivo with the P388 leukaemia and Lewis lung lines, whereas the growth inhibition IC50 values alone correlated with the dose potency in mice. It was thus possible to predict both in vivo anti-tumour activity and dose potency, identifying compounds with high therapeutic activity, using a combination of two in vitro assays. Two new compounds have been identified which provide, along with an acridine-substituted analogue of amsacrine which is at present in clinical trial (CI-921), a high proportion of cures against the Lewis lung tumour in vivo. Since amsacrine is thought to interact with the enzyme topoisomerase II, and because the anilino group of 9-anilinoacridine derivatives is thought to project from the DNA intercalation site of the drug-DNA complex, these compounds may be of particular interest in mode of action studies.","['Rewcastle, G W', 'Denny, W A', 'Wilson, W R', 'Baguley, B C']","['Rewcastle GW', 'Denny WA', 'Wilson WR', 'Baguley BC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Female', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1986 Nov;1(3):215-22.,,,,"['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland Medical School, New Zealand.']",,,,,,,,,

DNA-binding affinity, as estimated either by ethidium displacement or equilibrium dialysis, decreased progressively as the bulk of the substituent increased. Substitution at the 2 position provided the largest effects. The DNA unwinding angles, estimated by changes in viscosity of closed circular duplex DNA in the presence of drug, decreased significantly with ethyl and isopropyl substituents. However, with tertbutyl groups in the 2, 3 or 4 position of the acridine ring, unwinding was not observed even though DNA binding was measurable. Anti-leukaemia activity in vivo was also abolished when the acridine ring was substituted with a tertbutyl group. The results suggest that methyl substitution of the acridine ring inhibits DNA binding at the 2 position but not at the 3 and 4 positions, that ethyl and isopropyl substitution inhibits intercalative binding at all positions and that tertbutyl substitution abolishes intercalative binding. Biological activity in vitro is dependent on both lipophilicity and DNA binding and activity in vivo requires intercalative DNA binding.","['Denny, W A', 'Twigden, S J', 'Baguley, B C']","['Denny WA', 'Twigden SJ', 'Baguley BC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1986 Apr;1(2):125-32.,,,,"['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland Medical School, New Zealand.']",,,,,,,,,

In prefixed cells, the plasma membrane-associated network was isotropic without any prevailing direction of the filaments, and the gold-labelled H-2 antigens were preferentially localized over or at a very short distance from membrane-associated filaments. Incubation of unfixed cells with anti-H-2 antibodies followed by fixation and incubation with anti-Ig, did not induce detectable redistribution of H-2 antigens or of the filament network. Notwithstanding this apparent absence of rearrangement of H-2 antigens and filaments, a detergent-resistant linkage to the cytoskeleton was induced. Before immune incubations, virtually all H-2 antigens were solubilized by extraction with Triton X-100, while after incubation with anti-H-2 antibodies about 50% of the H-2 antigens were linked to the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton. Sequential addition of anti-H-2 and anti-Ig antibodies to unfixed cells induced formation of patches and caps of H-2 antigens. Under these conditions, the majority of the H-2 antigens became linked to the detergent-resistant cytoskeleton. Redistribution into patches and caps was often accompanied by a local rearrangement of the isotropic network into bundles of parallel filaments immediately adjacent to the plasma membrane. Patches were seen to overly both isotropic networks and these parallel filaments. Large sheets of plasma membrane overlying parallel filaments were frequently devoid of gold-labelled H-2 antigens and coated pits, and thus most probably represented areas away from caps. This observation suggests that capping is accompanied by a rearrangement of filaments close to the membrane.","['Feltkamp, C A', 'Spiele, H', 'Roos, E']","['Feltkamp CA', 'Spiele H', 'Roos E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cytoskeleton/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1987 Oct;88 ( Pt 3):313-25.,,,,"['Division of Cell Biology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Huis), Amsterdam.']",,,,,,,,,

For respiratory tract cancer, the pooled total is 1789 cases observed versus 1290.7 expected, a risk ratio of 1.39. Most electric welders are exposed to extremely low frequency electromagnetic radiation (ELF) (magnetic flux densities of up to 100,000 microT), a suspected leukemogen, and to concentrated metallic aerosols (up to 200 mg/m3), which can contain the putative respiratory tract carcinogens Cr(VI) and Ni. The two exposures are usually coincident, since welding with an electric current produces welding fumes. The observation of an excess risk for respiratory tract cancer strongly suggests significant exposure both to fumes and to ELF. The absence of increased risk for all leukemia or for acute leukemia among ELF-exposed welders does not support the hypothesis that the observed excess risk for leukemia or acute leukemia among workers in the electrical trades is due to their ELF exposure, which on the average is lower than that of welders.","['Stern, R M']",['Stern RM'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/adverse effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Electromagnetic Phenomena/*adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Welding']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1987 Dec;76:221-9. doi: 10.1289/ehp.8776221.,,['10.1289/ehp.8776221 [doi]'],PMC1474456,"['Danish Welding Institute, Brondby, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,

Femur and calvarium were examined at 15, 17 and 19 days in ovo and 7 and 25 days after hatching by histologic and immunoperoxidase techniques. Femur and calvarium were also examined by electron microscopy at 17 and 19 days in ovo and at 7 days after hatching. Avian osteopetrotic bone lesions were characterized by exuberant periosteal proliferation; the time of onset varied with different virus isolates. In the femur virus was first associated with osteoprogenitor cells, then with osteoblasts and finally with osteocytes as the cells progressed through normal sequences of differentiation. The amount of virus produced by these cells did not correlate with onset of periosteal proliferation. Slow onset isolates provoked early virus production, but proliferative lesions did not develop until later. Conversely, the rapid onset isolate induced little early virus production, although lesions were present. Periosteal proliferation was associated with and preceded by perivascular edema and perivascular cell necrosis within the bone cortex following infection by all isolates. However, the rapid onset isolate caused more severe lesions than other isolates. These lesions included vascular thrombosis, capillary necrosis and focal bone necrosis. The relationship between early vascular lesions and late periosteal proliferation seen with the slow onset isolates is not as clear as with the rapid onset isolate. Calvarial bone, a representative flat bone, was found to have virus present, but at a level less than the femur. Vascular lesions were rarely seen in the calvarium and bone proliferation did not occur at this site.","['Powers, B E', 'Norrdin, R W', 'Snyder, S P', 'Smith, R E']","['Powers BE', 'Norrdin RW', 'Snyder SP', 'Smith RE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*pathology', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus', 'Bone Diseases/microbiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Chickens/*microbiology', 'Femur/pathology', 'Osteopetrosis/microbiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Poultry Diseases/*microbiology/pathology', 'Skull/pathology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone. 1987;8(4):231-40. doi: 10.1016/8756-3282(87)90170-0.,"['CA35984/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CS09408/PHS HHS/United States']","['8756-3282(87)90170-0 [pii]', '10.1016/8756-3282(87)90170-0 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",,,,,,,,,

Due to diagnostic difficulties, results for liver and ovarian cancers, while suggestive of significant dose responses, do not provide convincing evidence for radiogenic effects. No significant dose responses are seen for cancers of the gallbladder, prostate, rectum, pancreas, or uterus, or for lymphoma. For solid tumors, largely due to sex-specific differences in the background rates, the relative risk of radiation-induced mortality is greater for women than for men. For nonleukemic cancers the relative risk seen in those who were young when exposed has decreased with time, while the smaller risks for those who were older at exposure have tended to increase. While the absolute excess risks of radiation-induced mortality due to nonleukemic cancer have increased with time for all age-at-exposure groups, both excess and relative risks of leukemia have generally decreased with time.

The present study was designed to explore the difference between the mechanism of gallium accumulation and that of iron by using mouse leukemic cell line L5178Y. When monensin which inhibits the recycle of transferrin receptor was added to the incubated system, accumulation of 59Fe and 67Ga was clearly diminished compared with that of control. However, inhibition of 59Fe accumulation was more remarkable than that of 67Ga. Furthermore, monensin has a action of Na+ ionophore which decreases Na+ gradient between the inside and the outside of the plasma membrane. Following administration of monensin, 67Ga accumulation was diminished according to the loss of the Na+ gradient. On the other hand, following administration of valinomycin, 67Ga accumulation was not affected by the loss of the K+ gradient. From these results, it was suggested that the mechanism of 67Ga accumulation into tumor cells differed from that of 59Fe and transferrin receptor and Na+ gradient of tumor cells played an important role on 67Ga accumulation into tumor cells.","['Murahashi, H', 'Wakao, H', 'Ikuta, H', 'Kogawa, T', 'Jinbu, Y', 'Higashi, T']","['Murahashi H', 'Wakao H', 'Ikuta H', 'Kogawa T', 'Jinbu Y', 'Higashi T']",['jpn'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Radioisotopes,Radioisotopes,20010290R,"['0 (Gallium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gallium Radioisotopes/*pharmacokinetics', 'Iron Radioisotopes/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monensin', 'Receptors, Transferrin/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism', 'Valinomycin']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radioisotopes. 1987 Nov;36(11):568-74. doi: 10.3769/radioisotopes.36.11_568.,,['10.3769/radioisotopes.36.11_568 [doi]'],,"['Department of Radiology, Kanagawa Dental College, Yokosuka-shi, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

Various modifications of the basic structure of PAF lead to different ether lipid (EL) analogs. Data from the evaluation of thioalkyl and amidoalkyl glycerophosphocholine and of glycerophosphoinositol EL analogs against different experimental tumors in vitro (HL60 and K562 human leukemia cells, BG1 and BG3 ovarian adenocarcinomas) are presented. Exclusion of trypan blue after short exposure to the drugs determined cytotoxicity, and a soft agarose clonogenic assay measured the ability of the analogs to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. The thioalkyl EL are very active against the cell lines using both end points, and the amidoalkyl EL showed efficacy against the leukemic cell lines, whereas the phosphoinositol EL are active only at high concentrations. Combined use of EL analogs, which are membrane-interactive, with classical DNA-interactive chemotherapeutic drugs revealed that the combinations have additive antiproliferative effects.

Twenty-two alkyl lysophospholipid analogs were chemically synthesized, and their antitumor activity against mouse experimental tumors (Sarcoma 180, MM46, P388) was examined. Among them, 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-acetoacetyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine was found to show antitumor activity similar to ET-18-OMe with less acute toxicity. Intravenous injection of the ET-18-OMe with sn-3 configuration retarded the subcutaneous growth of Sarcoma 180 cells effectively, while the growth inhibition by the sn-1 isomer was much less effective. This stereospecificity was similar to that observed in their activities as platelet-activating factor (PAF) agonists. The acetoacetyl compound, another PAF agonist, showed similar stereospecific antitumor action in vivo. These findings suggest that some alkyl lysophospholipids may activate host cells to a cytostatic stage against tumor cells in vivo through binding to a PAF receptor. Our preliminary results indicated that the responsible cells under these conditions might be primarily immature macrophages present in the bone marrow. No appreciable or even adverse stereospecificity was observed in the different sets of experiments where the activity of ET-18-OMe against MM46 tumor cells in vivo or the direct cytotoxicity against human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells in vitro was examined. Under some conditions, the antitumor activity of ET-18-OMe in vivo may be revealed through direct cytotoxicity and/or modulation of the host defense system by ""nonspecific"" mechanisms. Some alkylphospholipids without PAF activity may also show antitumor activity through similar ""nonspecific"" mechanisms.","['Kudo, I', 'Nojima, S', 'Chang, H W', 'Yanoshita, R', 'Hayashi, H', 'Kondo, E', 'Nomura, H', 'Inoue, K']","['Kudo I', 'Nojima S', 'Chang HW', 'Yanoshita R', 'Hayashi H', 'Kondo E', 'Nomura H', 'Inoue K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Phospholipid Ethers/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lipids. 1987 Nov;22(11):862-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02535545.,,['10.1007/BF02535545 [doi]'],,"['Department of Health Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

The mechanis of this selective cytotoxicity is unknown. We conducted studies to determine whether this compound is metabolized by phospholipases C and D and, if so, whether sensitive and resistant cells differ in their ability to degrade ET-18-OCH3 by these enzymes. We have examined the metabolism of the L-isomer of ET-18-OCH3, 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (L-ET-18-OCH3), by lysophospholipase D of rat liver microsomes and by a phospholipase D from the marine bacterium Vibrio damsela. The metabolism of L-ET-18-OCH3 was also examined in cell culture using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, human promyelocytic leukemia cells and human myelocytic leukemia cells. In these studies, L-ET-18-OCH3 and related 1-O-alkyl-linked phosphocholine analogs radiolabeled with 3H in the 1-O-alkyl chain were used. L-ET-18-OCH3 was not hydrolyzed by lysophospholipase D from rat liver microsomes under conditions where cleavage of 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was observed. However, phospholipase D from the marine bacterium V. damsela readily hydrolyzed L-ET-18-OCH3 to 1-O-[3H]octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, demonstrating that L-ET-18-OCH3 can be degraded by a phospholipase D.

We found that the steady-state amount of these different mRNAs gradually increased from day 13 to day 18. By comparison with the level of expression of these genes in adult liver, the increase during gestation was fairly more marked for Q10 mRNA than for the others. Furthermore, we found that the Q10 gene is transiently expressed in the endoderm layer of the visceral yolk sac and in the fetal heart. Expression in the latter tissue decreases abruptly while increasing in the liver. It has been proposed that the Q10 protein is involved in immune tolerance. However, the time course of expression of Q10 mRNA and its tissue distribution during embryogenesis suggest that the Q10 protein could play a role in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells.","['David-Watine, B', 'Transy, C', 'Gachelin, G', 'Kourilsky, P']","['David-Watine B', 'Transy C', 'Gachelin G', 'Kourilsky P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Liver/embryology', 'Mice/embryology/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Yolk Sac/physiology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 1987;61(2):145-54. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(87)90109-0.,,"['0378-1119(87)90109-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(87)90109-0 [doi]']",,"['Unite de Biologie Moleculaire du Gene, U. 277 INSERM - U.A.C. 115 CNRS, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,

The results indicate that the receptor is expressed with increased density in the majority of positive cases of acute leukaemia.

Single dose treatment of each drug was administered simultaneously or with a 24-hr interval between 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide to the advanced tumors or at various times after L1210 inoculation. While at low doses the action of the combination of the two drugs was greater than expected, there was no therapeutic synergism if the drugs were given together (optimum doses cyclophosphamide 366 mg/kg and 364 mg/kg, respectively, in advanced L1210 and P388 leukemias) or in the early tumor when cyclophosphamide was given 24 hours after 5-fluorouracil. In the advanced tumor, using the regimen employing a 24-hr interval between drugs, therapeutic synergism could be demonstrated (optimum doses 5-fluorouracil 130 mg/kg followed by cyclophosphamide 248 mg/kg in advanced L1210 leukemia and 5-fluorouracil 110 mg/kg followed by cyclophosphamide 263 mg/kg in advanced P388 leukemia). The evidence generated suggested that improved therapy could be found in two separate regions of the treatment space, raising the possibility of more than one mechanism of drug interaction. The location of the optimal treatment depended on the tumor burden at the time treatment was initiated. A shift from one region to the other occurred after 4-6 days of tumor growth when the original inoculum was 10(5) i.p. L1210 cells. Another more obvious conclusion that can be drawn is that treatment was less effective as the tumor became more advanced. The notion that different tumor stages may require different ratios of drugs in a clinically useful combination should receive attention.","['Wampler, G L', 'Carter, W H Jr', 'Campbell, E D']","['Wampler GL', 'Carter WH Jr', 'Campbell ED']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Staging']",1987/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1987;5(6):523-33. doi: 10.3109/07357908709020311.,,['10.3109/07357908709020311 [doi]'],,"['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298.']",,,,,,,,,

Thus, the therapeutic index of the important antifungal agent amphotericin B is markedly improved via incorporation of the drug into liposomes. The mechanistic basis of this effect seems to be an increase in the selectivity of the drug at the cellular level. Thus, free amphotericin B can readily partition into both fungal and mammalian membranes and can cause toxicity to both types of cells, giving rise to the notorious in vivo toxicity of this drug. By contrast, when amphotericin B is formulated in certain types of liposomes, the drug still readily partitions into fungal membranes but can no longer partition into animal cell membranes, thus markedly reducing its toxicity. Liposomes can also be used to reduce the toxicity of membrane-active antitumor drugs. Thus, the peptide ionophore valinomycin is far less toxic to animals when presented in liposomal form. Nonetheless, the drug retains useful antitumor activity in this form. The underlying basis of the enhanced therapeutic index of liposomal valinomycin is unknown at this time but is being explored. The development of membrane-active anti-tumor drugs, in conjunction with liposomal delivery systems, could be an important new approach in cancer chemotherapy. While no anticancer drug is likely to be free of toxic side effects, the toxicities engendered by membrane-active antitumor drugs are likely to affect a different spectrum of tissues and organs than those caused by ""conventional"" antitumor drugs. Thus membrane-active drugs could complement existing drugs and provide a valuable adjunct to therapy.","['Juliano, R L', 'Daoud, S', 'Krause, H J', 'Grant, C W']","['Juliano RL', 'Daoud S', 'Krause HJ', 'Grant CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Liposomes)', '2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Candida/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Infections/*drug therapy', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes/*administration & dosage', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Valinomycin/*therapeutic use']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1987;507:89-103. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb45794.x.,['CA 36840/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb45794.x [doi]'],,"['Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77096.']",,,,,,,,,

New, recurrent, or residual mediastinal masses in children treated for malignant disease present a diagnostic dilemma. Are these masses recurrent disease or simply normal reactive thymic hyperplasia? Our experience from 1979 to 1986 includes 14 children aged 1 to 17 years (mean 7.4 years) who were identified with new or recurrent mediastinal masses during or after chemotherapeutic treatment for malignant disease (lymphoma 9, Wilms tumor 2, leukemia 1, osteosarcoma 1, malignant teratoma 1). The mediastinal masses were treated by a variety of methods depending on the attending physician's preference (close observation 2, oral steroids 5, steroids and subsequent biopsy 1, open biopsy 6). Chest roentgenograms of ""observation only"" patients have showed stable mediastinal changes without clinical evidence of recurrent disease. Patients treated with steroids showed resolution of the mediastinal masses in 48 hours to seven days, without recurrence. Patients undergoing open biopsy showed only thymic hyperplasia and/or lymph nodes. We suggest a stepwise approach to evaluation of these patients. Mediastinal masses occurring during, or shortly following, chemotherapeutic treatments of malignant disease should first be treated with oral prednisone (60 mg/m2/d x 7 to 10 d). If the patient shows a complete or partial resolution, then follow-up includes frequent chest roentgenograms and/or a second course of steroids. If the mass fails to respond to steroids, or enlarges, then open biopsy through a minithoractomy will clarify the diagnosis.

The study period was divided in period A, before total unit renovation, and period B, afterwards. During period B all patient carriers of Clostridium difficile received vancomycin. A comparison of the two periods showed that the percentage of positive cultures fell from 16.6% to 3.6% and the positive toxin assays from 9.9% to 1.2%. It was concluded that colonization by Clostridium difficile can be prevented in hospital wards with generally high rates of infection by a combination of decontamination of the environment, introduction of preventive measures and treatment of Clostridium difficile carriage with vancomycin.","['Delmee, M', 'Vandercam, B', 'Avesani, V', 'Michaux, J L']","['Delmee M', 'Vandercam B', 'Avesani V', 'Michaux JL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol,European journal of clinical microbiology,8219582,['6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)'],IM,"['Carrier State/*drug therapy', 'Clostridium/classification', 'Cross Infection/drug therapy/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/drug therapy/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Hospital Units', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Serotyping', 'Vancomycin/*therapeutic use']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol. 1987 Dec;6(6):623-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02013056.,,['10.1007/BF02013056 [doi]'],,"['Microbiology Department, Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,

Four presented with refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 16 presented with refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and 1 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Dyserythropoiesis and dysgranulopoiesis were seen in all patients, and dysmegakaryopoiesis was seen in most patients. Cytogenetic studies in 13 of the 21 children showed karyotype abnormalities in 8; 5 had monosomy 7. Eleven patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy soon after diagnosis; 6 achieved complete remission (CR), and 2 of them are alive and still in complete remission after 48 and 69 months. Low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) was given in six children without improvement. Bone marrow transplantation after progression of the disease has produced complete remission lasting 28 + months now in one of two patients. Four patients received only symptomatic treatment. The rate of 5-year survival for the total group was 20% (SD 9%). We conclude that children with MDS may benefit from more aggressive treatment, but that in general the survival rate is poor and similar to that observed in adults with the same subtypes of this disease.","['Creutzig, U', 'Cantu-Rajnoldi, A', 'Ritter, J', 'Romitti, L', 'Odenwald, E', 'Conter, V', 'Riehm, H', 'Masera, G']","['Creutzig U', 'Cantu-Rajnoldi A', 'Ritter J', 'Romitti L', 'Odenwald E', 'Conter V', 'Riehm H', 'Masera G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/classification/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Germany, West', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/diagnosis/drug therapy']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1987 Winter;9(4):324-30.,,,,"[""University Children's Hospital, Munster, F.R.G.""]",,,,,,,,,

The results demonstrated that the immunoprecipitates migrated at 180 and 90 kilodaltons under non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the antigens recognized by GB16, GB18, GB19, and GB22 were able to bind human transferrin.

Moreover, the reactivities of these antibodies with HL-60 (promyelocytic leukaemia) cells diminished following dimethyl sulphoxide-induced differentiation by flow cytometric analysis. These data indicate that these four antibodies recognize the transferrin receptor. By competition assay, GB18 bound to an epitope different from those recognized by GB16, GB19 and GB22.

The blasts from both cases were initially classified as L1 lymphoblasts. Ultrastructural examination indicated a heterogenous blast population in both cases, with some regular lymphoblast-like cells, and others exhibiting nuclear irregularity, small bundles of microfilaments, or large inclusions. In one case at diagnosis, fresh cells expressed B-associated and a myeloid antigen (B4 and 1G10). At the second relapse, the cells from this patient expressed another myeloid-associated antigen, LFA1 molecule, recognized by the monoclonal antibody M232 (CD18). At the end of clinical evolution, a further myeloid antigen was expressed (OKM1), while 8% peroxidase were noted. The other case was studied at diagnosis only and did not express any myeloid marker but expressed the B-associated B4 antigen. Furthermore, the case that exhibited a phenotypic transformation, was noted to show a chromosomal clonal evolution not described so far in other reported cases of t(4;11) acute leukemia. A dual lymphoid-myeloid nature of t(4;11) acute leukemia has been widely discussed. One of the cases reported here supports this hypothesis while the other does not.

This action was strictly dose-dependent: immunostimulation was only evident in the low dose range, whereas immunosuppression became significant at intermediate or high doses. In search for an experimental model of the immunoaugmenting effects of oxazaphosphorines it was found that the transplantable leukemia L 5222 of BD IX inbred rats could be cured by low doses of oxazaphosphorines, whereas this therapeutic activity was gradually lost with increasing doses. Dose-response relationship studies with cyclophosphamide and its stabilized 4-hydroxy-derivative mafosfamide showed a bell-shaped pattern. When the two compounds were compared, the immunotherapeutic range of mafosfamide was considerably broader. Further experiments suggested that the oxazaphosphorine effect was T-cell mediated. Treated and surviving animals were immune to additional tumor challenges. It was shown that mafosfamide at low concentrations inhibited preferentially T-suppressor cell proliferation in vitro; in analogy, an elimination of suppressor mechanisms could also be responsible for the in vivo effects. In clinical phase I studies, the maximally tolerated dose of mafosfamide was around 3 g/m2. The presented animal data, however, indicated that the immunopharmacological dose was approximately 10 times lower. Studies for immunotherapy with mafosfamide are currently ongoing in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and other malignant diseases.","['Pohl, J', 'Reissmann, T', 'Voegeli, R']","['Pohl J', 'Reissmann T', 'Voegeli R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Spain,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol,Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology,7909595,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol. 1987 Sep;9(9):589-94.,,,,"['Abteilung Tumorforschung, Asta-Werke AG, Degussa Pharma Gruppe, Bielefeld, FRG.']",,,,,,,,,

Deoxyspergualin has significant activity in selected experimental tumor models, and clinical trials have been initiated. Described here are in vivo evaluations of the therapeutic activity of deoxyspergualin against murine leukemia lines specifically resistant to eight clinically useful antitumor drugs. These were P388 lines resistant to doxorubicin, vincristine, L-phenylalanine mustard, cisplatin, ara-C, and methotrexate and L1210 lines resistant to 5-FU, L-phenylalanine mustard, and cyclophosphamide. Sensitivity to deoxyspergualin was evaluated in parallel comparisons of each resistant leukemia to the sensitive line from which it had been derived. All experiments were repeated at least once for confirmation of results. Responses were quantitated in terms of the change in tumor cell numbers from the beginning of treatment to the end of treatment as estimated from the median survival times of dying mice. The results indicated that P388 leukemia resistant to cisplatin (P388/DDPt) was cross-resistant to deoxyspergualin. No cross-resistance was observed in leukemias resistant to doxorubicin, vincristine, ara-C, methotrexate, or cyclophosphamide. L1210 resistant to 5-FU (L1210/5-FU) was collaterally sensitive to deoxyspergualin. Although cross-resistance was also observed in P388/L-PAM, L1210/L-PAM retained sensitivity to deoxyspergualin. Total glutathione concentrations in P388/L-PAM and L1210/L-PAM provided no apparent explanation for this unexpected result. It may be tentatively concluded that resistance to cisplatin, L-PAM, or other DNA alkylators or cross-linkers may increase the potential for cross-resistance to deoxyspergualin. This conclusion requires verification with additional alkylating agents, with drug-resistant human tumor cell lines, and with prospective clinical studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Harrison, S D Jr', 'Brockman, R W', 'Trader, M W', 'Laster, W R Jr', 'Griswold, D P Jr']","['Harrison SD Jr', 'Brockman RW', 'Trader MW', 'Laster WR Jr', 'Griswold DP Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanidines)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'UJ0ZJ76DO9 (gusperimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Guanidines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1987/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1987 Dec;5(4):345-51. doi: 10.1007/BF00169973.,['N01-CM-47580/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1007/BF00169973 [doi]'],,"['Kettering-Meyer Laboratory, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, Alabama 35255.']",,,,,,,,,

At the optimal dosage, U-68,415 produced 4 out of 6 long-term (greater than 30 day) survivors; whereas CC-1065 produced a mere 62% increase of life span (ILS) and no long-term survivors. The order of antitumor potency and effectiveness of the CC-1065 analogs was U-68,415 greater than U-66,694 greater than U-68,819 greater than U-66,664, which was parallel to the inhibition of L1210 cell growth. CC-1065 and all the analogs tested here inhibited DNA synthesis approximately 10 times more than RNA synthesis. Protein synthesis was the least inhibited. On a molar basis, U-68,415 was about 6-9 times more inhibitory toward cellular DNA synthesis than CC-1065, yet the interaction and/or binding of CC-1065 to DNA determined by circular dichroism, DNA melting or differential cytotoxicity assay was much stronger than that of U-68,415.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Li, L H', 'Wallace, T L', 'DeKoning, T F', 'Warpehoski, M A', 'Kelly, R C', 'Prairie, M D', 'Krueger, W C']","['Li LH', 'Wallace TL', 'DeKoning TF', 'Warpehoski MA', 'Kelly RC', 'Prairie MD', 'Krueger WC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leucomycins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '69866-21-3 (CC 1065)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/isolation & purification', 'Duocarmycins', '*Indoles', 'Leucomycins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1987 Dec;5(4):329-37. doi: 10.1007/BF00169971.,,['10.1007/BF00169971 [doi]'],,"['Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001.']",,,,,,,,,

Implications for tumor growth and metastasis.,346-66,"A B16 melanoma clone and four derived subclones exhibiting markedly different tumorigenic and metastatic potentials in young C57BL/6 mice were investigated comparatively to determine relative immunogenicities and capacities to induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses following subcutaneous injection. All five populations stimulated some production of circulating antibody to a cell surface antigen complex (B16-gp70/80/85) specified by endogenous murine leukemia virus, as well as spleen-cell-mediated cytolytic and cytostatic activity apparently directed to the same antigens, but to varying extents. Immunogenicity and relative capacity to induce immunity were inversely related to tumorigenicity and tumor growth rate but were not obviously correlated with metastatic behavior. There were indications that tumor behavior might be influenced by developing or naturally acquired host immunity. The most rapidly growing clone, G3.26, which was poorly immunogenic and nonmetastatic in young mice, grew more slowly and was markedly metastatic in normal-aged mice in which some natural humoral and cellular responses cross-reactive with B16-gp70/80/85 antigens were detected. Furthermore, the highly immunogenic and normally nonmetastatic clone, G3.15, was appreciably metastatic in mice immunosuppressed by T lymphocyte depletion. In other cases, however, tumor behavior in immunosuppressed and immunopotentiated mice did not consistently indicate a critical role for host immunity in determining metastatic or nonmetastatic activity.","['Stackpole, C W', 'Alterman, A L', 'Braverman, S', 'Rappaport, I']","['Stackpole CW', 'Alterman AL', 'Braverman S', 'Rappaport I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Switzerland,Invasion Metastasis,Invasion & metastasis,8202435,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Aging/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cross Reactions', 'Female', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Melanoma/*immunology/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invasion Metastasis. 1987;7(6):346-66.,['R01-CA31336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Department of Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla.']",,,,,,,,,

Effect of daunorubicin and verapamil.,747-51,"Numerous studies have indicated that the plasma membrane plays an important role in the development of resistance to anthracycline and vinca alkaloid drugs (pleiotropic resistance). We have previously shown that pleiotropically resistant Ehrlich ascites tumour cells, which are of epithelial origin, have a significantly increased plasma membrane traffic (endo/exocytosis) to the endosomal compartment compared to sensitive cells. The present study, using the same ultrastructural morphometric technique, has demonstrated a similar significant difference in plasma membrane traffic between daunorubicin resistant and sensitive P388 cell lines (which are of lymphoid origin). Furthermore, we have shown that this difference between the P388 sublines is accompanied by an approximately 4 fold increase in the plasma membrane area participating in recycling together with an increased endosomal volume, number and membrane area in resistant cells. Plasma membrane traffic in resistant cells was significantly inhibited by the calcium channel blocker verapamil, a well known modulator of anthracycline resistance, but unaffected by daunorubicin itself. The confirmation of this phenotype in an additional pleiotropically resistant cell type with a different histogenesis further supports a hypothesis of endosomal drug trapping and vesicular extrusion as a possible resistance mechanism.","['Sehested, M', 'Skovsgaard, T', 'van Deurs, B', 'Winther-Nielsen, H']","['Sehested M', 'Skovsgaard T', 'van Deurs B', 'Winther-Nielsen H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Endocytosis', 'Exocytosis', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Verapamil/*therapeutic use']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1987 Dec;56(6):747-51. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1987.282.,,['10.1038/bjc.1987.282 [doi]'],PMC2002395,"['Institute of Pathological Anatomy, University of Copenhagen, Herlev Hospital, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,

Possible involvement of free radicals and correlation with phosphorylation of nuclear protein 1b.,649-56,"Treatment of human promyelocytic leukaemia HL60 cells in conditioned medium with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) for 4 h resulted in 25-30% inhibition of labelling of phosphatidylserine (PS) with [U-14C]serine. PS labelling was 40% lower, and no inhibitory TPA effect was observed when the experiments were performed in fresh medium. Cycloheximide or puromycin also inhibited PS labelling by 38-44%; their inhibitory effects were non-additive with that of TPA and occurred only in conditioned medium. Catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), both free-radical scavengers, and H7, a protein kinase C inhibitor, reversed to various extents the inhibitory effect of TPA on PS synthesis. On the other hand, chlorobenzoic acid, a free-radical-generating agent, also inhibited PS synthesis by 22% after 4 h treatment when conditioned medium was used. When ethanolamine was added to cells in conditioned medium to quench PS formation through the exchange of free serine with the ethanolamine moiety of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), PS labelling was decreased by 33% and the inhibitory TPA effect was significantly decreased. On the other hand, ethanolamine had marginal quenching effect on PS labelling when added to cells in fresh medium. TPA increased the phosphorylation of various proteins in the cells, including protein lb (Mr 80,000; pI 5.5) shown to be localized mainly in the nuclear fraction. Chlorobenzoic acid selectively stimulated the phosphorylation of protein lb, whereas CAT and SOD specifically attenuated the TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of this protein. All these agents affected phosphorylation of protein lb only if conditioned medium was used. The findings suggested that net synthesis of PS through the base-exchange mechanism was stimulated in HL60 cells by cell products present in the conditioned medium. TPA inhibited this stimulated PS synthesis by a mechanism which appeared to involve active oxygen species and protein synthesis and might be related to the phosphorylation of protein lb.","['Kiss, Z', 'Deli, E', 'Kuo, J F']","['Kiss Z', 'Deli E', 'Kuo JF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Chlorobenzoates)', '0 (Ethanolamines)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '5KV86114PT (Ethanolamine)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'IC7888DF4L (4-chlorobenzoic acid)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorobenzoates/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Ethanolamine', 'Ethanolamines/pharmacology', 'Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1987/12/15 00:00,1987/12/15 00:01,['1987/12/15 00:00'],"['1987/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1987 Dec 15;248(3):649-56. doi: 10.1042/bj2480649.,"['CA-36777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-15696/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-17608/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1042/bj2480649 [doi]'],PMC1148598,"['Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",,,,,,,,,

The major target for antifolate development has been dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), but other critical folate-dependent enzymes, i.e., thymidylate synthase, methionine synthetase, and folylpolyglutamate synthetase are also important targets for new antifolate development. The possibility that DHFR from tumor tissue differs significantly from normal tissue DHFR now seems improbable, and the ideas of the late Bill Baker to design specific inhibitors of the tumor enzyme vs. the normal tissue DHFR are unlikely to succeed. However, the experience with triazinate (Baker's antifol; TZT) indicates that transport of antifols could be exploited to provide selective toxicity, as well as to provide agents effective vs. MTX-resistant cells. This work led to a second generation of ""nonclassical"" folate antagonists, of which trimetrexate (JB-11; TMQ) is now in clinical trial. Uptake of TMQ is via an MTX-independent membrane system, and extremely high intracellular levels of this drug are achieved in human leukemia cells.","['Bertino, J R', 'Sobrero, A', 'Mini, E', 'Moroson, B A', 'Cashmore, A']","['Bertino JR', 'Sobrero A', 'Mini E', 'Moroson BA', 'Cashmore A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,NCI Monogr,NCI monographs : a publication of the National Cancer Institute,8610384,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Biological Transport', 'Drug Resistance', '*Folic Acid Antagonists/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Prodrugs/therapeutic use', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,NCI Monogr. 1987;(5):87-91.,"['CA-08010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.']",,,,,,,,,

One of these compounds, the Orn analog of AMT, is the most potent FPGS inhibitor we have found to date. A model to account for the fact that side-chain analogs containing a basic and those containing an acidic terminal group can both competitively inhibit FPGS is proposed. According to this model, binding may involve interaction of an acidic terminal group on the inhibitor with a positively charged active-site residue to which the gamma-carboxyl of the folate-antifolate substrate normally binds. It may also involve the interaction of a basic terminal group on the inhibitor with a different active-site residue which is negatively rather than positively charged and to which the alpha-amino group of the incoming Glu cosubstrate must bind before an amide bond to the gamma-carboxyl of the folate-antifolate can form. The 2 oppositely charged active-site residues assumed to take part in this binding are probably situated near each other and at approximately the same distance from the pteridine-binding site. The ability of compounds to inhibit both DHFR and FPGS makes it possible in principle for such compounds to kill cells via a ""self-potentiation"" mechanism in which inhibition of tetrahydrofolate synthesis is complemented by interference with the subsequent conversion of tetrahydrofolates to their polyglutamate conjugates. Possible exploitation of this mechanism to overcome MTX resistance is considered.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Moran, R G', 'Freisheim, J H', 'Bader, H', 'Forsch, R A', 'Solan, V C']","['Rosowsky A', 'Moran RG', 'Freisheim JH', 'Bader H', 'Forsch RA', 'Solan VC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,NCI Monogr,NCI monographs : a publication of the National Cancer Institute,8610384,"['0 (Aminobutyrates)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'H8B59H10OK (2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminobutyrates', 'Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Folic Acid Antagonists/chemical synthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine/analogs & derivatives', 'Peptide Synthases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,NCI Monogr. 1987;(5):145-52.,"['CA-25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,"['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",,,,,,,,,

In C57BL/6 mice, the virus did not replicate in adults up to 40 weeks of age, but beyond that there was a steep exponential increase with age in the amounts of SFFV recoverable. In C3H/He mice, which replicate the virus as young adults, the amount of SFFV recovered was 6-fold greater in old than in young mice. Recovery of virus was biphasic with age in SJL mice; in A strain mice no consistent change with age was noted. In C57BL/6 mice, reconstitution of lethally irradiated recipients with syngeneic marrow cells, followed by i.v. infection with FV, showed that the amounts of SFFV recovered depended on the age of the recipient. The present work shows that Friend SFFV replication is a sensitive indicator and can be used as a tool for the investigation of aging processes.

During exponential growth continuous labeling with tritiated thymidine indicated a growth fraction of unity, whereas the growth fraction was about 30% during growth restriction. At this growth phase the majority of cells with S phase DNA content remained unlabeled after pulse labeling with tritiated thymidine or uridine, indicating that both the ""salvage"" and the ""de novo"" DNA synthesis pathways were blocked in most S-phase cells. After pulse labeling with tritiated thymidine the DNA synthesis rate pattern was investigated by sorting of consecutive fractions of cells throughout the S phase followed by quantitative autoradiography. With exception of a reduced rate in the middle of S phase, the DNA synthesis rate increased as the cells progressed through S phase during exponential growth.

It was selective in that it also inhibited the proliferation of myeloid but not that of lymphatic mouse leukaemia cells. Even at strong (greater than 60%) inhibition of the formation of cell clones (colonies + clusters) the colony-to-cluster ratio (CClR) remained as in the controls. The data point to a long-lasting and selective effect of the inhibitor on the GM-CFC without influence on the proliferation of its progeny. This conclusion is confirmed by the temporal development of the inhibitory effect in the course of culture.

Constancy under standardized conditions and alteration in tumour-bearing mice and by various inhibitors added in vitro.,581-6,"The growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFC) from mouse bone marrow was studied in agar cultures in glass capillaries. Under standard conditions with normal bone marrow a specific total number of cell clones (colonies + clusters) and also a specific colony-to-cluster ratio (CClR) was found for each of 4 different mouse strains. Both parameters were studied in tumour-bearing mice and found to be influenced independently and, in part, in an opposite way. Thus, for bone marrow of mice with the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma an inhibition of clone formation was found whereas the growth of those clones still formed was stimulated (only colonies present). ""Natural"" inhibitors as present in uraemic serum added to the cultures decreased the number of clones without altering the CClR. The same is true for the inhibitors in CSF-containing endotoxin serum. On the other hand, inhibitors such as spermine or the synthetic 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine depressed the clone formation as well as the growth rate of the clones (relative increase of clusters and decrease of colonies). It is concluded that the sensitivity of the GM-CFC against various influences may differ from that of the cells in the clones they form; therefore, the determination of the CClR will provide a more refined interpretation of influences on the haematopoietic system.","['Schunck, H', 'Schutt, M', 'Langen, P']","['Schunck H', 'Schutt M', 'Langen P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Biomed Biochim Acta,Biomedica biochimica acta,8304435,"['0 (Culture Media)', '9002-18-0 (Agar)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agar', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Reference Values', 'Species Specificity']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Biochim Acta. 1987;46(7):581-6.,,,,"['Academy of Sciences of the GDR, Department of Cell Kinetics, Berlin-Buch.']",,,,,,,,,

After this, the pools recovered to 60% of control by 48 h, apparently because of an increase in AdoMet synthetase activity. Both AdoMet depletion and the accompanying increase in synthetase activity were substantially enhanced by lowering methionine concentrations in the media from 100 microM to 30 microM, the minimal concentration that supports cell growth at control values. During a 4 h incubation in media containing 30 microM-methionine, 1-5 mM-L-cisAMB depleted cellular AdoMet to undetectable values, and inhibited nucleic acid methylation by 44-72% and RNA methylation by 60-87%. Under these same treatment conditions, putrescine pools increased by about 3-fold, whereas spermidine pools decreased by only 20% and spermine pools remained the same. Pool changes were accompanied by a 2-4-fold increase in ornithine decarboxylase activities and AdoMet activities. Thus the rapid depletion of AdoMet pools by L-cisAMB results immediately in a decrease in methyl-transfer reactions involving nucleic acids, whereas, by contrast, biosynthesis of higher polyamines appears to be minimally affected, owing to compensatory increases in key enzyme activities.","['Kramer, D L', 'Sufrin, J R', 'Porter, C W']","['Kramer DL', 'Sufrin JR', 'Porter CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Aminobutyrates)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Polyamines)', '35891-72-6 (2-amino-4-methoxy-3-butenoic acid)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.5.1.6 (Methionine Adenosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Aminobutyrates/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Methionine Adenosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acids/*metabolism', 'Polyamines/*biosynthesis', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*metabolism']",1987/10/15 00:00,1987/10/15 00:01,['1987/10/15 00:00'],"['1987/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1987 Oct 15;247(2):259-65. doi: 10.1042/bj2470259.,"['CA-09072/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1042/bj2470259 [doi]'],PMC1148403,"['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",,,,,,,,,

Out of the 49 patients, 17 (35%) had evidence of platelet clumping which, however, occurred in an unpredictable manner from time to time. Platelet clumping thus provides a confounding factor when automated platelet counts are used to monitor effects of cytotoxic treatment in this type of disorders.

Fifty-three specimens (21 cerebrospinal fluids, 1 ventricular fluid, 2 brain cyst fluids, 12 needle washings, 15 imprints, 1 subdural fluid and 1 post-shunt fluid) were obtained from 21 gliomas, 2 meningiomas, 1 pineoblastoma, 11 metastatic tumors, 3 lymphomas, 1 leukemia and 14 cases without tumor. alpha-GFAP stained all 21 gliomas and 5 of 5 cases containing reactive brain fragments. UJ13A had a reactivity pattern similar to that of alpha-GFAP, but also stained the meningiomas, pineoblastoma, oat-cell carcinoma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. B72.3 stained all adenocarcinomas and the large-cell carcinoma. 2D1 stained lymphoma and leukemia, all inflammatory cells and 4 of 12 glioblastomas.

The primary sites of origin were the breast, kidney, colon and stomach as well as lymphoma. The cytologic features observed in the aspiration biopsy material from the six cases were characteristic of each of the primary tumors. Three of the patients had had prior resections of carcinomas (breast, colon and stomach) while in three patients the cytologic diagnosis of the thyroid aspirates led to the discovery of the primary tumor (kidney and two lymphomas). One case of lymphoma/leukemia and one case of previously biopsied lung carcinoma were confirmed on clinical grounds. It is of critical importance that primary thyroid neoplasms occurring in patients known to have primary tumors elsewhere be distinguished from disseminated tumors involving the thyroid. Our experience suggests that fine needle aspiration is of considerable value in this differential diagnosis.

Thus the chronic and acute myeloid leukaemias, thrombocythaemia, megakaryocytic myelosis, myelofibrosis, the myelodysplastic syndromes and some cases of aplastic anaemia may be viewed as variants of a single disease process. This view is useful in explaining the common occurrence of mixed forms of disease or interconversions between the myeloproliferative diseases. This variability is a consequence of the development of all the haematopoietic lineages from a single class of haematopoietic stem cell by progressive differentiation. The aetiology of the myeloproliferative diseases in the domestic animals is uncertain but feline leukaemia virus infection has been implicated in the cat. These conditions may be classified as aplastic anaemia, as preleukaemic dysplastic conditions with variable cytopenias and morphological abnormalities of blood cells, as smouldering leukaemias, or as leukaemias with a frankly leukaemic blood or bone marrow.","['Evans, R J', 'Gorman, N T']","['Evans RJ', 'Gorman NT']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Vet Rec,The Veterinary record,0031164,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/classification/*etiology/pathology', 'Cats', 'Dog Diseases/classification/*etiology/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification/etiology/pathology/*veterinary']",1987/11/07 00:00,1987/11/07 00:01,['1987/11/07 00:00'],"['1987/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Rec. 1987 Nov 7;121(19):437-43. doi: 10.1136/vr.121.19.437.,,['10.1136/vr.121.19.437 [doi]'],,"['Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Cambridge.']",,,,,,,,,

TTRS is all the more extensive according to bone marrow invasion or in IgA or light chain myeloma, all of which are especially destructive of bone.

Thus these results indicate that the nontoxic polysaccharide derivative has properties equivalent to the toxic endotoxin in enhancing the antibody responsiveness of FLV-suppressed spleen cells to a T-cell-dependent antigen like SRBC.,"['Friedman, H', 'Butler, R C', 'Nowotny, A']","['Friedman H', 'Butler RC', 'Nowotny A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Although chromosome 22 translocation breakpoints in CML virtually always occur within the 5.8-kilobase (kb) bcr, chromosome 9 breakpoints have been identified within the known limits of ABL in only a few instances. For a better understanding of the variability of the breakpoints on chromosome 9, we studied the CML cell line BV173. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), large-scale maps of the t(9;22) junctions were constructed. The chromosome 9 breakpoint was shown to have occurred within an ABL intron, 160 kb upstream of the v-abl homologous sequences, but still 35 kb downstream of the 5'-most ABL exon. bcr-ABL and ABL-bcr fusion genes were demonstrated on the Ph1 and the 9q+ chromosomes, respectively; both of these genes are expressed. These results suggest that the 9;22 translocation breakpoints in CML consistently occur within the limits of the large ABL gene. RNA splicing, sometimes of very large regions, appears to compensate for the variability in breakpoint location. These studies show that PFGE is a powerful new tool for the analysis of chromosomal translocations in human malignancies.","['Westbrook, C A', 'Rubin, C M', 'Carrino, J J', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Bernards, A', 'Rowley, J D']","['Westbrook CA', 'Rubin CM', 'Carrino JJ', 'Le Beau MM', 'Bernards A', 'Rowley JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['*Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Electrophoresis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Mar;71(3):697-702.,"['CA-09273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07190/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)78143-7 [pii]'],,"['University of Chicago, Department of Medicine, IL 60637.']",,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow hypercellularity was present at the time of diagnosis in all patients, although the median peripheral leukocyte count was 2,600/microL. A second course of induction therapy consisting of further ara-C and anthracycline was initiated 15 days after the start of treatment if bone marrow hypocellularity could not be documented. Karyotypic analysis of bone marrow blasts was performed on 15 of 34 patients; 11 of 15 had abnormalities in chromosomes 15 and/or 17. Twenty-nine of 34 (85%) patients had laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Of the 29 patients surviving 14 days, 24 (83%) received a second course of induction therapy. Complete remission was achieved in 25 of 34 (74%) patients, with four of 25 (16%) requiring one course of induction chemotherapy and 21 of 25 (84%) receiving two courses. Bone marrow specimens obtained 15 days after the start of therapy from the 25 patients who eventually attained complete remission showed the continued presence of dysplastic promyelocytes in 21 cases; three specimens were technically inadequate and only one was truly devoid of promyelocytes. Seventeen of 25 (68%) patients still had persistence of abnormal bone marrow promyelocytes seven or more days after the second course of therapy. Patients in complete remission received various forms of postremission therapy. Ten of the 25 (40%) completely responding patients remain alive in continuous complete remission. Neither the absence of bone marrow hypocellularity nor the persistence of dysplastic promyelocytes during induction exerted any influence on the probability for survival. These findings confirm and extend prior reports that complete remission in APL, in contrast to other subtypes of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), can frequently be achieved without bone marrow aplasia. Whether this observation signifies that complete remission in APL is due to leukemic cell differentiation or selective cytotoxicity is unknown. The absence of therapy-induced bone marrow hypoplasia in APL is not an absolute indication of induction failure or a poor ultimate prognosis.","['Stone, R M', 'Maguire, M', 'Goldberg, M A', 'Antin, J H', 'Rosenthal, D S', 'Mayer, R J']","['Stone RM', 'Maguire M', 'Goldberg MA', 'Antin JH', 'Rosenthal DS', 'Mayer RJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/complications', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Mar;71(3):690-6.,"['1RO1-CA 42802-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5RO1-CA 34183-0351/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 07623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['S0006-4971(20)78142-5 [pii]'],,"['Division of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",,,,,,,,,

In contrast, treatment of tumor-injected (iv) mice with cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, and methotrexate increased survival time by only a few days; and treatment of mice with cisplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin, bleomycin, or etoposide was ineffective.

I. (1985) Cancer Res. 45, 5159-5164). Antipeptide antibodies were prepared that specifically recognize the alpha, beta, and gamma isozymes of protein kinase C in rat brain cytosol and HL-60 cell extracts. The three isozymes do not share a common tissue distribution pattern. The gamma enzyme is abundant in brain but a relatively minor component in HL-60 cells; the opposite is true for the alpha enzyme. All three isozymes increase at least 2-fold in abundance in HL-60 cells exposed to 1.2% dimethyl sulfoxide for 48 h. The increase in abundance of the alpha and beta isoforms reaches 7- and 5-fold, respectively, by 96 h without further increase in the abundance of the gamma isozyme. Similarly, all three isozymes increase at least 1.5-fold in abundance after 48 h and 3-fold after 96 h with 1 microM retinoic acid. No further increase in the abundance of any of the isozymes is seen between 96 and 144 h of incubation with retinoic acid. The increase in protein kinase C activity is not limited to the cytosolic forms of the enzyme; a parallel increase in membrane-associated protein kinase C is also observed during differentiation. Approximately 10% of total protein kinase C activity is membrane-associated in both control and differentiating cells. These studies provide the first immunochemical evidence that all three protein kinase C isozymes increase during HL-60 cell differentiation, and they suggest that the increase in the isozyme levels may be coordinately regulated.","['Makowske, M', 'Ballester, R', 'Cayre, Y', 'Rosen, O M']","['Makowske M', 'Ballester R', 'Cayre Y', 'Rosen OM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/03/05 00:00,1988/03/05 00:01,['1988/03/05 00:00'],"['1988/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Mar 5;263(7):3402-10.,"['AM35158/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43225-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM34555/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)69085-4 [pii]'],,"['Program in Molecular Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Research Center, New York, New York 10021.']",,,,,,,,,

Transcription was measured by pulse labeling of whole cell RNA with [3H]uridine, and translation by labeling whole cell protein synthesis with [3H]leucine. Induction with dimethyl sulfoxide led to increased transcription of alpha, beta ma, and beta mi genes, and the proportion of beta mi RNA synthesized was similar to the proportion of beta mi globin protein produced, whether the cells produced 30-40% beta mi (lines 745 and 9M) or greater than 80% beta mi (clone 25-66). Induction with hemin did not lead to increased globin gene transcription in any line, although globin protein synthesis did increase. Thus, the mechanism of beta globin chain induction depends on the inducing agent, and not on the cell line or the type of beta globin gene product. The relative proportion of beta mi and beta ma globin chain proteins reflects the relative transcription of the two beta genes, whether or not transcription increased following induction.","['Ganguly, S', 'Skoultchi, A I', 'Garrick, M D', 'Garrick, L M', 'Campbell, A S', 'Alter, B P']","['Ganguly S', 'Skoultchi AI', 'Garrick MD', 'Garrick LM', 'Campbell AS', 'Alter BP']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Recombinant/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1988/03/05 00:00,1988/03/05 00:01,['1988/03/05 00:00'],"['1988/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Mar 5;263(7):3216-9.,"['AM26956/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)69057-X [pii]'],,"['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']",,,,,,,,,

By indirect immunofluorescence, antibody FB2 produced bright nucleolar staining in a variety of malignant tumors, including cancers of the breast, liver, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, blood, lymph system, lung, and brain. Although specific nucleolar immunofluorescence was not detectable in most normal tissues, it was detectable in some proliferating nonmalignant tissues including spermatogonia of the testes, ductal regions of hypertrophied prostates, and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. The Mr 120,000 antigen was not detectable in 48-h serum-deprived HeLa cells but was readily detectable (within 30 min) following serum refeeding. The Mr 120,000 antigen was not detected in retinoic acid-treated HL-60 cells following morphological differentiation but was detectable in 48-h phytohemagglutinin-treated lymphocytes.

Hepatic microsomal heme oxygenase activity is increased 50-100% in tumor bearing nu/nu mice when compared with normal controls.

Unlike the theta 1-globin genes of the rabbit and galago, the structure of these genes in the orangutan and baboon and their flanking regions show no apparent defects that would prevent their expression. Both theta 1-globin genes are split into three exons with the potential to code for a polypeptide of length 141 amino acids. Besides differing by 26% in replacement-site substitutions, the theta 1 and alpha 1-globin genes of the orangutan and baboon also differ in their promoter structures, in the use of TGA versus TAA as the termination codon, and in the use of AGTAAA versus AATAAA as the polyadenylation signal. In contrast, the two theta 1-globin genes from primates only differ by 1.7% in the replacement-site substitutions. Here we present the complete DNA sequence of a cloned theta 1-globin gene of humans, and show that it contains no apparent defects that would abolish its expression. Furthermore, by primer extension of single-stranded oligonucleotide probes, we show that the theta 1-globin gene of humans is transcribed in an erythroleukemia cell line K562.

In the present study, 40 children in continuous complete remission from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were given a battery of tests to assess memory functioning 5 years after CNS prophylaxis. All children were free of CNS disease at diagnosis and had been randomly assigned to receive CNS prophylaxis with either 1,800 cGy cranial irradiation (CRT) plus intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) or IT MTX plus intravenous (IV) high-dose MTX (HDMTX).

To examine the cellular site(s) of NE gene expression, a 0.65-kilobase cDNA (pPB15) complementary to the coding region of the NE gene was cloned from the cell line U937 using an oligonucleotide based on the known NE protein sequence. The sequence of pPB15 demonstrated that it coded for the 173 C-terminal residues of the 218 amino acids that comprise the mature NE protein, plus an additional 3' 60 base pairs prior to the in-frame stop codon, suggesting the NE mRNA contains sequences for a 20-residue C-terminal ""pro"" peptide that is not found in the mature protein. Northern analysis using 32P-labeled pPB15 as a probe revealed that neutrophils do not contain detectable NE mRNA transcripts despite the fact that this cell carries large amounts of this protein. Furthermore, resting and activated blood monocytes also contained no detectable NE mRNA transcripts, although these cells also carry detectable NE. In contrast, bone marrow precursor cells contained NE transcripts, suggesting the NE gene is expressed in blood precursor cells. In this regard, evaluation of HL-60 cells, a human cell line with myelomonocytic lineage features, demonstrated NE transcripts in resting cells and increased NE mRNA levels when the cells were induced toward the myelocytic lineage with dimethyl sulfoxide. However, when the HL-60 cells were induced toward the monocytic lineage with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, NE transcripts were lost even though transcripts for interleukin-1 beta were plentiful. Together, these observations are consistent with the concept that the NE gene is not expressed in the blood cells that carry the protein, but in bone marrow precursors that express NE transcripts about the time of commitment to the myelocytic series.","['Takahashi, H', 'Nukiwa, T', 'Basset, P', 'Crystal, R G']","['Takahashi H', 'Nukiwa T', 'Basset P', 'Crystal RG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Pancreatic Elastase/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1988/02/15 00:00,1988/02/15 00:01,['1988/02/15 00:00'],"['1988/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Feb 15;263(5):2543-7.,,['S0021-9258(18)69241-5 [pii]'],,"['Pulmonary Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,['GENBANK/J03545'],,,,,,,

In the continuous presence of PMA or PDBu, the rate of transcription of c-myc decreased to 20% of control within 2 h and was maintained at 20-30% of the control level for the ensuing 24 h. Cell-permeable sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), a diacylglycerol analogue, also caused a rapid decrease in c-myc transcription. The decrease in the transcription of c-myc induced by diC8 or PDBu was reversible; prolonged exposure of the cells to either agent for periods greater than 2 h was necessary to maintain the transcription of c-myc below the control rate. With both PDBu and diC8, there was a close correlation between the concentration dependence for binding to the phorbol ester receptor and the concentration dependence for inhibition of c-myc transcription. The decrease in transcription of c-myc induced by PDBu or diC8 appeared to be due to a block of elongation of the nascent mRNA beyond exon 1. The results of this study suggest that prolonged stimulation of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) is required for persistent inhibition of transcription of c-myc in HL-60 cells.","['Salehi, Z', 'Taylor, J D', 'Niedel, J E']","['Salehi Z', 'Taylor JD', 'Niedel JE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Diglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/02/05 00:00,1988/02/05 00:01,['1988/02/05 00:00'],"['1988/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Feb 5;263(4):1898-903.,['CA35680/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['S0021-9258(19)77962-9 [pii]'],,"['Department of Pharmacology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",,,,,,,,,

The two major findings of this study were elevated serum levels of total cholesterol and a strong increase in serum triglycerides. The former change was due to an increase in alpha-cholesterol and could not be attributed to L-asparaginase because it was also found following protocol BFM 83 before the administration of the drug. Elevations of total triglycerides were due to high levels of exogenous chylomicron bound triglycerides and were limited in occurrence almost exclusively to the period of L-asparaginase monotherapy.

Evidence for an extensive homology to other Arg-Gly-Asp adhesion receptors.,87-93,"Platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb is one of the two subunits of the common platelet adhesion receptor, GPIIb-IIIa. The isolation, characterization and sequencing of cDNA clones encoding for the two polypeptide chains of GPIIb are described. A number of clones were isolated from lambda gt11 libraries constructed with mRNA from an erythroleukemic cell line, HEL, and human megakaryocytes. Two of these clones, lambda IIb1, from HEL cells, and lambda IIb2, from megakaryocytes, cross-hybridized and were selected for detailed analysis. The identification of these as authentic GPIIb clones was based on immunological criteria and confirmed by the presence of nucleotide sequences in each insert encoding for known protein sequences of platelet GPIIb. These clones contained inserts of 1.54 kb and 1.39 kb, respectively, with an overlapping sequence of 801 bp. The nucleotide sequence of the overlapping region was identical indicating that HEL cells produce a protein closely related, if not identical, to platelet GPIIb. The determined nucleotide sequence of two inserts included a coding sequence for 648 amino acid residues, a TAG stop codon and 185 nucleotides of 3' non-coding sequence followed by a poly(A) tail. The coding sequence contained a portion of the heavy chain, the junction between the heavy and light chains and the entire light chain including a potential transmembrane-spanning domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. When these cDNA were used to probe for GPIIb mRNA, a single mRNA species of 3.9 kb was identified in both HEL cells and human megakaryocytes. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence for GPIIb with those of the alpha subunit of the vitronectin and the fibronectin receptors revealed extensive homologies. These homologies further establish that GPIIb-IIIa from platelets, together with the vitronectin and the fibronectin receptors, are members of a supergene family of adhesion receptors with a recognition specificity for Arg-Gly-Asp amino acid sequences.","['Uzan, G', 'Frachet, P', 'Lajmanovich, A', 'Prandini, M H', 'Denarier, E', 'Duperray, A', 'Loftus, J', 'Ginsberg, M', 'Plow, E', 'Marguerie, G']","['Uzan G', 'Frachet P', 'Lajmanovich A', 'Prandini MH', 'Denarier E', 'Duperray A', 'Loftus J', 'Ginsberg M', 'Plow E', 'Marguerie G']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Surface/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1988 Jan 15;171(1-2):87-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1988.tb13762.x.,"['HL 16411/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 28235/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1988.tb13762.x [doi]'],,"['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 217, Departement de Recherches Fondamentales, Grenoble, France.']",,['GENBANK/X06831'],,,,,,,

The in vitro growth of total normal and CML granulocyte/macrophage colony forming unit (CFU-GM) populations were compared with early and intermediate (HLA-DR positive) CFU-GM derived from the same marrows. The absolute number of total CML CFU-GM exceeded the number generated by normal marrow through 7 days of culture due entirely to an excess of CML CFU-GM with limited proliferative capacity. Unlike normal colonies, relatively few of the leukemic colonies grew to a large size; the early and intermediate (HLA-DR positive) CML progenitors also exhibited limited proliferative capacity compared to normal. Highly enriched progenitor populations were prepared, and it was observed that the primitive (small) CML CFU-GM also had greatly reduced proliferative potential compared to primitive normal progenitors, but rather behaved similarly to normal mature (large) CFU-GM. Similarly, CML erythroid burst forming units were at a more advanced stage of maturation than normal erythroid burst forming units as evidenced by their reduced proliferative capacity, the observation that a reduced proportion required burst promoting activity to enable them to respond to erythropoietin and the observation that a larger fraction than normal could sustain a limited period of erythropoietin deprivation in the absence of burst promoting activity. Based on these findings and supporting evidence from our previous studies and those reported by other investigators, it is concluded that the dominance of the leukemic population is not due to unregulated proliferation but rather to discordant maturation resulting in expansion in the later maturational compartments which are not under strict regulatory control.","['Strife, A', 'Lambek, C', 'Wisniewski, D', 'Wachter, M', 'Gulati, S C', 'Clarkson, B D']","['Strife A', 'Lambek C', 'Wisniewski D', 'Wachter M', 'Gulati SC', 'Clarkson BD']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Reference Values']",1988/02/15 00:00,1988/02/15 00:01,['1988/02/15 00:00'],"['1988/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Feb 15;48(4):1035-41.,"['CA 19117/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['Laboratory of Hematopoietic Cell Kinetics, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, New York.']",['Cancer Res 1988 Jun 1;48(11):3298'],,,,,,,,

In nine of the 31 children, more than two febrile episodes apparently attributable to VCR during maintenance therapy were identified. No such episodes were found to have occurred during induction therapy. The median age at diagnosis of these nine children was 3.2 +/- 1.6 years, significantly lower than the 6.8 +/- 4 years of the other 22 children (P less than 0.01). No significant difference was observed between these two groups in laboratory data obtained before the VCR injections, and the drugs used in combination with VCR were apparently unrelated to the incidence of febrile episodes. All of these febrile episodes began within 24 hours after VCR injection. Peak levels of 38 degrees C to 39 degrees C occurred 6 to 24 hours after onset. The episodes also were accompanied by mild, general fatigue and a loss of appetite. They ranged in duration from half of a day to 4 days, but those persisting more than 3 days occurred in three of the five children whose regimens did not include corticosteroid. The results thus suggest that fever is an immediate reaction to the toxicity of VCR in young children, and that the duration of fever can be shortened by combining VCR with corticosteroid.","['Ishii, E', 'Hara, T', 'Mizuno, Y', 'Ueda, K']","['Ishii E', 'Hara T', 'Mizuno Y', 'Ueda K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects']",1988/02/15 00:00,1988/02/15 00:01,['1988/02/15 00:00'],"['1988/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Feb 15;61(4):660-2. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880215)61:4<660::aid-cncr2820610407>3.0.co;2-2.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19880215)61:4<660::aid-cncr2820610407>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

Although most of these AML cases (n = 18) were of poorly differentiated (M1) type; 5 cases of AML showing features of granulocytic differentiation (M2) were also found to be TdT-positive. Even though TdT was generally more strongly expressed in the M1 group and associated with other markers of myeloid immaturity (Ia positive and lack of chloroacetate esterase), there was no inverse relationship with Sudan black or myeloperoxidase activity. In addition, although the proportion of AML-M1 cases with increased TdT-positive cells was slightly higher (18/95, 19%) than for the AML-M2 group (5/34, 15%) the results suggest that the presence of nuclear TdT in leukaemic myeloblasts may not only reflect cellular immaturity but may also be due to maturational asynchrony in otherwise well-differentiated blasts.","['Stark, A N', 'MacKarill, I D', 'Limbert, H J', 'Evans, P', 'Scott, C S']","['Stark AN', 'MacKarill ID', 'Limbert HJ', 'Evans P', 'Scott CS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/analysis/*pathology', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*blood', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*enzymology/pathology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1988 Jan;56(1):33-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00321057.,,['10.1007/BF00321057 [doi]'],,"['Department of Hematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of these labeled cells with the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), induces rapid generation of [3H]phosphatidic acid (PA) and slower formation of [3H]diglyceride, suggesting hydrolysis of alkyl-PC by PLD. A unique feature of PLD is its ability to transfer the phosphatidyl moiety of phospholipids to alcohols (transphosphatidylation). This characteristic has been exploited to identify PLD activity. For example, when ethanol is present during stimulation of the HL-60 cells, [3H]phosphatidylethanol (PEt) is formed with a concomitant decrease in [3H]PA. Cells incubated with [32P]orthophosphate to label the terminal phosphate of ATP do not incorporate 32P into PEt, consistent with the [3H]PEt not being synthesized from [3H]diglyceride. In contrast, [3H]PA arises from both PLD and diglyceride kinase activities. Furthermore, PEt synthesis closely parallels PA formation and both are inhibited by an fMLP receptor antagonist, suggesting that both PA and PEt are derived from agonist-stimulated PLD action. These observations are consistent with phospholipase D-catalyzed breakdown of alkyl-PC in fMLP- stimulated granulocytes.","['Pai, J K', 'Siegel, M I', 'Egan, R W', 'Billah, M M']","['Pai JK', 'Siegel MI', 'Egan RW', 'Billah MM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerophospholipids)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (phosphatidylethanol)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '67247-12-5 (t-butyloxycarbonyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)']",IM,"['Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Ethanol/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Glycerophospholipids', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphatidic Acids/biosynthesis', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Phospholipid Ethers/metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1988 Jan 15;150(1):355-64. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(88)90528-1.,,"['0006-291X(88)90528-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(88)90528-1 [doi]']",,"['Department of Allergy and Inflammation, Schering-Plough Corporation, Bloomfield, NJ 07003.']",,,,,,,,,

L. Smith, I. G. Macara, R. Levenson, D. Housman, and L. Cantley. J. Biol. Chem. 257: 773-780, 1982).

In our experiments, as in those of Lubin (J. Cell. Physiol. 124: 539-544, 1985), amiloride itself did not inhibit MEL cell differentiation. However, we did find that the amiloride analogue phenamil reversibly inhibits dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced MEL cell commitment to differentiate with a K1/2 of 2.5-5.0 microM (in plasma clot assay). At an extracellular concentration of 15 microM, phenamil inhibits commitment to differentiate by approximately 90% in the plasma clot assay while having a minimal effect on growth. Phenamil is not metabolized but is rapidly taken up by MEL cells. Phenamil was most effective as an inhibitor when present during the first 12 h of DMSO treatment, indicating that phenamil affects the early commitment process rather than later steps involved in hemoglobin synthesis. Phenamil does not, however, inhibit the early differentiation-induced decrease in [Na+]i and the concomitant drop in the Na+-K+ pump rate. A specific binding site for phenamil is suggested because some analogues in which the phenamil structure is slightly modified are unable to inhibit differentiation.","['Lannigan, D A', 'Bennington, J B', 'Cragoe, E J Jr', 'Knauf, P A']","['Lannigan DA', 'Bennington JB', 'Cragoe EJ Jr', 'Knauf PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['2038-35-9 (phenylamil)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amiloride/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism']",1988/01/11 19:15,1988/01/11 19:16,['1988/01/11 19:15'],"['1988/01/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '1988/01/11 19:16 [medline]', '1988/01/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1988 Jan;254(1 Pt 1):C122-9. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1988.254.1.C122.,"['DK-27495/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1988.254.1.C122 [doi]'],,"['Department of Biophysics, University of Rochester, School of Medicine and Dentistry, New York 14642.']",,,,,,,,,

Interferon treatment resulted in a 100 to 1,000-fold inhibition of the multiplication of FLC in the liver and spleen and a marked increase in mean survival time. Small numbers of tumor cells persisted in the liver and spleen in some interferon-treated mice and could be recovered by bioassay several weeks after tumor inoculation. Most interferon-treated mice died with tumor in the ensuing months. Three of 34 interferon-treated mice were considered cured as they were alive at 386, 325 and 284 days after tumor inoculation. Daily treatment of tumor-inoculated mice with human recombinant interferons alpha D and alpha BDDD, which had antiviral activity on mouse cells in culture, also increased the survival time of mice injected i.v. with FLC. The use of the interferon-resistant 3C18 line of FLC suggests that the marked inhibition of development of established liver and spleen metastases was not due to a direct effect of interferon on the tumor cells, but was host-mediated.","['Gresser, I', 'Maury, C', 'Woodrow, D', 'Moss, J', 'Grutter, M G', 'Vignaux, F', 'Belardelli, F', 'Maunoury, M T']","['Gresser I', 'Maury C', 'Woodrow D', 'Moss J', 'Grutter MG', 'Vignaux F', 'Belardelli F', 'Maunoury MT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Liver/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology/*secondary/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Recombinant Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*secondary/therapy']",1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 Jan 15;41(1):135-42. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910410124.,,['10.1002/ijc.2910410124 [doi]'],,"['Department of Viral Oncology, Institut de Recherches Scientifiques sur le Cancer, Villejuif, France.']",,,,,,,,,

The contraction status of chromosomes was comparable in normal and Ph-positive metaphases. The reduction of sister chromatid exchange in leukemic cells was seen in all chromosome groups. The analysis of cell cycle specific proliferation according to the typical staining patterns of metaphases due to the number of cell cycles during which bromodesoxyuridine was substituted, revealed longer cell cycle times for the leukemic cells.","['Becher, R', 'Zimmer, G', 'Prescher, G', 'Schmidt, C G']","['Becher R', 'Zimmer G', 'Prescher G', 'Schmidt CG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Feb 1;48(3):745-50.,,,,"['Universitatsklinikum Essen, Westdeutsches Tumorzentrum, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,

In intact cells, the bryostatins induce some phorbol ester responses, such as neutrophil activation, but paradoxically they not only fail to induce other responses, e.g., differentiation in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, but actually block response to the phorbol esters. We compare here bryostatin I and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate as inhibitors of cell-cell communication in cultured primary mouse epidermal cells. Like phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, bryostatin I at nanomolar concentrations markedly inhibited cell coupling. It differed from the phorbol esters, however, in that its action was more transient. By 4 h of incubation bryostatin 1 caused little inhibition of coupling. Moreover, coincubation of bryostatin 1 and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate gave no greater response at this time than that found for bryostatin 1 alone. Time-dependent inhibition of the protein kinase C pathway could account for many of the observed differences between the actions of the phorbol esters and bryostatin 1.","['Pasti, G', 'Rivedal, E', 'Yuspa, S H', 'Herald, C L', 'Pettit, G R', 'Blumberg, P M']","['Pasti G', 'Rivedal E', 'Yuspa SH', 'Herald CL', 'Pettit GR', 'Blumberg PM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Communication/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Lactones/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Skin/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jan 15;48(2):447-51.,['CA-16019-07-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Molecular Mechanisms of Tumor Promotion Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,,

The data were analyzed with the aid of an isobologram using the concept of an envelope of additivity (G. G. Steel and M. J. Peckman, Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., 5:85-91, 1979). Simultaneous exposure of VCR and MTX produced subadditive or mutually protective interactions. Sequential exposure to VCR first followed immediately by MTX produced similar interactions. When the interval of VCR exposure first and then MTX was increased from 0 to 3, 8, and 24 h, the inhibition of cell growth moved from protection and subadditivity to additivity only. The reversed order of exposure to the 2 drugs produced an entirely different picture. Thus, when the interval of MTX exposure first followed by VCR increased from 0 to 3, 8, and 24 h, the inhibitory effects of the combination changed progressively from the area of subadditivity to the area of supraadditivity. When these data were evaluated using median effect plot analyses (T-C. Chou and P. Talalay. In: New Avenues in Developmental Cancer Chemotherapy, pp. 36-64. Orlando, FL: Academic Press, 1987), strongly synergistic interaction of this sequence at space intervals was confirmed. These data show that the synergistic effects were produced only when MTX was followed 8 or 24 h later by VCR. Other schedules were only additive or even antagonistic. Simultaneous exposure of VCR with daunorubicin, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, or bleomycin also had subadditive and protective effects. VCR, followed by daunorubicin with the interval of 24 h and vice versa, was again subadditive and protective. VCR, followed by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine with the interval of 24 h and vice versa, was again subadditive or additive only. Simultaneous and continuous exposures of VCR with vinblastine or L-asparaginase were only marginally supraadditive.","['Kano, Y', 'Ohnuma, T', 'Okano, T', 'Holland, J F']","['Kano Y', 'Ohnuma T', 'Okano T', 'Holland JF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jan 15;48(2):351-6.,['15936/PHS HHS/United States'],,,"['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029.']",,,,,,,,,

A retrospective study.,227-31,"In an attempt to rationalize the use of therapy in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) in elderly patients, 69 cases of primary AML in patients older than 60 years of age were reviewed retrospectively. Therapy was empirical and 12 patients received supportive care (SC) only, 35 received aggressive chemotherapy (AC), and 22 received low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LD-araC). Patients receiving SC only often had a poor Karnofski index and their median survival was 17 days. Aggressive chemotherapy yielded complete remissions (CR) in 48% of the patients, whereas 23% of the patients had resistant disease (RD) and 29% had other failures (OF). Low-dose araC, which was administered to patients significantly older than those receiving AC, yielded 23% CR, 68% RD, and 9% OF, with important hematologic toxicity in most patients. Median survival was 211 days in patients receiving AC and 235 days in patients treated with LD-araC. Survival beyond 2 years from diagnosis was noted in the AC group only.

Two consecutive maintenance therapy regimens were employed in patients who achieved complete remission (CR): (1) a classical maintenance with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, with DNR plus methyl-GAG re-inductions; (2) from 1982 an intensive sequential combination therapy regimen was administered. CR was achieved in 23 patients (68%). Only one patient had leukemic resistance. Other failures were a consequence of post-chemotherapy complications. A multivariate logistic regression analysis has been performed to evaluate the prognostic importance on response to remission induction of 25 patient and disease characteristics at diagnosis. The significant variables in decreasing order of significance were: serum albumin level, fever at diagnosis, serum creatinine level, and age. The median duration of remission and survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis were projected to be 24 and 25 months, respectively. Relapses occurred in 11 of 23 CR patients. Nine patients remained in the first remission from 5+ to 37+ months.

L1210 leukemia cells enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) or oleic acid (18:1) were incubated with radiolabeled or unlabeled doxorubicin. After equilibration the cells were ruptured and the subcellular fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient separation. The doxorubicin localized primarily in nuclei, as expected, but appreciable amounts were also detected in mitochondria and smaller amounts in plasma membranes, microsomes, and cytoplasm. Subcellular distribution of another anticancer drug which binds to DNA, mitoxantrone, was similar. There were increased amounts of doxorubicin contained in the nuclei and all organelles of the 22:6-enriched cells. Although polyunsaturated fatty acid modification influenced the total amount of doxorubicin in fractions, the relative distribution of drug among the fractions was not different from that of the 18:1-enriched and unmodified cells.

The inhibition is also completely relieved by cytidine in noncompetitive manner, but not by guanosine or uridine, indicating that the principal damage to the cellular economy resides in the amination of UTP to CTP. This was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of cell extracts, which showed a marked decrease in CTP with increases in the levels of UTP, GTP, and ATP. A major swelling of cells leading to lysis accompanies the inhibition and increases in DNA and protein per cell confirms this unbalanced growth.

Median survival was also shorter in AA ANLL than in AN and NN cases (P less than 0.01). Median survival was different according to karyotype abnormalities: 11q anomalies and t(15;17) were not associated with a good prognosis, and the t(8;21) is not associated with a particularly long median survival (16 months) when compared with other ANLL as opposed to the results of others.

To further localize sequences which are sufficient for packaging, we inserted various fragments from an MoMLV-based retroviral vector into a nonretroviral transcription unit, transfected these constructs into retrovirus-packaging cells, and measured packaging of RNA transcribed from these constructs into virions. Transcripts from some of these constructs were packaged at least as well as those from the parental vector or MoMLV itself.

Fifteen carcinogens were examined for genotoxic effects in mouse lymphoma, Salmonella, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosomal aberration, and CHO sister chromatid exchange assay. Eight of these were positive in all four assays. Of the seven noncarcinogens that were tested in these four assays, none was negative in all four. The main conclusion to be drawn from this study is that the mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, as performed and evaluated in this study, detects chemical mutagenicity in a manner that is highly consistent with other genetic endpoints as well as rodent carcinogenicity studies. Thus the assay quality control and response criteria established in this study led not only to a high degree of reproducibility but also to an apparently reliable detection of mutagenic activity.","['Caspary, W J', 'Daston, D S', 'Myhr, B C', 'Mitchell, A D', 'Rudd, C J', 'Lee, P S']","['Caspary WJ', 'Daston DS', 'Myhr BC', 'Mitchell AD', 'Rudd CJ', 'Lee PS']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,['0 (Mutagens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Clone Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', '*Mutagenicity Tests', '*Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Quality Control', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 1988;12 Suppl 13:195-229. doi: 10.1002/em.2860120506.,,['10.1002/em.2860120506 [doi]'],,"['Cellular and Genetic Toxicology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.']",,,,,,,,,

Quality-control guidelines for solvent controls, positive controls, and compound-treated cultures were developed based on analysis of over 800 experiments. Frequency distributions of experimental parameters of control cultures, such as mutant frequencies, cloning efficiencies, and suspension growths, were examined. Cloning efficiency and relative total growth affected the variability only when the test chemical was highly toxic. This information was used to generate the quality-control criteria, which were applied to an experiment before it was evaluated for a response. The response categories for classifying the effect of test chemicals on the assay system are defined in terms of (1) the statistically significant differences in average mutant frequency between solvent control cultures and cultures exposed to a chemical and (2) the trend of the dose-related responses.","['Caspary, W J', 'Lee, Y J', 'Poulton, S', 'Myhr, B C', 'Mitchell, A D', 'Rudd, C J']","['Caspary WJ', 'Lee YJ', 'Poulton S', 'Myhr BC', 'Mitchell AD', 'Rudd CJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Solvents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', '*Mutagenicity Tests', '*Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Quality Control', 'Solvents/standards', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 1988;12 Suppl 13:19-36. doi: 10.1002/em.2860120503.,,['10.1002/em.2860120503 [doi]'],,"['Cellular and Genetic Toxicology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.']",,,,,,,,,

Replicate treatments were used, and at least two independent experiments were performed for each test condition. The test conditions consisted of no exogenous activation, activation by Aroclor 1254-induced Fischer 344 rat liver S9 homogenate, and in some cases activation by noninduced Fischer 344 rat liver S9. The results were organized into tables that show the mutant colony counts, mutant frequency, and toxicity for each test chemical treatment, positive control treatment, and solvent negative control cultures. The repeat experiments were highly consistent and yielded contradictory evaluations for only a few of the chemicals studied. Fifty-one of the chemicals (81%) were evaluated as mutagenic under one or both of the test conditions. A range in minimum effective concentrations of almost 10(6)-fold (0.008 to 5,000 micrograms/ml) was observed among the mutagenic chemicals. Nine chemicals (14%) were considered to be nonmutagenic. Three chemicals (progesterone, p-rosaniline HCl, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane) gave responses that were not easily evaluated under any test condition: evidence for mutagenesis was obtained in some experiments but not for all repeat studies. Under nonactivation conditions, specifically, the mutagenic activities of 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone, progesterone, and p-rosaniline HCl remained uncertain. With S9 activation, uncertain evidence for mutagenesis was obtained for 2-naphthylamine, progesterone, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. In some cases, changes in the treatment conditions could lead to different evaluations of the mutagenic activity, and these possibilities are discussed in the descriptive evaluations of each chemical.

This increased uptake and consequent cytolytic efficacy observed in Dulbecco's phosphate buffer was more apparent in culture medium; under this physiologic condition the TCD50 concentration of PTT.119 was 5 times lower than L-PAM. PTT.119 entry into leukemia cells was examined using competition transport assays assessing the ability of the tripeptide to compete with various amino acids and nonmetabolizable substrates for carrier receptors of the L, A and ASC transport systems. A 1-min exposure to a 1- to 50-fold excess of PTT.119 prior to addition of radiolabeled substrates significantly reduced within 60 s both sodium-dependent and sodium-independent uptake of leucine, methionine, threonine and alpha-[1-14C]-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), but not MeAIB. In complimentary studies, L1210 cells were protected from PTT.119 cytolysis by an 8,000-fold excess of AIB, whereas beta-2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) only abrogated tripeptide cytotoxicity by 95-97% even at BCH:PTT.119 ratios of 200,000. Leucine and methionine protection were significantly less effective; the TCD50 of leucine and methionine were 3.23 and 2.4 microM, respectively, compared to 11.41 microM for AIB and 7.96 microM for BCH. In addition, MeAIB and phenylalanine were totally unable to protect L1210 cells from PTT.119-induced cytolysis. The data indicate that L121 cells actively transport PTT.119 primarily by the BCH-sensitive, AIB-sensitive, MeAIB-insensitive L carrier system. A second, BCH-insensitive, AIB-sensitive and MeAIB-insensitive carrier which is also involved in tripeptide uptake is probably the ASC system.","['Yagi, M J', 'Scanlon, K J', 'Chin, S E', 'Holland, J F', 'Bekesi, J G']","['Yagi MJ', 'Scanlon KJ', 'Chin SE', 'Holland JF', 'Bekesi JG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'IB1H345F24 (ambamustine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Amino Acids/*pharmacokinetics', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Melphalan/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Sodium/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 1988;34(3):235-47. doi: 10.1159/000238575.,['5P-30CA-23102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1159/000238575 [doi]'],,"['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, N.Y.']",,,,,,,,,

Histopathologic diagnosis.,716-20,"Candida hepatitis, usually a manifestation of disseminated candidiasis in immunocompromised patients, is difficult to diagnose antemortem. We studied six patients with proven hepatic candidiasis to assess features helpful in deriving a correct diagnosis. Five patients were immunosuppressed as a result for treatment for leukemia; one was immunosuppressed due to renal transplantation. All had sustained fevers greater than 101 degrees F, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and multiple hepatic and splenic defects--presumably abscesses--on abdominal CT scan. Twelve liver biopsies (nine needle, three wedge) were examined. Biopsies from four patients contained identifiable Candida organisms within suppurative granulomas; a biopsy from a fifth patient grew Candida albicans in cultures. In the sixth patient, the first biopsy was culture positive for Candida albicans, and the second biopsy, a fine-needle aspirate, contained Candida organisms and purulent material. In all of the nondiagnostic biopsies, as well as in regions of the diagnostic biopsies around the suppurative granulomas, mass-associated obstructive changes were noted. These included pericentral sinusoidal dilatation and cholestatic inflammation characterized by periportal ductular proliferation with surrounding neutrophils and edema. We conclude that in the appropriate clinical setting, these mass-associated histologic findings are suggestive of adjacent Candida abscesses. Definite diagnosis requires either the identification of Candida organisms within inflammatory hepatic lesions or positive culture of Candida from the liver biopsy.","['Johnson, T L', 'Barnett, J L', 'Appelman, H D', 'Nostrant, T']","['Johnson TL', 'Barnett JL', 'Appelman HD', 'Nostrant T']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Candida/isolation & purification', '*Candidiasis/microbiology', 'Female', 'Granuloma/microbiology/pathology', 'Hepatitis/*etiology/microbiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1988 Sep;12(9):716-20. doi: 10.1097/00000478-198809000-00008.,,['10.1097/00000478-198809000-00008 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Hospital, Ann Arbor.']",,,,,,,,,

A single-step propidium iodide exclusion assay was then used to show that EPO + MBP in the absence of hydrogen peroxide is substantially cytotoxic only to the acute lymphocytic leukemia and IM-9 cells. In the presence of 0.003% hydrogen peroxide, EPO + MBP was cytotoxic to five types of cells. It is concluded that human EPO in the presence of MBP has an affinity for the membrane of diverse cell types.

To eliminate the problems of transfer of packaging functions and helper virus formation encountered with the previously available packaging systems, two mutant Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived proviral genomes carrying complementary mutations in the gag-pol or env regions were sequentially introduced into NIH 3T3 cells by cotransformation. Both genomes contained a deletion of the psi sequence necessary for the efficient encapsidation of retroviral genomes into virus particles and additional alterations at the 3' end of the provirus. We show that the resulting packaging cell lines psi CRIP and psi CRE can be used to isolate clones that stably produce high titers (10(6) colony-forming units/ml) of recombinant retroviruses with amphotropic and ecotropic host ranges, respectively. More importantly, we demonstrate that viral producers derived from the packaging cell lines do not transfer the packaging functions, or yield helper virus, even under conditions where existing packaging cell lines can be shown to yield transfer of packaging functions and/or helper virus. These properties of the psi CRIP and psi CRE packaging lines make them particularly valuable reagents for in vivo gene transfer studies aimed at cell lineage analysis and the development of human gene replacement therapies.","['Danos, O', 'Mulligan, R C']","['Danos O', 'Mulligan RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genes, Viral', 'Helper Viruses/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Plasmids', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transfection']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Sep;85(17):6460-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.17.6460.,"['CA38497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD00635/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HL37569/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1073/pnas.85.17.6460 [doi]'],PMC281992,"['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA.']",,,,,,,,,

Treatment is, on the other hand, aimed at prevention of the most frequent complications, that is of thromboembolic processes. In the last 30 years the authors treated a total of 118 PV patients, of whom 60 have died. Initially 32P treatment was applied, which was modified later, because of acute leukaemia that had occurred in 9% of the treated cases, to a single 5 mC 32P+Myelobromol (DBM) treatment. Still later only DBM was administered in the form of stosstherapy (2500 mg per day over a period of 4 days). In the latter two groups, acute leukaemia occurred as few as two cases. The course of untreated polycythaemia vera is characterized by transformation into another myeloproliferative disease. This phenomenon occurs in 50% of the cases on drastic treatment and in patients treated with 32P. Of the patients who were alive when the report was finished 35% had been free of complications, while 5.2% were suffering from chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), 34.5% from sclerotic osteo-myelofibrosis (OMF-SC) and 3.4% from chronic megakaryocytic granulocytiv leukaemia (CMGL). Of the 60 patients having died, 15% had suffered from other complications being predominantly of vascular nature. 11.8% of them died of AML, 10% of CGL, 26.7% of OMF-SC and 26.7% of CMGL. The terminal stage was characterized, in the majority of cases, by blastic crisis.

They were less sensitive to the monofunctional derivative 3-carbethoxypsoralen (3-CPs) and to trans-DDP to trans-DDP than their bifunctional counterparts. Incorporation levels of labeled 8-MOP or 3-CPs in wild-type cells and 2 mutants were almost the same, indicating that the sensitivity is not caused by differential incorporation of the agents. The rates of photoinduced mutations to 6-thioguanine resistance in the mutants, per unit dose of 8-MOP, were about 4 times higher for MCN 151 and 3 times higher for MCE 50 than that in L5178Y cells. However, the rates of induced mutations per viable cells in the mutants were nearly equal to those in wild-type cells.

J. Chem. 60: 1374-1376 (1982); Biochem. Pharmacol. 32:3864-3867 (1983)]. Structurally, combretastatin consists of two substituted benzene rings linked by a saturated, hydroxy-substituted two-carbon bridge. A large number of combretastatin analogs have now been synthesized or obtained from C. caffrum. These vary in substituents on the phenyl rings or bridge carbons, bridge length, unsaturation of the bridge (i.e., stilbene derivatives, with the two phenyl rings oriented either cis or trans), and in precise ring structure (two major variants, with the bridge incorporated into a third six-member ring to form a phenanthrene structure or a methyl group eliminated from vicinal methoxy substituents to form a benzodioxole ring). Available analogs (17 natural products and 22 synthetic agents) were examined for antimitotic and cytotoxic activity and for effects on tubulin polymerization and colchicine binding. Nineteen compounds inhibited cell growth by 50% or more at concentrations of 1 microM or less, and 14 inhibited tubulin polymerization by at least 50% at stoichiometric drug concentrations. The most potent cytotoxic agents generally strongly inhibited both tubulin polymerization and the binding of colchicine to tubulin. The most promising compound is the (cis)-stilbene derivative (cis)-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-(3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxyphenyl)ethene, which has been named combretastatin A-4. This compound inhibited cell growth by 50% at 7 nM, inhibited tubulin polymerization by 50% at 2.5 microM (1/4 molar equivalent), and competitively inhibited colchicine binding with an apparent Ki of 0.14 microM.","['Lin, C M', 'Singh, S B', 'Chu, P S', 'Dempcy, R O', 'Schmidt, J M', 'Pettit, G R', 'Hamel, E']","['Lin CM', 'Singh SB', 'Chu PS', 'Dempcy RO', 'Schmidt JM', 'Pettit GR', 'Hamel E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Anisoles)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bibenzyls)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tubulin)', '7O62J06F18 (combretastatin)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Anisoles', '*Antineoplastic Agents', '*Bibenzyls', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Colchicine/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Podophyllotoxin/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Stilbenes', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Tubulin']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1988 Aug;34(2):200-8.,,,,"['Laboratory of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,,

If autoantibodies in multiple sclerosis (MS) are made to the epitope EAL, they may cross-react with the envelope proteins of HTVL. It is speculated that in AIDS patients, antibodies to the antigenic epitope EAL of HIV may cross-react with brain vasopressin-neurophysin, leading to a decline in this brain peptide hormone.

Membrane fatty acids of L1210 cells were modified by incubating the cells with the highly unsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (22:6), which results in isolated plasma membranes with 37% of the fatty acids as 22:6, or with the monounsaturated oleic acid (18:1), which results in 58% of the fatty acids as 18:1. The rate of uptake by 22:6-enriched cells during the first min was 62% greater than by those enriched with 18:1. The higher rate was recorded at 0.5-16 microM, pH 6.6-7.6 and temperatures 10-40 C. The difference in cell-associated drug apparently was not due simply to a change in mitoxantrone solubility as measured by partitioning of the drug in lipophilic-hydrophilic systems containing lipids from the fatty-acid altered cells. We conclude that the type of fatty acids contained in L1210 cell membranes can affect the cell association of mitoxantrone.

The lymphocytes were isolated using density gradient centrifugation, labeled with subtype-specific MoAbs, and separated to a high degree of homogeneity by FACS into CD4+ helper T cells, CD8+ suppressor T cells, CD20+ B cells, and N901 (NHK-1)+ NK cells. The four lymphocyte subpopulations were labeled with [35S]methionine for 14 hr, solubilized in lysis buffer, and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (IEF). Of about 1000 proteins resolved in each case, most were found to be common to all subpopulations. However, eight putative markers for B1+ (proteins 5525, Mr = 63,700; 5621, Mr = 63,700; 8311, Mr = 36,900; 2202, Mr = 36,300; 6121, Mr = 30,300; 106, Mr = 29,300; 5009, Mr = 23,000; 8012, Mr = 11,600) and one for N901+ (protein 8129, Mr = 30,400) were identified. In contrast, no major protein markers were found that could differentiate T4+ and T8+ cells from each other or from B cells and NK cells. With the exception of two B1+ markers (proteins 5525 and 5621), lower but variable levels of the other markers were observed in all cell types. All the putative protein markers have been identified in the protein database of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (see accompanying article by Celis et al.). Comparison of the overall patterns of protein synthesis of the unsorted PBMCs with those of the four subpopulations showed that the synthesis of some major PBMC proteins decreased substantially in the sorted subsets. These proteins are most likely not of monocyte origin, as these cells constituted only about 15% of the total PBMCs.

Ten patients with ANLL were treated with low dose Harr in combination with low dose Ara-C. Complete remission was achieved in 8 of the 10 patients. After therapy, severe pancytopenia and moderate myelosuppression occurred in two patients who achieved remission. Four patients demonstrated a decrease in blast cells with an associated transient increase in mature granulocytes during therapy. Auer bodies appeared in 7-8% mature granulocytes in peripheral blood and in bone marrow on the 14th day of combination therapy in one patient. Freshly isolated leukemic cells from six pretreatment patients were cultured in liquid in the presence of Harr in combination with Ara-C. Apparent evidence of differentiation of leukemic cells and Auer bodies in the cytoplasm of mature granulocytic cells were observed in two of the six patients. The above results seem to suggest that the therapeutic effect of low dose Harr plus low dose Ara-C may result from both differentiation induction and cytotoxicity of the leukemic cells.","['Huang, C L', 'Deng, M L', 'Guo, R J', 'Wu, M T', 'Liu, F Z', 'Liang, Y M', 'Qiao, Q D']","['Huang CL', 'Deng ML', 'Guo RJ', 'Wu MT', 'Liu FZ', 'Liang YM', 'Qiao QD']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Harringtonines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/chemically induced', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Aug;2(8):518-22.,,,,"[""Department of Hematology, Second Teaching Hospital, Fourth Military Medical College, Xi'an, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,

This incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. The rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. The majority of P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of O-antigen groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species, and Staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. Such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins and central venous catheters. It is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of P. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.","['Funada, H', 'Machi, T', 'Matsuda, T']","['Funada H', 'Machi T', 'Matsuda T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,['0 (Cephalosporins)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Cephalosporins/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cross Infection/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sepsis/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Serotyping']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1988 Sep;18(3):239-48.,,,,"['Protected Environment Unit, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Ishikawa.']",,,,,,,,,

Sixty-four of the patients were treated between 1970 and 1978 with two cycles of MOPP and XRT to the mantle, upper abdomen, and pelvis. The remaining 38 patients were treated from 1978 to 1984 with a modification of the protocol in which pelvic XRT was omitted and low-dose whole-lung XRT was administered to patients with unfavorable mediastinal disease. The 10-year actuarial freedom-from-progression (FFP) and determinate survival rates at a mean follow-up of 93 months were 84% and 86% for stage III1 disease, 86% and 84% for stage III1A disease, and 78% and 91% for stage III1B disease. Three patients died of treatment-related toxicities without evidence of Hodgkin's disease, two died of complications of myelosuppression and one of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Neither FFP nor determinate survival rates were significantly influenced by B symptoms, unfavorable mediastinal disease, histologic subtype, extent of abdominal disease, the omission of pelvic XRT, the use of whole-lung XRT, or the number of splenic nodules. Patients 40 years of age or older had a 73% determinate survival rate at 10 years compared with 88% for patients younger than 40 years (P = .01).

The median time from diagnosis of HCL to the diagnosis of skeletal complications was 20 months (range, 0 to 93). All patients complained of pain and all but one lesion were located in the axial skeleton, primarily the proximal femur. Lytic lesions were seen on radiographic examination in all but one patient, and one patient additionally had multiple osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Radionuclide technetium bone scan was abnormal in all patients examined. Although the peripheral blood counts were variable (only two patients had a leukemic phase of the disease), all patients examined had a hypercellular bone marrow biopsy with hairy cells comprising at least 90% of the hematopoietic elements. The skeletal abnormalities responded well to local radiation therapy. Seven patients were begun on systemic therapy with interferon alpha-2b after the diagnosis of the skeletal lesion. Four of five evaluable patients had a partial hematological response and a substantial improvement in the degree of hairy cell infiltration of the bone marrow. None of these patients has had a recurrence of skeletal complications at a median follow-up time of 29 months. One patient failed to respond hematologically and developed additional bone lesions after 1 year of treatment. Another patient developed a new skeletal lesion 3 months after the cessation of interferon therapy at which time the bone marrow was essentially packed with hairy cells. This retrospective study indicates that bone involvement is a rare complication of HCL and is associated with a high tumor burden in the bone marrow. In addition to local radiation therapy, systemic treatment with interferon should be considered.","['Lembersky, B C', 'Ratain, M J', 'Golomb, H M']","['Lembersky BC', 'Ratain MJ', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteolysis/*etiology/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Splenectomy']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1988 Aug;6(8):1280-4. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1988.6.8.1280.,,['10.1200/JCO.1988.6.8.1280 [doi]'],,"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Medicine, IL.']",,,,,,,,,

Radiation doses from all the main sources of radiation exposure of the population and risks of radiation-induced leukemia have been calculated for children born and living in Seascale during the period of operation of the plant. For the Seascale study population of 1225 children and young persons, followed to age 20 y, or followed until 1980 for those born after 1960, 0.016 radiation-induced leukemias are predicted from the Sellafield discharges. This corresponds to an average risk to children in the population of about one in 75,000. For the four fatal leukemias observed in the study population (0.5 expected from United Kingdom statistics) to be attributed to the operations at Sellafield, the average risk would have to be increased by a factor of about 250, to one in 300. Although there is some uncertainty about the releases from the plant and concentrations of radionuclides in environmental materials in the Sellafield area, particularly for the early years of its operation, the possibility that the doses calculated and the risk coefficients used for radiation-induced leukemia could be so substantially wrong is very unlikely. The number of radiation-induced leukemias from all radiation sources is calculated to be 0.1, which corresponds to a risk of about one in 12,250 for the average child in the study population. About two-thirds of the risk is from natural radiation, 16% from the Sellafield discharges, and nuclear weapons fallout and medical exposure each contribute about 9%. The models used for calculating radiation doses from intakes of radionuclides were based upon those recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). This presented a number of difficulties in the assessment, which included the lack of any generally accepted age-related dosimetric models, particularly for bone-seeking radionuclides; limited information on gut transfer factors for radionuclides incorporated in foodstuffs; and no dosimetric models for the fetus. These and other problems identified in the analysis that require more information are discussed.","['Stather, J W', 'Dionian, J', 'Brown, J', 'Fell, T P', 'Muirhead, C R']","['Stather JW', 'Dionian J', 'Brown J', 'Fell TP', 'Muirhead CR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '0 (Radioactive Pollutants)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Radioactive/adverse effects/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'England', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioactive Pollutants/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Risk', 'Water Pollution, Radioactive/adverse effects/analysis']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 1988 Aug;55(2):471-81. doi: 10.1097/00004032-198808000-00049.,,['10.1097/00004032-198808000-00049 [doi]'],,"['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Oxon, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,

During this period, for example, most of the new information on cancer risk among survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will pertain to persons exposed at ages under 30. From the A-bomb survivor data and from a number of medically and occupationally irradiated populations now under study, it will be possible to construct a fairly complete picture of the temporal distribution of excess cancer risk over the remaining life span following exposure, a major source of uncertainty and controversy in current risk estimates. Provided that the necessary efforts are made, it should be possible to greatly increase our understanding of which organs and tissues are vulnerable to radiation carcinogenesis, variation by age at exposure and sex, and (what is most difficult at the present time) the influence of other risk factors and possible modifying factors on the magnitude of risk associated with radiation exposure. For some sites it may be possible, as it is now for breast cancer, to rule out certain broad classes of simple dose-response models. While the data gathered during the next 25 y will be nearly the last from some very important series, their information content should be extremely high. Thus, there is every reason to improve the resources, e.g., by improving dosimetry, enlarging samples, tapping new sources of case ascertainment, and gathering information on factors other than radiation dose. Modeling in epidemiological investigations depends heavily on work in experimental radiobiology. Thus far, the exchange has been largely in one direction, since epidemiological study design is mostly a matter of extracting information from ""experiments"" that have already taken place. With more epidemiological information, it seems reasonable to hope that detailed hypotheses, with direct relevance to areas of epidemiological uncertainty, may be generated suitable for experimental investigation. It seems likely that findings from large studies of populations exposed to relatively low levels of radiation, for which the signal-to-noise ratio is low, and for which random error and subtle sources of bias may have more than usual influence on reported results, will continue to generate controversy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Land, C E']",['Land CE'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Accidents', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Nuclear Reactors', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Ukraine']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 1988 Aug;55(2):269-78. doi: 10.1097/00004032-198808000-00020.,,['10.1097/00004032-198808000-00020 [doi]'],,"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20205.']",,,,,,,,,

The bone marrows from all the patients with MPD formed so called endogenous CFU-M colonies, in the absence of PHA-LCM, that increased in a dose-dependent manner with the addition of increasing concentrations of normal human AB-citrated plasma (NH-ABCP), while the bone marrows from all the patients with RT and from healthy controls formed few or no endogenous CFU-M colonies. In MPD, the endogenous CFU-M growth was enhanced by normal T cells in a dose-dependent fashion, and was decreased with the depletion of T cells from the marrow cells. These results suggest that the formation of endogenous CFU-M colonies is caused by hypersensitivity of CFU-M in MPD to NH-ABCP, which may contain a small amount of Meg-CSF, and/or by in vitro T cell stimulation. Among MPD, the endogenous CFU-M growth in ET was significantly lower than that of other MPD patients; however, the total number of ET CFU-M grown in the presence of PHA-LCM was the highest. These data show that the bone marrow CFU-M in MPD are heterogeneous with respect to in vitro growth pattern or sensitivity to exogenous Meg-CSF.","['Hamaguchi, H', 'Takano, N', 'Sakamaki, H', 'Enokihara, H', 'Saito, K', 'Furusawa, S', 'Shishido, H']","['Hamaguchi H', 'Takano N', 'Sakamaki H', 'Enokihara H', 'Saito K', 'Furusawa S', 'Shishido H']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Clone Cells/physiopathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology/physiopathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/pathology/physiopathology', 'Thrombocytosis/pathology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1988 Aug;41(2):163-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00886.x.,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00886.x [doi]'],,"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

In this study, MC540 was used as a probe for the cytofluorometric discrimination of hemopoietic cells. In PHA-stimulated lymphocytes or HL-60 cells induced to differentiate with DMSO, MC540 binding was increased in actively proliferating cells and undifferentiated cells as compared with the more differentiated cells of the same lineage. Mononuclear bone marrow cells exhibited a discrete distribution of MC fluorescence. Sorting a population with high MC540 fluorescence (MC+ population) produced a 9-14-fold enrichment of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM), and a recovery of all S-G2M phase cells (BrdUrd/DNA analysis). Cytological examination of the sorted MC+ population confirmed the enrichment in immature cells from all lineages. Double-labeling experiments using MC540 and Hoechst 33342 on total bone marrow or peripheral blood cells confirmed that the MC+ population included all the cycling cells. The proportion of S-G2M phase cells in this MC+ population was 29.3 +/- 7.8 for 15 bone marrow samples and 16.3 +/- 6.8 for 10 blood samples. MC540 could therefore be used as a marker for human hemopoietic cells, and it represents a useful tool for investigation of hemopoiesis in normal or leukemic bone marrow.","['Belloc, F', 'Lacombe, F', 'Bernard, P', 'Dachary, D', 'Boisseau, M R']","['Belloc F', 'Lacombe F', 'Bernard P', 'Dachary D', 'Boisseau MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Pyrimidinones/metabolism']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1988 Jan;9(1):19-24. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990090104.,,['10.1002/cyto.990090104 [doi]'],,"[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Cardiologique, Pessac, France.""]",,,,,,,,,

Cancer developed in an autosomal dominant pattern in 151 blood relatives, 119 (79%) of whom were affected before 45 years of age. These young patients had a total of 50 bone and soft tissue sarcomas of diverse histological subtypes and 28 breast cancers. Additional features of the syndrome included an excess of brain tumors (14 cases), leukemia (9 cases), and adrenocortical carcinoma (4 cases) before age 45 years. These neoplasms also accounted for 73% of the multiple primary cancers occurring in 15 family members. Six of these patients had second cancers linked to radiotherapy. The diversity of tumor types in this syndrome suggests pathogenetic mechanisms which differ from hereditary cancers arising in single organs or tissues. The syndrome is presently diagnosed on clinical grounds; laboratory markers are needed to identify high-risk individuals and families and to provide insights into susceptibility mechanisms that may be shared by a wide variety of cancers.","['Li, F P', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr', 'Mulvihill, J J', 'Blattner, W A', 'Dreyfus, M G', 'Tucker, M A', 'Miller, R W']","['Li FP', 'Fraumeni JF Jr', 'Mulvihill JJ', 'Blattner WA', 'Dreyfus MG', 'Tucker MA', 'Miller RW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Registries', 'Sarcoma/genetics', 'United States']",1988/09/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/09/15 00:00'],"['1988/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Sep 15;48(18):5358-62.,['N01-CP-31024/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Clinical and Environmental Epidemiology Branches, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,,

In the present study the mechanism(s) of the in vitro cytotoxic effects of the drug on tumor cells were studied. After 1-h exposure of L1210 murine leukemia cells to the drug, the concentration of FK973 required to inhibit cell growth by 50% was approximately 1 microM, which was threefold more potent than the concentration of mitomycin C required. DNA synthesis was selectively inhibited in the cells treated with FK973. Alkaline elution analyses showed that FK973 formed concentration- and time-dependent interstrand DNA-DNA and DNA-protein cross-links in the cells. On the other hand, no DNA single-strand breaks were observed in the cells treated with FK973. When isolated nuclei of L1210 were exposed to FK973 for 1 h, FK973 did not form detectable interstrand DNA-DNA cross-links. We propose that FK973 is activated in the cytoplasm of cells, and forms interstrand DNA-DNA and DNA-protein cross-links which may be important for the induction of its cytotoxicity.","['Masuda, K', 'Nakamura, T', 'Mizota, T', 'Mori, J', 'Shimomura, K']","['Masuda K', 'Nakamura T', 'Mizota T', 'Mori J', 'Shimomura K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oxazines)', '114580-45-9 (FK 973)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oxazines/*metabolism']",1988/09/15 00:00,1988/09/15 00:01,['1988/09/15 00:00'],"['1988/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Sep 15;48(18):5172-7.,,,,"['Department of Pharmacology, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd., Osaka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

Biochem., 157: 129, 1986). Here we report the application of this technique to the study of the intracellular biotransformations of (DL)-trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexanemalonatoplatinum(II) [PtCl2(trans-DACH)] and (DL)-trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexanemalonatoplatinum(II) [Pt(mal)(trans-DACH)] in the L1210 cell line. The two-column high performance liquid chromatography system allowed separation and identification of both parent drugs and intracellular biotransformation products containing glutathione, methionine, cysteine, arginine, lysine, aspartate or glutamate, and serine or threonine. With the exception of the platinum-glutathione complex, the relative abundance of each biotransformation product was independent of drug concentration. The relative abundance of the platinum-glutathione biotransformation product increased with increasing platinum concentration, suggesting that platinum drugs cause an increase in intracellular glutathione levels in a dose-dependent manner. This hypothesis was verified by direct measurement of intracellular glutathione levels. In continuous uptake experiments, the intracellular levels of the parent compounds peaked between 2 and 5 h and declined to negligible levels by 24 h. In pulse-chase experiments, the chemical t1/2 for PtCl2(trans-DACH) and Pt(mal)(trans-DACH) inside the cell at 37 degrees C was determined to be 12-15 and 21-28 min, respectively. This is far shorter than previously determined rates for the displacement of either ligand in vitro. The platinum-amino acid complexes accumulated gradually throughout the 24-h incubation. The free trans-DACH carrier ligand also accumulated to a level approaching 20% of filterable counts during the 24-h incubation, probably due to trans-labilization of the carrier ligand by sulfur-containing nucleophiles. A combination of reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and a DNA binding assay was used to identify and quantitate the reactive biotransformation products. As expected from previous studies (Mauldin et al., Cancer Res., 46: 2876, 1986), the PtCl2(trans-DACH)-treated cells had approximately 3 times more reactive platinum biotransformation product at early times, but the levels of reactive biotransformation product fell much more rapidly than in Pt(mal)(trans-DACH)-treated cells.

Monocytosis was more prominent in patients with high leukemic counts, but there was no correlation to clinical stages.

Two-color fluorescence was used for the analysis of cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II molecules, complement receptors, and Fc receptors on the LeuM3+ monocytes. Compared to cells from control donors, there was an increase for MHC class II antigens, complement receptors, and Fc receptors on the monocytes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in terms of both the percentage of positive cells among the LeuM3+ monocytes and of fluorescence intensity. This increase was not restricted to patients with monocytosis nor were the molecules always upregulated concomitantly. The increase of antigen expression on LeuM3+ monocytes was more than 50% (1.5-fold) in seven of 22 patients for MHC Class II antigens, in seven of 16 patients for complement receptor and in six of 12 patients for Fc receptor. A similar decrease of antigen expression was observed only in one patient for MHC Class II and in one patient for complement receptor expression.

The decarboxylation of SAM is inhibited by the toxic cytostatic drug methylglyoxalbis-(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG). To achieve more specific and less toxic effects of MGBG, this drug was combined with cycloleucine, which inhibits SAM synthesis, and with nitrous oxide, which inhibits methionine synthetase. This treatment thus aimed at sequential inhibition of the synthesis of decarboxylated SAM, and was studied in a rat leukemia model (BNML). Combined treatment further decreased the level of spermine, but not of spermidine, in leukemic cells, compared to the effects of MGBG alone. The therapeutic effects of this combination were additive or less than additive, however. MGBG was not very effective in reducing leukemic growth and severely toxic, although less with combined treatment. Another inhibitor of SAM decarboxylase, berenil, was also used, and although this drug was about equally active in inhibition of leukemic growth, alterations in intracellular polyamines were not observed. The combination of nitrous oxide and cycloleucine, which effectively reduced leukemic growth at non-toxic dosages, selectively inhibited spermine synthesis, and therefore may be used to interfere with polyamine metabolism. The relevance of this polyamine deprivation to the treatment of leukemia could not be demonstrated.","['Kroes, A C', 'Ermens, A A', 'Lindemans, J', 'Schoester, M', 'Abels, J']","['Kroes AC', 'Ermens AA', 'Lindemans J', 'Schoester M', 'Abels J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0TQU7668EI (Cycloleucine)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'K50XQU1029 (Nitrous Oxide)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cycloleucine/pharmacology', 'DNA/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mitoguazone/pharmacology', 'Nitrous Oxide/pharmacology', 'Polyamines/*analysis', 'Proteins/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*metabolism']",1988/08/30 00:00,1988/08/30 00:01,['1988/08/30 00:00'],"['1988/08/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/30 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1988 Aug 30;41(3):295-305. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(88)90291-1.,,"['0304-3835(88)90291-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(88)90291-1 [doi]']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,

The CC-1065 molecule is made up of three repeating pyrroloindole subunits, one of which (the left-hand one or A subunit) contains a reactive cyclopropyl function. The drug reacts with adenines in DNA in a highly sequence-specific manner, overlapping four base pairs to the 5'-side of the covalently modified base. Concomitant with CC-1065 covalent binding to DNA is an asymmetric effect on local DNA structure which extends more than one helix turn to the 5'-side of the covalent binding site. The DNA alkylation, sequence specificity, and biological potency of CC-1065 and a select group of trimeric synthetic analogues were evaluated.

Sixteen patients died without a complete remission; of these, all 11 who underwent autopsy were found to have invasive fungal pneumonia. The 24 patients who achieved a complete remission received one to nine (median, four) additional courses of intensive chemotherapy for remission consolidation and/or relapse, and experienced 132 episodes of severe granulocytopenia. Seven patients never had a pulmonary infection despite 34 granulocytopenic episodes. However, fungal pneumonia complicated 32 (33 percent) of 98 granulocytopenic episodes in the other 17 patients. Fifteen of the patients who achieved a complete remission had at least one episode of fungal pneumonia; 12 received further chemotherapy, and nine (75 percent) of these had a subsequent fungal pneumonia. In all, 17 (52 percent) of 33 subsequent granulocytopenic episodes experienced by patients with a prior fungal pneumonia were complicated by another fungal pneumonia.

This is especially true for the role of macrophages, which figure prominently in the inflammatory response. Two proteins, MRP8 and MRP14, which are expressed in infiltrate macrophages during inflammatory reactions but not in normal tissue macrophages, have been characterized. Here we report that MRP8 and MRP14 mRNAs are specifically expressed in human cells of myeloid origin and that their expression is regulated during monocyte-macrophage and granulocyte differentiation. To initiate the analysis of cis-acting elements governing the tissue-specific expression of the MRP genes, we cloned the human genes encoding MRP8 and MRP14. Both genes contain three exons, are single copy, and have a strikingly similar organization. They belong to a novel subfamily of highly homologous calcium-binding proteins which includes S100 alpha, S100 beta, intestinal calcium-binding protein, P11, and calcyclin (2A9). A transient expression assay was devised to investigate the tissue-specific regulatory elements responsible for MRP gene expression after differentiation in leukemia HL60 cells. The results of this investigation demonstrated that the cis-acting elements responsible for MRP expression are present on the cloned DNA fragment containing the MRP gene loci.","['Lagasse, E', 'Clerc, R G']","['Lagasse E', 'Clerc RG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Jun;8(6):2402-10. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.6.2402-2410.1988.,,['10.1128/mcb.8.6.2402-2410.1988 [doi]'],PMC363438,"['Department of Biotechnology, CIBA-GEIGY, Basel, Switzerland.']",,"['GENBANK/M21005', 'GENBANK/M21064']",,,,,,,

Vitamin D was about 10 times more effective in inducing differentiation than RA. LCM significantly increased the differentiation-inductive capacity of both vitamins, although LCM did not have an effect of its own. During the first days of culture, the number of cells per clone increased with either vitamin or LCM alone as compared to control cultures. This suggests that cellular proliferation may be important in the initial phase of the differentiation induction. No synergy in this respect was found between RA and vitamin D in the presence or absence of LCM. Thus it is doubtful whether RA and vitamin D have a true synergistic effect on individual HL-60 cell differentiation as previously described in liquid cultures. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the process of differentiation induction regarding the growing cells in agar gel involves an all-or-none process. The data may also help elucide the observed relationship between the in vitro production of colony stimulating activity and favorable prognosis of AML.","['Soppi, E', 'Robert, K H', 'Gahrton, G']","['Soppi E', 'Robert KH', 'Gahrton G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Culture Media)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin D/*pharmacology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1988 Jul;41(1):66-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00871.x.,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00871.x [doi]'],,"['Department of Medicine, Hudding Hospital, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,

The therapy for patients in clinical remission before laparotomy consisted of TNI or sTNI in 19 patients, mediastinal radiation in 6 patients and no further therapy in the remaining 3 patients. No significant differences were seen in survival and relapse-free survival between those patients treated by extensive and those treated by local radiotherapy or no further therapy. Instead, among those patients who received extensive radiotherapy 3 developed acute non-lymphoid leukemia (ANLL). The therapy for this group of patients consisted of further chemotherapy in 7 who had concomitant liver involvement and TNI in the remaining 3 who had the disease confined to the spleen and/or lymph nodes. Among these patients, only 3 obtained CR; 2 with radiation and 1 who was resistant to MOPP, with ABVD. This study leads us to re-consider the role of laparotomy in stage III HD which should be used as non-routine procedure only in selected patients without poor prognostic factors who may be cured by radiotherapy alone.

Based on measurements of the defined cellular properties, we have characterized the pleiotropic responses of each tumour cell line to the phorbol ester in relation to intensity and time of onset of each response. The effects of TPA are highly varied, ranging in time of onset from minutes to days, and in intensity from strong to weak within the four cell lines studied. However, within all the processes that are affected, the activation of protein kinase C appears to be a common initiating event of phorbol ester induction.","['Zanyk, M J', 'Banerjee, D', 'McFarlane, D L']","['Zanyk MJ', 'Banerjee D', 'McFarlane DL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology/pathology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1988 Jul;9(4):374-9. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990090415.,,['10.1002/cyto.990090415 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pathology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,

In support of this speculation, Roop et al. (Nature, 323, 822-824, 1986) have shown that papillomas developed from skin grafts of cultured keratinocytes in which the v-rasH gene had been introduced by a defective retroviral vector. Using the same technique we have analyzed the cytogenetic profile of primary mouse epidermal cultures bearing the activated ras gene and of the tumors generated by skin grafts of the same cells. The epidermal cultures infected with the replication-defective virus which incorporated the v-rasH gene into a packaging-defective Moloney murine leukemia virus did not show any detectable karyotypic abnormalities. These cells presented a diploid/tetraploid configuration similar to uninfected controls. Furthermore, papillomas produced by skin grafts of these cells also showed euploid chromosomal profiles. On the other hand, two carcinomas that arose spontaneously from pre-existing papillomas showed 80% aneuploid cells and aneuploid stem lines. It appears, from these results, that the activated rasH gene is able to generate benign lesions without the involvement of further gross genomic alterations, but that such alterations may be associated with malignant conversion.","['Aldaz, C M', 'Conti, C J', 'Yuspa, S H', 'Slaga, T J']","['Aldaz CM', 'Conti CJ', 'Yuspa SH', 'Slaga TJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Karyotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Oncogenes', 'Papilloma/genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1988 Aug;9(8):1503-5. doi: 10.1093/carcin/9.8.1503.,['CA 42157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1093/carcin/9.8.1503 [doi]'],,"['University of Texas System Cancer Center, Smithville 78957.']",,,,,,,,,

All animals were kept ultimately until 22 months to register the long-term tumour pattern. The carcinogenic effects of ENU alone were also studied in two separate experiments. Prenatal X-irradiation with 1.6 Gy mostly abolished the carcinogenic late effects of ENU, with the exception of an almost constant leucosis incidence and an unchanged lung tumour frequency. Lowering the prenatal X-ray dose to 0.8 Gy resulted in a significantly increased rate of liver tumours and ovary tumours. Synergistic effects on various tissues were observed after both 0.4- and 0.2-Gy foetal X-irradiation treatment in combination with postnatal application of ENU. These effects mainly involved a significant increase in the frequency of leucosis and of tumours of the liver, intestine, uterus and ovaries. The greater-than-additive effect in the case of these tumours suggests that low-level prenatal X-irradiation leads to a lasting sensitivity of some tissues towards a subsequent carcinogenic stimulus.","['Schmahl, W']",['Schmahl W'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'Ethylnitrosourea', 'Female', 'Fetus/*radiation effects', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/etiology', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/etiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1988 Aug;9(8):1493-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/9.8.1493.,,['10.1093/carcin/9.8.1493 [doi]'],,"['Institut fur Pathologie, Gesellschaft fur Strahlen- und Umweltforschung mbH Munchen, Neuherberg, FRG.']",,,,,,,,,

Because the expression of receptor for the lectin peanut agglutinin PNA by normal lymphocytes is associated with noncirculating (stationary phase) cells, we studied the relationship between PNA binding by lymphoma cells and the presence of clonal B cells in the blood of 38 patients with B-cell lymphoma. The binding of PNA by cells in tissues was determined by the immunoperoxidase method and by two-color flow cytometry. Circulating lymphoma cells (clonal B cells) were identified by a sensitive flow-cytometric technique (kappa-lambda analysis) and were also studied for PNA binding in some cases. In all, 16 of 38 (42%) of lymphomas were PNA+, including a spectrum of histologic types. Circulating lymphoma cells were demonstrated in 17 of 22 PNA-lymphomas, whereas only 3 of 16 of PNA+ lymphomas had such circulating cells. Thus, there is a significant association between PNA binding and peripheral blood involvement by lymphoma (P less than .005 by chi-square analysis). In 12 cases, the circulating and tissue lymphoma cells had similar expression of PNA receptor (2 PNA+ and 10 PNA- cases), indicating that modulation of the PNA binding sites did not occur. In three patients who presented with lymphosarcoma cell leukemia, the circulating malignant cells were PNA-. These findings suggest that for both normal and malignant lymphocytes the absence of binding sites for PNA is associated with the capacity of these cells to circulate freely.","['Weinberg, D S', 'Ault, K A', 'Pinkus, G S']","['Weinberg DS', 'Ault KA', 'Pinkus GS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Peanut Agglutinin)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Peanut Agglutinin']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Aug;72(2):698-704.,['CA40357/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['S0006-4971(20)81054-4 [pii]'],,"[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",,,,,,,,,

We have studied the effects of these dietary lipids on the density profile and composition of the plasma lipoproteins and on the lipid composition and fluidity of (purified) lymphoid cell membranes in healthy mice and in mice bearing a transplanted lymphoid leukemia (GRSL). Tumor development in these mice occurred in the spleen and in ascites. While the fatty acid composition of the VLDL-triacylglycerols still strongly resembled the dietary lipids, the effects of the diets decreased in the order VLDL-triacylglycerols greater than HDL-phospholipids greater than plasma membrane phospholipids. Diet-induced differences in the latter fraction were virtually confined to the content of oleic acid and linoleic acid, and they were too small to affect the membrane fluidity, as measured by fluorescence polarization using the probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Healthy mice were almost irresponsive to dietary cholesterol, but in the tumor bearers, where lipoprotein metabolism has been shown to be disturbed, the cholesterol diet caused a substantial increase in the low- and very-low density regions of both blood and ascites plasma lipoproteins. The cholesterol-rich diet also increased the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio and lipid structural order (decreased fluidity) in GRSL ascites cell membranes, but not in the splenic GRSL cell membranes. We conclude that the composition of plasma lipoproteins and cell membrane lipids in GR/A mice is subject to exquisite homeostatic control. However, in these low-responders to dietary lipids the development of an ascites tumor may lead to increased responsiveness to dietary cholesterol. The elevated level of membrane cholesterol thus obtained in GRSL ascites cells did not affect the expression of various cell surface antigens or tumor cell growth.","['Damen, J', 'De Widt, J', 'Hilkmann, H', 'Van Blitterswijk, W J']","['Damen J', 'De Widt J', 'Hilkmann H', 'Van Blitterswijk WJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '0 (Lipoproteins, VLDL)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '1720-32-7 (Diphenylhexatriene)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Dietary Fats/*pharmacology', 'Diphenylhexatriene', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lipoproteins/*blood', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Fluidity/*drug effects', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spleen/metabolism']",1988/08/18 00:00,1988/08/18 00:01,['1988/08/18 00:00'],"['1988/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Aug 18;943(2):166-74. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(88)90548-2.,,"['0005-2736(88)90548-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(88)90548-2 [doi]']",,"['Division of Cellular Biochemistry, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (Antoni van Leeuwenhoek-Huis), Amsterdam.']",,,,,,,,,

A 1-hr incubation with 1.6 +/- 0.2 microM BCNU resulted in a 50% inhibition of glutathione reductase, while 10 microM BCNU caused total inhibition of the enzyme. The time required for 50% inhibition of glutathione reductase by 10 microM BCNU was 7 min. The recovery of glutathione reductase activity was studied by incubating cells with 10 microM BCNU for 30 min to inhibit all glutathione reductase activity, washing the cells free of drug, and continuing the incubation in fresh medium. Fifty percent of the activity returned within 12 hr. Glutathione reductase activity recovered normally when cell growth and DNA synthesis were inhibited in the cells, but it failed to recover when protein synthesis was inhibited. Therefore, the inactivation of glutathione reductase appears irreversible, and the recovery of enzymatic activity is dependent on the synthesis of new protein. Continuous incubation with 19.8 +/- 0.4 microM BCNU resulted in a 50% inhibition of cell growth.

We have previously detected increased plasma membrane traffic to, and content of, the acid endosomal compartment in pleiotropic resistant Ehrlich ascites and P388 leukemia cells. This suggested that the endosome could be associated with the pleiotropic resistance phenotype by a mechanism of vesicular drug trapping and transport. The present study was undertaken in order to test the effects of the carboxylic ionophores monensin and nigericin, which are known to both disrupt intracellular vesicular traffic and to raise intravesicular pH, with relation to the pleiotropic resistance phenotype. Both monensin and nigericin increased daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation in daunorubicin resistant Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (EHR2/DNR+) in a dose-dependent manner. Further, monensin inhibited glucose induced DNR efflux from EHR2/DNR+ cells loaded with drug by energy deprivation. On the other hand, monensin had only negligible effect on DNR accumulation and efflux in wild-type Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (EHR2). In a clonogenic assay system, monensin reduced resistance to DNR in EHR2/DNR+, whereas only an additive effect was obtained in EHR2. However, both ionophores proved too toxic in in vivo experiments. These results, showing that drugs known to disrupt endosomal functions also inhibit the pleiotropic resistance phenotype, support the suggested link between the endosome and pleiotropic resistance.","['Sehested, M', 'Skovsgaard, T', 'Roed, H']","['Sehested M', 'Skovsgaard T', 'Roed H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance/*drug effects', 'Golgi Apparatus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monensin/*pharmacology', 'Nigericin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1988 Sep 1;37(17):3305-10. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(88)90643-0.,,"['0006-2952(88)90643-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(88)90643-0 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Copenhagen, Herlev Hospital, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,

Five patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma with severe AIHA associated with a ""warm"" IgG antibody, and a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with an IgM ""cold"" antibody were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin G (0.4 g/kg) daily for five doses followed by maintenance therapy every 21 to 28 days if evidence of recurrence was noted. Two additional patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia were given maintenance therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin G every 21 days for previously recurrent AIHA and infections. Hematocrit levels of patients with AIHA stabilized followed by a gradual improvement at 21 days after intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion without steroids. Treatment with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin G resulted in faster and higher increments in hematocrit levels in these patients. Other patients who had partial responses to steroids showed further improvement in their hematocrit levels by the addition of intravenous immunoglobulin G. Another patient with a cold agglutinin disease was refractory to intravenous immunoglobulin G therapy. Five patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute AIHA and two patients with previous recurrences of AIHA required maintenance intravenous immunoglobulin G every 21 days. All seven patients except one did not have any episodes of AIHA from six months to as long as four years while receiving the three-week intravenous immunoglobulin G therapy.

Revised models were established for three highly active mitomycin C analogues: M-83, BMY-25282, and RR-150.

In this structural class the quinone moiety, which is believed to be responsible for the cardiotoxicity of the anthracyclines, has been designed out. The synthesis of the benzothiopyranoindazoles was carried out by a multistep sequence from requisite 1-chloro-4-nitro-9H-thioxanthen-9-one precursors. Reaction with a monoalkylhydrazine gave a 5-nitrobenzothiopyranoindazole adduct, which was catalytically reduced to a corresponding C-5 anilino intermediate. Alkylation of 7 with a requisite X(CH2)nNR1R2 (X = Cl, Br; R1, R2 = H, alkyl, acyl; n = 2,3) provided target ""two-armed"" benzothiopyranoindazoles or A-ring methoxy and/or side chain acyl intermediates, which could be converted to 3 by appropriate deprotection methodologies. Alternatively, certain target compounds 3 were synthesized by reaction of 7 with appropriately functionalized glycine precursors under Schotten-Bauman or BOP chloride condensation conditions to provide C-5 acylamino intermediates, followed by Red-Al reduction and deprotection steps. Described also is the synthesis of selected benzothiopyranoindazole congeners with proximal acylamino side chains at C-5 and B-ring sulfone functionality at S-6.

Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells induced with 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) differentiate into monocytes/macrophages and accumulate in G1. We determined the effect of TPA on the growth kinetics of a human leukemia cell line (KOPM-28), which developed several of the characteristics of megakaryocytes in response to TPA, such as the surface antigen complex IIb/IIIa, platelet peroxidase and polyploidy. Cell growth was immediately and completely inhibited by TPA. Flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA content revealed a gradual decrease in cells in G1 and an accumulation of cells in G2. These data suggest that TPA prolonged G1 and rapidly arrested the cells in G2. Synchronized cells were utilized to further analyze the rapid G2 arrest. Cells arrested with aphidicolin at the G1/S interphase were released, and the effects of TPA (added at different intervals) on cell cycle progression were examined 14 h after release. The results showed that TPA added at the end of the S phase, as well as at the G1/S interphase incompletely but distinctly arrested cells in G2. Moreover, G2 arrest was observed when TPA was added to cells released from a colcemid-induced G2/M block, suggesting that cells already in G2 were inhibited by TPA from moving through M to G1. Since some cells became multi-nucleated in the course of incubation with TPA, this G2 accumulation may have resulted at least in part from a prolongation of the phase or a transient G2 block. These changes in cell cycle progression induced by TPA may be characteristic of and/or related to megakaryocytic differentiation of hemopoietic precursor cells.","['Tsuda, H', 'Sakaguchi, M', 'Kawakita, M', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Mori, T', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Tsuda H', 'Sakaguchi M', 'Kawakita M', 'Nakazawa S', 'Mori T', 'Takatsuki K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Metaphase/drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1988 May;6(3):209-20. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530060306.,,['10.1002/stem.5530060306 [doi]'],,"['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

A possible mechanism for electron transport chain defects.,1311-7,"Activated macrophages inhibit replication of murine lymphoblastic leukemia L1210 cells without lysis. This inhibition of replication is associated with abnormalities of mitochondrial electron transport at the level of NADH dehydrogenase (NADH-DH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). The mechanism of inhibition is unknown, although it has been demonstrated that as NADH-DH and SDH activity is lost, iron is released from cells. Because both NADH-DH and SDH contain numerous iron-sulfur clusters, damage to these structures may be one result of injury by activated macrophages. L1210 cells were labeled with 55Fe and co-cultivated with activated murine peritoneal macrophages (injured L1210 cells). At 48 h, injured L1210 cells had released 83 +/- 8% (mean +/- SEM of 55Fe activity into the media, compared with 25 +/- 4% release from control and 37 +/- 7% from nondividing mitomycin C-treated control cells. All cells were greater than 90% viable. These differences were also reflected in the iron content of the cells. Mitochondria were then separated by centrifugation after cell disruption and 55Fe activity was found to be similarly decreased in both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial fractions of injured L1210 cells. To further characterize the changes in mitochondrial iron content, mitochondrial proteins from injured and control L1210 cells were separated by IEF and 55Fe activity of gel slices was determined. There was selective loss of 55Fe activity in the area of the gel corresponding to SDH and NADH-DH, suggesting that iron loss from iron-sulfur clusters may occur in L1210 cells injured by activated macrophages. Iron uptake into L1210 cells after removal from macrophages showed a rapid large influx of radioactive iron. L1210 cells in contact with macrophages appear to develop an iron-depleted state, which is dependent on the continued presence of macrophages.","['Wharton, M', 'Granger, D L', 'Durack, D T']","['Wharton M', 'Granger DL', 'Durack DT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell-Free System', 'Culture Media', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Electron Transport', 'Female', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/immunology/*metabolism/pathology']",1988/08/15 00:00,1988/08/15 00:01,['1988/08/15 00:00'],"['1988/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Aug 15;141(4):1311-7.,['CA35893-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",,,,,,,,,

One of these (K562-Clone I), when made resistant to the toxic effects of Concanavalin A (Con A-R1), regained its sensitivity to NK. Comparing the plasma membranes of Clone I and Con A-R1, we observed 1) a very similar electrophoretic pattern of membrane glycoproteins identified by binding to the lectins Con A, WGA, PNA, and SBA; 2) an increase in binding of Ulex europaeus lectin to a group of glycoproteins from Con A-R1 that were sensitive to treatment with fucosidase and N-glycanase and that had a diffuse mobility ranging in apparent molecular weight from 30 to 200 kDa; and 3) a marked decrease in binding of an antibody reactive with the lactoneofucopentaose III antigen (Lewis x).

Inhibition of RNA synthesis arrests cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, preventing these cells from entering S phase and rendering them insensitive to MTX. Because MTX cytotoxicity can be enhanced by concurrent administration of hypoxanthine (HX), we examined the hypothesis that this modulation can allow normal rates of RNA synthesis and cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. For L1210 cells exposed to MTX for 12 h or 24 h, the addition of HX enhanced the cytotoxicity of MTX; however, no enhancement was observed with a 6-h exposure. Inhibition of RNA synthesis by MTX was prevented by concurrent administration of HX. The effect of HX on cell cycle progression was first examined using flow cytometry, which indicated that MTX treatment alone or with concurrent HX caused a buildup of cells with a G1 content of DNA. Because this technique may fail to distinguish between cells in late G1 phase, the G1/S border, or early S, the method of premature chromosome condensation was used to determine cell cycle position based on chromatin morphology. A shift to a higher degree of chromatin decondensation was observed when HX was coadministered with MTX during a 12-h exposure, suggesting progression from G1 towards S. This correlated with the enhancement of MTX cytotoxicity by HX after 12 h exposure. The results of these studies suggest that HX potentiates MTX cytotoxicity by maintaining RNA synthesis, allowing cells that might ordinarily be arrested in G1 to progress into the cytotoxic S phase.","['Fairchild, C R', 'Maybaum, J', 'Straw, J A']","['Fairchild CR', 'Maybaum J', 'Straw JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1988;22(1):26-32. doi: 10.1007/BF00254176.,['5T-32-CA09223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1007/BF00254176 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pharmacology, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20037.']",,,,,,,,,

In vitro, DNA-platinum adducts inhibit DNA synthesis. An assessment of the inhibition of DNA synthesis in murine leukemia L1210 cells demonstrated that, although cell division was halted, DNA replication continued for a period of time. The DNA underwent almost a complete doubling even in cells that did not divide. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a slowed synthetic phase which progressed to a block in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The duration of the G2 block was proportional to the concentration of cis-DDP. Low concentrations of cis-DDP caused the cells to be transiently blocked in the G2 phase for 24 to 48 h. Higher concentrations of cis-DDP resulted in a G2 arrest that was not reversed by 96 h. After this time, the arrested cells appeared to disintegrate, rather than recover. Cell survival and trypan blue exclusion studies indicated that, at low drug concentrations, cells which had transiently arrested in the G2 phase survived, while at higher concentrations only a limited number of survivors were responsible for the observed recovery of growth. Analysis of DNA double-strand breaks showed that significant numbers of breaks only occurred at concentrations of cis-DDP that subsequently led to debris detectable on the flow cytometer and to loss of trypan blue exclusion. The formation of these breaks appeared to be the first detectable change that was indicative of cell death. It is proposed that cells arrest in the G2 phase because they are unable to transcribe damaged DNA and make mRNA essential for passage into mitosis. DNA repair probably overcomes this arrest. Cell death may therefore be a consequence of the inability to adequately recover transcription.","['Sorenson, C M', 'Eastman, A']","['Sorenson CM', 'Eastman A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', '*DNA Damage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interphase/*drug effects', 'Trypan Blue']",1988/08/15 00:00,1988/08/15 00:01,['1988/08/15 00:00'],"['1988/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Aug 15;48(16):4484-8.,"['CA00906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68105.']",,,,,,,,,

Cerebral aspergillosis, however, may lead to a cerebral vascular accident such as intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral infarction. In this report, we present two patients with cerebral aspergillosis accompanied by intracranial hemorrhage. A total of 124 reported cases of cerebral aspergillosis are reviewed to ascertain the pathogenesis of the associated vascular lesion. The first patient was a 9-year-old girl, who developed drowsiness with a headache during the medical treatment for acute myelocytic leukemia. CT disclosed subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. The autopsy revealed that the aspergillus arteritis was the cause of repeated hemorrhage. The second patient was a 15-year-old boy with allergic purpura and renal failure, who suddenly developed a stupor with convulsive seizure. CT disclosed an intracerebral hemorrhage in the right parieto-occipital area. The patient gradually deteriorated and died in spite of the surgical removal of the hematoma. The autopsy revealed that the hemorrhage was caused by the aspergillus arteritis. Cerebral aspergillosis has two routes of infection to the central nervous system: hematogenous dissemination from the distant site (usually the lung) and direct extension from the contiguous site (usually the paranasal sinuses or orbit). The primary mechanism of neuropathology is different between these two types. Primary cerebral arteritis is most often seen in patients with the former type, whereas primary basal meningitis occurs in the latter. The incidence of clinico-pathological features is different between hematogenous dissemination type and direct extension type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Matsumura, S', 'Sato, S', 'Fujiwara, H', 'Takamatsu, H', 'Kajiwara, T', 'Yamashiro, K', 'Miyagawa, A']","['Matsumura S', 'Sato S', 'Fujiwara H', 'Takamatsu H', 'Kajiwara T', 'Yamashiro K', 'Miyagawa A']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,No To Shinkei,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,0413550,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aspergillosis/classification/*complications', 'Brain Diseases/classification/*complications', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/*etiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,No To Shinkei. 1988 Mar;40(3):225-32.,,,,"['Neurosurgery Service, National Sapporo Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

These patterns have been critically assessed in light of the distinctive life-style features of these groups. All 4 religious groups considered in this paper have reduced overall rates of cancer, suggesting that the life-styles of all 4 groups have merit in terms of reducing the overall risk of cancer. The rate of smoking among these groups is nearly nil, and the lung cancer rate in all 4 of these religious groups is strikingly low. Cancer of the oral structures, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus is also generally quite low. Amish and Hutterites have unusually high rates of breast cancer and juvenile leukemia. Reproductive factors frequently mentioned as risk factors for breast cancer cannot explain the excess breast cancer in the Amish and Hutterite women because they should have had the effect of reducing the rate. None of the numerous risk factors, normally suggested for leukemia, are consistent with this observation. The observations on ovarian cancer tend to confirm low parity and late age at first birth as risk factors, although the evidence is not entirely consistent. Also, contrary to common observations, the pattern of ovarian cancer contrasts greatly with the breast cancer pattern, suggesting dissimilar risk factors. Their low rate of cervical cancer is consistent with promiscuity being a strong risk factor, but other frequently suggested risk factors were generally inconsistent with the observations. Cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, urinary bladder and prostate, in these 4 religious groups, are not readily explained by the risk factors commonly implicated in cancer of these sites. The patterns of a few types of cancers were consistent with the prevailing opinions of risk factors, but some cancers were poorly explained and, in some cases, the cancer patterns contradicted commonly held opinions concerning risk factors. Religions that provide strong directives for the personal lives of adherents result in distinctive life-style, reflecting multiple disease related factors (risk factors and protective factors). Disease related factors are related to each other in simple or more complex ways (e.g. additive, multiplicative or even more complex). Therefore, when dealing with distinctive life-styles, it may be unwarranted to attempt to isolate individual risk factors.","['Troyer, H']",['Troyer H'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Religion and Medicine', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1988;26(10):1007-17. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(88)90218-3.,,['10.1016/0277-9536(88)90218-3 [doi]'],,"['University of Missouri-Kansas City, School of Basic Life Sciences 64108.']",,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a simple, rapid HPLC-based micromethod for the assay of blood thymidine phosphorylase. We have arbitrarily defined 1 unit of blood thymidine phosphorylase activity as the activity required to produce a 1-nM increment in the plasma concentration of thymine after incubation for 1 h at 37 degrees C with a saturating concentration of exogenous thymidine. In normal adults, whole (peripheral venous) blood thymidine phosphorylase activity with blood cells intact was 64 +/- 11 units (mean +/- S.D., n = 20, range 45-89). The apparent Michaelis constant for thymidine was of the order of 10(-4) M but varied nearly 5-fold between different individuals. Activity increased when blood cells were permeabilised or lysed with non-ionic detergents, implying that thymidine phosphorylase is an intracellular enzyme which may be influenced by exogenous as well as intracellular factors. When blood from normal donors was fractionated, thymidine phosphorylase activity consistently co-isolated with platelets. Whole-blood thymidine phosphorylase activity correlated well with platelet parameters. Although thymidine phosphorylase activity was also detected in plasma and serum, the small size and notorious fragility of platelets suggest its platelet origin. Blood from leukaemic donors showed significantly increased thymidine phosphorylase activity compared to normal controls (mean activity +/- S.D. was 96 +/- 27 units; range 58-140, n = 8). Thymine formation from thymidine was temperature- and pH-dependent in whole blood. 2'-Deoxyuridine and 3 of its 5-halogenated analogues (but not 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), were catabolised by blood thymidine phosphorylase, even during blood clotting at room temperature. Assumptions about in vivo concentrations of these compounds should therefore be interpreted cautiously. In the presence of high concentrations of thymine and suitable deoxyribose donors, small amounts of thymidine were formed in some blood samples, so it is conceivable that thymidine catabolism may be reversible in vivo under some circumstances.","['Shaw, T', 'Smillie, R H', 'MacPhee, D G']","['Shaw T', 'Smillie RH', 'MacPhee DG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Nucleotides)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.4 (Thymidine Phosphorylase)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/*physiology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Pentosyltransferases/*blood', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thymidine Phosphorylase/*blood', 'Thymine/blood']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1988 Jul-Aug;200(1-2):99-116. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(88)90074-7.,,"['0027-5107(88)90074-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(88)90074-7 [doi]']",,"['Department of Microbiology, LaTrobe University, Bundoora, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,

In five of 14 MDS and all five leukemic transformed MDS cases, colony formation was found to require both PHA and CSF. Three of these five PHA-dependent MDS cases progressed to overt leukemia within 1 year, one progressed from RA to RAEB, and one patient received AML chemotherapy. PHA-dependent colony formation was associated with higher bone marrow blast counts, but not directly to FAB type or cytogenetic abnormalities. In nine other MDS cases only CSF was required for colony formation. In these PHA-independent cases the course of the disease was stable during the observation time (5-17 months). Two types of colonies were observed in this in vitro system: colonies adherent and colonies nonadherent to the agar underlayer. The former consisted of terminally differentiated myeloid cells, and the latter comprised immature cells. This suggests that the percentage of adherent colonies formed in vitro may be used as a measure for the maturation defect in MDS. However, no correlation was found between the percentage of adherent colonies and progression to leukemia of the MDS cases. Our findings suggest that the dependency on PHA for in vitro colony formation of colony-forming cells in MDS is predictive for the progression to leukemia. However, the in vitro differentiation capacity has no apparent prognostic significance.","['Schipperus, M R', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Ploemacher, R E', 'Lindemans, J', 'Voerman, J S', 'Abels, J']","['Schipperus MR', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Ploemacher RE', 'Lindemans J', 'Voerman JS', 'Abels J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Jul;2(7):433-7.,,,,"['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,

In an effort to improve survival, an intensive maintenance therapy approach was evaluated in 86 patients with ANLL in remission (median age 47 years) entered on study from 1978 to 1982. One-third of patients in remission were randomized to chemotherapy alone, one-third to splenectomy in addition to chemotherapy, and one-third to immunotherapy in addition to chemotherapy. The chemotherapy, which was identical in the three arms of the study, consisted of cytosine arabinoside plus 6-thioguanine, each given at a dose of 100 mg/m2 every 12 hr for a variable number of days, to render the patient's marrow aplastic, and was repeated every three months for three or more years.

Twenty-five per cent of complete remitters are in continuous complete remission five to nine years after beginning intensive maintenance therapy.

In comparison with the results of earlier studies at the same institution in patients with similar characteristics, using identical remission induction therapy but less intensive maintenance therapy (46 patients), there has been a significant improvement in remission duration (p less than 0.001) and a significant impact on survival (p = 0.03) attributable to the use of intensive maintenance therapy.

Limited specific alterations were observed with a number of lectins when K562 erythroleukemia cells were induced to differentiate. Among these, a number of bands were identified that were either lost or appeared after induction of differentiation with all four agents. In contrast, the glycoproteins bound by UEA were drastically diminished after induction of differentiation, and the remaining UEA-bound glycoproteins bore little resemblance to those of the cells before treatment. This high-resolution technique may be useful as a general method for the examination of cell surface glycoprotein differences.

Low dose (10(-8) M) MTX, which slightly inhibits clonal replication of the cells, delays progress across the S phase, and treatment for 24 h results in a slight increase of the S-phase population. Much higher doses (10(-7) M and 10(-6) M) of MTX, which strongly reduce the clonogenicity, prevented the progression of cells at the G1-S boundary and across the S phase, but not in the other phases. The cells arrested at the G1-S boundary were able to incorporate BrdUrd in the medium for 6-12 h after the start of treatment and then lost the ability to incorporate BrdUrd. By determining the colony inhibitory activity of MTX, it could be shown that not only S-phase cells but non-S-phase cells are susceptible to cytotoxicity of MTX. MTX-induced S-phase arrest is closely associated with an alteration in the distribution of BrdUrd-labeled cells, and MTX apparently inhibits BrdUrd incorporation into L1210 cells as the dose and duration of treatment increase.

The uptake and retention of vincristine (VCR), vinblastine (VBL) and vindesine (VDS) were evaluated comparatively with respect to their cytotoxic action on a murine lymphoblastic leukaemia (L5178Y). 2. The same parameters were measured on a derived subline of cells resistant to VCR (L5178Y/r) in order to determine whether the different degree of resistance to each alkaloid correlates with the amount of drug associated with the cells. 3. VCR was the most active on L5178Y cells (IC50 = 5.8 x 10(-9) M) while the activity of VBL and that of VDS were similar (IC50 4.4 x 10(-8) M and 3.5 x 10(-8) M, respectively). Nevertheless, a considerably larger amount of VBL was taken up by the cells compared to VDS, although there were no significant differences in their cytotoxic action. 4. The VCR resistant cell line also expressed resistance to VDS, whose IC50 was increased by a factor of 11.4, but not to VBL. However, the uptake and retention of the three alkaloids were similarly reduced in L5178Y/r cells regardless of the degree of resistance expressed. 5. Although a decreased drug uptake and/or retention by the cells provides an explanation for the resistance to vinca alkaloids, they do not seem to be the only factors accounting for the resistance shown by the cell line which we have isolated. 6. The results seem to indicate that part of the VBL taken up by the cells is not used to induce the cytotoxic effect, but is diverted to some cellular compartment(s) or rate controlling process(es) which are different from the target that mediates its cytotoxic action.","['Rivera-Fillat, M P', 'Pallares-Trujillo, J', 'Domenech, C', 'Grau-Oliete, M R']","['Rivera-Fillat MP', 'Pallares-Trujillo J', 'Domenech C', 'Grau-Oliete MR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Water/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vinblastine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vinca Alkaloids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vindesine/metabolism/pharmacology']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 1988 Apr;93(4):902-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1988.tb11478.x.,,['10.1111/j.1476-5381.1988.tb11478.x [doi]'],PMC1853905,"['Departamento de Farmacologia y Patologia Experimental, CSIC, Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,

The human gene encoding p67 was isolated in a mouse genetic background after DNA-mediated gene transfer and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for transformants that bound the monoclonal antibody MY9. After three serial rounds of gene transfer and cell sorting, multiple independently derived tertiary mouse cell transformants were obtained that expressed p67. Southern blot analysis revealed that these transformants shared restriction fragments containing highly reiterated human DNA sequences. Two shared EcoRI fragments of 3.3-kilobase (kb) and 9.5-kb pairs were molecularly cloned into bacteriophage vectors. A subsegment of the 3.3-kb fragment lacking repeated sequences was then used as a unique sequence probe to isolate two independent cosmid clones. Cells transfected with DNA from both cosmid clones bound MY9, and the human p67 protein was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. NFS mice inoculated with a mouse cell transformant coexpressing p67 and the v-fms oncogene product produced antisera that specifically immunoprecipitated p67 from human leukemic cell lines, mouse cell transformants, and mouse cells transfected with the biologically active cosmid clones. The human p67 locus was previously assigned to chromosome 19 by screening a panel of rodent X human somatic cell hybrids with the unique sequence probe.

Two groups of cases were recognized. Fourteen cases were negative with B and T lymphoid markers and expressed one or two myeloid antigens detected by the monoclonal antibodies (McAb) MCS2 (CD13) and MY9 (CD33). Peroxidase activity was demonstrated at ultrastructural level by the method of Roels on unfixed cells in eight out of 10 cases; rearrangement of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes was demonstrated in one of the three cases investigated. These cases are proliferations of early, MO, myeloblasts which can only be recognized by immunological and ultrastructural cytochemical methods. The remaining seven cases revealed a complex phenotype with expression of myeloid and lymphoid antigens. Peroxidase activity was detected in blasts from two cases with rearrangement of the Ig-heavy chain gene; in one of them the T cell receptor beta and gamma chain genes were also found in rearranged configuration. This group comprises cases of biphenotypic and mixed acute leukaemia which probably involve multipotent stem cells. This study demonstrates that the expression of myeloid antigens on blast cells parallels closely the presence of peroxidase activity and that lymphoid markers correlate with gene rearrangements at DNA level. Our findings are reassuring with respect to the specificity of the antimyeloid McAb for the diagnosis of cases which are unclassifiable by conventional methods.","['Matutes, E', 'Pombo de Oliveira, M', 'Foroni, L', 'Morilla, R', 'Catovsky, D']","['Matutes E', 'Pombo de Oliveira M', 'Foroni L', 'Morilla R', 'Catovsky D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'DNA/analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidases/metabolism']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Jun;69(2):205-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07623.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07623.x [doi]'],,"['M.R.C.

The proliferation of fibroblasts in MPD patients was increased compared to normal individuals, especially in patients with chronic myelocytic leukaemia and essential thrombocythaemia. This increment of proliferation might be due to higher sensitivity of the fibroblasts to plasma derived serum than to PDGF, because the ratio of proliferation with PDGF to that without PDGF, when compared between patients and normals, remained unchanged. These results suggest that MPD fibroblasts are more sensitive to some factor(s) in plasma, and this fact could partially explain the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis in MPD patients.","['Kimura, A', 'Katoh, O', 'Kuramoto, A']","['Kimura A', 'Katoh O', 'Kuramoto A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*pharmacology']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Jun;69(2):153-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07616.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07616.x [doi]'],,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Research Institute for Nuclear Medicine and Biology, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

This produces a fourth ring and a structure which resembles a hybrid of colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and steganacin. Cornigerine was somewhat more toxic than colchicine with L1210 murine leukemia cells and caused them to accumulate in metaphase arrest. Cornigerine resembled colchicine in its interactions with tubulin in vitro, and it was also somewhat more potent than colchicine in these drug-tubulin interactions. Cornigerine inhibited tubulin polymerization both with and without microtubule-associated proteins, inhibited the binding of radiolabeled colchicine to tubulin, and stimulated tubulin-dependent GTP hydrolysis. Indirect evidence suggested that the binding of cornigerine to tubulin is relatively slow and temperature-dependent, like the binding of colchicine to the protein.","['Hamel, E', 'Ho, H H', 'Kang, G J', 'Lin, C M']","['Hamel E', 'Ho HH', 'Kang GJ', 'Lin CM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Tubulin)', '6877-25-4 (cornigerine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colchicine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Colchicum/*analysis', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Herb-Drug Interactions', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Plants, Medicinal/*analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tubulin/*metabolism']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1988 Jun 15;37(12):2445-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(88)90372-3.,,"['0006-2952(88)90372-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(88)90372-3 [doi]']",,"['Laboratory of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,,

The results obtained can be summarized as follows: Antimetabolites prolonged the duration of the S phase at a low dose, while at a high dose they decreased the rate of progression from the G1 to S phase, resulting in G1 and G1-S boundary accumulation. Partial synchronization by these agents was obtained through two different mechanisms. In vinca alkaloid-accumulated cells in the G2+M phase at 24h, mitotic index (MI) reached 20%, which was 10 to 20 times higher than that of control and most M-phase cells, which consisted of metaphase cells. Other cells in a tetraploid state were considered to be in the G2 phase or possibly G1 phase of the tetraploid cycle. Antibiotics generally accumulated cells in the G2 phase, but agents could be divided into two groups according to the degree of G2 accumulation. One group showed almost complete G2 accumulation, while the other showed only partial accumulation. The former group inhibited the progression of the S phase at a higher dose. Both groups completely inhibited the progression of the cell cycle at the highest dose. Alkylating agents only partially accumulated cells in the G2 phase at a low dose, showed prolongation of the S phase at a high dose, and inhibited the progression of the cell cycle at the highest dose, as with antibiotics. On the basis of these results, the application of these agents for treatment of cancer, especially leukemia, is discussed from a rational viewpoint.","['Mitomo, Y', 'Takamoto, S']","['Mitomo Y', 'Takamoto S']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

A total of 11,030 workers contributing 188,025 person-years were included in the study. Vital status was successfully ascertained through 1982 for over 96% of the cohort. The average (TWA) formaldehyde exposure at the three plants monitored in 1981 and 1984 by NIOSH was 0.15 ppm but past exposures may have been substantially higher. In general, mortality from nonmalignant causes was less than expected. A statistically significant excess in mortality from cancers of the buccal cavity (SMR = 343) and connective tissue (SMR = 364) was observed. Statistically nonsignificant excesses in mortality were observed for cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung (SMR = 114), pharynx (SMR = 112), bladder (SMR = 145), leukemia and aleukemia (SMR = 113), and other lymphopoietic neoplasms (SMR = 170). Mortality from cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung was inversely related to duration of exposure and latency. In contrast, mortality from cancers of the buccal cavity, leukemias, and other lymphopoietic neoplasms increased with duration of formaldehyde exposure and/or latency. These neoplasms also were found to be highest among workers first exposed during a time period of high potential formaldehyde exposures in this industry (1955-1962). However, it should be recognized that these findings are based on relatively small numbers and that confounding by other factors may still exist. The results from this investigation, although far from conclusive, do provide evidence of a possible relationship between formaldehyde exposure and the development of upper respiratory cancers (buccal), leukemias, and other lymphopoietic neoplasms in humans.","['Stayner, L T', 'Elliott, L', 'Blade, L', 'Keenlyside, R', 'Halperin, W']","['Stayner LT', 'Elliott L', 'Blade L', 'Keenlyside R', 'Halperin W']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,['1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)'],IM,"['Female', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', '*Textile Industry', 'United States']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1988;13(6):667-81. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700130606.,,['10.1002/ajim.4700130606 [doi]'],,"['Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati OH 45226.']",,,,,,,,,

Merocyanine 540 (MC540) was mixed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells in the presence of human albumin. This cell-dye mixture was irradiated with 514 nm argon laser light. Results show that in the presence of 0.1%, 0.25% and 0.5% albumin, laser light doses of 62.4 J/cm2, 93.6 J/cm2 and 109.2 J/cm2, respectively, were required for a 5 log reduction in the survival of leukemic cells. Under identical conditions, 80% to 84% of the normal bone marrow cells and 41% of the granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells survived. The number of surviving stromal cells was reduced (1+) compared to the untreated control (4+). Mixing of irradiated bone marrow cells with equal number of HL-60 cells did not interfere with the killing of HL-60 cells treated with MC540 and laser light. The non-specific cytotoxicity of laser light alone was less than 6% for normal bone marrow cells. These results suggest that the concentration of human albumin plays an important role in laser light-induced phototoxicity. This laser light-induced selective photolysis of leukemic cells can be used in ex vivo purging of tumor cell-contaminated bone marrow grafts to achieve very high survival rates of normal bone marrow cells and granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells.","['Gulliya, K S', 'Matthews, J L', 'Fay, J W', 'Dowben, R M']","['Gulliya KS', 'Matthews JL', 'Fay JW', 'Dowben RM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Albumins)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",IM,"['Albumins', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Survival', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Lasers', 'Macrophages', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Pyrimidinones', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1988;42(25):2651-6. doi: 10.1016/0024-3205(88)90336-0.,,"['0024-3205(88)90336-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0024-3205(88)90336-0 [doi]']",,"['Baylor Research Foundation, Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75246.']",,,,,,,,,

These cells exhibit a slower growth rate than folate-replete parental cells and have a lower ability to transport folate or methotrexate via the reduced folate transport system. Measurements at nanomolar concentrations of folate revealed that the adapted cells have acquired a high-affinity folate-binding protein. Binding to this component at 37 degrees C was rapid and reached a maximum value after 30 min which corresponded in amount to 0.23 +/- 0.3 pmol/mg protein, and excess unlabeled folate added 30 min subsequent to the [3H]folate led to a rapid release of the bound substrate. Radioactivity bound to or released from the cells after 30 min at 37 degrees C remained as unmetabolized folic acid. Binding was also rapid at 0 degrees C but uptake at the plateau was only one-half the value obtained at 37 degrees C. Half-maximal saturation of the binding component (KD) occurred at a folate concentration of 0.065 nM at pH 7.4, while the affinity for folate decreased 30-fold when the pH was reduced to 6.2 (KD = 2.0 nM). 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate was also bound by this component (Ki = 13 nM at pH 7.4) but with a much lower affinity than for folate, while progressively weaker interactions were observed with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (Ki = 45 nM) and methotrexate (Ki = 325 nM). When the same adaptation procedure was performed with limiting amounts of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, two additional cell lines, JT-2 and JT-3, were isolated which expressed elevated levels of the folate-binding protein. The binding activity of the latter cells was 0.46 and 1.4 pmol/mg protein, respectively. When the level of binding protein was compared in cells grown at different concentrations of folate, an increase in medium folate from 1 to 500 nM caused a sevenfold reduction in binding activity in the JT-3 cell line, while these same growth conditions had no effect on binding by the other cells. These results indicate that L1210 cells adapted to low concentrations of folate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate contain elevated levels of a high-affinity binding protein and that this protein is able to mediate the intracellular accumulation of folate compounds. L1210 cells thus appear to have two potential uptake routes for folate compounds, the previously characterized anion-exchange system and a second route mediated by a high-affinity binding protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Henderson, G B', 'Tsuji, J M', 'Kumar, H P']","['Henderson GB', 'Tsuji JM', 'Kumar HP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/pathology', '*Receptors, Cell Surface']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1988 Mar;101(3):247-58. doi: 10.1007/BF01872839.,['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1007/BF01872839 [doi]'],,"['Department of Basic and Clinical Research, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California 92037.']",,,,,,,,,

The N delta-hemiphthaloyl derivative was also prepared from 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-formylpteroic acid by reaction with persilylated N delta-phthaloyl-L-ornithine, followed by simultaneous deformylation and ring opening of the N delta-phthaloyl moiety with base. The products were potent inhibitors of purified dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from L1210 murine leukemia cells, with IC50's ranging from 0.027 and 0.052 microM as compared with 0.072 microM for APA-L-Orn. Several of the N delta-acyl-N10-formyl intermediates also proved to be good DHFR inhibitors. One of them, N alpha-(4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-formylpteroyl)-N delta-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-L- ornithine, had a 2-fold lower IC50 than its deformylated product, confirming that the N10-formyl group is well tolerated for DHFR binding. While N delta-acylation of APA-L-Orn did not significantly alter anti-DHFR activity, inhibition of FPGS was dramatically diminished, supporting the view that the basic NH2 on the end of the APA-L-Orn side chain is essential for the activity of this compound against FPGS. N delta-Acylation of APA-L-Orn markedly enhanced toxicity to cultured tumor cells. However, N delta-acyl derivatives also containing an N10-formyl substituent were less cytotoxic than the corresponding N10-unsubstituted analogues even though their anti-DHFR activity was the same, suggesting that N10-formylation may be unfavorable for transport. Two compounds, the N delta-benzoyl and N delta-hemiphthaloyl derivatives of APA-L-Orn, with IC50's against L1210 cells of 0.89 and 0.75 nM, respectively, were more potent than either methotrexate (MTX) or aminopterin (AMT) in this system. These compounds were also more potent than MTX against CEM human lymphoblasts and two human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SCC15, SCC25) in culture. Moreover, in assays against SCC15/R1 and SCC25/R1 sublines with 10-20-fold MTX resistance, the N delta-hemiphthaloyl derivative of APA-L-Orn showed potency exceeding that of MTX itself against the parental cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Rosowsky, A', 'Bader, H', 'Cucchi, C A', 'Moran, R G', 'Kohler, W', 'Freisheim, J H']","['Rosowsky A', 'Bader H', 'Cucchi CA', 'Moran RG', 'Kohler W', 'Freisheim JH']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Pterins)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Peptide Synthases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pterins/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1988 Jul;31(7):1332-7. doi: 10.1021/jm00402a013.,"['CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1021/jm00402a013 [doi]'],,"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",,,,,,,,,

The optimal number of CH2 groups in aminophosphonoalkanoic acid analogues of AMT was found to be two for both enzyme inhibition and cell growth inhibition but was especially critical for activity against FPGS. Deletion of the alpha-carboxyl also led to diminished anti-FPGS activity in comparison with previously studied homocysteic acid and 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid analogues. In the aminoalkanesulfonic acid analogues of MTX without an alpha-carboxyl, anti-FPGS activity was low and showed minimal variation as the number of CH2 groups between the carboxamide and sulfonate moieties was changed from one to four. In similar aminoalkanephosphonic acid analogues of MTX, anti-FPGS activity was also low, was comparable for two and three CH2 groups between the carboxamide and phosphonate moieties, and was diminished by monoesterification of the phosphonate group. These effects demonstrate that the alpha-carboxyl group of folate analogues is involved in binding to the active site of FPGS, and that an alpha-carboxyl group should be retained as part of the structure of FPGS inhibitors.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Forsch, R A', 'Moran, R G', 'Kohler, W', 'Freisheim, J H']","['Rosowsky A', 'Forsch RA', 'Moran RG', 'Kohler W', 'Freisheim JH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Drug Resistance', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/pathology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Organophosphonates/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Peptide Synthases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Sulfonic Acids/chemical synthesis/pharmacology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1988 Jul;31(7):1326-31. doi: 10.1021/jm00402a012.,"['CA39867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1021/jm00402a012 [doi]'],,"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",,,,,,,,,

The DNA distribution, the rate of aneuploid cells exceeding 5c (5cER), and the square deviation index of DNA values from the normal 2c-peak (2cDI) were recorded. Both variables were of diagnostic and prognostic importance for epithelial tumours, malignant lymphomas, and dysplastic lesions. A rate of 5cER greater than 0 was found in eight of 10 myelodysplastic, but in none of seven control cases. Hypodiploidy was equally pronounced in both groups of patients. The 5cE had the highest discriminative value of all variables calculated. The 2cDI was not significantly different in either group. In pernicious anaemia the 2cDI depended mainly on the percentage of S cells, reflecting the defect of DNA synthesis. In RA with megaloblastosis the 2cDI correlated with the percentage of G2 cells, reflecting G2 arrest. In the myelodysplastic group the 2cDI correlated positively with the length of time until ANL developed, indicating the prognostic relevance of 2cDI. Our findings show that in megaloblastic anaemia DNA image cytometry can distinguish myelodysplasia from pernicious anaemia and that it also provides prognostic information.","['Auffermann, W', 'Fohlmeister, I', 'Bocking, A']","['Auffermann W', 'Fohlmeister I', 'Bocking A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Macrocytic/*diagnosis', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/*diagnosis', 'Anemia, Pernicious/diagnosis', 'Anemia, Refractory/diagnosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/analysis', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Prognosis']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1988 Jun;41(6):604-8. doi: 10.1136/jcp.41.6.604.,,['10.1136/jcp.41.6.604 [doi]'],PMC1141538,"['Department of Pathology, Technical University of Aachen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytic NB104 cells and myelogenous leukemic K562 cells can be productively infected with vaccinia. Whereas NB104 cells were readily lysed, cells from the K562 line stayed persistently infected. Infection of promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells results in an abortive infection in which the virus is uncoated, does not replicate, remains latent and can be rescued by cocultivation with permissive cells. Upon addition of phorbol esters to HL60 cell cultures, viral replication resumed.

The radionuclide ventriculography is the non-invasive trasteale method used to detect early variations in the Left Ventricular Function (LVF) using Anthracyclines. The LVF in 13 pts, with acute non lymphoblastic leukaemia, was analyzed using a Nuclear Stethoscope before and after induction therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) at the total dosage of 135 mg/m2. The mean age of this group was 59 +/- 5 years; 4 of these were female and 9 were male. In all pts the Ejection Fraction (EF) for the systolic phase and the Peak Filling Rate (PFR) for the diastolic phase were evaluated. Results. Before therapy: 1) normal value of EF (74 +/- 4%) in all pts; 2) normal value of PFR in 10 pts and a slightly reduced value in 3 pts (PFR middle 3.30 +/- 0.74 EDV/sec). After therapy: 1) no significant changes in EF (72 +/- 4%); 2) significant reduction of PFR values in all pts (PFR middle 2.71 +/- 0.48 EDV/sec; p less than 0.05).

The cells were studied both immediately after separation from blood and after culture for 24 to 48 h with a range of growth activators. Cells direct from blood were tested for polarization in fetal calf serum (FCS 20%), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA 10(-7)M) and colchicine (10(-5)M). The polarization of lymphocytes from CLL patients with high white cell (WBC) counts (greater than 10 X 10(9)/litre) was very poor in FCS and PMA, though the cells from about half of these patients responded well to colchicine. The response of cells from patients with low white cell counts was the same as that of controls. The growth activators, PHA (1 micrograms/ml), anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3 2.5 ng/ml), Cowan strain Staphylococcus aureus (SAC; 1.5 X 10(7)/ml) and PMA (10(-8)M) induced an increase in the proportion of locomotor lymphocytes from controls and from CLL patients with low white cell counts during 24 h of culture. Cells from patients with high white cell counts showed very little increase in locomotor forms in any activator including PMA and the B cell mitogen SAC. This defect was seen in both polarization assays and collagen gel invasion assays. The findings suggest that CLL lymphocytes have a defect of locomotion demonstrable at two levels: (a) the cells fail to respond by polarizing immediately upon stimulation; colchicine treatment reverses this defect in some cases; (b) they also fail to acquire locomotor capacity during culture with activators of growth.","['Wilkinson, P C', 'Islam, L N', 'Sinclair, D', 'Dagg, J H']","['Wilkinson PC', 'Islam LN', 'Sinclair D', 'Dagg JH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Collagen', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1988 Mar;71(3):497-501.,,,PMC1541664,"['Department of Bacteriology, University of Glasgow, Western Infirmary, UK.']",,,,,,,,,

This study compared the cellular metabolism and cytotoxic properties of dFdC and ara-C in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In wild-type cells, dFdC was significantly more cytotoxic than ara-C after both 4- and 18-h incubations. The 5'-triphosphate of dFdC (dFdCTP) was the major cellular metabolite (85-90%), reaching cellular concentrations up to 20-fold greater than those observed for ara-C 5'-triphosphate at equimolar concentrations of the parent drug. A deoxycytidine kinase-deficient mutant neither accumulated dFdCTP nor showed any cytotoxic response up to drug concentrations of 100 microM. The cytotoxicity of dFdC could be competitively reversed by deoxycytidine further suggesting that dFdC, like ara-C, required phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase for biological activity. Several explanations for the different cellular accumulation of the drug triphosphates were established: (a) nucleoside transport studies demonstrated that the membrane permeation of dFdC was 65% more rapid than that of ara-C; (b) deoxycytidine kinase had a higher affinity for dFdC (Km = 3.6 microM) than for ara-C (Km = 8.8 microM), while the Km for deoxycytidine was 1.4 microM; (c) the elimination of intracellular dFdCTP was biphasic with t1/2 alpha = 3.9 and t1/2 beta greater than 16 h while the degradation of ara-CTP was monophasic and significantly faster (t1/2 = 0.7 h). The comparatively long half-life of dFdCTP was related to the prolonged inhibition of DNA synthesis after removal of exogenous nucleoside. Together these factors contribute to the more potent cytotoxicity of dFdC compared with ara-C.","['Heinemann, V', 'Hertel, L W', 'Grindey, G B', 'Plunkett, W']","['Heinemann V', 'Hertel LW', 'Grindey GB', 'Plunkett W']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Kinetics']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jul 15;48(14):4024-31.,['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",,,,,,,,,

F-344 male rats received three s.c. injections of azoxymethane (15 mg/kg) or normal saline and were then subdivided into high or low fat diet groups. During subsequent serial sacrifices normal colon mucosa, adenomas, and carcinomas were harvested for histology and RNA extraction. Seventy-one RNA samples were analyzed by the Northern blot hybridization procedure using the appropriate 32P-labeled DNA probes. A marked increase in the abundance of c-myc, RaLV, and 30S RNAs were seen in all of the colon tumors, including adenomas and invasive carcinomas. No or a very low level of expression of RaLV and c-myc RNA was found in the flat grossly normal mucosa adjacent to the tumors and in the mucosa of the control rats. Some of the colon tumors also displayed increased levels of c-H-ras, ornithine decarboxylase and beta-actin RNAs but these findings were less striking and more variable than those seen with c-myc, RaLV, and 30S RNAs. These results suggest that increased expression of the c-myc protooncogene and of the endogenous retrovirus-like sequences (RaLV) and 30S are hallmarks of colon carcinogenesis in this model system.","['Guillem, J G', 'Hsieh, L L', ""O'Toole, K M"", 'Forde, K A', 'LoGerfo, P', 'Weinstein, I B']","['Guillem JG', 'Hsieh LL', ""O'Toole KM"", 'Forde KA', 'LoGerfo P', 'Weinstein IB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', 'MO0N1J0SEN (Azoxymethane)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azoxymethane', 'Body Weight', 'Colonic Neoplasms/chemically induced/etiology/*genetics', 'Dietary Fats/adverse effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Intestinal Mucosa/analysis', 'Male', '*Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jul 15;48(14):3964-71.,['CA 02111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",,,,,,,,,

A study of conditions that predispose to leukemia could shed some light on the origin of these translocations and therefore help in clarifying their exact role in the process of neoplastic transformation. Based on this assumption, we studied a group of individuals treated with radiochemotherapy for previous lymphoma and who were at increased risk of developing a secondary leukemia. The group comprised 14 Hodgkin's disease patients, 11 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, and 13 controls. The patients were in remission and had been off therapy for at least 6 months. Chromosomes were studied from phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral lymphocytes and from bone marrow cells by the direct method and after short-term cultures (72 hours). The latter were also exposed to 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Metaphases were scored for chromosome breaks, gaps, and other rearrangements. The percentage of gaps and breaks was significantly higher in patients than in controls. The difference was induced by BrdU and was apparent in bone marrow cells, but not in peripheral lymphocytes. We conclude that individuals exposed to the action of mutagenic agents (radiochemotherapy) have an increased chromosome instability that could be related to their increased risk of developing a secondary leukemia.","['Genuardi, M', 'Zollino, M', 'Serra, A', 'Leone, G', 'Mancini, R', 'Mango, G', 'Neri, G']","['Genuardi M', 'Zollino M', 'Serra A', 'Leone G', 'Mancini R', 'Mango G', 'Neri G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Fragility', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/genetics/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/genetics/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1988 Jul 15;33(2):201-11. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(88)90030-1.,,"['0165-4608(88)90030-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(88)90030-1 [doi]']",,"['Istituto di Genetica Umana, Facolta di Medicina A.

These persons were traced (with 93% success) approximately 10 years later by the NHANESI Epidemiologic Followup Survey, and incidence of malignancy in the interim period was determined. Primary allergy variables were physician-diagnosed asthma, hay fever, hives, food allergy, or other allergies. Excluded were persons with a prior history of cancer and cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer. After adjustment by logistic regression for age, sex, race, and smoking history, allergic history was found to increase the risk of subsequent malignancy (risk odds ratio = 1.40, 95% confidence interval = 1.10-1.77). The specific allergy type with the strongest cancer risk was hives. The cancer group with the strongest allergy association was lymphatic-hematopoietic (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma). The risk odds ratio of developing leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma for persons with hives history was 7.89 (95% CI = 3.13-19.89). These findings suggest that a history of allergy does not protect against subsequent cancer, and may be a risk factor.

Patients who received MOPP as first-line therapy had a significantly worse response rate than those who received MOPP upon relapse after radiotherapy. This difference is reduced when adjustments are made for the presence of the above prognostic factors. A Cox regression analysis showed that Stage IV at presentation and lymphocyte-depleted histology were the most important factors indicating reduced survival.

Cases with DMS and RAEB showed statistically significantly lower WBC counts than normal, whereas cases with lymphoma showed significantly higher values. No disease entity demonstrated changes in mean peroxidase activity (MPA) that were significantly different from normal, although all disease entities, including cases with solid tumors, showed significantly higher (two to severalfold) proportions of cells with high peroxidase (HPX) content, probably as a reflection of a disturbance of normal hemopoiesis with the emergence of younger granulocytic forms.

There were no statistically significant differences for any parameter (WBC counts, MPA, HPX, or LUC) among the paraleukemia subtypes. However, based on the displayed trends, a case presenting with dyserythropoiesis, relatively low WBC counts, abnormal HPX values, and LUC below 10% should be suspected for RAEB, whereas the presence of greater than 10% LUC and almost normal or even slightly elevated WBC counts should suggest a more accelerated phase of RAEB. Unless complicated by a leukemic phase, cases of lymphoma or myeloma did not display changes in any of the parameters analyzed by the H-6000. Similarly, patients with AIDS had no overt changes other than a trend to lower WBC counts with occasionally higher or lower absolute lymphocyte counts than normal. The peripheral blood of patients with solid tumors displayed a slight increase in HPX, suggesting an indirect effect on hemopoiesis since careful workup failed to demonstrate bone marrow involvement.

It is suggested that primary malignant lymphomas of the ovary are extremely rare and that for therapeutic purposes all lymphomas of the ovary should be regarded as local manifestations of systemic disease.","['Fox, H', 'Langley, F A', 'Govan, A D', 'Hill, A S', 'Bennett, M H']","['Fox H', 'Langley FA', 'Govan AD', 'Hill AS', 'Bennett MH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Obstet Gynaecol,British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,7503752,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/etiology/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Obstet Gynaecol. 1988 Apr;95(4):386-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1988.tb06611.x.,,['10.1111/j.1471-0528.1988.tb06611.x [doi]'],,"['Department of Pathology, University of Manchester.']",,,,,,,,,

The mechanism in most cases had an identifiable underlying etiology such as a malignancy, or vascular or cytotoxic damage, with a small percentage being unexplained. Bone marrow necrosis is seen across a wide range of conditions, including sickle cell diseases, AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, anemia, sepsis, and other systemic diseases. Patients at the extremes of age, less than 20 years and greater than 70 years, usually demonstrate only small foci of necrosis (Grade I).

Cells were labeled for 60 min with dense amino acids, and the label was chased for up to 22 h (two replication events for these cells). Nuclei were isolated and treated with formaldehyde to stabilize the histone-histone interactions with a covalent cross-link that produces an octameric complex of two each of H3, H2B, H2A, and H4. This complex was then extracted from the DNA and analyzed on density gradients. The results indicate that new H3,H4 deposits as a tetramer and does not dissociate in the subsequent chases. New H2A,H2B deposited as a dimer and also does not dissociate in subsequent chases. These new histones form hybrid octamers with old histones. On the basis of the new:old ratio in the hybrid octamers, we propose that additional old H2A,H2B from elsewhere in the genome interacts with tetramers of new H3,H4 to form the newly synthesized nucleosomes. It is also observed that 5% of the cross-linked complexes produced by formaldehyde are octamer-octamer (dioctamer). Upon analysis of the density of the dioctamer, the hybrid octamers were found adjacent to octamers that were homogeneous with respect to containing normal density histones. Control experiments are presented to demonstrate that the octamer-octamer cross-links are a product of intrastrand and not interstrand interactions between nucleosomes. These same control experiments also indicate that these procedures do not induce histone exchange during the preparative procedure prior to density gradient analysis. The significance of these results with regard to the dynamics of histone-histone interactions at the replication fork and the potential role in the maintenance of differentiation is discussed.","['Jackson, V']",['Jackson V'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Histones/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism']",1988/03/22 00:00,1988/03/22 00:01,['1988/03/22 00:00'],"['1988/03/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/22 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1988 Mar 22;27(6):2109-20. doi: 10.1021/bi00406a044.,['CA35829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1021/bi00406a044 [doi]'],,"['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",,,,,,,,,

The ever-changing indications.,581-9,"A comparison between a series of splenectomies performed at the University of Virginia Medical Center for hematologic disorders between 1946 and 1962 (Series I) and 1963 and 1982 (Series II) is presented. Four hundred splenectomies (20 per year) were performed between 1963 and 1982 compared with 94 (5.5 per year) between 1946 and 1962. Also noted in Series II was a sharp decline in the number performed each year between 1974 and 1983. The major factor responsible for these observations was the evolution of the staging laparotomy for malignant lymphomas, particularly Hodgkin's disease, and the decline in the average annual incidence of staging laparotomies since 1974. Staging laparotomy currently is rarely done for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Also contributing to the changes noted was an increase in the total number but subsequent fall in the annual incidence of splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis, idiopathic hypersplenism, and myeloproliferative disorders in Series II. The average number of splenectomies for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura increased from 1.1 per year in Series I to 3.6 per year in Series II; the annual incidence during the study period of Series II, however, remained constant. The total number of splenectomies for hairy cell leukemia and Felty's syndrome increased from zero in Series I to 12 and 17, respectively, in Series II, whereas the number of miscellaneous reasons dropped from 29 (1.7 per year) in Series I to 15 (0.75 per year) in Series II. The mortality rate in Series I was 6.3% compared with 4.0% in Series II. No deaths occurred in Series II after 1979. Indications for splenectomy in Series II were for diagnostic purposes in 3.2%, therapeutic in 56.5%, staging in 39.5%, and restaging in 0.8%. Accessory spleens were found in 49 (12.5%) in Series II.","['Wilhelm, M C', 'Jones, R E', 'McGehee, R', 'Mitchener, J S', 'Sandusky, W R', 'Hess, C E']","['Wilhelm MC', 'Jones RE', 'McGehee R', 'Mitchener JS', 'Sandusky WR', 'Hess CE']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Ann Surg,Annals of surgery,0372354,,IM,"['Hematologic Diseases/diagnosis/mortality/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Laparotomy', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/pathology/surgery', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology/surgery', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenectomy/mortality/*trends', 'Virginia']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Surg. 1988 May;207(5):581-9. doi: 10.1097/00000658-198805000-00012.,,['10.1097/00000658-198805000-00012 [doi]'],PMC1493478,"['Department of Surgery, University of Virginia Medical Center, Charlottesville 22908.']",,,,,,,,,

Chronic toxicity studies indicate that B6C3F1 mice are more susceptible than F334/N rats to benzene toxicity. The purpose of the studies presented in this paper was to determine if there were metabolic differences between F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice which might be responsible for this increased susceptibility. Metabolites of benzene in blood, liver, lung, and bone marrow were measured during and following a 6-hr 50 ppm exposure to benzene vapor. Hydroquinone glucuronide, hydroquinone, and muconic acid, which reflect pathways leading to potential toxic metabolites of benzene, were present in much greater concentrations in the mouse than in rat tissues. Phenylsulfate, a detoxified metabolite, and an unknown water-soluble metabolite were present in approximately equal concentrations in these two species. These results indicate that the proportion of benzene metabolized via pathways leading to the formation of potentially toxic metabolites as opposed to detoxification pathways was much higher in B6C3F1 mice than in F344 rats, which may explain the higher susceptibility of mice to benzene-induced hematotoxicity and carcinogenicity.","['Sabourin, P J', 'Bechtold, W E', 'Birnbaum, L S', 'Lucier, G', 'Henderson, R F']","['Sabourin PJ', 'Bechtold WE', 'Birnbaum LS', 'Lucier G', 'Henderson RF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Glucuronates)', '0 (Sulfates)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '3KD92ZL2KH (muconic acid)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'X045WJ989B (Sorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Glucuronates/metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sorbic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Tritium']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1988 Jun 15;94(1):128-40. doi: 10.1016/0041-008x(88)90343-2.,['222-ES-0092/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1016/0041-008x(88)90343-2 [doi]'],,"['Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185.']",,,,,,,,,

This report presents the comparisons of leukemia and nonleukemia cancer mortality risk estimates under the old and new dosimetries. In terms of total kerma (essentially whole-body gamma plus neutron exposure), risk estimates for both classes of cancer are 75-85% higher with the new dosimetry. This and other summary comparisons allow for possible nonlinearity at high estimated doses. Changes are also considered in relation to organ doses and assumptions about the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of neutrons. Without regard to RBE, the risk estimates for total organ dose are essentially unchanged by the dosimetry revision. However, with increasing assumed values of RBE, the estimated low-LET risk decreases much less rapidly under the new dosimetry, due to the smaller neutron component. Thus at an assumed constant RBE of 10, for example, the effect of the dosimetry revision is to increase organ dose risk estimates, relative to those based on the old dosimetry, by 30% for nonleukemia and 80% for leukemia. At an RBE of 20 these increases are 72 and 136%, respectively. A number of other issues are discussed. The city difference in dose is no longer statistically significant, even at an RBE of one. Estimation of RBE is even less feasible with new dosimetry. There is substantial question of the linearity in dose response, in the sense of a leveling off at higher doses. Finally, some indication is given of how risks estimated from this dosimetry and the current data may compare to widely used estimates based largely on the RERF data with the previous dosimetry.","['Preston, D L', 'Pierce, D A']","['Preston DL', 'Pierce DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Risk']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1988 Jun;114(3):437-66.,,,,"['Computer Center, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

Also, we have examined whether it is possible to extrapolate relative risk estimates across species, from mice to humans. The answers to these questions were obtained from determinations of risk estimates for nine neoplasms in female and male C3Hf/Bd and C57BL/6 Bd mice and from data obtained from previous experiments with female BALB/c Bd and RFM mice. The mice were exposed to 137Cs gamma rays at 0.4 Gy/min to doses of 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 Gy. When tumors that were considered the cause of death were examined, both the control and induced mortality rates for the various tumors varied considerably among sexes and strains. The results suggest that in general susceptibility is determined by the control incidence. The relative risk model was significantly superior in five of the tumor types: lung, breast, liver, ovary, and adrenal. Both models appeared to fit myeloid leukemia and Harderian gland tumors, and neither provided good fits for thymic lymphoma and reticulum cell sarcoma. When risk estimates of radiation-induced tumors in humans and mice were compared, it was found that the relative risk estimates for lung, breast, and leukemia were not significantly different between humans and mice. In the case of liver tumors, mice had a higher risk than humans. These results indicate that the relative risk model is the appropriate approach for risk estimation for a number of tumors. The apparent concordance of relative risk estimates between humans and mice for the small number of cancers examined encourages us to undertake further studies.","['Storer, J B', 'Mitchell, T J', 'Fry, R J']","['Storer JB', 'Mitchell TJ', 'Fry RJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Biological', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Risk', 'Species Specificity']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1988 May;114(2):331-53.,['Y-1-CM-20112/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Biology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee 37831.']",['Radiat Res 1989 Feb;117(2):362'],,,,,,,,

Antibodies were produced against each peptide by immunizing rabbits with peptide-KLH conjugates. Each anti-peptide antiserum exhibited good reactivity with the corresponding immunizing peptide (titer: 10(-4) to 10(-5] and four of the six antisera exhibited a distinct preferential murine IgE reactivity compared to four other murine immunoglobulin classes (IgG1, IgG2b, IgM and IgA). In addition, one antiserum (anti-epsilon peptide 5), raised against a peptide with 80% homology to human IgE, reacted comparably with both human and murine IgE. Each IgE-reactive antiserum was screened for the ability to stimulate mediator release from IgE-sensitized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Two of the four IgE-reactive antisera strongly stimulated 3H-serotonin release (anti-epsilon peptides 4 and 5), one antiserum showed weak activity (anti-epsilon peptide 3) and the remaining anti-peptide serum (anti-epsilon peptide 6), which exhibited the highest anti-IgE reactivity, exhibited no detectable stimulatory activity. Individual anti-peptide antibodies were subsequently tested for the potential to bind to receptor-bound IgE. Anti-epsilon peptide 3 was shown to exhibit the least binding, anti-epsilon peptide 6 showed the highest magnitude of binding while anti-epsilon peptides 4 and 5 exhibited intermediate values. We conclude from this study that sequences defined by epsilon-peptides 4 and 5 are not significantly involved in the receptor binding mechanism whereas epsilon-peptide 3 is likely to be most proximal to the IgE-receptor recognition site of those sequences studied. Finally, we suggest that the epsilon-peptide 6 sequence is in such an orientation in cell-bound IgE that, while it is accessible to external antibody, effective cross-linking of the IgE-receptor complex cannot be achieved through this determinant.","['Robertson, M W', 'Liu, F T']","['Robertson MW', 'Liu FT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1988 Feb;25(2):103-13. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(88)90057-0.,"['19747/PHS HHS/United States', '20958/PHS HHS/United States']",['10.1016/0161-5890(88)90057-0 [doi]'],,"['Division of Molecular Biology, Medical Biology Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",,,,,,,,,

It is concluded that LAK cells are not important in mediating the beneficial effects of alpha-IFN in hairy cell leukemia.","['Griffiths, S D', 'Cawley, J C']","['Griffiths SD', 'Cawley JC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Jun;2(6):377-81.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,"['University Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool Hospital, U.K.']",,,,,,,,,

To determine whether M7 megakaryocytic leukemia is a clonal disease and to evaluate the differentiative expression of the cells involved by the leukemia we studied a patient with megakaryocytic leukemia who was heterozygous for the X-chromosome-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The diagnosis of megakaryocytic leukemia was based on results obtained with the immunogold method and ultrastructural studies with the monoclonal anti-Gplla/IIIb antibody, 10E5. Direct testing of blood and marrow mononuclear cells and blood platelets demonstrated only A-type G6PD, whereas skin exhibited both B and A enzymes. The results indicate that the megakaryocytic leukemia in this patient was clonal at the time of study. To determine the differentiative expression of the stem cells, granulocyte/macrophage colony forming units and erythroid burst forming units were cultured and the resultant colonies were tested for G6PD. The results indicate that the stem cells involved by the leukemia exhibited differentiative expression multipotent for the megakaryocytic and granulocytic pathways, but no definitive conclusion could be made regarding the erythroid lineage.","['Najfeld, V', 'Zucker-Franklin, D', 'Adamson, J', 'Singer, J', 'Troy, K', 'Fialkow, P J']","['Najfeld V', 'Zucker-Franklin D', 'Adamson J', 'Singer J', 'Troy K', 'Fialkow PJ']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Clone Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/analysis/genetics', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics/*pathology']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Jun;2(6):351-7.,"['AM 12274/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,"['Polly Annenberg Levee Hematology Center, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York 10029.']",,,,,,,,,

All of the vectors tested carry the neomycin resistance gene and provide for the insertion of a second gene which, in these studies, comprised sequences from the myc or myb oncogenes or the gene encoding granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The vectors utilize two different strategies for the coexpression of the two genes: alternate splicing and the use of a separate internal promoter. We found that expression in hemopoietic cells could be increased by substituting sequences from the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus long terminal repeat for those of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. However, none of the vectors examined was able to express a second gene at levels equivalent to those achieved by the parental vectors carrying only the neomycin resistance gene. The reasons for this varied with the different vectors and included inefficient splicing and/or a reduction in the level of unspliced transcripts upon insertion of a second gene. Although the basis of the latter phenomenon is not clear, it is probably related to the position--near the 5' long terminal repeat--at which the second gene was inserted, since insertion of the same genes near the 3' end of another vector had no effect on viral RNA levels. In an attempt to circumvent some of these problems, we constructed a vector that employs an internal beta-actin promoter. Although this vector could express granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor sequences in a responsive hemopoietic cell line, the level of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor produced was disappointingly low. The results from these studies suggest approaches to the design of improved vectors for effective expression of genes in hemopoietic cells.","['Bowtell, D D', 'Cory, S', 'Johnson, G R', 'Gonda, T J']","['Bowtell DD', 'Cory S', 'Johnson GR', 'Gonda TJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Synthetic', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1988 Jul;62(7):2464-73. doi: 10.1128/JVI.62.7.2464-2473.1988.,"['CA 12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1128/JVI.62.7.2464-2473.1988 [doi]'],PMC253405,"['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,

By comparison with 222 patients greater than 1 year of age, infants were significantly more likely to have monoblastic or myelomonoblastic leukemia (P less than .0001), chloroma (P less than .0001), marked hepatomegaly (P = .001), and high leukocyte count (P = .005) and were less likely to have Auer rods (P less than .001). Each of these features except leukocyte count showed an association with infant ANLL in a multivariate analysis. Twenty-four (83%) of the infants attained a complete remission, a rate that was not significantly different from that of the older children. Even though infants had a significantly higher CNS relapse rate (P = .003), their event-free survival times were no different than those of older children (P = .74). Ten of the infants remain in initial complete remission for 5+ to 112+ months (median, 52+ months). Infants with ANLL did not have a poorer prognosis than older patients in our study; future protocols for this age group should emphasize more effective systemic therapy, preferably including an epipodophyllotoxin, as well as improved treatment for subclinical CNS leukemia.","['Pui, C H', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Schell, M J', 'Mason, C A', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Dahl, G V']","['Pui CH', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Schell MJ', 'Mason CA', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Dahl GV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Brain Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence']",1988/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1988 Jun;6(6):1008-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1988.6.6.1008.,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1200/JCO.1988.6.6.1008 [doi]'],,"[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",,,,,,,,,

Over a 4-week period, each patient received eight intravenous infusions of 3 mg/m2 T101-RTA over 1 h. All infusions were well tolerated. Patients had mild fevers but no other systemic toxicities. In vivo binding of T101-RTA was detected by FACS analysis using anti-mouse Ig-FITC or anti-A chain-FITC antibody conjugates. Saturation of circulating leukemic cell-associated target antigen was achieved in three of the patients. Available CD5 sites per cell dropped precipitously at the completion of infusions in all four patients, returning to within 30% of baseline by 24 h. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed rapid clearance of T101-RTA, with wide interpatient variability in peak serum levels (the highest levels in those patients who saturated their circulating CD5 antigen with immunotoxin). Although no patient developed detectable levels of antimurine antibodies, one patient did have a rising titer of anti-ricin A chain antibody associated with declining peak serum levels of immunotoxin. All patients had a rapid fall in WBC count of less than 24-h duration after each T101-RTA infusion, most likely secondary to the antibody portion of immunotoxin. No sustained benefit could be demonstrated in any patient, possibly because in the absence of an enhancing agent the leukemic cells of all four patients were resistent to T101-RTA at concentrations up to 2,000 ng/ml in vitro.","['Hertler, A A', 'Schlossman, D M', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Laurent, G', 'Jansen, F K', 'Schmidt, C', 'Frankel, A E']","['Hertler AA', 'Schlossman DM', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Laurent G', 'Jansen FK', 'Schmidt C', 'Frankel AE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ricin/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1988 Feb;7(1):97-113.,,,,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",,,,,,,,,

Expression is neither required nor sufficient for tumor development.,4035-41,"Murine tumor cells frequently express retroviral protein p15E, a protein with antiinflammatory activity. This has led to the hypothesis that p15E expression allows nascent tumor cells to escape host immunologic defenses. To evaluate the role of p15E expression in tumorigenesis, NIH3T3 cells transformed by various oncogenes and BALB/c lines transformed by carcinogens or SV40 were examined for p15E expression and tumorigenicity. All of the NIH3T3 transformants and most of the BALB/c transformants did not express p15E, indicating that transformation per se does not inevitably induce the expression of p15E. Although not expressing p15E, some of these transformants were capable of forming tumors in immune competent hosts, indicating that p15E is not universally required for tumor growth. Four of the transformed cell lines negative for p15E expression and deficient in tumor-forming capacity were transfected with a gene coding for Moloney retroviral p15E. Despite the expression of p15E, there was no augmentation of their tumorigenic capacity, showing that p15E is not sufficient to ensure tumor formation by a transformed cell. These results argue against a general role for retroviral p15E expression in tumorigenesis.","['Schmidt, D M', 'Snyderman, R']","['Schmidt DM', 'Snyderman R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (virus structural protein p15)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Gene Products, gag', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/genetics/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/physiology']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Jun 1;140(11):4035-41.,,,,"['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Medicine, Durham, NC 27710.']",,,,,,,,,

When cells are growth-arrested by density inhibition, a technique that places the majority of cells in early G1, c-myc protein, as detected by Western analysis, is expressed at 80% of the level seen in proliferating cells. Steady-state mRNA levels and, to a lesser extent, transcriptional activity of the c-myc gene, parallel the protein findings. Under these conditions, TfR gene expression is much lower than in normally cycling cells. We have previously demonstrated that density-inhibited M1 cells, released from density inhibition and treated with the DNA polymerase alpha inhibitor aphidicolin, remain in G1, but at a point temporally closer to S phase. Cells treated in this manner demonstrate reduced transcriptional activity and expression of the c-myc gene, but TfR gene expression approximates the level found in proliferating cells. These data suggest that neither c-myc nor TfR gene expression is constant throughout the G1 phase of the cell cycle in M1 cells. c-myc gene expression is highest in early G1 and falls to low levels by late G1, while the reverse is true for TfR gene expression.","['Neckers, L M', 'Tsuda, H', 'Weiss, E', 'Pluznik, D H']","['Neckers LM', 'Tsuda H', 'Weiss E', 'Pluznik DH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Genes', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Experimental', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1988 May;135(2):339-44. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041350223.,,['10.1002/jcp.1041350223 [doi]'],,"['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,,

Media folate levels and methotrexate were used to alter intracellular levels of reduced folates, and the distribution among individual reduced folates, so that they could be evaluated in terms of their effects on thymidylate synthesis and cell proliferation. Over the media folate concentration range of 0.25-50 microM, growth rate and thymidylate synthesis remained essentially unchanged while total intracellular reduced folates, determined from the summation of the five individual pools measured, increased approximately 25-fold. The 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate pools accounted for over 90% of the total reduced folate at the highest media folate level, while low media folate resulted in a much more equal distribution among the five reduced folates examined. Methotrexate, over the concentration range of 0.25-30 nM, caused extensive growth and intracellular thymidylate synthesis inhibition at media folate levels used in RPMI 1640 media (2.5 microM) and lower. However, growth inhibition was much less at the highest media folate level used, and thymidylate synthesis was not inhibited to a statistically significant extent. Intracellular reduced folates also responded differently to methotrexate depending upon the level of media folate. Depletion of the thymidylate synthase substrate, methylenetetrahydrofolate, could not account for diminished growth or thymidylate synthesis inhibition, since at 0.25 and 2.5 microM media folate no depletion occurred in response to methotrexate and only slight depletion was observed at 50 microM media folate. Dihydrofolate showed a tendency to increase at each of the media folate levels used with the least increase at the highest folate level. However, the ratio of dihydrofolate to total reduced folates was quantitatively most consistent with thymidylate synthesis and growth inhibition results.","['Bunni, M', 'Doig, M T', 'Donato, H', 'Kesavan, V', 'Priest, D G']","['Bunni M', 'Doig MT', 'Donato H', 'Kesavan V', 'Priest DG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '0SXY5ET48B (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic acid)', '365-07-1 (Thymidine Monophosphate)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*analysis', 'Thymidine Monophosphate/*biosynthesis', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thymine Nucleotides/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jun 15;48(12):3398-404.,['CA-22754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",,,,,,,,,

Molecular weight of MX-2 is 622.07, and it can cross blood-brain barrier because of its high lipid solubility. In this report, we described its in vitro and in vivo effects on brain tumors. The growth of rat 9L and human KNS-42 glioma cells were markedly inhibited by the medium containing more than 1 ng/ml of MX-2. The inhibitory concentration of MX-2 for 50% cell kill was 1.8 ng/ml for 9L cell and 18 ng/ml for KNS-42, respectively. These values were the almost same as those reported with P388 leukemia. In rats with meningeal carcinomatosis induced by intracisternal inoculation of Walker 256 carcinosarcoma cells, the median survival time was significantly prolonged. The increased life span was 40, 40, 40 (p less than 0.01), and 20% (p less than 0.05) in the animals given intravenous MX-2 of 1.5, 1.0, 0.75, and 0.375 mg/kg on day 1, 5, and 9 after tumor inoculation respectively.

The objective was to evaluate the prognostic value of clonal chromosomal abnormalities and of an excess of blasts for early death from acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and/or bone marrow failure (BMF). Patients were subdivided into two main groups: (1) refractory anemia without an excess of blasts (RAWEB), grouping patients with refractory anemia (RA) and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), and (2) refractory anemia with an excess of blasts (RAEB), grouping patients with refractory anemia with an excess of blasts (RAEB) and refractory anemia with an excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt). There were 29 patients with RAWEB and 14 with RAEB. The median time of observation was 26 months for RAWEB and 12 months for RAEB. Ten RAWEB patients (34%) and 11 RAEB patients (78%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities. Among the ten RAWEB patients with clonal abnormalities, one (10%) died from ANLL, while of 19 RAWEB patients with a normal karyotype, two (10%) died from ANLL or BMF. The median survival for patients with RAWEB and an abnormal karyotype was not reached. In contrast, eight of the 11 RAEB patients with clonal chromosomal abnormalities (74%) died from ANLL or BMF. The median survival in this sub-group was 7 months. By using a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, it was determined that a karyotype abnormality was not a significant predictory of survival once the contribution of the RAWEB/RAEB variable was taken into account. Being in the RAEB group was associated with a relative risk of 10.6 of dying from ANLL or BMF (beta = 2.36, standard error (SE) = 0.68, P = .0001). We conclude that classifying patients according to an excess of blasts will lead to a better prediction of survival than determining karyotype abnormality.","['Gyger, M', 'Infante-Rivard, C', ""D'Angelo, G"", 'Forest, L', 'Lussier, P']","['Gyger M', 'Infante-Rivard C', ""D'Angelo G"", 'Forest L', 'Lussier P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/classification/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/classification/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1988 May;28(1):13-20. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830280104.,,['10.1002/ajh.2830280104 [doi]'],,"['Department of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,

A review.,485-92,"Hairy cells (HCs), derived from the peripheral blood and spleen of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) patients, constantly displayed both ruffles and microvilli. HCs which were kept in culture for up to three days exhibited extremely polarized and active surfaces with elongated microvilli and exaggerated ""spiked"" ruffles. Cells derived from 11 cases of HCL were treated with alpha-interferon (IFN) in-vitro and examined by immuno-scanning electron microscopy (immuno-SEM). In 8 cases, up to one-third of the IFN-treated hairy cells displayed deformed surfaces with ""bubbling"" membrane and markedly villous bud-like formations. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), used in conjunction with immuno-gold labeling, facilitated better correlation between these morphological changes and the immunological profiles of the cells before and after interferon treatment in-vitro. Immuno-SEM analyses revealed no remarkable changes in the labeling of HCs with Leu-14 and Leu-M5 MoAbs before and after IFN treatment, even in cases showing membrane changes. However, a significant increase in the labeling intensity for HLA-DR and HLA-DQ was noticed in HCs from cases where IFN-induced membrane changes were evident. A review of the literature on membrane changes in IFN-treated cells proposes that such immuno-ultrastructural alterations might reflect unique interferon-induced membrane reorganization in the target malignant cells.","['Gamliel, H', 'Gurfel, D', 'Wu, S H', 'Golomb, H M']","['Gamliel H', 'Gurfel D', 'Wu SH', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Scanning Microsc,Scanning microscopy,8704616,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Monocytes/ultrastructure', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/pathology']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scanning Microsc. 1988 Mar;2(1):485-92.,,,,"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL 60637.']",,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the broad distribution of H-2 and the intermediate distribution of Qa, TL expression is restricted to cells of T-cell derivation during development in the thymus and is lost when T cells migrate to the periphery. Some mouse strains do not express TL antigens on thymocytes (TL- strains), but leukemias occurring in these mice can have a TL+ phenotype, indicating activation of normally silent TL genes. In transfection studies with H-2 or TL genes in L cells (mouse fibroblasts), H-2 is expressed at high levels, whereas TL is poorly expressed. To identify genetic elements that regulate expression in transfected L cells, chimeric genes were constructed by transposing the 5' and 3' regions of TL and H-2 genes. Antigen expression was not influenced by transposing the cytoplasmic domain and 3' untranslated region. In contrast, interchanging the 5' flanking sequences and exon 1 had a marked influence on antigen expression, with 5' sequences from the H-2 gene increasing TL expression 10- to 50-fold, and 5' sequences from the TL gene markedly decreasing H-2 expression. With both the parental TL gene (p20-TL) and the highly expressed chimeric TL gene (construct 3), levels of TL mRNA and TL antigen correlated with the number of transfected gene copies. However, in cells transfected with equal copy numbers, much higher levels of TL mRNA and TL antigen were found in construct-3 transfectants than in p20-TL transfectants. In addition, there was marked heterogeneity in TL mRNA size in L cells transfected with p20-TL, in contrast to a more homogeneous transcript size in construct-3 transfectants. These results point to regulatory sequences in the 5' flanking region of class I genes that control proper initiation and processing of TL transcripts.","['Obata, Y', 'Stockert, E', 'Chen, Y T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Old, L J']","['Obata Y', 'Stockert E', 'Chen YT', 'Takahashi T', 'Old LJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chimera', 'Genes', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'L Cells/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', '*Transfection']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 May;85(10):3541-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.10.3541.,['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1073/pnas.85.10.3541 [doi]'],PMC280249,"['Laboratory of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center, Chikusaku Nagoya, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

After a median of seven months of therapy, anti-interferon antibodies were found in 31 patients. Fifteen of these patients had only non-neutralizing antibodies, but antibody from the other 16 neutralized the antiviral effects of recombinant interferon alfa-2a in vitro. In no case, however, did neutralizing antibody inhibit the antiviral effects of purified natural interferon alfa. Clinical resistance to interferon of various degrees was present in 6 of 16 patients with neutralizing antibodies; the remaining 10 patients and all 20 patients without antibody continue to respond after a minimum of two years of therapy. In all the patients with interferon resistance, antibody was present when it developed. These data suggest that the development of clinical resistance to interferon alfa-2a in hairy-cell leukemia is not necessarily related to an altered cellular response to interferon.

In order to determine if the predicted amino acid sequences of these proteoglycans are identical as well as to isolate a full length cDNA encoding a rat secretory granule proteoglycan, a cDNA library was prepared from RBL-1 cells and screened with the 165-base pair 5'----XmnI fragment of pPG-1, a partial cDNA which encodes the rat L2 cell proteoglycan peptide core. Based on the consensus nucleotide sequence of two full length RBL-1 cell-derived cDNAs, the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA that is expressed in RBL-1 cells is shorter than that expressed in the rat L2 cells although the coding regions of the mRNAs from the two cell types are identical. These findings indicate that the targeting of proteoglycans to an intracellular or extracellular compartment is a cell-specific event which is independent of the translated peptide core. Since the RBL-1 cell and the rat L2 cell proteoglycans have different types of glycosaminoglycans bound to them, it can also be concluded that the selection of the type of glycosaminoglycan that will be synthesized onto a peptide core is a cell-specific event which is not exclusively dependent on the translated peptide core. When the predicted amino acid sequence of the RBL-1 cell proteoglycan peptide core was compared to the predicted sequence of the homologous human molecule from HL-60 cells, 48% of the amino acids were identical. The N terminus was the most highly conserved area of the molecule. This region of the peptide core, which precedes the serine-glycine repeat region, is likely to be of critical importance for the biosynthesis and/or function of these proteoglycans. Analysis of 10 different mouse/hamster somatic cell hybrid lines with a SspI----3' fragment of the rat L2 cell cDNA revealed that, as in the human, the gene that encodes the mouse analogue of this peptide core resides on chromosome 10.","['Avraham, S', 'Stevens, R L', 'Gartner, M C', 'Austen, K F', 'Lalley, P A', 'Weis, J H']","['Avraham S', 'Stevens RL', 'Gartner MC', 'Austen KF', 'Lalley PA', 'Weis JH']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (secretory granule proteoglycan)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basophils', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Proteoglycans/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1988/05/25 00:00,1988/05/25 00:01,['1988/05/25 00:00'],"['1988/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 May 25;263(15):7292-6.,"['AI-23401/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-23483/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-24158/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['S0021-9258(18)68640-5 [pii]'],,"['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",,['GENBANK/J03224'],,,,,,,

The finding that an Acivicin-resistant subline of P388 cells which exhibited good transport of DON showed negligible transport of Acivicin suggests different modes of resistance towards the two glutamine antimetabolites.","['Huber, K R', 'Rosenfeld, H', 'Roberts, J']","['Huber KR', 'Rosenfeld H', 'Roberts J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '03J0H273KZ (Diazooxonorleucine)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Antimetabolites', 'Azo Compounds/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Diazooxonorleucine/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutamine/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Oxazoles/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism']",1988/05/15 00:00,1988/05/15 00:01,['1988/05/15 00:00'],"['1988/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1988 May 15;41(5):752-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910410519.,,['10.1002/ijc.2910410519 [doi]'],,"['Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia 29208.']",,,,,,,,,

Studies in vitro have suggested that first-pass metabolism can be saturated at higher doses of 6MP. To determine whether saturation occurs in vivo at clinically used doses and whether bioavailability can be enhanced by increasing the dose, the bioavailability of different doses of 6MP was studied first in rhesus monkeys and then in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission. In monkeys a higher dose of 6MP resulted in enhanced bioavailability, whereas in patients the mean relative bioavailability at the higher dose was significantly less. However, all patients achieved cytocidal (greater than 1 to 10 mumol/L) plasma concentrations at the higher dose without manifesting significant clinical toxicity.

Micromolar Km values were estimated with both propionaldehyde (Km = 5 microM) and 4-hydroxy cyclophosphamide (4-OH CPA) (Km = 4 microM) as substrates, indicating that this isozyme is capable of oxidizing the activated cyclophosphamide intermediate 4-hydroxy CPA/aldophosphamide to carboxyphosphamide. This isozyme is also potently inhibited by disulfiram (Ki = 6 microM) and 4-(diethylamino)benzaldehyde (Ki = 0.04 microM). Both of these inhibitors are capable of sensitizing L1210/CPA cells to activated CPA in clonogenic survival assays. Thus, the increased levels of only the cytosolic ALDH isoform in L1210/CPA cells appear to be the single phenotypic difference necessary for conferring resistance to CPA. Monospecific antibodies to the L1210/CPA isozyme have been used in Western blot analysis to detect nanogram levels of ALDH in cell and tissue extracts. These antibodies cross-react with the cytosolic isozyme in P388/CPA cells, mouse liver, mouse small intestine, and the 1C1C7 hepatoma cell line, whereas no ALDH is detected in sensitive L1210 or P388 cells.

Fifty-one patients (84%) presented with thromboembolic complications, and eight patients (13%) with hemorrhages. In seven patients (12%), a thrombocytosis was detected accidentally. Disturbances of the microcirculation (67%), mainly of the fingers and toes (53%), were the most frequent thromboembolic symptoms. The mean age of all patients was 58 years (male patients, 61 years; female patients, 56 years). The average platelet count at diagnosis was 897,000/microliter. The average maximal platelet count was 1.231 X 10(6)/microliter (range, 500,000/microliter to 4 X 10(6)/microliter). Seventy-two percent had a moderate leukocytosis (average, 12,400/microliter), 34% a splenomegaly, 29% a hepatomegaly. Signs of hypermetabolism were infrequent, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid elevations, if present, were moderate. Bleeding time and viscosity were normal in most patients. Spontaneous platelet aggregation was increased in 81% of patients (n = 40). Platelet aggregation studies with the aggregation inducing substances adenosine diphosphonate (ADP), platelet activating factor (PAF), thrombin, collagen, and adrenalin showed hypoaggregation in most patients. Adrenalin-induced aggregation distinguished best between ET-patients and reactive thrombocytosis showing hypoaggregation in all ET-patients tested (n = 16) and in none of 22 controls. Bone marrow studies were performed in 57 patients. The histologic studies (done in 49 patients) were consistent with a chronic myeloproliferative disorder in all cases. In 41 cases (84%) the picture of a megakaryocytic myelosis was found, in 12 of these a granulocyte-rich form of megakaryocytic myelosis. Cytologic studies only (eight patients) did not differentiate ET well from reactive thrombocytosis. Platelet aggregation studies and bone marrow histology may be of help in the diagnosis of difficult cases of thrombocytosis. The Philadelphia status was negative in all cases studied (14 patients). Fourteen patients died. The causes of death were thromboembolic complications in probably 11 and acute leukemia in two patients. The probability of 10-year survival is 64% after a mean follow-up time of approximately 5 years.

The timing of the peripheral hematologic remission of individual blood elements was similar to that reported for other interferons, and 60% of patients attained a complete peripheral hematologic remission at 9 months. Two patients relapsed despite a good initial response to IFN. No anti-IFN antibodies could be detected in their sera. In vitro studies of colony formation from the peripheral blood of all responding patients showed that rIFN-alpha-C did not inhibit the growth of colonies but favorably affected the maturation of their elements towards monocytes, granulocytes, and erythroid elements. The relapsing patient examined initially experienced a similar beneficial in vitro response which paralleled his in vivo improvement. During relapse, rIFN-alpha-C inhibited both the colony formation and the myelomonocytic differentiation in the in vitro cultures. These findings may suggest that the acquired resistance to IFN in our patient could be due either to an acquired stem cell maturation arrest in response to IFN or to emergence of a new clone indifferent to IFN-alpha-C differentiation effect.","['Aderka, D', 'Michalevicz, R', 'Daniel, Y', 'Levo, Y', 'Douer, D', 'Ben-Bassat, I', 'Ramot, B', 'Shaklai, M', 'Prokocimer, M', 'Berrebi, A']","['Aderka D', 'Michalevicz R', 'Daniel Y', 'Levo Y', 'Douer D', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Ramot B', 'Shaklai M', 'Prokocimer M', 'Berrebi A', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Spleen/pathology']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Jun 1;61(11):2207-13. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880601)61:11<2207::aid-cncr2820611114>3.0.co;2-q.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19880601)61:11<2207::aid-cncr2820611114>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],,"['Department of Medicine T, Ichilov Hospital, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,

The most potent inhibitors were 5'-deoxy-5'-[N-methyl-N-[2-(aminooxy)ethyl]amino]adenosine (MAOEA) and 5'-deoxy-5'-[N-methyl-N-(3-hydrazinopropyl)amino]adenosine (MHZPA), which had I50 values of 400 nM and 70 nM, respectively, when added directly to the assay medium under standard conditions. These compounds were irreversible inactivators of the enzyme, and more than 95% of the activity was lost within 15 min of exposure to 5 microM MAOEA or 0.5 microM MHZPA. Both inhibitors led to a large reduction in the content of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine in L1210 cells and to a substantial decrease in the production of 5'-(methylthio)adenosine by these cells. These results are consistent with their bringing about an inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity in the cell which leads to a reduction in the synthesis of spermidine and spermine. Analysis of the polyamine content in L1210 cells exposed to 100 microM MAOEA or 50 microM MHZPA showed that this was the case and that putrescine levels were greatly increased while spermidine and spermine content declined. The combined application of 100 microM MAOEA and 5 mM alpha-(difluoromethyl)ornithine (an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor) to L1210 cells completely prevented the synthesis of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine for up to 48 h. The reduction in polyamine content brought about by MHZPA or MAOEA could be partially prevented by the addition of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to the culture medium. These inhibitors also brought about an inhibition of cell growth which could be reversed by the addition of spermidine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Pegg, A E', 'Jones, D B', 'Secrist, J A 3rd']","['Pegg AE', 'Jones DB', 'Secrist JA 3rd']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', ""112621-39-3 (5'-deoxy-5'-(N-methyl-N-(2-(aminooxy)ethyl)amino)adenosine)"", ""112621-42-8 (5'-deoxy-5'-(N-methyl-N-(3-hydrazinopropyl)amino)adenosine)"", 'EC 4.1.1.- (Carboxy-Lyases)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Carboxy-Lyases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Prostate/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1988/03/08 00:00,1988/03/08 00:01,['1988/03/08 00:00'],"['1988/03/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/08 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1988 Mar 8;27(5):1408-15. doi: 10.1021/bi00405a003.,"['CA-37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI-42555/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1021/bi00405a003 [doi]'],,"['Department of Physiology, Milton S.

Oxygen consumption by this lipoxygenase was strictly dependent upon Ca2+, ATP and 5-HPETE. Removal of any of these three cofactors caused a complete inhibition of enzyme activity. Addition of the missing cofactor instantly restored the 5-lipoxygenase-dependent consumption of oxygen which remained linear for 10-20 s. Later on the velocity of the reaction decreased and after 2-3 min the enzyme became inactivated. Kinetic data were obtained from the initial velocity of the reaction using constant and saturating concentrations of CaCl2 and ATP.

Therapy with these DNA cross-linking agents is limited by their toxic side effects, cumulative and delayed bone marrow toxicity being the main dose-limiting one. Since the intrinsic anti-tumour activity of the nitrosourea group is very high, coupling to appropriate carrier molecules represents a challenge for target-orientated chemotherapy. Many human tumours contain receptors for steroid hormones. Therefore, 2-chloroethyl-N-nitroso-carbamoyl(CNC)-amino acid derivatives have been developed that are linked to steroid hormones. In the series of oestradiol (E2)-linked analogues CNC-L-alanine-E2-17-ester was significantly superior to other E2-linked congeners and to the unlinked equimolar mixture when tested against hormone-dependent N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary carcinoma of the rat. Relevance of E2 receptor contents for therapy with E2-linked drugs is evidenced by loss of superiority of this analogue in hormone-independent mammary carcinomas. Some androgen-linked CNC-amino acids showed substantial affinity to the androgen receptor and in part also to the progesterone receptor. A preliminary study in rat leukaemia L5222 revealed the CNC-L-alanine-dihydrotestosterone-17-ester to be highly active.

In further assays, using the water-soluble salt sodium linoleate, we found that sodium linoleate was more effective in vitro in killing human chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes than normal lymphocytes and mouse leukemic thymocytes than normal thymocytes. We also found that a single intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg of sodium linoleate into Swiss-Webster mice one day after the mice were inoculated with EAT cells increased the median survival from 18 (in the controls) to 48 days (in the treated mice) and prevented tumor growth completely in over 40% of the treated mice.

Dose-response curves showed that the two modalities interact to make the combination more cytotoxic than the sum of the separate individual treatments, and that a determining factor is the intracellular concentration of HpD of tumour cells during hyperthermia. High cytotoxic (synergistic) effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) were obtained when PDT was performed after hyperthermia following HpD administration. However, only additive cytotoxic effects were found, when hyperthermia was performed after HpD administration and PDT. These cytotoxic data were supported by DNA damage (the increase in single-stranded DNA) as revealed by flow cytometry in cells stained with acridine orange (AO). These in vitro experiments suggest that clinical applications of PDT after hyperthermia with HpD injection might be useful.","['Miyoshi, N', 'Matsumoto, N', 'Hisazumi, H', 'Fukuda, M']","['Miyoshi N', 'Matsumoto N', 'Hisazumi H', 'Fukuda M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Hyperthermia,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",8508395,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA Damage', '*Hematoporphyrin Photoradiation', 'Hot Temperature/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Mice', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hyperthermia. 1988 Mar-Apr;4(2):203-9. doi: 10.3109/02656738809029310.,,['10.3109/02656738809029310 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pathology, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

One class, that of oncogenes, acts by virtue of abnormal or elevated activity. It is operative primarily in leukemias and lymphomas. There is no evidence yet that genetic predisposition to these neoplasms can be imparted by oncogene mutations in the germline. However, there are conditions that predispose to these tumors, primarily through excessive chromosomal breakage and rearrangement. The other class, that of anti-oncogenes, is recessive in oncogenesis; cancer results when both normal copies have been mutated or deleted. Some persons carry one such mutation in the germline and are highly susceptible to tumor because only one somatic event is necessary. Some children, even though carrying no such mutation in the germline, can acquire tumor as a result of two somatic events. Most solid tumors in children seem to involve initiation through the loss of both copies of an anti-oncogene.","['Knudson, A G']",['Knudson AG'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1988;75(1):135-8.,,,,"['Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']",,,,,,,,,

The most frequent first neoplasm is retinoblastoma, followed by Hodgkin's disease. The second neoplasms are essentially sarcomas mostly associated with radiation therapy. Leukemias are also frequent, apparently essentially induced by alkylating agents. The incidence of SMN depends on the primary and on the treatment given, thus it varies according to the studied cohorts. In the most recently analysed material of the LESG, the 20-year incidence was 8%. Children treated for a first neoplasm have an elevated risk of developing a SMN.

In addition this agent has been shown to be equally toxic toward parental and daunorubicin-resistant P388 cells in vitro. These resistant cells are highly cross-resistant to the established anti-mitotic agents vincristine and vinblastine. Drug accumulation studies in cells have shown that whereas resistance in this cell line is associated with decreased drug accumulation in the case of daunorubicin, vincristine and vinblastine, this effect is much less pronounced for amphethinile. It is proposed that amphethinile is a poor substrate for the drug efflux process associated with the pleiotropic resistance mechanism operating in these cells. The data suggest that cell sensitivity towards amphethinile differs qualitatively from that of the vinca alkaloids and anthracycline. Pharmacokinetic studies in male mice were undertaken.

Evaluation of daunomycin conjugates in vivo against L1210 leukaemia.,147-56,"DBA2 mice were inoculated i.p. with 10(5)L1210 cells. Animals subsequently treated with daunomycin (single i.p. dose, 0.25-5.0 mg kg-1) all died. The maximum increase in mean survival time observed was approximately 135%. Animals treated with N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers conjugated to daunomycin (DNM) showed a significant increase in mean survival time when the polymer-drug linkage was biodegradable (i.e., Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly). Such treatment also produced a number of long term survivors (greater than 50 days). In contrast, HPMA copolymer conjugated to DNM via a non-degradable linkage (Gly-Gly) produced no increase in survival time relative to untreated control animals. The effect observed with biodegradable HPMA copolymer-DNM conjugates was dependent on the concentration of conjugated drug administered (optimum greater than 5 mg kg-1); the frequency of administration (multiple doses were more effective than single); the timing of administration (single doses given on days 1 and 3 were most effective); and the site of tumour inoculation and route of drug administration. Biodegradable HPMA copolymer-DNM conjugates administered i.p. were active against L1210 inoculated s.c. at higher doses than required to curb a peritoneal tumour. Under certain experimental conditions polymer-DNM conjugates containing fucosylamine or galactosamine proved more active than conjugates without the carbohydrate moeity. The mechanism of drug-conjugate action in vivo is at present unclear. Radioiodination of polymer showed approximately 75% of polymer-drug conjugate to be excreted 24 h after i.p. administration. Synthesis of HPMA conjugates containing [3H]DNM showed that polymer containing Gly-Gly-[3H]DNM was excreted (60% of radioactivity in the urine, 24 h) in macromolecular form. In contrast polymer containing Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly-[3H]DNM was largely excreted in the form of low molecular weight species.","['Duncan, R', 'Kopeckova, P', 'Strohalm, J', 'Hume, I C', 'Lloyd, J B', 'Kopecek, J']","['Duncan R', 'Kopeckova P', 'Strohalm J', 'Hume IC', 'Lloyd JB', 'Kopecek J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', 'R3F262Z4E0 (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Carriers', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1988 Feb;57(2):147-56. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1988.31.,,['10.1038/bjc.1988.31 [doi]'],PMC2246422,"['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Keele, Staffordshire, UK.']",,,,,,,,,

Cultured cells in exponential phase growth were more susceptible to hydralazine cytotoxicity than stationary phase (G0) cells. Growth inhibition was associated with a dose-related slowdown of cell progression through S phase and was observed prior to a decrease of cell viability. At high drug concentrations, progression in all phases of the cell cycle was partially or totally inhibited. Hydralazine did not have an effect on the proliferation and differentiation of testicular germ cells in spontaneously hypertensive rats receiving 0-90 mg/kg/day (up to 20 times the dose used in humans) of hydralazine for a 12-week period. Hydralazine-exposed, histone-containing somatic cells and protamine-containing sperm cells failed to show any alterations in stainability with a DNA-intercalating dye nor in the susceptibility of nuclear DNA to undergo acid-induced denaturation in situ. The data suggest that hydralazine causes a dose-related suppression of mammalian cell growth with S phase appearing to be the most susceptible to hydralazine cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the interaction of hydralazine with chromatin at concentrations leading to antigenicity did not inhibit DNA staining with the intercalating dye acridine orange, suggesting that the drug does not competitively intercalate at a detectable level. Association of hydralazine with chromatin did not cause a detectable level of stabilization or destabilization of the DNA to denaturation in situ.","['Evenson, D P', 'Fasbender, A J']","['Evenson DP', 'Fasbender AJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Chromatin)', '26NAK24LS8 (Hydralazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Damage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydralazine/*toxicity', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Testis/drug effects']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1988 Apr;93(2):339-50. doi: 10.1016/0041-008x(88)90134-2.,,"['0041-008X(88)90134-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0041-008x(88)90134-2 [doi]']",,"['Department of Chemistry, South Dakota State University, Brookings 57007.']",,,,,,,,,

We now report the effect of MRA-CN (and DOX) on leukemia cell lines established from patients with common, T-cell, and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as with monoblastic leukemia. The effect of MRA-CN on the leukemia cells was compared to its toxicity on normal myeloid progenitors (therapeutic ratio) and to the effect of DOX on the leukemia and normal cells. MRA-CN was found to be 100 times more potent than DOX against normal myeloid progenitors--colony-forming units, granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM)--and 40-240 times more potent than DOX against leukemia cell lines. In addition, the therapeutic ratio was uniformly greater than 1, indicating that each leukemia cell line tested was more sensitive than CFU-GM to MRA-CN in vitro. There was a lack of correlation between MRA-CN and DOX at a drug concentration at which the colony formation is inhibited by 50% in the leukemia cell lines (correlation coefficient = 0.38), which supported the previous reports of non-cross-resistance between these two agents. The favorable therapeutic ratio, the non-cross-resistance with DOX, and the previously described lack of cardiac toxicity all make MRA-CN an attractive candidate for clinical trials in patients with acute leukemia.","['Beckman, R A', 'McFall, P J', 'Sikic, B I', 'Smith, S D']","['Beckman RA', 'McFall PJ', 'Sikic BI', 'Smith SD']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', ""88254-07-3 (3'-deamino-3'-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)doxorubicin)""]",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/05/04 00:00,1988/05/04 00:01,['1988/05/04 00:00'],"['1988/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1988 May 4;80(5):361-5. doi: 10.1093/jnci/80.5.361.,"['CA-41124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1093/jnci/80.5.361 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305.']",,,,,,,,,

High risks of cancers of the esophagus (RR = 3.5, n = 15) and liver (RR = 2.4, n = 48) were not consistent with a radiation effect since risk did not vary by duration of employment. This finding suggested that some differences might exist between groups of hospital workers in social class, alcohol intake, dietary habits, and other risk factors. No excess lung cancer (RR = 0.9, n = 22) or multiple myeloma (n = 0) was observed. Significant excesses of leukemia and cancers of the breast and thyroid occurred among x-ray workers first employed prior to 1960 when radiation exposures in China were high.

However, healthy carriers of this microorganism have been found, particularly healthy neonates and small children. Various typing systems have been used to clarify the epidemiology of C. difficile. We used the electrophoretic patterns of EDTA-extracted proteins to characterize C. difficile strains from various sources. Altogether, 110 strains were studied, including 2 reference strains, and 21 different protein profiles were obtained. However, two patterns were the most common: the group 2 pattern, characterized by a major 35-kilodalton polypeptide band, and the group 5 pattern, identified by principal bands of 37 and 56 kilodaltons. The group 2 pattern was characteristic of strains isolated during hospital outbreaks and from sporadic cases of pseudomembranous colitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The group 5 pattern was obtained only from isolates from healthy neonates and children. A correlation between electrophoretic characteristics and virulence can be hypothesized, namely that group 2 strains are more prone to induce diseases and cause outbreaks. It is noteworthy that strains isolated from children with diarrhea of unknown etiology, not related to antibiotic use, belong to the ""virulent"" group 2; strains from leukemic patients showed a variety of different patterns, and only two belong to group 2. This characterization can be used to aid studies on the virulence and clinical significance of C. difficile.","['Pantosti, A', 'Cerquetti, M', 'Gianfrilli, P M']","['Pantosti A', 'Cerquetti M', 'Gianfrilli PM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,['0 (Bacterial Proteins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bacterial Proteins/*analysis', 'Carrier State/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Clostridium/analysis/*classification', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/*microbiology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/complications']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1988 Mar;26(3):540-3. doi: 10.1128/jcm.26.3.540-543.1988.,,['10.1128/jcm.26.3.540-543.1988 [doi]'],PMC266328,"['Laboratory of Medical Bacteriology and Mycology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,

An examination of the sites of phosphorylation of substrates of protein tyrosine kinases indicated a relatively high probability of the beta-turn as the secondary structural feature at these sites. We have, therefore, synthesized three tyrosine peptides: Ala-Pro-Tyr-Gly-NHCH3, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Ala-NHCH3, and Pro-Gly-Ala-Tyr-NH2, of which the first two peptides, but not the third, would be expected to contain the tyrosine residue in a beta-turn. Circular dichroism and infrared spectral data on the peptides confirmed this expectation. Phosphorylation data on the peptides by the tyrosine kinase showed that the two beta-turn peptides were phosphorylated with Vmax and Km values comparable to those of the 13-residue-long arginine-containing synthetic peptide substrate having a sequence homologous to the autophosphorylation site of the LSTRA kinase. The peptides used here contain the shortest sequence length among the reported synthetic peptide substrates for protein tyrosine kinases.

To investigate whether amine oxidase is essential for NKT-01 and SGL to exhibit their antiproliferative activities or not, the in vitro activities of NKT-01, SGL and polyamines against L1210 cells were examined in the presence of calf or human serum. Polyamines exhibited antiproliferative activity only in the presence of calf serum, while NKT-01 and SGL inhibited cell growth in the presence of both calf and human serum. In the presence of calf serum the activity of NKT-01 was inhibited by aminoguanidine, an amine oxidase inhibitor. Aminoguanidine did not inhibit the activity of NKT-01 in the presence of human serum. The activity of NKT-01 was shown at much lower concentrations in the presence of human serum than that in the presence of calf serum, and was strongly dependent on incubation time. The in vivo activities of NKT-01, SGL and SGL derivatives correlated with their in vitro activities in the presence of human serum. These results suggest that the in vivo antitumor activities of NKT-01, SGL and SGL derivatives may be attributed to a mechanism different from those of amine oxidase-oxidized product and represent a novel growth inhibitory action.","['Kuramochi, H', 'Hiratsuka, M', 'Nagamine, S', 'Takahashi, K', 'Nakamura, T', 'Takeuchi, T', 'Umezawa, H']","['Kuramochi H', 'Hiratsuka M', 'Nagamine S', 'Takahashi K', 'Nakamura T', 'Takeuchi T', 'Umezawa H']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,"['0 (Guanidines)', '71O2A541CU (spergualin)', 'EC 1.4.3.21 (Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing))', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'SCQ4EZQ113 (pimagedine)', 'UJ0ZJ76DO9 (gusperimus)']",IM,"['*Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Guanidines/antagonists & inhibitors/blood/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Species Specificity']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 1988 Feb;41(2):234-8. doi: 10.7164/antibiotics.41.234.,,['10.7164/antibiotics.41.234 [doi]'],,"['Research Laboratories, Pharmaceuticals Group, Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,

Mice receiving DOX + CPZ were similar to DOX till day 25, but subsequently died earlier (MST of 27 and 34 days, for DOX 6 and 12 mg/kg). At death or day 60, 31% (5/16) of DOX mice and 88% (14/16) of DOX + CPZ had macroscopic tumours (P less than 0.005, both DOX dose groups combined). However, only 19% (3/16) of DOX and 6% (1/16) of DOX + CPZ had tumours in the abdominal cavity, the others being in the abdominal wall close to the site of injection.

This block may be caused by decreased local delivery of DOX, due to the hypothermia produced by CPZ.","['Gailis, L', 'Dumas, L', 'Page, M']","['Gailis L', 'Dumas L', 'Page M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Chlorpromazine/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1988 Feb;24(2):169-73. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(88)90248-9.,,['10.1016/0277-5379(88)90248-9 [doi]'],,"['Institut de Cardiologie de Quebec, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,

It is a member of a gene family comprising about 10 closely related genes. In order to characterize mRNAs transcribed from individual genes we have identified by DNA and RNA hybridization experiments, gene-specific sequences from the 3' noncoding regions of CEA, and of nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA) mRNAs, which have been recently cloned. With these probes, CEA mRNAs with lengths of 3.5 and 3.0 kilobases and an NCA mRNA species of 2.5 kilobases were identified in various human tumors. A 2.2-kilobase mRNA species, however, could only be detected in leukocytes of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia by hybridization with a probe from the immunoglobulin-like repeat domain of CEA. This region is known to be very similar among the various members of the CEA gene family, and indeed the probe hybridizes with all four mRNA species. In situ hybridization with a cross-hybridizing probe from the NCA gene localized the members of the CEA gene family to the short and to the long arm of chromosome 19.

When 10(4) P388 leukemia cells were inoculated i.p. on day 0 in BALB/c x DBA/2 F1 mice, all mice died within 18 days if left untreated. Murine IFN-alpha/beta (5 x 10(5) units) injected daily i.p. on days 5-9 resulted in 20% increase in life span (ILS) (P less than 0.0001). Cyclophosphamide (CY) (100, 33, or 15 mg/kg) was injected i.p. once 2 days before start (day 3), simultaneously with start (day 5), or 2 days after cessation of IFN treatment (day 11). When 100 mg/kg CY alone were injected on day 3 or 5, all mice survived more than 90 days and were considered cured. When IFN was given after this curative dose of CY, more tumor deaths occurred; up to 100% of the mice died when 100 mg/kg CY on day 3 were combined with IFN on days 5-9. Increased mortality with the combination was not due to added toxicity of CY and IFN since the mice developed abdominal tumors and ascites. Mice not inoculated with tumor cells and treated similarly suffered only a transient weight loss, had only moderate white count depression, and did not die. When IFN was injected before CY on days 1-5 (instead of days 5-9), IFN did not alter the effectiveness of CY (100 mg/kg on day 5). In contrast to these results, when CY (100 mg/kg) was administered on day 11, after IFN (days 5-9), an augmented survival occurred with 119% ILS and 40% cures (CY alone on day 11 resulted in 69% ILS but no cures). In addition, when CY at a lower dose of 15 mg/kg was injected in combination with IFN, survival was consistently augmented by IFN; e.g., CY alone on day 3 caused 40% ILS and with IFN (days 5-9) 60% ILS (P less than 0.0001). Qualitatively similar findings were obtained when P388 leukemia cells were inoculated s.c. and the drugs delivered i.p. Inhibition by IFN of antitumor effects of a second alkylating agent, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, was also identified. Thus, IFN-alpha/beta potentiated suboptimal CY effects for P388 leukemia, had neutral effects when injected before CY treatment, and inhibited antitumor activity of curative CY or nitrosourea schedules.","['Borden, E C', 'Sidky, Y A', 'Hatcher, J F', 'Bryan, G T']","['Borden EC', 'Sidky YA', 'Hatcher JF', 'Bryan GT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 May 1;48(9):2329-34.,,,,"['Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin Clinical Cancer Center, Madison 53792.']",,,,,,,,,

The OKT9 staining also was loosely correlated with the three morphologic grades of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas identified by the International Working Formulation. In general, higher grade lymphomas more often and more intensely expressed the T9 antigen. However, transferrin receptor expression by certain histologic subtypes of lymphoma did not correlate with their morphologic grade: low-grade follicular lymphomas expressed the T9 antigen more frequently than diffuse low-grade lymphomas; diffuse small cleaved cell lymphomas were stained by OKT9 less often than other histologic subtypes of intermediate-grade lymphomas; and diffuse immunoblastic lymphomas expressed transferrin receptors less often than the other high-grade histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Intermediate lymphocytic lymphomas, not recognized in the International Working Formulation, were infrequently and weakly stained by OKT9 in a manner similar to diffuse low-grade lymphomas.

Chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera or unclassifiable myeloproliferative disorders were in no case associated with monoclonal gammopathy. One patient with idiopathic myelofibrosis had primarily coexistent IgG-lambda paraproteinemia and increasing osteolytic lesions; histologic evidence of multiple myeloma, however, was insufficient. In the second patient the interval between diagnosis of idiopathic myelofibrosis and IgG-kappa paraproteinemia was 11 years. After a stable period of 9 years' duration the paraprotein level rapidly increased, associated with depression of normal background immunoglobulins and progressive bone marrow failure. The exact nature of this patient's malignant plasma cell dyscrasia remained uncertain. In the third case benign monoclonal gammopathy of the IgM-lambda type was diagnosed 13 years after idiopathic myelofibrosis. A review of the literature confirms a remarkably high incidence of monoclonal gammopathies in idiopathic myelofibrosis. Benign monoclonal gammopathy seems to occur in at least 8% of the patients while only a few cases of concomitant multiple myeloma have been reported. It may be speculated that plasma cell dyscrasias in idiopathic myelofibrosis reflect involvement of the lymphoid lineage in the neoplastic stem cell disorder.","['Duhrsen, U', 'Uppenkamp, M', 'Meusers, P', 'Konig, E', 'Brittinger, G']","['Duhrsen U', 'Uppenkamp M', 'Meusers P', 'Konig E', 'Brittinger G']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,,IM,"['Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Paraproteinemias/*complications', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1988 Mar;56(3):97-102. doi: 10.1007/BF00320010.,,['10.1007/BF00320010 [doi]'],,"['Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Universitat Essen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,

These drug-induced DNA strand breaks initiate poorly defined cell processes which result in lethality. To explore the mechanism of etoposide cytotoxicity, we studied the effect of protein synthesis inhibitor on Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts and CCRF-CEM and L1210 leukemia cells by exposing these cell lines to cycloheximide for various periods of time prior to etoposide challenge. Cycloheximide alone during these periods of exposure was not cytotoxic; however, it conferred increasing cytoprotection from etoposide in a time-dependent fashion when it preceded etoposide. Although cycloheximide did cause a decrease in enzyme content and in etoposide-induced DNA cleavage of Balb/C 3T3 and the CCRF-CEM cell lines, cytoprotection by cycloheximide could not be accounted for completely by these phenomena since, in L1210 cells, cytoprotection was observed without significant change in DNA cleavage or enzyme content. Cycloheximide diminished DNA synthesis as well as protein synthesis. However, DNA synthesis resumed within 6 hr after removal of cycloheximide, in spite of the fact that cytoprotection persisted. Cycloheximide did not alter cell cycle distribution as measured by flow cytometry. Our data, therefore, clearly demonstrate that cycloheximide can diminish the cytotoxic potential of etoposide-mediated topoisomerase-DNA complexes. Elucidation of the mechanism by which cytoprotection occurs should shed light on the basis for the cytotoxic effect of topoisomerase II-active drugs.","['Chow, K C', 'King, C K', 'Ross, W E']","['Chow KC', 'King CK', 'Ross WE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis']",1988/03/15 00:00,1988/03/15 00:01,['1988/03/15 00:00'],"['1988/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1988 Mar 15;37(6):1117-22. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(88)90519-9.,['CA-24586/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0006-2952(88)90519-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(88)90519-9 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville 32610.']",,,,,,,,,

Approximately 14 percent of all patients with these disorders had elevated PAIgM but normal levels of PAIgG. Of patients with classic autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP), there was a trend toward more frequently normal levels of PAIgG in chronic ITP compared with patients with acute ITP, but this was not statistically significant. Patients with acute ITP had higher levels of PAIgG and PAIgM in general than those with chronic ITP. Patterns of PAIgG and/or PAIgM elevation were not significantly different when chronic and acute ITP were compared, nor when childhood ITP was compared with adult ITP. Patients with immune thrombocytopenias owing to malignant disorders were likely to have lower levels of PAIgG compared with those with classic ITP. Treated patients with immune thrombocytopenias showed a trend toward earlier response to therapy if they had only elevated PAIgG as opposed to elevated PAIgM alone or elevated PAIgM and PAIgG (p = 0.17). There appear to be great overlaps in the patterns and quantities of PAIgG and PAIgM in patients with immune-mediated thrombocytopenias in widely varied clinical settings. This suggests some underlying common pathophysiologic mechanisms for thrombocytopenia in these clinically diverse disorders.

Radiotherapy in childhood was associated with an increased risk of death due to tumors of the head and neck (relative risk (RR) = 3) and leukemia (RR = 2.3). No other causes of death were significantly elevated after irradiation. The excess of brain tumors (average intracranial dose = 150 rads) confirms that the central nervous system of the child is sensitive to the induction of cancers by radiation. The bone marrow dose averaged over the entire body was approximately 30 rad, and the estimated risk coefficient of 0.9 excess leukemias per million per year per rad is consistent with other studies of whole-body exposure. A significant excess of bone and soft tissue sarcomas (RR = 9) was also observed. The pattern of cancer risk over time was bimodal; an early peak due to excess leukemias occurred within a few years of exposure, whereas excesses of solid tumors were most apparent after about 15 years. Despite the excess of cancers among exposed persons, over 50% of the deaths in the entire study population were from external events, mainly accidents or events related to military service.

The results support managing most of these infections initially with medical treatment, using an antibiotic regimen that includes an aminoglycoside and a specific drug against anaerobes. Surgery is recommended if there is obvious fluctuance, a significant amount of necrotic tissue evident, or progression of the infection locally or continued sepsis after an adequate antibiotic trial.","['Glenn, J', 'Cotton, D', 'Wesley, R', 'Pizzo, P']","['Glenn J', 'Cotton D', 'Wesley R', 'Pizzo P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Rev Infect Dis,Reviews of infectious diseases,7905878,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anus Diseases/drug therapy/*etiology/surgery', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*etiology/surgery', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drainage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia', 'Neutrophils', 'Rectal Diseases/drug therapy/*etiology/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Infect Dis. 1988 Jan-Feb;10(1):42-52. doi: 10.1093/clinids/10.1.42.,,['10.1093/clinids/10.1.42 [doi]'],,"['Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,,

However, the growth of advanced subcutaneous tumors, arising from inoculation of either the original in vivo LL line or a tissue culture-adapted cell line (LLTC) derived from the LL line was delayed significantly by FAA treatment. Comparison, by clonogenic survival assays, of the cytotoxic effect of FAA on LLTC cells demonstrated that most cell killing occurred between 2 and 8 hours following in vivo exposure but occurred to a much lesser extent and at later times following in vitro exposure. FAA was inactive against LLTC cells growing in vivo in diffusion chambers, suggesting that a host cellular component was necessary for activity. FAA was found to induce hemorrhagic necrosis in the advanced LL tumors, as well as in a number of human tumor xenografts growing in athymic mice. The human cell lines from which the xenografts were derived, as well as the LL tumor lines and P388 leukemia lines, were inhibited by FAA in vitro. However, the ranking of FAA activity in vivo did not parallel that observed in vitro.

RAD's are tetracyclic, and they have an oxazole ring fused on the tricyclic phenoxazine chromophore of AMD. The oxazole ring in RAD is substituted at the C-2 carbon with either a CH3 (in RAD I), a C6H5 (in RAD II), or a CH2CONH(CH2)4NH2 (in RAD III) group. In tumor cells and rat hepatic microsomes, RAD's are metabolized to a tricyclic ""symmetrical"" analogue of AMD (SAD) with the loss of the oxazole ring and its substituents. RAD and SAD are very active in priming superoxides in the presence of microsomal enzymes as well as in inhibiting the synthesis of DNA and the growth of human colon tumor HT-29 cells in vitro. RAD III and SAD efficiently cleave closed circular plasmid pBR322 DNA like the antitumor agent bleomycin. In addition to their strong inhibitory activity against P388 and B16 tumors in vitro and in vivo, RAD III and SAD demonstrate high levels of activity against primary C26 and advanced C38 colon tumors in mice and against a xenograft of human colon adenocarcinoma CX-1 in athymic mice. In all these biological activities, the analogues demonstrate superiority to AMD in several experimental tumors. Also, the analogues, in contrast to AMD, show reduced toxicity in tumor-free mice, which is possibly due to the metabolic deactivation of SAD in host organs.","['Sengupta, S K', 'Kogan, Y', 'Kelly, C', 'Szabo, J']","['Sengupta SK', 'Kogan Y', 'Kelly C', 'Szabo J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Dactinomycin/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1988 Apr;31(4):768-74. doi: 10.1021/jm00399a014.,,['10.1021/jm00399a014 [doi]'],,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Boston University Medical Center, School of Medicine, Massachusetts 02118.']",,,,,,,,,

The meta isomer of AMT was obtained from 2,4-diamino-6-(bromomethyl)pteridine and m-(aminobenzoyl)-L-glutamic acid, while the ortho isomer was obtained via the same route by using alpha-methyl gamma-tert-butyl o-(aminobenzoyl)-L-glutamate instead of the free acid. Analogues of MTX and AMT containing a double bond in the side chain were prepared from dimethyl D,L-2-amino-4-hexenedioate and 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroic acid and 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-formylpteroic acid, respectively. Finally, a positional isomer of MTX with the CH2CH2COOH moiety moved from the alpha-carbon to the adjacent carboxamide nitrogen was synthesized from 3-[N-(carboxymethyl)amino]propanoic acid diethyl ester and 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroic acid. The positional isomers of AMT were weak DHFR inhibitors and showed very little growth-inhibitory activity against L1210 murine leukemia cells or the MTX-resistant L1210/R81 mutant line in culture. The MTX and AMT analogues with the CH2CH2COOH moiety replaced by a CH2CH = CHCOOH side chain showed anti-DHFR activity similar to that of the previously described saturated compound N-(4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl)-L-2-aminoadipic acid, but were less potent than the parent drugs. The MTX analogue with the CH2CH2COOH side chain displaced from C to N was weakly bound to DHFR, confirming the importance of an intact CONH moiety, and showed greatly diminished cell growth inhibitory potency relative to MTX. None of the compounds was a substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) from mouse liver. Furthermore, inhibition of folic acid polyglutamylation in vitro at equimolar 500 microM concentrations of drug and substrate was negligible.

Recently, attempts have been made to treat extraperitoneal tumors by concurrent i.v. administration of CDDP and sodium thiosulfate. We have tested this approach in mice bearing systemic L1210 leukemia, s.c. growing Lewis lung carcinoma, C3H mammary carcinoma, and a human sarcoma growing in athymic nude mice. In all cases the antitumor activity of CDDP was substantially reduced in a manner dependent on the thiosulfate dose. Increased doses of CDDP, permitted by reduced toxicity in the presence of thiosulfate, raised the antitumor activity. However, the latter did not exceed that obtained by much lower doses in the absence of thiosulfate. The present experiments in animal models thus fail to support the clinical use of CDDP given i.v. together with its antidote, sodium thiosulfate.","['Aamdal, S', 'Fodstad, O', 'Pihl, A']","['Aamdal S', 'Fodstad O', 'Pihl A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Thiosulfates)', 'HX1032V43M (sodium thiosulfate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Thiosulfates/*administration & dosage']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1988;21(2):129-33. doi: 10.1007/BF00257358.,,['10.1007/BF00257358 [doi]'],,"['Institute for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, Oslo.']",,,,,,,,,

These data thus further support that measurement of this purine metabolic enzyme is useful in diagnosing the cause of pure RBC aplasia in children. Of interest, however, elevated RBC-ADA activity also is seen in some children with acute leukaemia and other haematologic disorders. In children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the increase in RBC-ADA activity is proportional to the degree of anaemia. However, the elevated RBC-ADA activity in this leukaemic population is not related to the fetal haemoglobin concentration. These data suggest increased RBC-ADA activity may be a non-specific manifestation of abnormal erythroid stem cell function, an alteration distinct from that seen with reactivation of fetal erythropoiesis. However, since almost all patients with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia manifest elevated RBC-ADA activity, this chemical alteration yet may reflect the specific erythroid differentiation lesion in this disorder.","['Glader, B E', 'Backer, K']","['Glader BE', 'Backer K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenosine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*enzymology', 'Child', 'Erythrocytes/*enzymology', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Hematologic Diseases/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*metabolism']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Feb;68(2):165-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06184.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06184.x [doi]'],,"['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, California.']",,,,,,,,,

The total number of patients studied was 254; of these, 171 patients had a pleural and 83 patients a peritoneal effusion. In the total group, sex distribution was two men to three women: about equal in the pleural effusion group and about two men to nine women in the ascites group, with the latter ratio reflecting the large number of primary malignant processes in the breast and ovaries. The average age at the time of the effusion, whether it was located in the pleural or in the peritoneal cavity, was about 55 years. This figure was roughly 60 years for men and 51 years for women. The nine-year average age difference between sexes can be explained by the size of the four largest groups of different primary malignant localizations and their sex distribution. The interval between the discovery of the primary malignancy and the first fluid sample was longer for patients with a pleural effusion (average of 77.0 weeks) than for patients with ascites (average of 54.5 weeks). The longest interval was seen in the breast carcinoma group, with the shortest interval in lung carcinoma patients. The interval was significantly longer for women, being 111.9 weeks for pleural effusions and 57.9 weeks for ascites (average for both sites of 88.7 weeks). In 30.7% of the patients, the primary malignancy was discovered at the same time or later than the effusion; in patients with lung cancer, a strikingly higher percentage of 53.0% was found. In this respect, the cytologic diagnosis of effusions is of great importance not only for the detection and proper identification of a malignant process but also as an indicator of the life expectancy of a patient.","['van de Molengraft, F J', 'Vooijs, G P']","['van de Molengraft FJ', 'Vooijs GP']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Ascitic Fluid/*pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', '*Cytodiagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Pleural Effusion/*pathology', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1988 Mar-Apr;32(2):183-7.,,,,"['Department of Pathology, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,

A gradually increasing percentage of CD33+/TdT+ cells was detected in the bone marrow in a period of 6 months before hematological relapse. Although the t(6;9) may not be correlated to a specific French-American-British subtype, it may be associated with TdT-positive ANLL.

Determined IC50 values were highly dependent on the culture medium used, and it was found that the presence of ascorbate in the medium had a major effect on the stability of compounds to oxidation. A survey of 115 analogues of amsacrine indicates that a low ratio of IC50 values (HCT-8/L1210) is necessary but not sufficient for good antitumor activity against the solid tumor. DNA binding constants did not in themselves predict activity, although they were related to dose potency. Other factors, such as drug lipophilicity, acridine base strength, and drug solubility, also are involved, probably in providing effective drug distribution. It is concluded that in vitro assay data provide information useful for drug design but that other factors also are important for in vivo activity.","['Baguley, B C', 'Finlay, G J']","['Baguley BC', 'Finlay GJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1988/04/06 00:00,1988/04/06 00:01,['1988/04/06 00:00'],"['1988/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1988 Apr 6;80(3):195-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/80.3.195.,,['10.1093/jnci/80.3.195 [doi]'],,"['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland Medical School, New Zealand.']",,,,,,,,,

It is postulated that this occurs through prevention of the entry of normal cells into the cell cycle through protein deficiency, while allowing malignant cells, permissive for protein starvation, to continue to cycle, thus maintaining sensitivity for cycle specific anticancer agents. Reported in this paper is the confirmation of these L-histidinol-FUra effects. However, a modification was made by which more L-histidinol could be given and more consistent protection of whole animals demonstrated. Further, an optimal schedule of L-histidinol was defined in which FUra preceded L-histidinol infusion. Finally, the specificity and proliferation dependence of this schedule was evaluated on colony forming units-spleen in resting and proliferating state, colony forming units-granulocyte-macrophage, and L1210 leukemia.

Leukemic LGL may be a useful model for studying natural killer (NK) cell (CD3- LGL) and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CD3+ LGL) activation and differentiation.","['Loughran, T P Jr', 'Starkebaum, G', 'Aprile, J A']","['Loughran TP Jr', 'Starkebaum G', 'Aprile JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['DNA', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1988/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Mar;71(3):822-4.,"['CA 18821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 05761-12/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)78166-8 [pii]'],,"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle 98104.']",,,,,,,,,

Proflavin was highly mutagenic at the tk locus, producing 724-965 TK mutants/10(6) survivors (background = 56-85/10(6); survival = 29-32%). Most of the mutants were small colonies, which suggested that proflavin may induce chromosomal mutations. The potent clastogenicity of proflavin was confirmed by cytogenetic analysis for chromosomal aberrations. At the highest dose analyzed (1.5 micrograms/ml), proflavin produced 82 aberrations/100 metaphaes (background = 2/100). The large-colony TK mutant frequency produced by proflavin (48-109/10(6) survivors; background = 23/10(6); survival = 57-61%) was similar to published HPRT mutant frequencies produces by proflavin in L5178Y and CHO cells (50-100/10(6) survivors; background = 2-50/10(6); survival = 50-62%). These results lead to the conclusion that proflavin is a potent clastogen and induces a high frequency of small-colony TK mutants; however, it induces a low frequency of HPRT mutants and a low frequency of large-colony TK mutants.","['DeMarini, D M', 'Brock, K H', 'Doerr, C L', 'Moore, M M']","['DeMarini DM', 'Brock KH', 'Doerr CL', 'Moore MM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'CY3RNB3K4T (Proflavine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proflavine/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1988 Feb;204(2):323-8. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(88)90106-1.,,"['0165-1218(88)90106-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(88)90106-1 [doi]']",,"['Genetic Toxicology Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.']",,,,,,,,,

In a series of 149 patients with ANLL, we sought to determine whether the t(8;21), t(15;17), t(9;11) or other abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 11, inv(16) or t(16;16), inv(3) or t(3;3), trisomy 8, and abnormalities of chromosome 5 (-5/5q-) or of chromosome 7 (-7/7q-) identify differences in susceptibility to chemotherapy drugs in vivo. The immediate outcome of the first cycle of remission induction chemotherapy was analyzed for patients in each cytogenetic subgroup as an index of the drug susceptibility of the leukemia cells in vivo. Patients with t(8;21), inv(16), t(16;16), or 11q abnormalities had high rates of complete remission after initial therapy (60-100%), whereas patients with -7/7q- or -5/5q- had low initial response rates (0-36%), suggestive of drug resistance in vivo. In general, cytogenetic groups with high initial complete remission rates (""drug sensitive"") also had long disease-free survivals; those groups with low initial remission rates (""drug resistant"") had short remission durations even if these patients eventually achieved complete remission with further therapy. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), all of whom had the t(15;17), were the exception; despite low initial remission rates, they had long disease-free survivals, possibly due to a more rapid cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy on the clonogenic APL cells than on the more numerous malignant promyelocytes. We conclude that the prognostic importance of specific chromosomal abnormalities in ANLL resides in part in differing susceptibilities to chemotherapy.","['Samuels, B L', 'Larson, R A', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Daly, K M', 'Bitter, M A', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Barker, C M', 'Rowley, J D', 'Golomb, H M']","['Samuels BL', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Daly KM', 'Bitter MA', 'Vardiman JW', 'Barker CM', 'Rowley JD', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Feb;2(2):79-83.,"['CA 16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 35377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Illinois.']",,,,,,,,,

Children were classified into groups on the basis of treatment modality and treatment status. All patients received systemic chemotherapy. Other treatment modalities included intrathecal chemotherapy and intrathecal chemotherapy plus central nervous system radiation therapy. Treatment status was determined by whether children were newly diagnosed patients in active treatment or long-term survivors of cancer. This classification resulted in five groups; group 1 (n = 29)--children with newly diagnosed disease who were receiving intrathecal chemotherapy; group 2 (n = 21)--children with newly diagnosed disease who were receiving systemic chemotherapy without central nervous system treatment; group 3 (n = 24)--long-term survivors who had received intrathecal chemotherapy; group 4 (n = 25)--long-term survivors who had received intrathecal chemotherapy plus cranial radiotherapy; and group 5 (n = 25)--long-term survivors who had received systemic chemotherapy only (no specific central nervous system treatment). Groups were compared by using multivariate analysis of variance on sets of neuropsychological test variables that represent major cognitive domains. Results of comparisons indicated significant group differences for most dependent-variable sets. Follow-up pairwise comparisons showed that the group of long-term survivors who had received intrathecal chemotherapy plus cranial radiotherapy consistently obtained lower test scores than the other four groups. These findings are consistent with results of previous studies, thus indicating that intrathecal chemotherapy plus cranial radiotherapy is associated with significant effects on neuropsychological performance. Comparisons among newly diagnosed and long-term groups of patients who did not receive cranial radiotherapy yielded null results on measures of higher-order cognitive functions. However, significant group differences were observed on measures of fine-motor and visual-motor skills; newly diagnosed groups obtained lower scores than the nonirradiated long-term survivor groups. Findings were attributed to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy that differentially affected the newly diagnosed groups.","['Copeland, D R', 'Dowell, R E Jr', 'Fletcher, J M', 'Bordeaux, J D', 'Sullivan, M P', 'Jaffe, N', 'Frankel, L S', 'Ried, H L', 'Cangir, A']","['Copeland DR', 'Dowell RE Jr', 'Fletcher JM', 'Bordeaux JD', 'Sullivan MP', 'Jaffe N', 'Frankel LS', 'Ried HL', 'Cangir A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Child Neurol,Journal of child neurology,8606714,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neurocognitive Disorders/*etiology', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology']",1988/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Child Neurol. 1988 Jan;3(1):53-62. doi: 10.1177/088307388800300113.,['CA 33097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1177/088307388800300113 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",,,,,,,,,

Drugs that block adrenergic receptors and inhibitors of tyrosinase or tyrosine hydroxylase had no effect on the cytostatic properties of MIBG.

MIBG had anti-tumor effects on L1210 leukemia and N1E115 neuroblastoma, grown as subcutaneous tumors in animals treated with MIBG in non-toxic schedules.

Use of the drug in adults has been curtailed due to sparse reports of effectiveness as well as its dose-limiting toxicities, i.e., severe nausea, vomiting and mucositis. In earlier studies, children given DON orally in combination with 6-mercaptopurine had significant prolongation of remission of acute leukemias during maintenance therapy. As DON is acid-labile and relatively unstable in solution, oral administration does not appear to be ideal for DON. In the trial described in this report, i.v. DON therapy was studied, using i.v. chlorpromazine to control vomiting, in 20 children, 17 of whom were evaluable following treatment at DON dose levels ranging from 150 mg/m2 to 520 mg/m2. Nausea and vomiting, the dose-limiting toxicity for adults, was controlled with chlorpromazine. Mucositis, which has also been observed in adults, did not occur in the children given DON i.v. A maximum tolerated dose was not defined; however, the projected maximum tolerated dose appears to be in excess of 450 mg/m2. DON was measured in plasma using a rapid-sampling HPLC procedure. The total body clearance, plasma t1/2, and area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) were calculated using a noncompartmental method. The drug is rapidly cleared from plasma (t 1/2 = 3 h), and its volume of distribution is approximately twice that of total body water in children. These pharmacokinetic data, differ from that of adults reported by others. Specifically, the plasma t 1/2 for children is longer: total body clearance (Cl), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) are greater. In addition, no dose dependency of t 1/2, Cl or Vss was observed in this study, and the DON pharmacokinetics were linear and predictable. Five of nine children with acute leukemia showed improvement, though insufficient for classification as partial response, and five of eight children with solid tumors also showed improvement.

It is speculated that alteration of some fundamental process(es) in the cells leads to the development of multidrug resistance. The sodium pump activity of murine leukemia cell lines P388/S (sensitive) and P388/ADR (resistant) was measured and found to be different in the two cell lines. The rate of sodium pumping, i.e., the ouabain-sensitive rubidium uptake, was consistently lower in the resistant cells compared to their parental controls. Uptake of adriamycin was lower in the resistant cells. Depolarizing the cells with potassium chloride or by inhibiting the pump with ouabain increased the adriamycin uptake in the sensitive cells but not in the resistant cells. Adriamycin did not have any acute effects on the sodium pump activity. It is concluded that the development of drug resistance in cell line P388 is associated with a decrease in sodium pump activity and a lack of depolarization-induced adriamycin uptake; these processes may be causally linked via alterations in cytosolic calcium concentration.","['Bose, R', 'Lam, H Y']","['Bose R', 'Lam HY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1988;21(1):14-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00262731.,,['10.1007/BF00262731 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,

At the IC50 of DOX in the presence of 5 microM TFP, although cellular accumulation of DOX was concentration dependent over the range of 1-20 microM TFP, enhancement in cytotoxicity of DOX was dose dependent at 1-5 microM TFP but not 5-20 microM TFP.

This report describes a 45-year-old man with the simultaneous occurrence of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), extramedullary large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and malignant lymphoid meningeal involvement. In this case, peripheral blood lymphocytes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphoblasts, and malignant cells in surgical biopsy tissue obtained from a soft tissue mass all stained concordantly for immunoglobulin isotypes and for B-cell immunophenotypic markers, supporting the hypothesis of a clonal origin for the three malignant cell populations. These observations suggest that the different tumors in Richter's syndrome (CLL and NHL) may represent the clonal progression of a common neoplasm rather than independent neoplastic events. Richter's syndrome and other transformations of lymphoid malignancies (prolymphocytic transformation of CLL, blast crisis of CLL, and blastic transformation of NHL) may all represent possible routes of progression in the natural history of a single neoplasm. The present case also suggests that, in patients with B-cell CLL with CNS symptoms, the possibility of blastic transformation presenting as CNS lymphoma deserves consideration.","['Lane, P K', 'Townsend, R M', 'Beckstead, J H', 'Corash, L']","['Lane PK', 'Townsend RM', 'Beckstead JH', 'Corash L']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Syndrome']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1988 Feb;89(2):254-9. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/89.2.254.,,['10.1093/ajcp/89.2.254 [doi]'],,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",,,,,,,,,

The data were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier procedure using as criteria cause of death and possible cause of death. Individual groups were compared by a modified Wilcoxon test according to Hoel and Walburg, and entire sets of different doses from one radiation schedule were evaluated by the procedure of Peto and by the Cox proportional hazard model. No significant difference was found in life-shortening of C57Bl mice between a single gamma and neutron exposure. Gamma fractionation was clearly less effective in reducing survival time than a single exposure. On the contrary, fractionation of neutrons was slightly although not significantly more effective in reducing life span than a single exposure. Life-shortening appeared to be a linear function of dose in all groups studied. The data on causes of death show that malignant tumors, particularly leukemias including thymic lymphoma, and noncancerous late degenerative changes in lung were the principal cause of life-shortening after a high single gamma exposure. Exposure delivered in 8 fractions 3 h apart was more effective in causing leukemias and all carcinomas and sarcomas than one delivered in 10 fractions 24 h apart or in a single session. Following a single neutron exposure, leukemias and all carcinomas and sarcomas appeared to increase somewhat more rapidly with dose than after gamma irradiation.

The results showed that strain LY-R was more proficient than strain LY-S in the repair of SLD. The split dose recovery observed in strain LY-S could be accounted for by its recovery during postirradiation incubation. In contrast, SLD repair occurred in the absence of PLD repair in strain LY-R. The possibility that the repair of PLD might be completed prior to the postirradiation incubation in strain LY-R was suggested by the decreased survival observed when the cells were irradiated in a hypotonic solution. The repair of PLD and SLD in strain LY-S was temperature sensitive, occurring during postirradiation incubations between 15 and 34 degrees C, but not at 37 or 40 degrees C. This temperature sensitivity is very similar to the temperature sensitivity of the repair of pH 9.6-labile lesions in DNA in strain LY-S, as reported previously. Thus postirradiation cellular recovery processes in strain LY-S may involve the repair of pH 9.6-labile lesions in DNA. Temperature-dependent changes in the postirradiation distribution of cells throughout the cell cycle were observed which could contribute to the temperature sensitivity of the postirradiation recovery of strain LY-S.","['Evans, H H', 'Horng, M F']","['Evans HH', 'Horng MF']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics', 'Mice', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1988 Jan;113(1):183-90.,"['CA-15901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['Department of Radiology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",,,,,,,,,

None of the analogues studied were as potent as 4a toward TS; however, 9-methyl-5,8-dideazaisoaminopterin, 6d, was only 2.5-fold less effective. Compound 4a was prepared by direct alkylation of the di-tert-butyl ester of 5,8-dideazafolic acid followed by hydrolysis of the resulting diethyl ester, which resulted from concomitant transesterification. It was found to be identical with a sample of 4a prepared by earlier methodology by using a variety of spectroscopic techniques. Its isomer, 9-propargyl-5,8-dideazaisofolic acid, 4b, which was synthesized by an analogous approach, was found to be dramatically less inhibitory toward TS than 4a. Each of the 2,4-diamino derivatives, including those possessing an allyl or propargyl group at N9, was an excellent inhibitor of DHFR, having a level of potency similar to that of methotrexate, MTX. However, many of these 5,8-dideazaaminopterin analogues were far more inhibitory toward TS than MTX.","['Hynes, J B', 'Patil, S A', 'Tomazic, A', 'Kumar, A', 'Pathak, A', 'Tan, X H', 'Li, X Q', 'Ratnam, M', 'Delcamp, T J', 'Freisheim, J H']","['Hynes JB', 'Patil SA', 'Tomazic A', 'Kumar A', 'Pathak A', 'Tan XH', 'Li XQ', 'Ratnam M', 'Delcamp TJ', 'Freisheim JH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1988 Feb;31(2):449-54. doi: 10.1021/jm00397a031.,"['CA 25014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1021/jm00397a031 [doi]'],,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",,,,,,,,,

The glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways of ADP phosphorylation are major intracellular targets inactivated by hydrogen peroxide.,1665-75,"Inhibition of ADP phosphorylation by both glycolysis and mitochondria in P388D1 cells exposed to H2O2 is described. Net glucose uptake and lactate production were inhibited by oxidant exposure (ED50 = 50-100 microM). Glycolysis was specifically inactivated at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step by three independent mechanisms: (a) direct inactivation of the intracellular enzyme (ED50 approximately equal to 100 microM); (b) reduction of the intracellular concentration and redox potential of its nicotinamide cofactors; and (c) a cytosolic pH shift further from the enzyme optima. Consistent with inhibition of glycolysis at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step, a rise in the intracellular concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was observed. The calculated combined inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity could be reasonably correlated with the depression in glycolytic flux rate with the appropriate modeling. The steady-state contribution by mitochondria to the total intracellular ATP pool was indirectly determined by the use of various metabolic inhibitors and was found to rapidly decline following exposure to 300-800 microM H2O2. The inhibition of ADP phosphorylation appeared to be related more to the direct inhibition of the ATPase-synthase complex rather than to the diminished capacity of the respiratory chain for coupled electron transport. Both the estimated rates of ADP phosphorylation by glycolysis and mitochondria and the estimated rate of ATP hydrolysis by ongoing metabolism were utilized to model the approximate decline in intracellular ATP expected at 15-min exposure to various H2O2 concentrations. Theoretical calculations and the measured intracellular ATP status were in good agreement. Oxidant exposure for 15 min resulted in dose-dependent killing of the cells (ED50 = 500 microM), indicating a close correlation between H2O2-mediated loss of intracellular ATP and cell viability. The possible contribution of impaired energy homeostasis during oxidant-mediated injury to the process of cell dysfunction and death is discussed.","['Hyslop, P A', 'Hinshaw, D B', 'Halsey, W A Jr', 'Schraufstatter, I U', 'Sauerheber, R D', 'Spragg, R G', 'Jackson, J H', 'Cochrane, C G']","['Hyslop PA', 'Hinshaw DB', 'Halsey WA Jr', 'Schraufstatter IU', 'Sauerheber RD', 'Spragg RG', 'Jackson JH', 'Cochrane CG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Lactates)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin B/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', '*Glycolysis', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Lactates/biosynthesis', 'Lactic Acid', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1988/02/05 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/02/05 00:00'],"['1988/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Feb 5;263(4):1665-75.,['HL23584/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['S0021-9258(19)77928-9 [pii]'],,"['Department of Immunology, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, California 92037.']",,,,,,,,,

The two acrylates were much more potent in their response than acrylic acid.

M. marinum induces an infectious granuloma in Xenopus which is histopathologically indistinguishable from Xenopus ""lymphosarcoma"" (px1). It had been reported that the filtrate (0.22-micron pore size) and the supernate of ultracentrifugation (20,000 x g) of the pxl tissue homogenate were bacteria free and could transmit the disease (R.H.

Late effects after radiotherapy.,679-88,"Using data from the population-based Danish Cancer Registry, the relative risk (RR) of second primary cancer was assessed among 24,970 women with invasive cervical cancer (1943-1982) and 19,470 women with carcinoma in situ of the cervix. The analysis was stratified according to treatment with (+) and without (-) radiation. For all second primaries combined, a RR+ = 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-1.18) and a RR- = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.13-1.40) was observed after invasive cervical cancers and a RR+ = 3.5 (95% CI = 1.4-7.2) and RR- = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.7-1.6) following in situ cancer. The small overall excess of second primary cancer is accounted for by an increase of some cancers such as lung, bladder, and a concurrent decrease in others such as breast. Although not statistically different from nonirradiated, the RR increased with time since treatment among irradiated invasive cervical cancer patients in organs close to and at intermediate distance from the cervix, reaching a maximum after 30 or more years of follow-up (RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.4-2.5). Altogether, for these sites an excess of 64 cases per 10,000 women per year were attributable to radiation among survivors of 30+ years. The highest risks among long-term survivors were observed for the following: other genital organs (RR = 5.8; 95% CI = 1.8-13.0) bladder (RR = 5.5; 95% CI = 2.8-9.5), connective tissue (RR = 3.3; 95% CI = 0.4-12.0), stomach (RR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.1-4.7) and rectum (RR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.1-4.6). A significant deficit of risk for breast cancer (RR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.6-0.8) was observed for 10+ years, may be attributable to the effect of ovarian ablation by radiotherapy. It is speculated that the same effect also may explain the observed deficits of brain tumors (RR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4-1.0) and skin melanomas (RR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.3-1.0). It is concluded that cancers attributable to radiation, apart from acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, tend to appear late (10 or more years after radiotherapy), and that the risk remains elevated for more than 30 years.","['Storm, H H']",['Storm HH'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Carcinoma in Situ/*radiotherapy', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",1988/02/15 00:00,1988/02/15 00:01,['1988/02/15 00:00'],"['1988/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Feb 15;61(4):679-88. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880215)61:4<679::aid-cncr2820610411>3.0.co;2-s.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19880215)61:4<679::aid-cncr2820610411>3.0.co;2-s [doi]'],,"['Danish Cancer Registry, Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,

In terms of the specific chromosomal abnormalities, there are no differences between the various treatment groups. Hypodiploidy is the most common form of aneuploidy in these patients, with the most common numerical abnormality being the loss of chromosome 7.

Although erythroid abnormalities were prominent in all, 12 patients also showed involvement of the granulocytic and/or megakaryocytic cell lines, and nonrandom chromosomal aberrations were observed in five of 23 patients studied for such defects. Measurements of erythroid marrow function showed in most cases erythroid expansion with ineffective erythropoiesis. In seven patients, however, the erythroid activity was found to be inappropriately low for the degree of anemia. Transfusion dependence occurred in 26 of 37 cases. Iron overload was a common feature at presentation but produced clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis only in those patients who subsequently had a regular need for blood transfusions. Five patients progressed to bone marrow failure, and another five patients (two of whom had monosomy 7) evolved into acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). The median survival was 72 months, with a high transfusion requirement, multilineage defects, and inappropriately low erythroid proliferation being associated with a poor prognosis. The most common causes of death were complications of iron overload and evolution into ANLL. We conclude that (a) the natural history of IRSA is characterized by an initial phase of erythroid hyperplasia and ineffective erythropoiesis, which is usually stable for many years but in a subset of patients may be followed by a phase of marrow failure with or without the later emergence of leukemic blasts; (b) peripheral blood counts, measurement of erythroid marrow function, and chromosomal analysis are useful for identifying subjects at risk of evolution into marrow failure or ANLL; and (c) IRSA patients with no need for blood transfusions are very likely to be long survivors, whereas those who become transfusion dependent are at risk of death from the complications of secondary hemochromatosis.","['Cazzola, M', 'Barosi, G', 'Gobbi, P G', 'Invernizzi, R', 'Riccardi, A', 'Ascari, E']","['Cazzola M', 'Barosi G', 'Gobbi PG', 'Invernizzi R', 'Riccardi A', 'Ascari E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Anemia, Refractory/pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Feb;71(2):305-12.,,['S0006-4971(20)78175-9 [pii]'],,"['Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia School of Medicine, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,

Taken together, these results suggest that the 44-kd OFA polypeptide described here may provide a useful cell surface marker for future radiation carcinogenesis studies. MAb 115 is a promising reagent for detecting tumor-associated 44-kd OFA, for assessing immunoregulatory perturbations to the OFA caused by radiation damage and for investigating the immunopathology of OFA-associated radiation damage.","['Coggin, J H Jr', 'Rohrer, S D', 'Leinbach, E D', 'Hester, R B', 'Liu, P I', 'Heath, L S']","['Coggin JH Jr', 'Rohrer SD', 'Leinbach ED', 'Hester RB', 'Liu PI', 'Heath LS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (oncofetal antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*pathology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*pathology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1988/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1988 Jan;130(1):136-46.,"['CA 39698/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC1880537,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Alabama, College of Medicine, Mobile 36688.']",,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the general assumption that HU blocks cells at the G1/S boundary [J. Brachet (1985) Molecular Cytology, Vol. I, p. 266, Academic Press, New York], the present results show that the cells are not held at G1/S but enter S at about the normal rate and are accumulated in early S phase due to a dose-dependent inhibiting effect of HU on DNA synthesis. Partial synchronization of the cells demonstrated by a distinct mitotic peak 10 h after HU application is not due to a G1/S block of the cells and their subsequent synchronous passage through the cycle after release from the block but is due to rather complex mechanisms of action of HU: a differential cytocidal effect and an effect on the passage of the cells through the cycle, both depending on the position of the cells throughout the cycle. HU kills S-phase cells, mainly cells in early S phase; i.e., a great portion of the cells ""accumulated"" in early S phase is killed by the drug, while G1-phase cells are almost not affected by the lethal effect of HU. These G1-phase cells pass through the cycle more rapidly after cessation of the HU effect. The same is true for the surviving cells accumulated in early S phase, while part of the cells in the remaining S phase are delayed in their passage through the cycle. This causes partial synchronization, since a great portion of all cells that survive HU treatment reach mitosis at the same time.","['Maurer-Schultze, B', 'Siebert, M', 'Bassukas, I D']","['Maurer-Schultze B', 'Siebert M', 'Bassukas ID']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1988 Jan;174(1):230-43. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(88)90157-7.,,"['0014-4827(88)90157-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(88)90157-7 [doi]']",,"['Institut fur Medizinische Strahlenkunde, University of Wurzburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells were exposed to 10, 100, or 1000 nM ara-C for 3 h. Simultaneous exposure of log phase HL-60 cells to BrdUrd (1-1000 microM) and ara-C for 3 h resulted in enhancement of ara-C incorporation into DNA, with a doubling of incorporation in response to 10 nM ara-C occurring at concentrations of BrdUrd greater than 100 microM. Preexposure of cells to BrdUrd for 16 h followed by addition of ara-C for 3 h resulted in even greater ara-C incorporation into DNA. This increase was most marked at the lower concentrations of ara-C (10 and 100 nM), where approximately 3-fold enhancement of ara-C incorporation was observed in response to BrdUrd concentrations greater than 100 microM. Intracellular pools of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-CTP increased significantly (up to 3-fold) following 16-h exposure to BrdUrd (30, 100, or 300 microM) at all concentrations of ara-C tested. The ara-C phosphorylating activity of cell-free extracts obtained following 16-h exposure of cells to BrdUrd increased 1.5- to 2.3-fold over control. Intracellular dCTP pools fell to approximately 50% of control after exposure to 750 microM BrdUrd or dThd. Exposure to BrdUrd for 16 h caused a concentration-dependent increase in cells with S-phase DNA content, as assessed by flow cytometry, with a doubling of cells in S phase (to 60%) observed in response to 500 microM BrdUrd. HL-60 cells exposed to identical conditions of BrdUrd for 3 h showed no significant alteration in cell cycle phase distribution. Thus, although BrdUrd does increase cells in S phase, the increased ara-C incorporation caused by BrdUrd cannot be explained solely on a cytokinetic basis since enhancement of incorporation was observed after a 3-h exposure of cells to BrdUrd and ara-C. The combination of ara-C (100 nM) and BrdUrd (100-1000 microM) exhibited cytotoxic synergism, as measured by the fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide method. These data demonstrate a clear potential for BrdUrd modulation of ara-C metabolism in human leukemia. Additionally, the interaction of BrdUrd and ara-C should be considered in the interpretation of studies of the effects of ara-C on DNA synthesis as measured by flow cytometric quantification of incorporated BrdUrd.","['Ross, D D', 'Joneckis, C C', 'Song, T H', 'Wu, R K']","['Ross DD', 'Joneckis CC', 'Song TH', 'Wu RK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyguanine Nucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '8C2O37Y44Q (deoxyguanosine triphosphate)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Biotransformation', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/toxicity', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Feb 1;48(3):517-21.,['1RO-1-CA40188-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",,,,,,,,,

An examination of age-adjusted incidence rates by cholesterol level showed an inverse association between cholesterol and all cancer; lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and bladder cancers; and leukemia. In women a weak inverse relation (reflecting an elevated rate among those only in the lowest cholesterol quintile) was apparent for all cancer; more prominent inverse associations were seen for cancers of the lung, pancreas, bladder, cervix, and for leukemia. A more detailed analysis of cholesterol and colorectal cancer revealed little association in both men and women. For an aggregate group of smoking-related cancers, the inverse relation was especially prominent: the multivariate relative risk estimates for subjects in the lowest cholesterol quintile, compared to those in the highest quintile, were 2.1 (1.1-3.8) and 3.3 (1.4-7.8) for men and women, respectively. The inverse association was present for smoking-related cancers diagnosed 6 or more yr after cholesterol determination in both men and women, suggesting that this association cannot be simply dismissed as a preclinical cancer effect.

In K562 cells, the rate of triphosphate accumulation was maximal during incubation with 10 microM ara-C (35 microM/h) and 300 microM F-ara-A (102 microM/h). Under these conditions, accumulation of cellular ara-CTP plateaued at about 110 microM after 3 h, whereas in separate cultures, F-ara-ATP continued to accumulate at a linear rate to cellular concentrations greater than 500 microM after 5 h. Other laboratories have demonstrated that dCK activity in cell-free extracts was inhibited by ara-CTP. To determine whether ara-CTP exhibited the same activity in whole cells, K562 cells were preincubated with ara-C to accumulate 110 microM ara-CTP. After washing into medium containing F-ara-A, the rate of F-ara-ATP accumulation was significantly decreased (37 microM/h). However, cells loaded with F-ara-ATP exhibited an increased rate of ara-CTP accumulation (110 microM/h) that resulted in cellular ara-CTP concentrations in excess of 400 microM after 5 h. This stimulation was proportional to the cellular concentration of F-ara-ATP, achieving a maximum effect between 75 and 100 microM. Phosphorylation of ara-C by cell-free extracts supplemented with physiological levels of ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates was stimulated by addition of F-ara-ATP. The decreased rate of accumulation of products of dCK in intact cells containing 110 microM ara-CTP suggests that this active triphosphate may limit its own synthesis and phosphorylation of other substrates. In contrast, stimulation of the accumulation of ara-CTP in cells containing F-ara-ATP suggests new possibilities for the design of combination chemotherapy regimens.","['Gandhi, V', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '74832-57-8 (2-fluoro-araATP)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleotides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jan 15;48(2):329-34.,['CA 28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston 77030.']",,,,,,,,,

However, the antitumor mechanisms of IFN-alpha are not known. Using two examples, hairy Cell leukemia (HCL) and renal cell cancer (RCC), it is shown that the requirements for successful IFN-alpha therapy of HCL and RCC are different. In HCL low doses of IFN-alpha are sufficient to treat the disease. The reduction of hairy cells in peripheral blood is detectable within the first week of treatment. The endogenous IFN-alpha production in these patients is impaired as demonstrated by the lack of IFN-alpha induction and by low levels of 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A possible reason for deficient endogenous IFN-alpha production is the lack of monocytes in HCL patients. It is likely that therapy with low doses of IFN-alpha substitutes for the endogenous IFN-alpha deficiency. In RCC comparatively high doses of IFN-alpha are necessary for a clinical response. There may be differences between the effectiveness of natural and recombinant alpha interferons. High doses given within a week seem to be more important than high single doses, which therefore suggests the need of daily treatment. Responses of RCC to IFN-alpha therapy are usually seen several months after the beginning of therapy. These differences in the effectiveness of IFN-alpha therapy for HCL and RCC suggest that IFN-alpha acts differently in the treatment of each disease.","['Porzsolt, F', 'Digel, W', 'Jacobsen, H', 'Mittnacht, S', 'Kirchner, H', 'Heimpel, H']","['Porzsolt F', 'Digel W', 'Jacobsen H', 'Mittnacht S', 'Kirchner H', 'Heimpel H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)"", 'HSU1C9YRES (Medroxyprogesterone)']",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/blood"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/deficiency/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medroxyprogesterone/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenectomy']",1988/01/15 00:00,1988/01/15 00:01,['1988/01/15 00:00'],"['1988/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Jan 15;61(2):288-93. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880115)61:2<288::aid-cncr2820610217>3.0.co;2-0.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19880115)61:2<288::aid-cncr2820610217>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],,"['Department of Medicine III and Tumor Center, University of Ulm, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,

A clinical study with long-term follow-up.,89-95,"The analysis of 288 cases of polycythemia vera (PV) with a minimal follow-up of 10 years enabled us to study the characteristics of acute leukemia as observed in 33 patients (11.4%). In 50% of the patients (16 of 33), the malignant transformation is of the refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) type. Half of these further transform to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Their life expectancy is not better than patients who abruptly develop ANLL. Leukemic transformation shows a frequency peak in the eighth year after initial evaluation in PV treated with chemotherapy and in the 11th year in patients treated with radiotherapy. In 30% of the patients myelofibrosis, or the spent phase of PV, is present before the transformation to acute leukemia (AL). This complication is, however, part of the natural history of PV and is observed in 20% of PV patients at 10 years when leukemic transformation is absent. Marrow fibrosis can therefore not be considered as a preleukemic phase. It was also noted that the occurrence of myeloid metaplasia/myelofibrosis is more frequent and begins earlier in patients treated by phlebotomy alone, and who do not transform to leukemia. The clinical characteristics of these AL, including high frequency of partial marrow invasion, difficulties in cytologic classification, a peak incidence similar to that in patients treated by chemotherapy or radiotherapy for a prior malignancy, multiple chromosome abnormalities, and poor response to therapy are all highly suggestive of secondary leukemias.","['Najean, Y', 'Deschamps, A', 'Dresch, C', 'Daniel, M T', 'Rain, J D', 'Arrago, J P']","['Najean Y', 'Deschamps A', 'Dresch C', 'Daniel MT', 'Rain JD', 'Arrago JP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neural Tube Defects/*etiology/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications/pathology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Jan 1;61(1):89-95. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880101)61:1<89::aid-cncr2820610115>3.0.co;2-0.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19880101)61:1<89::aid-cncr2820610115>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],,"['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,

We studied five patients to determine the potential for phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity. Cellular characterization studies included light myeloperoxidase (L-MPO), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), ultrastructural MPO (U-MPO), and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry using T11, T3, T4, T8, Leu 1, B1, Leu 12, HLA-DR (la), CALLA (J5), OKM1, My4, My7, My8, My9, and My10. DNA was analyzed for rearrangements of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr), immunoglobulin heavy chain, joining region (JH), immunoglobulin kappa light chain constant region (C kappa), and T cell receptor (TcR beta). RNA dot blots were hybridized by using molecular probes for MPO and TdT. We found that four of five cases were acute mixed-lineage leukemia (AMLL). One patient had acute unclassifiable leukemia. Of the four patients classified as having AMLL, three showed myeloid and lymphoid features, with one patient showing myeloid, T cell, and B cell features. The last case showed T cell and B cell features only. In one patient MPO/RNA was positive in spite of insufficient L-MPO or U-MPO to diagnose acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), thereby suggesting significant MPO gene expression before the production of sufficient MPO protein to meet the French-American-British criteria for AML. Three of the five patients showed rearrangement of bcr (cases 1, 2, and 5). Studies of these five patients support the concepts of molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity in Ph1 acute leukemia, demonstrate a high incidence of AMLL in this subset of acute leukemia, and support the use of lineage-associated molecular probes to define lineage at an earlier stage than previously possible.","['Hirsch-Ginsberg, C', 'Childs, C', 'Chang, K S', 'Beran, M', 'Cork, A', 'Reuben, J', 'Freireich, E J', 'Chang, L C', 'Bollum, F J', 'Trujillo, J']","['Hirsch-Ginsberg C', 'Childs C', 'Chang KS', 'Beran M', 'Cork A', 'Reuben J', 'Freireich EJ', 'Chang LC', 'Bollum FJ', 'Trujillo J', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/analysis/immunology', 'Phenotype', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jan;71(1):186-95.,"['1 R37 CA42081-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)78242-X [pii]'],,"['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",,,,,,,,,

This was observed both on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels directly or on one-dimensional gels of viral lysates that had been immunoprecipitated with monospecific goat anti-p30 serum. The phosphorylation event had been difficult to detect because pp12 the major virion phosphoprotein incorporates almost all of the 32P label added to infected cells (Y. Yoshinaka and R. B. Luftig, Virology 116:181-195, 1982). When immunoprecipitates from M-MuLV lysates labeled with 32Pi were compared with those labeled with [35S]methionine, it was calculated that the degree of phosphorylation at the p30 domain of Pr65gag was only 0.22 to 0.54% relative to phosphorylation at the p12 domain. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the 32P-labeled p30 immunoprecipitates showed that there were three phosphorylated p30 forms with isoelectric points (pIs) of 5.7, 5.8, and 6.0. These forms were generally more acidic than the [35S]methionine-labeled p30 forms, which had pIs of 6.0, 6.1, 6.3 (the major constituent with greater than 80% of the label), and 6.6. The predominant phosphoamino acid of the major phosphorylated p30 form (pI 5.8) was phosphoserine. Further, tryptic peptide analysis of this p30 form showed that only one peptide was predominantly phosphorylated. Based on a comparison of specific labeling of p30 tryptic peptides with [14C]serine, [35S]methionine, and 32Pi, we tentatively assigned the phosphorylation site to a 2.4-kilodalton NH2-terminal peptide containing triple tandem serines spanning the region from amino acids 4 to 24.","['Ikuta, K', 'Luftig, R B']","['Ikuta K', 'Luftig RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)']",IM,"['Capsid/immunology/*metabolism', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1988 Jan;62(1):40-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.62.1.40-46.1988.,['CA-37380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1128/JVI.62.1.40-46.1988 [doi]'],PMC250499,"['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans 70112-1393.']",,,,,,,,,
