We exploited the promiscuous nature of kinase inhibitors to screen 9 clinically relevant kinase inhibitors for their ability to sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to a sub-lethal concentration of gemcitabine. Bosutinib, dovitinib, and BEZ-235 were identified as sensitizers that abrogated the DNA damage checkpoint. We further characterized bosutinib, an FDA-approved Src/Abl inhibitor approved for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Unbeknownst to us, we used an isomer (Bos-I) that was unknowingly synthesized and sold to the research community as ""authentic"" bosutinib. In vitro and cell-based assays showed that both the authentic bosutinib and Bos-I inhibited DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Wee1, with Bos-I showing greater potency. Imaging data showed that Bos-I forced cells to override gemcitabine-induced DNA damage checkpoint arrest and destabilized stalled replication forks. These inhibitors enhanced sensitivity to the DNA damaging agents' gemcitabine, cisplatin, and doxorubicin in pancreatic cancer cell lines. The in vivo efficacy of Bos-I was validated using cells derived directly from a pancreatic cancer patient's tumor. Notably, the xenograft studies showed that the combination of gemcitabine and Bos-I was significantly more effective in suppressing tumor growth than either agent alone. Finally, we show that the gatekeeper residue in Wee1 dictates its sensitivity to the 2 compounds. Our strategy to screen clinically relevant kinase inhibitors for off-target effects on cell cycle checkpoints is a promising approach to re-purpose drugs as chemosensitizers.","['Beeharry, Neil', 'Banina, Eugenia', 'Hittle, James', 'Skobeleva, Natalia', 'Khazak, Vladimir', 'Deacon, Sean', 'Andrake, Mark', 'Egleston, Brian L', 'Peterson, Jeffrey R', 'Astsaturov, Igor', 'Yen, Timothy J']","['Beeharry N', 'Banina E', 'Hittle J', 'Skobeleva N', 'Khazak V', 'Deacon S', 'Andrake M', 'Egleston BL', 'Peterson JR', 'Astsaturov I', 'Yen TJ']","['Cancer Biology Program; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.', 'Program in Developmental Therapeutics; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.', 'Cancer Biology Program; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.', 'Program in Developmental Therapeutics; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.', 'Program in Developmental Therapeutics; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.', 'Reaction Biology Corporation; Malvern, PA USA.', 'Molecular Modeling Facility; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Facility; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.', 'Cancer Biology Program; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.', 'Program in Developmental Therapeutics; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.', 'Cancer Biology Program; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Philadelphia, PA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (WEE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Repositioning', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/06/24 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['29214 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.29214 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(14):2172-91. doi: 10.4161/cc.29214.

Since that time, the molecular basis for oncogenic signaling has been elucidated in multiple malignancies. The development of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) inhibitors has helped improve clinical outcomes in malignant melanoma and is suggested by case reports in other malignancies. METHODS: A review of pertinent articles examining the mechanisms of BRAF signaling in various cancer types and an update on clinical trials of BRAF inhibitions are presented. RESULTS: Clinical response to BRAF inhibition varies by malignancy. In melanoma, single-agent vemurafenib or dabrafenib prolongs overall survival compared with chemotherapy, but both are limited by the development of acquired resistance in many patients. Results of early-phase clinical trials and case reports demonstrate responses in V600E-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and hairy cell leukemia. However, no significant difference in progression-free survival was seen in colorectal cancer with single-agent vemurafenib. Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibition with combination therapy is an active area of research. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of BRAF mutations represents an advance in delivering molecularly targeted therapies to patients with a variety of cancers. Acquired resistance limits the ability of BRAF inhibitors to produce long-term remissions; however, combining BRAF inhibitors with the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and/or other pathway inhibitors represents a promising method to improve long-term outcomes.","['Hall, Richard D', 'Kudchadkar, Ragini R']","['Hall RD', 'Kudchadkar RR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, University of Virginia Health System, Hematology/Oncology, Charlottesville, 22908, USA. rdh3q@virginia.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/06/24 06:00,2015/04/18 06:00,['2014/06/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/107327481402100307 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2014 Jul;21(3):221-30. doi: 10.1177/107327481402100307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about SOX17 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The purpose of this study was to investigate the alteration of SOX17 expression and to explore its clinical significance in AML. METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was performed to analyze the status of SO1X17 expression in 103 patients with de novo AML and 26 normal controls. The clinical relevance of SOX17 expression was analyzed in AML. RESULTS: SOX17 level in AML was significantly down-regulated compared to controls (p<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve analysis revealed that an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.834 (95% CI 0.765-0.903; p<0.0001) or 0.789 (95% CI 0.690-0.888, p<0.001) in discriminating all patients or cytogenetically normal patients from controls, respectively. The cohort of AML patients was divided into two groups according to the cut-off value of 0.017 (60% sensitivity and 100% specificity, respectively). Cytogenetically normal patients with low SOX17 expression had significantly shorter OS than those with high SOX17 expression (median 4 vs. 25 months, respectively, p=0.035). Multivariate analysis confirmed low SOX17 expression as an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that low SOX17 level may define an important risk factor in AML with normal cyotgenetics.","['Tang, Chun-Yan', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Wei', 'Yang, Jing', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun', 'Yang, Lei', 'An, Cui', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Zhang, Ying-Ying', 'Qian, Jun']","['Tang CY', 'Lin J', 'Qian W', 'Yang J', 'Ma JC', 'Deng ZQ', 'Yang L', 'An C', 'Wen XM', 'Zhang YY', 'Qian J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SOX17 protein, human)', '0 (SOXF Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Area Under Curve', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk Factors', 'SOXF Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/24 06:00,2015/07/02 06:00,['2014/06/24 06:00'],"['2014/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/cclm-2014-0487 [doi]', '/j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2014-0487/cclm-2014-0487.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2014 Dec;52(12):1843-50. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2014-0487.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A previous report on cancer incidence in a farm worker labor union between 1987 and 1997 found increased leukemia, brain, stomach, and uterine cervix cancer rates in this working population. METHODS: A roster of farm workers was created and electronically linked to the database of the California Cancer Registry. Proportionate cancer incidence (PCIR), stage, and age at diagnosis and histological subtypes of cancer were compared between the United Farm Workers (UFW) members and the Hispanic population of California as well as to the non-Hispanic whites (NHW). RESULTS: In this population of 139,000 farm workers in California, more than 3,600 cancer diagnoses were recorded between 1988 and 2010. Proportionately more cancer was noted in the UFW than among California NHW for kidney and renal pelvis cancer (PCIR = 1.60), liver (PCIR = 4.24), prostate (PCIR = 1.13), and uterine cervix cancer (PCIR = 2.08). Proportionately less breast (PCIR = 0.85), lung (PCIR = 0.75), skin melanoma (PCIR = 0.18), and urinary bladder cancer (PCIR = 0.59) was found. Stage at diagnosis was more advanced in the farm workers for several cancer sites, although, not for colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These farm workers experience proportionally more prostate, kidney and renal pelvis, brain, liver, stomach, cervix and leukemia and less breast, melanoma, and colorectal cancer than reference populations. For many sites, cancer is not diagnosed as early in the farm workers as in the comparison groups, except for colorectal cancer in females and melanoma in males.","['Mills, Paul K', 'Shah, Purvi']","['Mills PK', 'Shah P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, San Francisco Fresno Medical Education and Research Program, Fresno, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology"", 'California/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",2014/06/24 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/06/24 06:00'],"['2014/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajim.22338 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2014 Jul;57(7):737-47. doi: 10.1002/ajim.22338.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hispanic farm workers', 'cancer incidence']",,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to estimate the risk of late effects in children with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with contemporary protocols. METHODS: We used data from similarly treated members of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a multicentre, North American study of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. We included cohort members if they were aged 1.0-9.9 years at the time of diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and had received treatment consistent with contemporary standard-risk protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We calculated mortality rates and standardised mortality ratios, stratified by sex and survival time, after diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We calculated standardised incidence ratios and absolute excess risk for subsequent neoplasms with age-specific, sex-specific, and calendar-year-specific rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Outcomes were compared with a sibling cohort and the general US population. FINDINGS: We included 556 (13%) of 4329 cohort members treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Median follow-up of the survivors from 5 years after diagnosis was 18.4 years (range 0.0-33.0). 28 (5%) of 556 participants had died (standardised mortality ratio 3.5, 95% CI 2.3-5.0). 16 (57%) deaths were due to causes other than recurrence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Six (1%) survivors developed a subsequent malignant neoplasm (standardised incidence ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.0-5.7). 107 participants (95% CI 81-193) in each group would need to be followed-up for 1 year to observe one extra chronic health disorder in the survivor group compared with the sibling group. 415 participants (376-939) in each group would need to be followed-up for 1 year to observe one extra severe, life-threatening, or fatal disorder in the group of survivors. Survivors did not differ from siblings in their educational attainment, rate of marriage, or independent living. INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of adverse long-term outcomes in children treated for standard risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia according to contemporary protocols is low, but regular care from a knowledgeable primary-care practitioner is warranted.

Relapse after ASCT can be due to contamination with leukemic blasts of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) collected by leukapheresis (LK). Identification and quantification of a minimal residual disease (MRD) marker in PBSCs could be relevant in determining the relapse risk after ASCT. High levels of the WT1 gene transcript in bone marrow of AML patients after treatment completion predict disease relapse. We evaluated WT1 transcript levels in autologous PBSC from LK used for ASCT in 30 consecutive AML patients in complete remission (CR) and established a correlation with clinical outcome. At diagnosis, all patients had WT1 overexpression. All patients were in morphological and genetic CR at the time of PBSC collection and before ASCT. Real-time quantitative PCR of WT1 was performed in samples of each LK, using TaqMan technology on RNA from mononucleated cells. The median WT1 transcript level in the PBSC graft (WT1-LK) of patients who relapsed was significantly higher than of those who did not relapse after transplantation (P <.0001). We defined a cut-off level of 80 WT1-LK copies/ABL 10e4 copies to discriminate between positive and negative PBSC grafts. The cut-off level was strongly associated with disease recurrence, DFS and OS. Our study represents the largest series of patients evaluating WT1 as a marker of MRD in PBSC LK products using a completely standardized real-time WT1-reverse transcriptase-PCR based assay. These data, if confirmed by prospective study, will help to determine an individual patient's adapted postremission allocation strategy.","['Messina, Carlo', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Carrabba, Matteo G', 'Tresoldi, Cristina', 'Sala, Elisa', 'Tassara, Michela', 'Crippa, Alessandra', 'Peccatori, Jacopo', 'Assanelli, Andrea', 'Gattillo, Salvatore', 'Bellio, Laura', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Bernardi, Massimo']","['Messina C', 'Candoni A', 'Carrabba MG', 'Tresoldi C', 'Sala E', 'Tassara M', 'Crippa A', 'Peccatori J', 'Assanelli A', 'Gattillo S', 'Bellio L', 'Fanin R', 'Ciceri F', 'Bernardi M']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University Hospital of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Immuno-hematology and Transfusion Medicine, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Immuno-hematology and Transfusion Medicine, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Immuno-hematology and Transfusion Medicine, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Immuno-hematology and Transfusion Medicine, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Immuno-hematology and Transfusion Medicine, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University Hospital of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.

MvRL was toxic to A. salina (LC50=159.9 mug/mL), and exerted cytotoxic effects on NCI-H292 cells (IC50=25.23 mug/mL). The lectin (1-100 mug/mL) did not affect the viability of K562 and Hep-2 tumour cells, as well as of PBMCs. MvRL concentration of 1, 10, and 100 mug/mL promoted malformations (mainly exogastrulation) in 7.8%, 22.5%, and 27.7% of embryos, respectively, as well as delayed embryo development in 42.0%, 69.5%, and 54.7% of embryos, respectively. MvRL at a concentration of 100 mug/mL killed B. glabrata embryos (17.7%) and adults (25%). Further, MvRL damaged B. glabrata reproductive processes, which was evidenced by observations that snails exposed to the lectin (100 mug/mL) deposited fewer eggs than those in the control group, and approximately 40% of the deposited eggs exhibited malformations. Comparison of these results with that from A. salina assay indicates that MvRL is adulticidal at the concentration range which is toxic to environment. In conclusion, the cytotoxicity of MvRL on tumour cell and absence of toxicity to normal cell indicate its potential as chemotherapeutic drug. Also, the study revealed that the lectin is able to promote deleterious effects on B. glabrata embryos at environmentally safe concentrations.","['de Albuquerque, Lidiane Pereira', 'Pontual, Emmanuel Viana', 'Santana, Giselly Maria de Sa', 'Silva, Luanna Ribeiro Santos', 'Aguiar, Jaciana dos Santos', 'Coelho, Luana Cassandra Breitenbach Barroso', 'Rego, Moacyr Jesus Barreto de Melo', 'Pitta, Maira Galdino da Rocha', 'da Silva, Teresinha Goncalves', 'Melo, Ana Maria Mendonca de Albuquerque', 'Napoleao, Thiago Henrique', 'Paiva, Patricia Maria Guedes']","['de Albuquerque LP', 'Pontual EV', 'Santana GM', 'Silva LR', 'Aguiar Jdos S', 'Coelho LC', 'Rego MJ', 'Pitta MG', 'da Silva TG', 'Melo AM', 'Napoleao TH', 'Paiva PM']","['Departamento de Bioquimica-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE 50670-420, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE 50670-420, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE 50670-420, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biofisica e Radiobiologia-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Antibioticos-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE 50670-420, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE 50670-420, Brazil; Laboratorio de Imunomodulacao e Novas Abordagens Terapeuticas, Nucleo de Pesquisa em Inovacao Terapeutica (NUPIT), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE 50670-420, Brazil; Laboratorio de Imunomodulacao e Novas Abordagens Terapeuticas, Nucleo de Pesquisa em Inovacao Terapeutica (NUPIT), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Antibioticos-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biofisica e Radiobiologia-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE 50670-420, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica-CCB, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE 50670-420, Brazil.

We used a set of cells derived from a parental K562 cell line, expressing various levels of ABCB1 and ABCG2, respectively. The function of ABCB1 and ABCG2 was confirmed using calcein AM and pheophorbide A accumulation assays, respectively. These assays indicated distinct differences in activities of ABCB1 and ABCG2 which corresponded to their expression levels. We observed that the resistance to DRN and imatinib was proportional to the expression level of ABCB1. Similarly, the resistance to nilotinib and imatinib was proportional to the expression level of ABCG2. Importantly, K562/DoxDR05 and K562/ABCG2-Z cells with the lowest expressions of ABCB1 and ABCG2, respectively, failed to reduce the intracellular levels of imatinib to provide a significant resistance to this drug. However, the K562/DoxDR05 and K562/ABCG2-Z cells significantly decreased the intracellular levels of DRN and nilotinib, respectively, thereby mediating significant resistances to these drugs. Only cells which expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2 exceeded a certain level exhibited a significantly decreased intracellular level of imatinib, and this effect was accompanied by a significantly increased resistance to this drug. Our results clearly indicated that resistance to anticancer drugs mediated by main ABC transporters, ABCB1 and ABCG2, strongly depends on their expressions at protein levels. Importantly, resistance for one drug might be maintained while resistance for other ones might become undetectable at low transporter expression levels.","['Kosztyu, Petr', 'Bukvova, Romana', 'Dolezel, Petr', 'Mlejnek, Petr']","['Kosztyu P', 'Bukvova R', 'Dolezel P', 'Mlejnek P']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, Olomouc 77515, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, Olomouc 77515, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, Olomouc 77515, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, Olomouc 77515, Czech Republic.

The purpose of this report was to present a case of a primary laryngeal granulocytic sarcoma and review of the literature. METHODS: A literature review was performed using Medline and PubMed databases to search for cases of all primary and secondary myelogenous tumors of the larynx. RESULTS: A 36-year-old man presented with a mass involving the preepiglottic space that was histologically confirmed as an extramedullary acute myeloid leukemia, or granulocytic sarcoma. Our review found 18 cases of secondary involvement of the larynx by myelogenous tumors, and only 1 previously reported case of primary laryngeal granulocytic sarcoma. CONCLUSION: The detection of granulocytic sarcoma is difficult given its rarity and nonspecific presentation. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of primary granulocytic sarcoma of the larynx reported in the literature.","['Kim, Luke Y', 'Purkey, Michael T', 'Patel, Mihir R', 'Ghosh, Ankona', 'Hartner, Lee', 'Newman, Jason G']","['Kim LY', 'Purkey MT', 'Patel MR', 'Ghosh A', 'Hartner L', 'Newman JG']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Head Neck,Head & neck,8902541,['Primary granulocytic sarcoma'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Deglutition Disorders/diagnosis/etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/*pathology/*therapy', 'Tracheostomy/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/24 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hed.23805 [doi]'],ppublish,Head Neck. 2015 Mar;37(3):E38-44. doi: 10.1002/hed.23805.

FUT7 and ST3GAL4 were overexpressed in three AML MDR cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) of AML patients with MDR by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A close association was found between the expression levels of FUT7 and ST3GAL4 and the amount of sLe X oligosaccharides, as well as the phenotypic variation of MDR of HL60 and HL60/ADR cells both in vitro and in vivo. Manipulation of these two genes' expression modulated the activity of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, thereby regulating the proportionally mutative expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance related protein 1 (MRP1), both of which are known to be involved in MDR. Blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway by its specific inhibitor LY294002 or Akt short hairpin RNA (shRNA) resulted in the reduced MDR of HL60/ADR cells. This study indicated that sLe X involved in the development of MDR of AML cells probably through FUT7 and ST3GAL4 regulating the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and the expression of P-gp and MRP1.","['Ma, Hongye', 'Zhou, Huimin', 'Li, Peng', 'Song, Xiaobo', 'Miao, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Yanping', 'Jia, Li']","['Ma H', 'Zhou H', 'Li P', 'Song X', 'Miao X', 'Li Y', 'Jia L']","['College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Bone Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Tromso, Tromso, Norway.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.

This may lead to unnecessary treatment discontinuation in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Our aim was to review spontaneously reported cases of decreased factor V activity associated with both drugs and to identify the possible impact on patient care. METHODS: Cases of decrease in prothrombin (PT) or factor V activity involving purine analogs were extracted from the French pharmacovigilance database. Reports with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, signs of acute hepatocellular failure, liver cirrhosis or concomitant vitamin K antagonist treatment were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-four cases (azathioprine: 13 and 6-mercaptopurine: 11) were retained. Therapeutic indications were inflammatory bowel diseases in 11 patients, acute leukemia in eight, and other autoimmune diseases in five. PT activity before treatment was normal in all nine tested patients. The decrease in PT or factor V activity occurs after a median of 10 weeks of treatment and all patients were asymptomatic. The median PT and factor V activities values were 51.5% and 36.4%, respectively. Other coagulation factors were inconsistently decreased. Full recovery was observed within 3-60 days following purine analogs discontinuation. In four patients, drug rechallenge was associated with recurrence of the coagulation disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanism remains unknown, this series that includes cases with positive drug reintroduction strongly suggests the causative role of these drugs. As all patients remained asymptomatic, treatment discontinuation should be carefully considered in patients who clearly benefits from this treatment.","['Paret, Nathalie', 'Dautriche, Anne', 'Bera, Annie Pierre Jonville', 'Gouraud, Aurore', 'Millaret, Anne', 'Descotes, Jacques', 'Vial, Thierry']","['Paret N', 'Dautriche A', 'Bera AP', 'Gouraud A', 'Millaret A', 'Descotes J', 'Vial T']","['Centre regional de pharmacovigilance, 162, avenue Lacassagne, 69003 Lyon, France.', 'Centre regional de pharmacovigilance, hopital du Bocage, 10, boulevard Marechal-de-Lattre-de-Tassigny, BP 77908, 21000 Dijon, France.', 'Centre regional de pharmacovigilance, service de pharmacologie clinique, hopital Bretonneau, 2, boulevard Tonnelle, 37044 Tours cedex 9, France.', 'Centre regional de pharmacovigilance, 162, avenue Lacassagne, 69003 Lyon, France.', 'Centre regional de pharmacovigilance, 162, avenue Lacassagne, 69003 Lyon, France.', 'Centre regional de pharmacovigilance, 162, avenue Lacassagne, 69003 Lyon, France.', 'Centre regional de pharmacovigilance, 162, avenue Lacassagne, 69003 Lyon, France.

For subsequent similar data, NCCN guidelines indicate that ATRA plus ATO is one of the recommended regimens for the treatment of patients with APL. We demonstrated SFK (Src family kinase) inhibitor PP2-enhanced APL cell differentiation when combined with either ATRA or ATO with difference in activation of RA-induced genes. In this study, we investigated whether SFK inhibitor PP2 could enhance the differentiation of NB4 APL cells when combined with ATRA and ATO and the changes in the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) derived from the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) target gene. Treatment of NB4 cells with 1 muM of ATRA, 0.5 muM of ATO, or 10 muM of PP2 for 72 h induced expression of CD11b-positive cells by 13.01%, 11.53% or 13.28%, respectively. However, the combination of ATRA and ATO and the combination of three agents (ATRA, ATO, and PP2) led to a significantly higher expression of CD11b-positive cells (30.96% and 63.17%, respectively). The synergistic effect of the combination of three agents was more significant than the combination of ATRA and ATO. These results were confirmed with NBT staining. These effects were not related to apoptosis. Annexin-V-fluorescein staining revealed that a combination of ATRA and ATO and combination of the three agents did not induce apoptosis in NB4 cells. The expression of ICAM-1 markedly increased in cells treated with the combination of the three agents. These findings suggest that the SFK inhibitor can enhance differentiation of APL cells combined with ATRA and ATO.

PIM kinases act in downstream effector functions as inhibitors of apoptosis and as positive regulators of G1-S phase progression through the cell cycle. PIM kinases are upregulated in multiple cancer indications, including lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and prostate, gastric, and head and neck cancers. Overexpression of one or more PIM family members in patient tumors frequently correlates with poor prognosis. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate PIM expression in low- and high-grade urothelial carcinoma and to assess the role PIM function in disease progression and their potential to serve as molecular targets for therapy. One hundred thirty-seven cases of urothelial carcinoma were included in this study of surgical biopsy and resection specimens. High levels of expression of all three PIM family members were observed in both noninvasive and invasive urothelial carcinomas. The second-generation PIM inhibitor, TP-3654, displays submicromolar activity in pharmacodynamic biomarker modulation, cell proliferation studies, and colony formation assays using the UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cell line. TP-3654 displays favorable human ether-a-go-go-related gene and cytochrome P450 inhibition profiles compared with the first-generation PIM inhibitor, SGI-1776, and exhibits oral bioavailability. In vivo xenograft studies using a bladder cancer cell line show that PIM kinase inhibition can reduce tumor growth, suggesting that PIM kinase inhibitors may be active in human urothelial carcinomas.","['Foulks, Jason M', 'Carpenter, Kent J', 'Luo, Bai', 'Xu, Yong', 'Senina, Anna', 'Nix, Rebecca', 'Chan, Ashley', 'Clifford, Adrianne', 'Wilkes, Marcus', 'Vollmer, David', 'Brenning, Benjamin', 'Merx, Shannon', 'Lai, Shuping', 'McCullar, Michael V', 'Ho, Koc-Kan', 'Albertson, Daniel J', 'Call, Lee T', 'Bearss, Jared J', 'Tripp, Sheryl', 'Liu, Ting', 'Stephens, Bret J', 'Mollard, Alexis', 'Warner, Steven L', 'Bearss, David J', 'Kanner, Steven B']","['Foulks JM', 'Carpenter KJ', 'Luo B', 'Xu Y', 'Senina A', 'Nix R', 'Chan A', 'Clifford A', 'Wilkes M', 'Vollmer D', 'Brenning B', 'Merx S', 'Lai S', 'McCullar MV', 'Ho KK', 'Albertson DJ', 'Call LT', 'Bearss JJ', 'Tripp S', 'Liu T', 'Stephens BJ', 'Mollard A', 'Warner SL', 'Bearss DJ', 'Kanner SB']","['Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Lehi, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Lehi, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Lehi, UT.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Lehi, UT.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Lehi, UT.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Lehi, UT.

Recent studies have shown that EZH2 mutations are often associated with RUNX1 mutations in MDS patients, although its pathological function remains to be addressed. Here we establish an MDS mouse model by transducing a RUNX1S291fs mutant into hematopoietic stem cells and subsequently deleting Ezh2. Ezh2 loss significantly promotes RUNX1S291fs-induced MDS. Despite their compromised proliferative capacity of RUNX1S291fs/Ezh2-null MDS cells, MDS bone marrow impairs normal hematopoietic cells via selectively activating inflammatory cytokine responses, thereby allowing propagation of MDS clones. In contrast, loss of Ezh2 prevents the transformation of AML via PRC1-mediated repression of Hoxa9. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of how Ezh2 loss collaborates with RUNX1 mutants in the pathogenesis of MDS in both cell autonomous and non-autonomous manners.","['Sashida, Goro',

We analyzed 256 MDS patients who underwent transplantation from a matched related (n = 133) or matched unrelated (n = 123) donor after 2001. Of the 256, 78 (30.5%) did not receive cytoreductive therapy before HSCT; 40 (15.6%) received chemotherapy, 122 (47.7%) received hypomethylating agents (HMA), and 16 (6.2%) received both (chemo+HMA). Disease status at HSCT defined by International Working Criteria was complete remission in 46 (18%) patients. There were significant differences between therapy groups: there were more therapy-related MDS and higher use of matched related donor in the untreated group. The chemotherapy group had higher serum ferritin levels at HSCT. Patients were older and had more high-risk disease by revised International Prognostic Scoring in the HMA group. Despite those differences, transplantation outcomes were similar in patients who were untreated and who received cytoreductive therapy before HSCT. Three-year event-free survival (EFS) was 44.2%, 30.6%, 34.2%, and 32.8% for untreated, chemotherapy, HMA, and chemo+HMA groups, respectively (P = .50). Multivariate analyses revealed that older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.3; P = .001); high-risk histologic subtypes, including refractory anemia with excess blasts (HR, 1.5; P = .05) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (HR, 2.1; P = .03), high-risk cytogenetics with monosomal karyotype (MK) (HR, 4.0; P < .0001) and high serum ferritin level at HSCT (HR, 1.8; P = .002) were poor prognostic factors for EFS. Bone marrow blast count 5% or higher at HSCT (HR, 1.6; P = .01) and MK (HR, 4.2; P < .0001) were the only prognostic factors for increased relapse incidence after HSCT. Patients with MK represented a poor prognostic group, with 3-year EFS of 11.4% and relapse incidence of 60.9%. In this analysis, various therapy approaches before HSCT did not lead to different transplantation outcomes. Cytogenetics defined by MK was able to identify a very poor prognostic groups that innovative transplantation approaches to improve outcomes are urgently needed.","['Oran, Betul', 'Kongtim, Piyanuch', 'Popat, Uday', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Lu, Xinyan', 'Chen, Julien', 'Rondon, Gabriella', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Ahmed, Sairah', 'Andersson, Borje', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Ciurea, Stefan', 'Shpall, Elizabeth', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Oran B', 'Kongtim P', 'Popat U', 'de Lima M', 'Jabbour E', 'Lu X', 'Chen J', 'Rondon G', 'Kebriaei P', 'Ahmed S', 'Andersson B', 'Alousi A', 'Ciurea S', 'Shpall E', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

NPM1 is the most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia; mutations map to the C-terminal domain of the protein and cause its denaturation and aberrant cytoplasmic translocation. NPM1 C-terminal domain binds G-quadruplex regions at ribosomal DNA and at gene promoters, including the well characterized sequence from the nuclease-hypersensitive element III region of the c-MYC promoter. These activities are lost by the leukemic variant. Here we analyze the NPM1/G-quadruplex interaction, focusing on residues belonging to both the NPM1 terminal three-helix bundle and a lysine-rich unstructured tail, which has been shown to be necessary for high affinity recognition. We performed extended site-directed mutagenesis and measured binding rate constants through surface plasmon resonance analysis. These data, supported by molecular dynamics simulations, suggest that the unstructured tail plays a double role in the reaction mechanism.

Here we use the CRISPR-Cas9 system of genome editing to overcome this limitation. By delivering combinations of small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and Cas9 with a lentiviral vector, we modified up to five genes in a single mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), leading to clonal outgrowth and myeloid malignancy. We thereby generated models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with cooperating mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers, transcription factors and mediators of cytokine signaling, recapitulating the combinations of mutations observed in patients.

Due to the increasing use of molecular measurements, it was the aim of this work to identify a BCR-ABL level according to the international scale (BCR-ABL(IS)) as an equivalent substitute for complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR). METHODS: In total, 1,329 paired data from 557 patients of the German CML-Study IV were evaluated. The data set was divided into a learning set and a validation set. The best cutoff was determined applying a minimal p value approach to the Fisher test. RESULTS: In the learning set, we found BCR-ABL(IS) values between 0.2 and 1.1 % were well suited for predicting a CCyR. In the validation set, the cutoff level of 1 % led to a mean concordance rate of 90.1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there is no one-to-one cutoff for BCR-ABL(IS) representing CCyR, but we advise to use the 1 % BCR-ABL(IS) in order to avoid misclassification of CCyR patients.","['Lauseker, Michael', 'Hanfstein, Benjamin', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Pfirrmann, Markus', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Dietz, Christian T', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Muller, Martin C']","['Lauseker M', 'Hanfstein B', 'Haferlach C', 'Schnittger S', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Fabarius A', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Saussele S', 'Dietz CT', 'Erben P', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hasford J', 'Hochhaus A', 'Muller MC']","['Institut fur Medizinische Informationsverarbeitung, Biometrie und Epidemiologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology/therapy', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger/*blood/genetics', 'Remission Induction']",2014/06/24 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/06/23 06:00'],"['2014/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1746-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2014 Nov;140(11):1965-9. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1746-8.

Current strategies that employ gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) to target Notch activation have not been successful. Many limitations, such as non-Notch specificity, dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicity and GSI resistance, have prompted an urgent need for more effective Notch signaling inhibitors for T-ALL treatment. Human four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 1C (FHL1C) (KyoT2 in mice) has been demonstrated to suppress Notch activation in vitro, suggesting that FHL1C may be new candidate target in T-ALL therapy. However, the role of FHL1C in T-ALL cells remained unclear. METHODS: Using RT-PCR, we amplified full-length human FHL1C, and constructed full-length and various truncated forms of FHL1C. Using cell transfection, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscope, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blotting, we found that overexpression of FHL1C induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells. By using a reporter assay and Annexin-V staining, the minimal functional sequence of FHL1C inhibiting RBP-J-mediated Notch transactivation and inducing cell apoptosis was identified. Using real-time PCR and Western blotting, we explored the possible molecular mechanism of FHL1C-induced apoptosis. All data were statistically analyzed with the SPSS version 12.0 software. RESULTS: In Jurkat cells derived from a Notch1-associated T-ALL cell line insensitive to GSI treatment, we observed that overexpression of FHL1C, which is down-regulated in T-ALL patients, strongly induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we verified that FHL1C-induced apoptosis depended on the RBP-J-binding motif at the C-terminus of FHL1C. Using various truncated forms of FHL1C, we found that the RBP-J-binding motif of FHL1C had almost the same effect as full-length FHL1C on the induction of apoptosis, suggesting that the minimal functional sequence in the RBP-J-binding motif of FHL1C might be a new drug candidate for T-ALL treatment. We also explored the molecular mechanism of FHL1C overexpression-induced apoptosis, which suppressed downstream target genes such as Hes1 and c-Myc and key signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB of Notch signaling involved in T-ALL progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has revealed that FHL1C overexpression induces Jurkat cell apoptosis. This finding may provide new insights in designing new Notch inhibitors based on FHL1C to treat T-ALL.","['Fu, Wei', 'Wang, Kai', 'Zhao, Jun-Long', 'Yu, Heng-Chao', 'Li, San-Zhong', 'Lin, Yan', 'Liang, Liang', 'Huang, Si-Yong', 'Liang, Ying-Min', 'Han, Hua', 'Qin, Hong-Yan']","['Fu W', 'Wang K', 'Zhao JL', 'Yu HC', 'Li SZ', 'Lin Y', 'Liang L', 'Huang SY', 'Liang YM', 'Han H', 'Qin HY']","[""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, People's Republic of China. liangym@fmmu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (FHL1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (RBPJ protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'LIM Domain Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/06/24 06:00,2015/03/10 06:00,['2014/06/23 06:00'],"['2013/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-463 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-463 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jun 22;14:463. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-463.,,20140622,,PMC4077834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, an obatoclax analogue, SC-2001, was found to disrupt the protein-protein interactions of the Bcl-2 family and also repress Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression via STAT3 inactivation. Here, we report a novel mechanism of autophagy induction by SC-2001 in liver cancer cells. The findings indicate that SC-2001 induced the autophagy marker LC3-II in four hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Autophagosomes induced by SC-2001-treated cells were confirmed by electron microscopy. SC-2001 activated SHP-1, dephosphorylated STAT3 and Mcl-1, and subsequently released free beclin 1. Overexpression of STAT3 and Mcl-1 in PLC5 cells attenuated the induction of SC-2001 on autophagy. Abolishment of SHP-1 by a specific inhibitor aboragated the autophagic effects induced by SC-2001. In addition, it was further revealed that RFX-1, a transcription factor of SHP-1, is a critical regulator in SC-2001-mediated autophagy. Downregulation of RFX-1 by si-RNA protected cells from SC-2001-induced autophagy. Importantly, Huh7 tumor-bearing nude mice treated with SC-2001 showed downregulation of Mcl-1 and p-STAT3 protein expression and upregulation of SHP-1, LC3II, and RFX-1 protein expression. In summary, our data suggest that SC-2001 induces autophagic cell death in a RFX1/SHP-1/STAT3/Mcl-1 signaling cascade.","['Su, Jung-Chen', 'Tseng, Ping-Hui', 'Hsu, Cheng-Yi', 'Tai, Wei-Tien', 'Huang, Jui-Wen', 'Ko, Ching-Huai', 'Lin, Mai-Wei', 'Liu, Chun-Yu', 'Chen, Kuen-Feng', 'Shiau, Chung-Wai']","['Su JC', 'Tseng PH', 'Hsu CY', 'Tai WT', 'Huang JW', 'Ko CH', 'Lin MW', 'Liu CY', 'Chen KF', 'Shiau CW']","['Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; National Center of Excellence for Clinical Trial and Research, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RFX1 protein, human)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X1)', '0 (Rfx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (SC-2001)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Beclin-1', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phagosomes/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Regulatory Factor X1', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/06/24 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/06/23 06:00'],"['2014/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['2054 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2054 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Jul 15;5(13):4909-19. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2054.,,,,PMC4148109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, new therapeutic approaches are required for remission induction and prevention of relapse. Due to the higher chemotherapy sensitivity and limited life span of more differentiated AML blasts, differentiation-based therapies are a promising therapeutic approach. Based on public available gene expression profiles, a myeloid-specific differentiation-associated gene expression pattern was defined as the therapeutic target. A XIAP inhibitor (Dequalinium chloride, DQA) was identified in an in silico screening searching for small molecules that induce similar gene expression regulation. Treatment with DQA, similarly to Embelin (another XIAP inhibitor), induced cytotoxicity and differentiation in AML. XIAP inhibition differentially impaired cell viability of the most primitive AML blasts and reduced clonogenic capacity of AML cells, sparing healthy mature blood and hematopoietic stem cells.

Yet, how mutations in genes encoding ubiquitously expressed proteins such as these result in cell-type- and tissue-specific defects remains unknown. Here, we identify mutations in GATA1, encoding the critical hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-binding protein-1, that reduce levels of full-length GATA1 protein and cause DBA in rare instances. We show that ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency, the more common cause of DBA, can lead to decreased GATA1 mRNA translation, possibly resulting from a higher threshold for initiation of translation of this mRNA in comparison with other mRNAs. In primary hematopoietic cells from patients with mutations in RPS19, encoding ribosomal protein S19, the amplitude of a transcriptional signature of GATA1 target genes was globally and specifically reduced, indicating that the activity, but not the mRNA level, of GATA1 is decreased in patients with DBA associated with mutations affecting ribosomal proteins. Moreover, the defective hematopoiesis observed in patients with DBA associated with ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency could be partially overcome by increasing GATA1 protein levels. Our results provide a paradigm by which selective defects in translation due to mutations affecting ubiquitous ribosomal proteins can result in human disease.","['Ludwig, Leif S', 'Gazda, Hanna T', 'Eng, Jennifer C', 'Eichhorn, Stephen W', 'Thiru, Prathapan', 'Ghazvinian, Roxanne', 'George, Tracy I', 'Gotlib, Jason R', 'Beggs, Alan H', 'Sieff, Colin A', 'Lodish, Harvey F', 'Lander, Eric S', 'Sankaran, Vijay G']","['Ludwig LS', 'Gazda HT', 'Eng JC', 'Eichhorn SW', 'Thiru P', 'Ghazvinian R', 'George TI', 'Gotlib JR', 'Beggs AH', 'Sieff CA', 'Lodish HF', 'Lander ES', 'Sankaran VG']","[""1] Division of Hematology and Oncology, Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Absence of Shb was recently shown to reduce hematopoietic stem cell proliferation through activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and thus we sought to investigate Shb's role in the progression of leukemia. METHODS: Wild type and Shb knockout bone marrow cells were transformed with a retroviral BCR-ABL construct and subsequently transplanted to wild type or Shb knockout recipients. Disease latency, bone marrow and peripheral blood cell characteristics, cytokine expression, signaling characteristics and colony formation were determined by flow cytometry, qPCR, western blotting and methylcellulose colony forming assays. RESULTS: It was observed that Shb knockout BCR-ABL-transformed bone marrow cells produced a disease with death occurring at earlier time points compared with corresponding wild type controls due to elevated proliferation of transformed bone marrow cells. Moreover, significantly elevated interleukin-6 and granulocyte colony-stimulation factor mRNA levels were observed in Shb knockout c-Kit + leukemic bone marrow cells providing a plausible explanation for the concurrent peripheral blood neutrophilia. Shb knockout leukemic bone marrow cells also showed increased ability to form colonies in methylcellulose devoid of cytokines that was dependent on the concomitantly observed increased activity of FAK. Transplanting BCR-ABL-transformed Shb knockout bone marrow cells to Shb knockout recipients revealed decreased disease latency without neutrophilia, thus implicating the importance of niche-derived cues for the increase of blood granulocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of Shb accelerates disease progression by exerting dual roles in BCR-ABL-induced leukemia: increased cell expansion due to elevated FAK activity and neutrophilia in peripheral blood, the latter dependent on the genetic background of the leukemic niche.","['Gustafsson, Karin', 'Jamalpour, Maria', 'Trinh, Camilla', 'Kharas, Michael G', 'Welsh, Michael']","['Gustafsson K', 'Jamalpour M', 'Trinh C', 'Kharas MG', 'Welsh M']","['Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Husargatan 3, 75123 Uppsala, Sweden.

Risk factors for Rothia mucilaginosa (previously known as Stomatococcus mucilaginosus) bacteremia include prolonged and profound neutropenia, malignancy, and an indwelling vascular foreign body. Here, we describe 67 adults at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, from 2002 to 2012 with blood cultures positive for Rothia. Twenty-five of these patients had multiple positive blood cultures, indicating true clinical infection. Among these, 88% (22/25) were neutropenic, and 76% (19/25) had leukemia. Common sources of bacteremia were presumed gut translocation, mucositis, and catheter-related infection. One patient died with Rothia infection. Neutropenic patients were less likely to have a single positive blood culture than were nonneutropenic patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 21% of the isolates. All of the tested isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and most beta-lactams; however, four of six tested isolates were resistant to oxacillin.

A yeast two-hybrid screen has revealed that the transcriptional repressor Sin3b interacts with Myc protein. Endogenous Myc and Sin3b co-localize and interact in the nuclei of human and rat cells, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and proximity ligation assay. The interaction is Max-independent. A conserved Myc region (amino acids 186-203) is required for the interaction with Sin3 proteins. Histone deacetylase 1 is recruited to Myc-Sin3b complexes, and its deacetylase activity is required for the effects of Sin3b on Myc. Myc and Sin3a/b co-occupied many sites on the chromatin of human leukemia cells, although the presence of Sin3 was not associated with gene down-regulation. In leukemia cells and fibroblasts, Sin3b silencing led to Myc up-regulation, whereas Sin3b overexpression induced Myc deacetylation and degradation. An analysis of Sin3b expression in breast tumors revealed an association between low Sin3b expression and disease progression. The data suggest that Sin3b decreases Myc protein levels upon Myc deacetylation. As Sin3b is also required for transcriptional repression by Mxd-Max complexes, our results suggest that, at least in some cell types, Sin3b limits Myc activity through two complementary activities: Mxd-dependent gene repression and reduction of Myc levels.","['Garcia-Sanz, Pablo', 'Quintanilla, Andrea', 'Lafita, M Carmen', 'Moreno-Bueno, Gema', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Lucia', 'Tabor, Vedrana', 'Varela, Ignacio', 'Shiio, Yuzuru', 'Larsson, Lars-Gunnar', 'Portillo, Francisco', 'Leon, Javier']","['Garcia-Sanz P', 'Quintanilla A', 'Lafita MC', 'Moreno-Bueno G', 'Garcia-Gutierrez L', 'Tabor V', 'Varela I', 'Shiio Y', 'Larsson LG', 'Portillo F', 'Leon J']","['From the Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria (IBBTEC), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Universidad de Cantabria, Sociedad para el Desarrollo de Cantabria and the Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander 39011, Spain, the Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Instituto de Investigacion Hospital Universitario La Paz (IdiPaz), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, 28046 Madrid, Spain, the Fundacion M.

Previously, we reported that in response to ABT-737, ABT-737-resistant ALL cell lines showed an apparent increase in Mcl-1 (an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that is not effectively inhibited by ABT-737) while ABT-737-sensitive ALL cell lines showed decreased Mcl-1 levels. Here we explored the mechanism of Mcl-1 cleavage by ABT-737 and the effect of adjacent phosphorylation sites on Mcl-1 cleavage and apoptosis induced by ABT-737 in a human B-lineage ALL cell line. Caspase cleavage sites in Mcl-1 and the effect of mutation in Mcl-1 phosphorylation sites were determined by transducing Mcl-1 variants tagged with the V5 epitope into human ALL cells. Cytotoxicity was by fluorescence-based DIMSCAN, and changes in protein by immunoblotting. ABT-737 induced a caspase-dependent cleavage of Mcl-1. Of the two Mcl-1 caspase cleavage sites (D127 and D157), D157 was the site of ABT-737-induced cleavage in ALL cells. Cells with exogenously expressed Mcl-1 Delta157 fragment showed greater caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation when they were treated with ABT-737 compared with cells expressing wild-type or D157A mutant Mcl-1. Cells with mutated phosphorylation sites on Mcl-1 (S159A and T163A) were less susceptible to Mcl-1 cleavage and apoptosis induced by ABT-737. Our data showed that Mcl-1 is post-translationally regulated in response to ABT-737 treatment, primarily via a caspase-dependent cleavage that generates a pro-apoptotic Mcl-1 fragment.","['Ryu, YongKu', 'Hall, Connor P', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kang, Min H']","['Ryu Y', 'Hall CP', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kang MH']","['Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA Cell Biology & Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA Neuroscience and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA Cell Biology & Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA Neuroscience and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA Cell Biology & Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA Neuroscience and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA min.kang@ttuhsc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*toxicity', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoblotting', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*toxicity', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/toxicity', 'Sulfonamides/*toxicity']",2014/06/22 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/22 06:00'],"['2014/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1535370214538745 [pii]', '10.1177/1535370214538745 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2014 Oct;239(10):1390-402. doi: 10.1177/1535370214538745.

At time of their transplant, 20 and seven patients were in first and second complete remission, respectively, while three patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were responding to chemotherapy or who had not been previously treated. The CloB2A2 regimen consisted of clofarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day for 4 days, busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day for 2 days and antithymocyte globulin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 days. The median follow-up was 23 months.

Co-existence of an FLT3-ITD activating mutation has been found in more than 70% of NUP98-NSD1-positive patients. To address functional synergism, we determined the transforming potential of retrovirally expressed NUP98-NSD1 and FLT3-ITD in the mouse. Expression of NUP98-NSD1 provided mouse strain-dependent, aberrant self-renewal potential to bone marrow progenitor cells. Co-expression of FLT3-ITD increased proliferation and maintained self-renewal in vitro. Transplantation of immortalized progenitors co-expressing NUP98-NSD1 and FLT3-ITD into mice resulted in acute myeloid leukemia after a short latency. In contrast, neither NUP98-NSD1 nor FLT3-ITD single transduced cells were able to initiate leukemia. Interestingly, as reported for patients carrying NUP98-NSD1, an increased Flt3-ITD to wild-type Flt3 mRNA expression ratio with increased FLT3-signaling was associated with rapidly induced disease. In contrast, there was no difference in the expression levels of the NUP98-NSD1 fusion or its proposed targets HoxA5, HoxA7, HoxA9 or HoxA10 between animals with different latencies to develop disease. Finally, leukemic cells co-expressing NUP98-NSD1 and FLT3-ITD were very sensitive to a small molecule FLT3 inhibitor, which underlines the significance of aberrant FLT3 signaling for NUP98-NSD1-positive leukemias and suggests new therapeutic approaches that could potentially improve patient outcome.","['Thanasopoulou, Angeliki', 'Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Schwaller, Juerg']","['Thanasopoulou A', 'Tzankov A', 'Schwaller J']","[""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital of Basel (UKBB), Switzerland."", 'Institute for Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.', ""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital of Basel (UKBB), Switzerland j.schwaller@unibas.ch.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-NSD1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/06/22 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/22 06:00'],"['2014/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.100917 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.100917 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Sep;99(9):1465-71. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.100917.

The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to shift the balance in favor of tumor immunosurveillance, so that the immune system can recognize the tumor, eliminate it, and prevent its recurrence. Bendamustine plus rituximab is generally considered effective and safe in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. To evaluate the effects of bendamustine-rituximab and rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) on the recuperation of immune system, we analyze the distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells in peripheral blood of 18 patients who received 4-6 cycles of rituximab-bendamustine (BR) or six R-CHOP before therapy and 6 months after completing treatment. Our results indicate that lymphocyte recovery is impaired in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent lymphomas treated with bendamustine plus rituximab. Low CD4 T cells (<200 cells/mul) induced by bendamustine (BR) suggest prophylaxis should be applied against opportunistic infections. Asymptomatic EBV and CMV reactivations support a negative effect of BR on the immune system. If cellular immune therapy such as lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) or effector lymphocytes infusion is planned, regimes other than BR should be the first choice.","['Garcia Munoz, Ricardo', 'Izquierdo-Gil, Araceli', 'Munoz, Aura', 'Roldan-Galiacho, Veronica', 'Rabasa, Pilar', 'Panizo, Carlos']","['Garcia Munoz R', 'Izquierdo-Gil A', 'Munoz A', 'Roldan-Galiacho V', 'Rabasa P', 'Panizo C']","['Hematology Department, Hospital San Pedro, c/Piqueras 98, 26006, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain, rgmunoz@riojasalud.es.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/22 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2135-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Nov;93(11):1879-87. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2135-8.

We previously reported on the efficacy and safety of azacitidine in 155 AML patients treated within the Austrian Azacitidine Registry (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01595295). We herein update this report with a population almost twice as large (n = 302). This cohort included 172 patients with >30 % BM blasts; 93 % would have been excluded from the pivotal AZA-001 trial (which led to European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of azacitidine for high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML with 20-30 % BM blasts). Despite this much more unfavorable profile, results are encouraging: overall response rate was 48 % in the total cohort and 72 % in patients evaluable according to MDS-IWG-2006 response criteria, respectively. Median OS was 9.6 (95 % CI 8.53-10.7) months. A clinically relevant OS benefit was observed with any form of disease stabilization (marrow stable disease (8.1 months), hematologic improvement (HI) (9.7 months), or the combination thereof (18.9 months)), as compared to patients without response and/or without disease stabilization (3.2 months). Age, white blood cell count, and BM blast count at start of therapy did not influence OS. The baseline factors LDH >225 U/l, ECOG >/=2, comorbidities >/=3, monosomal karyotype, and prior disease-modifying drugs, as well as the response-related factors hematologic improvement and further deepening of response after first response, were significant independent predictors of OS in multivariate analysis. Azacitidine seems effective in WHO-AML, including patients with >30 % BM blasts (currently off-label use). Although currently not regarded as standard form of response assessment in AML, disease stabilization and/or HI should be considered sufficient response to continue treatment with azacitidine.","['Pleyer, Lisa', 'Burgstaller, Sonja', 'Girschikofsky, Michael', 'Linkesch, Werner', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Schreder, Martin', 'Tinchon, Christoph', 'Sliwa, Thamer', 'Lang, Alois', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Krippl, Peter', 'Geissler, Dietmar', 'Voskova, Daniela', 'Schlick, Konstantin', 'Thaler, Josef', 'Machherndl-Spandl, Sigrid', 'Theiler, Georg', 'Eckmullner, Otto', 'Greil, Richard']","['Pleyer L', 'Burgstaller S', 'Girschikofsky M', 'Linkesch W', 'Stauder R', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Schreder M', 'Tinchon C', 'Sliwa T', 'Lang A', 'Sperr WR', 'Krippl P', 'Geissler D', 'Voskova D', 'Schlick K', 'Thaler J', 'Machherndl-Spandl S', 'Theiler G', 'Eckmullner O', 'Greil R']","['3rd Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University Hospital Salzburg, and Center for Clinical Cancer and Immunology Trials at Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Mullner Hauptstrasse 48, 5020, Salzburg, Austria, l.pleyer@salk.at.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Austria/epidemiology', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', '*World Health Organization']",2014/06/22 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/22 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2126-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Nov;93(11):1825-38. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2126-9.

Difficulties in diagnosing invasive fungal infections and subsequent delays in treatment initiation lead to unfavourable outcomes and emphasise the importance of prophylaxis. Since the recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the German Society for Haematology and Oncology in 2009, results of 14 additional clinical studies have been published comprising 2,899 patients and initiating this update. Key recommendations for adult patients are as follows: Posaconazole remains the drug of choice during remission-induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with graft versus host disease (AI).

It often arises as a mediastinal mass, and with bone marrow involvement. Presentation at other sites without nodal or mediastinal localization is uncommon. CASE REPORT: We describe clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of two cases of primary T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma arising respectively in uterine corpus and testis. The tumors were composed by medium to large cells, exhibiting a diffuse pattern of growth but sometimes forming indian files or pseudo-rosettes. The neoplastic cells strongly expressed TdT and T-cell markers in both uterine corpus and testis. However, the testis case also showed aberrant expression of B-cell markers, thus molecular biology was necessary to achieve a final diagnosis. T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis identified a T-cell origin. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, only one doubtful previous case of primary uterine T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and no previous cases of primary testicular T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma have been reported. Due to the morphology of neoplastic cells, a challenging differential diagnosis with all the tumors belonging to the so-called small round blue cell tumor category is mandatory. In ambiguous lineage cases, molecular biology may represent an adequate tool to confirm diagnosis.

Studies conducted in other countries and Brazil have observed a decrease in their mortality.This study aimed to evaluate the trend of mortality from leukemia in children under 19 years of age in Brazil, from 1980 to 2010. METHODS: This was an ecological study, using retrospective time series data from the Mortality Information System, from 1980 to 2010. Calculations of mortality rates were performed, including gross, gender-specific, and age-based. For trend analysis, linear and semi-log regression models were used. The significance level was 5%. RESULTS: Mortality rates for lymphoid and myeloid leukemias presented a growth trend, with the exception of lymphoid leukemia among children under 4 years of age (percentage decrease: 1.21% annually), while in the sub-group ""Other types of leukemia"", a downward trend was observed. Overall, mortality from leukemia tended to increase for boys and girls, especially in the age groups 10-14 years (annual percentage increase of 1.23% for males and 1.28% for females) and 15-19 years (annual percentage increase of 1.40% for males and 1.62% for females). CONCLUSIONS: The results for leukemia generally corroborate the results of other similar studies. A detailed analysis by subgroup of leukemia, age, and gender revealed no trends shown in other studies, thus indicating special requirements for each variable in the analysis.","['Silva, Franciane F', 'Zandonade, Eliana', 'Zouain-Figueiredo, Glaucia P']","['Silva FF', 'Zandonade E', 'Zouain-Figueiredo GP']","['Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo (UFES), Vitoria, ES, Brazil.

However, the dynamic uptake into cells of TKIs of low molecular weight and their intracellular behaviour is unknown because of the difficulty of observing non-fluorescent small molecules at subcellular resolution. Here we report the direct label-free visualization and quantification of two TKI drugs (imatinib and nilotinib) inside living cells using hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging. Concentrations of both drugs were enriched over 1,000-fold in lysosomes as a result of their lysosomotropic properties. In addition, low solubility appeared to contribute significantly to the surprisingly large accumulation of nilotinib. We further show that the lysosomal trapping of imatinib was reduced more than tenfold when chloroquine is used simultaneously, which suggests that chloroquine may increase the efficacy of TKIs through lysosome-mediated drug-drug interaction in addition to the commonly proposed autophagy-inhibition mechanism.","['Fu, Dan', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Zhu, Wenjing Suzanne', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Wang, Y Karen', 'Hood, Tami', 'Wylie, Andrew', 'Xie, X Sunney']","['Fu D', 'Zhou J', 'Zhu WS', 'Manley PW', 'Wang YK', 'Hood T', 'Wylie A', 'Xie XS']","['1] Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA [2].', '1] Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA [2].', 'Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.', 'Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Basel CH-4002, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.', 'Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.', 'Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Nat Chem,Nature chemistry,101499734,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Cell Tracking/*methods', 'Eukaryotic Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman/*methods']",2014/06/21 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/06/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['nchem.1961 [pii]', '10.1038/nchem.1961 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Chem. 2014 Jul;6(7):614-22. doi: 10.1038/nchem.1961.

This review focuses on siphonaxanthin as a bioactive compound and outlines the evidence associated with functionality. Siphonaxanthin has been reported to potently inhibit the viability of human leukemia HL-60 cells via induction of apoptosis. In comparison with fucoxanthin, siphonaxanthin markedly reduced cell viability as early as 6 h after treatment. The cellular uptake of siphonaxanthin was 2-fold higher than fucoxanthin. It has been proposed that siphonaxanthin possesses significant anti-angiogenic activity in studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells and rat aortic ring. The results of these studies suggested that the anti-angiogenic effect of siphonaxanthin is due to the down-regulation of signal transduction by fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 in vascular endothelial cells. Siphonaxanthin also exhibited inhibitory effects on antigen-induced degranulation of mast cells. These findings open up new avenues for future research on siphonaxanthin as a bioactive compound, and additional investigation, especially in vivo studies, are required to validate these findings. In addition, further studies are needed to determine its bioavailability and metabolic fate.","['Sugawara, Tatsuya', 'Ganesan, Ponesakki', 'Li, Zhuosi', 'Manabe, Yuki', 'Hirata, Takashi']","['Sugawara T', 'Ganesan P', 'Li Z', 'Manabe Y', 'Hirata T']","['Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawaoiwakecho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan. sugawara@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawaoiwakecho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan. ganesan381980@yahoo.com.', 'Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawaoiwakecho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan. lizhuosi@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawaoiwakecho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan. yuukim@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawaoiwakecho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan. hiratan@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Xanthophylls)', '06O0TC0VSM (fucoxanthin)', '28526-44-5 (siphonaxanthin)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorophyta/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xanthophylls/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2014/06/21 06:00,2015/01/16 06:00,['2014/06/21 06:00'],"['2014/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['md12063660 [pii]', '10.3390/md12063660 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2014 Jun 19;12(6):3660-8. doi: 10.3390/md12063660.,,20140619,,PMC4071595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HAS1 is aberrantly spliced in malignant cells from multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), but not in their counterparts from healthy donors. The presence of aberrant HAS1 splice variants predicts for poor survival in multiple myeloma (MM). We evaluated the influence of inherited HAS1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on the risk of having a systemic B cell malignancy in 1414 individuals compromising 832 patients and 582 healthy controls, including familial analysis of an Icelandic kindred. We sequenced HAS1 gene segments from 181 patients with MM, 98 with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), 72 with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), 169 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as 34 members of a monoclonal gammopathy-prone Icelandic family, 212 age-matched healthy donors and a case-control cohort of 295 breast cancer patients with 353 healthy controls. Three linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in HAS1 intron3 are significantly associated with B-cell malignancies (range p = 0.007 to p = 10(-5)), but not MGUS or breast cancer, and predict risk in a 34 member Icelandic family (p = 0.005, Odds Ratio = 5.8 (OR)), a relatively homogeneous cohort. In contrast, exon3 SNPs were not significantly different among the study groups. Pooled analyses showed a strong association between the linked HAS1 intron3 SNPs and B-cell malignancies (OR = 1.78), but not for sporadic MGUS or for breast cancer (OR<1.0).

SB maintains the undifferentiated state of mouse embryonic stem cells. However, the way of SB in maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse embryonic stem cells remains unclear. Considering that SB could not maintain embryonic stem cells pluripotency when leukemia inhibitory factor was withdrawn, we sought to identify the mechanism of SB on pluripotent maintenance. Transcripts regulated by SB, including message RNAs and small non-coding RNAs were examined through microarray and deep-sequence experiments. After examination, Western blot analysis, and quantitative real-time PCR verification, we found that SB regulated the transcript expressions related to self-renewal and differentiation. SB mainly functioned by inhibiting differentiation. The key pluripotent factors expression were not significantly affected by SB, and intrinsic differentiation-related transcripts including fibroblast growth factor family members, were significantly down-regulated by SB. Moreover, SB could partially inhibit the retinoic acid response to neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.","['Du, Juan', 'Wu, Yongyan', 'Ai, Zhiying', 'Shi, Xiaoyan', 'Chen, Linlin', 'Guo, Zekun']","['Du J', 'Wu Y', 'Ai Z', 'Shi X', 'Chen L', 'Guo Z']","['College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, 3 Taicheng Road, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China.

Clinically, snake venom toxins therefore represent a significant hazard to snakebite victims which underscores the need to produce more efficient anti-venom. Some snake venom toxins, however, have great potential as drugs for treating human diseases. In this review, we discuss the biochemistry, structure/function, and pathology induced by snake venom toxins on human tissue. We provide a broad overview of cobra venom cytotoxins, catalytically active and inactive phospholipase A2s (PLA2s), and Zn(2+)-dependent metalloproteinases. We also propose biomedical applications whereby snake venom toxins can be employed for treating human diseases. Cobra venom cytotoxins, for example, may be utilized as anti-cancer agents since they are efficient at destroying certain types of cancer cells including leukemia. Additionally, increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) by which snake venom PLA2s promote hydrolysis of cell membrane phospholipids can give insight into the underlying biomedical implications for treating autoimmune disorders that are caused by dysregulated endogenous PLA2 activity. Lastly, we provide an exhaustive overview of snake venom Zn(2+)-dependent metalloproteinases and suggest ways by which these enzymes can be engineered for treating deep vein thrombosis and neurodegenerative disorders.","['Gasanov, Sardar E', 'Dagda, Ruben K', 'Rael, Eppie D']","['Gasanov SE', 'Dagda RK', 'Rael ED']","['Applied Mathematics and Informatics Department, Moscow State University Branch, 22 A.

We demonstrated that ROT induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells cultured in G11 by oxidative stress (OS) mechanism involving the generation of anion superoxide radical (O2(-), 68%)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 54%), activation of NF-kappaB (32%), p53 (25%), c-Jun (17%) transcription factors, and caspase-3 (28%), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF, 36%) nuclei translocation, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, and loss of mitochondria transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim, 62%) leading to nuclei fragmentation (~10% and ~40% stage I-II fragmented nuclei, resp.). ROT induces massive cytoplasmic aggregates of DJ-1 (93%), and upregulation of Parkin compared to untreated cells, but no effect on PINK-1 protein was observed. Cell death marker detection and DJ-1 and Parkin expression were significantly reduced when cells were cultured in G55 plus ROT. Remarkably, metformin sensitized Jurkat cells against ROT in G55. Our results indicate that a high-glucose milieu promotes resistance against ROT/H2O2-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells.

METHODS: From January 2010 to April 2012, all consecutive patients with newly diagnosed AML were prospectively registered at 33 participating Italian centres. All cases of IFIs occurring within 30 days after the end of the first induction chemotherapy were recorded. The strategy of antifungal treatment (empirical, pre-emptive or targeted) and the drugs used were analysed. ClinicalTrials.gov code: NCT01315925. RESULTS: In total, 1192 patients with newly diagnosed AML were enrolled in the study, of whom 510 received posaconazole prophylaxis and were included in the present analysis. Of these patients, 140 (27%) needed systemic antifungal treatment. Among the 127 evaluable cases, an empirical approach was utilized in 102 patients (80%), a pre-emptive approach in 19 patients (15%) and targeted therapy in 6 patients (5%). Only five patients died of IFIs (three in the empirical group and two in the targeted group; 4%). A critical review of IFI diagnoses at 30 days demonstrated that among the patients treated empirically, approximately 30% were not affected by IFIs but rather only by fever of unidentified origin. A comparison between the empirical and the pre-emptive groups showed no significant differences regarding the attributable and overall mortalities. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that posaconazole prophylaxis reduces the incidence of breakthrough IFIs and does not modify the efficacy of subsequent systemic antifungal treatment, regardless of the approach (empirical or pre-emptive) or the antifungal drug used.","['Pagano, Livio', 'Verga, Luisa', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Mitra, Maria Enza', 'Fanci, Rosa', 'Ballanti, Stelvio', 'Picardi, Marco', 'Castagnola, Carlo', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Nosari, Annamaria', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Caira, Morena', 'Salutari, Prassede', 'Lessi, Federica', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Tumbarello, Mario']","['Pagano L', 'Verga L', 'Busca A', 'Martino B', 'Mitra ME', 'Fanci R', 'Ballanti S', 'Picardi M', 'Castagnola C', 'Cattaneo C', 'Nadali G', 'Nosari A', 'Candoni A', 'Caira M', 'Salutari P', 'Lessi F', 'Aversa F', 'Tumbarello M']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy lpagano@rm.unicatt.it.', 'Unita di Ematologia, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale S.Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Ematologia, Ospedale S.Giovanni Battista, Torino, Italy.', ""Divisione di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera 'Bianchi Melacrino Morelli', Reggio Calabria, Italy."", 'Divisione di Ematologia e TMO, Policlinico di Palermo, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa di Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Universita di Perugia, Italy.', 'Divisione di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Chirurgia, Universita Federico II, Napoli, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Onco-Ematologico, Fondazione ICRRS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Divisione di Ematologia, Spedali Civili di Brescia, Italy.', 'UOC Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona, Italy.', ""Divisione di Ematologia e Centro Trapianti Midollo, Ospedale Niguarda Ca' Granda, Milano, Italy."", 'Clinica di Ematologia, Universita di Udine, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Ematologia Clinica, Ospedale Santo Spirito, Pescara, Italy.', 'Ematologia ed Immunologia Clinica, Dipartimento di Medicina, Universita di Padova, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Universita di Parma, Italy.', 'Istituto di Malattie Infettive, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', '*Data Collection/methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/21 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/06/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['dku227 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dku227 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2014 Nov;69(11):3142-7. doi: 10.1093/jac/dku227.

By 1 and 2 years, confirmed undetectable BCR-ABL1 was achieved by 12.5% vs 5.8% (P = .108) and 22.1% vs 8.7% of patients in the nilotinib and imatinib arms, respectively (P = .0087). Among patients without molecular response 4.5 (BCR-ABL1(IS) </=0.0032%; MR(4.5)) and those without major molecular response at study start, MR(4.5) by 2 years was achieved by 42.9% vs 20.8% and 29.2% vs 3.6% of patients in the nilotinib and imatinib arms, respectively. No patient in the nilotinib arm lost CCyR, vs 3 in the imatinib arm. Adverse events were more common in the nilotinib arm, as expected with the introduction of a new drug vs remaining on a well-tolerated drug. The safety profile of nilotinib was consistent with other reported studies. In summary, switching to nilotinib enabled more patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) to sustain lower levels of disease burden vs remaining on imatinib.

We evaluated the relationship between PAH exposure and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using concentrations in residential dust as an exposure indicator. We conducted a population-based case-control study (251 ALL cases, 306 birth-certificate controls) in Northern and Central California from 2001 to 2007. We collected residential dust using a high volume small surface sampler (HVS3) (n=185 cases, 212 controls) or by sampling from participants' household vacuum cleaners (n=66 cases, 94 controls). We evaluated log-transformed concentrations of 9 individual PAHs, the summed PAHs, and the summed PAHs weighted by their carcinogenic potency (the toxic equivalence). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression adjusting for demographic characteristics and duration between diagnosis/reference date and dust collection. Among participants with HVS3 dust, risk of ALL was not associated with increasing concentration of any PAHs based on OR perln(ng/g). Among participants with vacuum dust, we observed positive associations between ALL risk and increasing concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (OR perln[ng/g]=1.42, 95% CI=0.95, 2.12), dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (OR=1.98, 95% CI=1.11, 3.55), benzo[k]fluoranthene (OR=1.71, 95% CI=0.91, 3.22), indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (OR=1.81, 95% CI=1.04, 3.16), and the toxic equivalence (OR=2.35, 95% CI=1.18, 4.69). The increased ALL risk among participants with vacuum dust suggests that PAH exposure may increase the risk of childhood ALL; however, reasons for the different results based on HVS3 dust samples deserve further study.","['Deziel, N C', 'Rull, R P', 'Colt, J S', 'Reynolds, P', 'Whitehead, T P', 'Gunier, R B', 'Month, S R', 'Taggart, D R', 'Buffler, P', 'Ward, M H', 'Metayer, C']","['Deziel NC', 'Rull RP', 'Colt JS', 'Reynolds P', 'Whitehead TP', 'Gunier RB', 'Month SR', 'Taggart DR', 'Buffler P', 'Ward MH', 'Metayer C']","['Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA.

OBJETIVES: To determine the prevalence of underlying cancer in patients with mild CEA elevation and the mean cost per patient of CEA determination. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in all patients with CEA elevation (3-10 ng/ml) and suspicion of cancer referred to the gastroenterology or internal medicine outpatient units from 2001 to 2007. RESULTS: We studied 100 patients (60 men and 40 women), with a mean age of 67.4 +/- 14.2 years and baseline CEA of 5.8 +/- 1.7 ng/ml. The most important symptoms and signs were laboratory abnormalities (19 patients [19%]). Cancer was diagnosed in 4 patients (one gastric, 2 lung and one colon). Among patients without malignancies, 49 patients (49%) had no related processes, and 47 (47%) had benign diseases. During follow-up, one laryngeal cancer, one acute myeloid leukemia, and one colon cancer were detected (54.3 +/- 24.6 months). We found no differences between baseline CEA levels in patients with and without cancer (6.6 +/- 2.4 vs. 5.8 +/- 1.7 ng/ml, p = 0.2). The mean cost per patient was 503.6 +/- 257.6 euro. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer was detected in a small proportion (7%) of patients with mild CEA elevation. The study of these patients is directly and indirectly associated with a not inconsiderable cost.","['Cerezo Ruiz, Antonio', 'Rosa Jimenez, Francisco', 'Lobon Hernandez, Jose Antonio', 'Gomez Jimenez, Francisco Javier']","['Cerezo Ruiz A', 'Rosa Jimenez F', 'Lobon Hernandez JA', 'Gomez Jimenez FJ']","['Aparato Digestivo.

The mechanism of resistance and the normal differentiation pathway are poorly understood. Three-amino-acid loop extension (TALE) family genes are master regulators of differentiation. Because retinoids promote differentiation in neuroblastoma, we evaluated TALE family gene expression in neuroblastoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated expression of TALE family genes in RA-sensitive and -resistant neuroblastoma cell lines, with and without 13-cisRA treatment, identifying genes whose expression correlates with retinoid sensitivity. We evaluated the roles of one gene, PBX1, in neuroblastoma cell lines, including proliferation and differentiation. We evaluated PBX1 expression in primary human neuroblastoma samples by qRT-PCR, and three independent clinical cohort microarray datasets. RESULTS: We confirmed that induction of PBX1 expression, and no other TALE family genes, was associated with 13-cisRA responsiveness in neuroblastoma cell lines. Exogenous PBX1 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines, mimicking induced PBX1 expression, significantly impaired proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, and promoted RA-dependent and -independent differentiation. Reduced PBX1 protein levels produced an aggressive growth phenotype and RA resistance. PBX1 expression correlated with histologic neuroblastoma subtypes, with highest expression in benign ganglioneuromas and lowest in high-risk neuroblastomas. High PBX1 expression is prognostic of survival, including in multivariate analysis, in the three clinical cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: PBX1 is an essential regulator of differentiation in neuroblastoma and potentiates retinoid-induced differentiation. Neuroblastoma cells and tumors with low PBX1 expression have an immature phenotype with poorer prognosis, independent of other risk factors.","['Shah, Nilay', 'Wang, Jianjun', 'Selich-Anderson, Julia', 'Graham, Garrett', 'Siddiqui, Hasan', 'Li, Xin', 'Khan, Javed', 'Toretsky, Jeffrey']","['Shah N', 'Wang J', 'Selich-Anderson J', 'Graham G', 'Siddiqui H', 'Li X', 'Khan J', 'Toretsky J']","[""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Research Institute of Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio; nshahnb@gmail.com."", 'Oncogenomics Section, Advanced Technology Center, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Gaithersburg, Maryland;', ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Research Institute of Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio;"", 'Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center; and.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, The Research Institute of Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio;"", 'Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Biomathematics, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.', 'Oncogenomics Section, Advanced Technology Center, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Gaithersburg, Maryland;', 'Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dermatologic Agents)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dermatologic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/06/21 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/06/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1486 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1486 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Aug 15;20(16):4400-12. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1486.

Although transplantation of BMSCs has a therapeutic effect on many diseases, it is unclear whether BMSC transplantation can be used as a therapy for a thin endometrium. To explore whether transplantation of BMSCs directly into the uterine cavity can improve endometrium thickness, a thin endometrium rat model was established by infusing ethanol into the uterine cavity. In all, 48 rats with thin endometrium and 24 normal rats were divided into 3 groups: (1) normal group, (2) experimental group transplanted with BMSCs into uterine cavity, and (3) control group transplanted with saline into the uterine cavity. The morphology of the endometrium, the regeneration and receptivity of the endometrium, and the mechanisms involved in BMSC therapy were subsequently analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, Western blot analysis, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction throughout an observation period of 3 estrus cycles. The rats in the experimental group had a significantly thicker endometrial lining and exhibited higher expression of cytokeratin, vimentin, integrin alphagammabeta3, and leukaemia inhibitor factor (LIF) than that of the control group (P < .05). Bromodeoxyuridine -positive cells were detected in the endometrium after BMSC transplantation. Some proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) and interleukin (IL)-1betamRNA, were significantly downregulated, and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA and IL-6mRNA, were significantly upregulated in the experimental group compared to the control group (P < .05). In conclusion, BMSCs improved endometrium thickness, probably via their migration and immunomodulatory properties. Uterine perfusion with BMSCs represents a promising new tool for the currently intractable problem of an inadequate, thin endometrium.","['Zhao, Jing', 'Zhang, Qiong', 'Wang, Yonggang', 'Li, Yanping']","['Zhao J', 'Zhang Q', 'Wang Y', 'Li Y']","['Reproductive Medicine Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China zhaojing19840427@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endometrium/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Ethanol/toxicity', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', '*Regeneration', 'Time Factors']",2014/06/21 06:00,2015/09/18 06:00,['2014/06/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1933719114537715 [pii]', '10.1177/1933719114537715 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2015 Feb;22(2):181-8. doi: 10.1177/1933719114537715.

It was recently found to be the receptor for heme and its plasma-binding protein hemopexin (Hx) and is integral to systemic heme clearance. Little is known about systemic concentrations of Hx during pregnancy and whether maternal Hx and placental LRP1 contributes to fetal iron (Fe) homeostasis during pregnancy. We hypothesized that placental LRP1 would be upregulated in maternal/neonatal Fe insufficiency and would be related to maternal circulating Hx. Placental LRP1 expression was assessed in 57 pregnant adolescents (14-18 years) in relationship with maternal and cord blood Fe status indicators (hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin, transferrin receptor), the Fe regulatory hormone hepcidin and serum Hx. Hx at mid-gestation correlated positively with Hb at mid-gestation (r=0.35, P=0.02) and Hx at delivery correlated positively with cord hepcidin (r=0.37, P=0.005). Placental LRP1 protein expression was significantly higher in women who exhibited greater decreases in serum Hx from mid-gestation to term (r=0.28, P=0.04). Significant associations were also found between placental LRP1 protein with cord hepcidin (r=-0.29, P=0.03) and placental heme exporter feline leukemia virus C receptor 1 (r=0.34, P=0.03).

Our previous study showed that OPN can promote tumor cell proliferation in GISTs. In this series, we further aim to investigate the effect of OPN on apoptosis in GISTs. METHODS: The expression of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins in response to OPN was evaluated. In vitro effects of OPN against apoptosis in GIST were also assessed. GIST specimens were also used for analyzing protein expression of specific apoptosis-related molecules and their clinicopathologic significance. RESULTS: Up-regulation of beta-catenin and anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 with concomitant suppression of apoptotic proteins in response to OPN was noted. A significant anti-apoptotic effect of OPN on imatinib-induced apoptosis was identified. Furthermore, Mcl-1 overexpression was significantly associated with OPN and beta-catenin expression in tumor tissues, as well as worse survival clinically. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies anti-apoptotic effects of OPN that, through beta-catenin-mediated Mcl-1 up-regulation, significantly antagonized imatinib-induced apoptosis in GISTs. These results provide a potential rationale for therapeutic strategies targeting both OPN and Mcl-1 of the same anti-apoptotic signaling pathway, which may account for resistance to imatinib in GISTs.","['Hsu, Kai-Hsi', 'Tsai, Hung-Wen', 'Lin, Pin-Wen', 'Hsu, Yun-Shang', 'Lu, Pei-Jung', 'Shan, Yan-Shen']","['Hsu KH', 'Tsai HW', 'Lin PW', 'Hsu YS', 'Lu PJ', 'Shan YS']","['Department of Surgery, National Cheng Kung University, College of Medicine, Tainan 70428, Taiwan. ysshan@mail.ncku.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Osteopontin/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']",2014/06/21 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/06/21 06:00'],"['2014/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7819-12-189 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7819-12-189 [doi]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2014 Jun 20;12:189. doi: 10.1186/1477-7819-12-189.,,20140620,,PMC4080696,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometry (FCM) is very useful in the diagnosis of the plasma cell leukemia. Herein, we present 10 cases of PCL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied immunophenotypic profile of 10 cases of PCL from Jan 2009 to Dec 2013 using 5 parameters, 6 color flow cytometric analysis. We also studied their clinical presentation and other laboratory findings. RESULTS: Common clinical features at presentation were weakness, bone pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia and osteolytic lesions. Plasma cell population were identified by strong expression of CD38 and co-expression of CD38 and CD138. CD56 was expressed in 20% cases. CD19 and CD117 were negative in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotyping is highly useful to differentiate PCL from other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders with plasmacytoid morphology as well as from non-neoplastic reactive plasma cells. Co-expression of CD38 and CD138 is a best combination to identify the plasma cells by using FCM.","['Agarwal, Anshul D', 'Brahmbhatt, Beena S', 'Parikh, Biren P', 'Shah, Manoj J']","['Agarwal AD', 'Brahmbhatt BS', 'Parikh BP', 'Shah MJ']","['Department of Pathology, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2014/06/21 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2014_51_1_18_134605 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.134605 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2014 Jan-Mar;51(1):18-9. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.134605.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though there is much data on CML chronic phase, there is limited data on imatinib-naomicronve advanced phase CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 90 patients with advanced phase CML (accelerated phase [AP]: 51 and blast crisis [BC]: 39), patients who received imatinib as frontline therapy. RESULTS: The median age of presentation in CML-AP and CML-BC were 32 years (12-61) and 39 years (8-59), respectively. Imatinib at 600 mg/day was initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Median time to complete hematological response in both CML-AP and CML-BC was 3 months (CML-AP: 1-9 months and CML-BC: 1-14 months). At 6 months 30 (59%) CML-AP and 15 (38%) CML-BC patients achieved major cytogenetic response (MCyR), of them 24 (47%) and 10 (25.6%) being the complete cytogenetic response, respectively. At a median follow-up of 41 months, the median overall survival in CML-AP was 61 months, but in CML-BC it was 14 months. The median progression-free survival and event-free survival were 30 months and 23 months in CML-AP and 14 and 12 months in CML-BC, respectively. On univariate analysis, performance status (PS), spleen size, and MCyR predicted survival in AP, whereas in BC, platelet count, PS, and early MCyR were predictive. Non-hematologic and hematologic adverse events were observed in 80% and 60% of patients, respectively. Dose was reduced in 10% of patients for grade IV toxicity and interrupted in 30% for grade III toxicity. CONCLUSION: Front-line imatinib is an option in advanced phases of CML especially in CML-AP in low-resource countries, where stem cell transplantation and alternate TKIs are not available.","['Thota, N K', 'Gundeti, S', 'Linga, V G', 'Coca, P', 'Tara, R P']","['Thota NK', 'Gundeti S', 'Linga VG', 'Coca P', 'Tara RP']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Andhra pradesh, India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/21 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2014_51_1_5_134598 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.134598 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2014 Jan-Mar;51(1):5-9. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.134598.,,,,,,,,,,,['Raghunadharao'],,,,,,,,,,

Here we developed a tumor antigen-targeted delivery of immunonanoparticle carrying a novel non-immunosuppressive FTY720 derivative OSU-2S with potent cytotoxicity against leukemic B cells. OSU-2S induces activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SHP1(S591) and deregulation of multiple cellular processes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) resulting in potent cytotoxicity. To preclude OSU-2S-mediated effects on these ubiquitous phosphatases in unintended cells and avoid potential adverse effects, we developed an OSU-2S-targeted delivery of immunonanoparticles (2A2-OSU-2S-ILP), that mediated selective cytotoxicity of CLL but not normal B cells through targeting receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1 expressed in leukemic but not normal B cells. Developing a novel spontaneous CLL mouse model expressing human ROR1 (hROR1) in all leukemic B cells, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of enhanced survival with 2A2-OSU-2S-ILP in vivo. The newly developed non-immunosuppressive OSU-2S, its delivery using human CLL directed immunonanoparticles and the novel transgenic (Tg) mouse model of CLL that expresses hROR1 exclusively in leukemic B cell surface are highly innovative and can be applied to CLL and other ROR1+ malignancies including mantle cell lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Mani, R', 'Mao, Y', 'Frissora,

We analysed the diagnostic role of BM smears, multiparameter flow cytometry analysis, histology and microbiological cultures. Five patients (11%) were finally diagnosed by BM study (three had an infectious disease and two were found to have haematological malignancies), all of whom were immunocompetent patients. Histology was the most useful study (diagnosis was obtained in 4/5 patients), while BM cultures did not establish the final diagnosis in any patient. Flow cytometry established the diagnosis in one patient, although this patient was also diagnosed by histology. In conclusion, BM study is useful for establishing the aetiology of FUO.

Seven patients had secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at UCBT, and median age at UCBT was 54 years. Twenty-four patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen, and 17 of 35 patients received total body irradiation (2 to 12 Gy)-fludarabine-cyclophosphamide (TCF) conditioning. The median follow-up was 24 months. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at 60 days was 80%. Fifteen patients relapsed after UCBT. The 2-year overall survival and event-free-survival (EFS) rates were 44% and 30%, respectively. All patients given TCF achieved neutrophil and platelet recovery, and the use of TCF was associated with superior EFS in the RIC population (44% versus 0%, P = .001). Patients with transformation to AML had similar outcomes to patients with less advanced stages. In conclusion, despite graft failure remaining a major concern, the role of UCBT in the management of MF, especially using RIC TCF-based regimens, deserves further investigation to improve results.","['Robin, Marie', 'Giannotti, Federica', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Legrand, Faezeh', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Nguyen, Stephanie', 'Maillard, Natacha', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Linkesch, Werner', 'Cannell, Paul', 'Marcatti, Magda', 'Bay, Jacques-Olivier', 'Chalandon, Yves', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa']","['Robin M', 'Giannotti F', 'Deconinck E', 'Mohty M', 'Michallet M', 'Sanz G', 'Chevallier P', 'Cahn JY', 'Legrand F', 'Rovira M', 'Passweg J', 'Sierra J', 'Nguyen S', 'Maillard N', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Linkesch W', 'Cannell P', 'Marcatti M', 'Bay JO', 'Chalandon Y', 'Kroger N', 'Gluckman E', 'Rocha V', 'Olavarria E', 'Ruggeri A']","['Hematology-Bone Marrow Transplantation, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.

It was initially described in the setting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but it has since been identified in immunocompetent patients, as well. PBL is characterized by CD20 negativity and is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. The outcome with available therapy is poor, with median survival of less than 1 year. Multiple adverse prognostic factors have been identified, including HIV-negativity, MYC gene rearrangement, high-risk international prognostic index, and not achieving complete remission after induction therapy. The role of intensification of induction chemotherapy is controversial. Novel agents have shown some activity in relapsed setting and may have a role in upfront line of treatment. The outcome for relapsed PBL is dismal. Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) appears to be feasible and may produce better results than chemotherapy, but definitive data are sparse. Chemosensitivity before transplantation might be required to benefit from such therapy. Some data suggest a better outcome of PBL if consolidation with AHCT is used in first-line setting, particularly for those with high-risk disease.","['Al-Malki, Monzr M', 'Castillo, Jorge J', 'Sloan, J Mark', 'Re, Alessandro']","['Al-Malki MM', 'Castillo JJ', 'Sloan JM', 'Re A']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Roger Williams Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island; Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.

The aim of the study was to assess the antiproliferative effect of the venom obtained from Rhinella schneideri and to identify its constituents by spectroscopic and spectrometric methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The venom was obtained by gentle pressing the parotid glands of the toads. The dry crude drug was analyzed by HPLC-MS-MS and chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 to obtain purified compounds and fractions for spectroscopic analysis. The venom and fractions were evaluated for antiproliferative activity towards normal human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) and four human cancer cell lines: gastric epithelial adenocarcinoma (AGS), lung cancer (SK-MES-1), bladder carcinoma (J82) and promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60). RESULTS: From the Rhinella schneideri venom, 29 compounds were isolated and/or identified by spectroscopic and spectrometric means. Three known alkaloids and five argininyl diacids were identified in the complex mixture by HPLC-MS-MS. Nine out of fifteen argininyl diacid derivatives of the bufadienolides bufalin, marinobufagin and telocinobufagin are reported for the first time and four argininyl diacids are described for the first time as natural products. The venom and the fractions 9-13 showed a remarkable antiproliferative effect, with IC50 values in the range 0.019-0.022, 0.035-0.040, 0.028-0.064, 0.042-0.056 and 0.044-0.052 microg/mL for MRC-5, AGS, SK-MES-1, J82 and HL-60 cell lines, respectively. Under the same experimental conditions, IC50 values of the reference compound etoposide were 2.296, 0.277, 1.295, 1.884 and 1.059 microg/mL towards MRC-5, AGS, SK-MES-1, J82 and HL-60 cells, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The venom showed a strong antiproliferative effect towards human cancer cells and presented a high chemical diversity in its constituents, supporting its use as anticancer agent. These findings encourage further work on the chemistry and bioactivity of South American toad venoms.","['Schmeda-Hirschmann, Guillermo', 'Quispe, Cristina', 'Theoduloz, Cristina', 'de Sousa, Paulo Teixeira Jr', 'Parizotto, Carlos']","['Schmeda-Hirschmann G', 'Quispe C', 'Theoduloz C', 'de Sousa PT Jr', 'Parizotto C']","['Laboratorio de Quimica de Productos Naturales, Instituto de Quimica de Recursos Naturales, Universidad de Talca, Casilla 747, 3460000 Talca, Chile.

Furthermore, the present study demonstrates for the first time, using isobologram analysis, that the combination of 20S-Rg3 and Vp enhances the reversal of DOX and VCR resistance in a supra-additive or at least an additive manner. These results indicate that 20S-Rg3 may be used as a Vp synergizer or as a promising alternative to Vp in the chemosensitization of multidrug resistant acute myeloid leukemia, with far fewer side effects.","['Kim, Sung Su', 'Seong, Sin', 'Kim, Sung Young']","['Kim SS', 'Seong S', 'Kim SY']","['Department of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Oriental Medicine, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Oriental Medicine, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,2014/06/20 06:00,2014/06/20 06:01,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2014.1826 [doi]', 'ol-07-04-1265 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2014 Apr;7(4):1265-1269. doi: 10.3892/ol.2014.1826.

In the current study, the effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO) on the ecotropic viral integration site-1 (EVI-1) gene were investigated in the THP1 cell line. THP-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of ATO (0, 1, 3 and 5 muM) for 24, 48 or 72 h, then tested for cell viability by CCK-8 kit, cell morphology by cytospin smear, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry, EVI-1 mRNA expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein quantity by western blot. ATO treatment was shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in THP1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. ATO downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of EVI-1 in the THP1 cell line. In addition, ATO significantly decreased the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), but markedly increased the expression of proapoptotic proteins, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylated-JNK, Bax, full length caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3. These results indicated that ATO inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in THP1 cells partially via blocking the inhibitory effects of EVI-1 on the JNK signaling pathway with the involvement of apoptosis-associated proteins, including Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and caspase-3. These novel observations may be used to elucidate the mechanism by which ATO induces apoptosis in acute leukemia cells, and provide rationales to develop a personalized medicine strategy for ATO via targeting EVI-1 positive neoplasm.","['Zhou, Ling-Yun', 'Chen, Fang-Yuan', 'Shen, Li-Jing', 'Wan, Hai-Xia', 'Zhong, Ji-Hua']","['Zhou LY', 'Chen FY', 'Shen LJ', 'Wan HX', 'Zhong JH']","['Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, P.R.

While most studies focus on later disease stages, the onset of aberrant DNA methylation events and their dynamics during leukemic progression are largely unknown. METHODS: We screened genome-wide for aberrant CpG island methylation in three disease stages of a murine AML model that is driven by hypomorphic expression of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1. DNA methylation levels of selected genes were correlated with methylation levels of CD34+ cells and lineage negative, CD127-, c-Kit+, Sca-1+ cells; common myeloid progenitors; granulocyte-macrophage progenitors; and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors. RESULTS: We identified 1,184 hypermethylated array probes covering 762 associated genes in the preleukemic stage. During disease progression, the number of hypermethylated genes increased to 5,465 in the late leukemic disease stage. Using publicly available data, we found a significant enrichment of PU.1 binding sites in the preleukemic hypermethylated genes, suggesting that shortage of PU.1 makes PU.1 binding sites in the DNA accessible for aberrant methylation. Many known AML associated genes such as RUNX1 and HIC1 were found among the preleukemic hypermethylated genes. Nine novel hypermethylated genes, FZD5, FZD8, PRDM16, ROBO3, CXCL14, BCOR, ITPKA, HES6 and TAL1, the latter four being potential PU.1 targets, were confirmed to be hypermethylated in human normal karyotype AML patients, underscoring the relevance of the mouse model for human AML. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified early aberrantly methylated genes as potential contributors to onset and progression of AML.","['Sonnet, Miriam', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Becker, Natalia', 'Zucknick, Manuela', 'Petersen, Jana', 'Lipka, Daniel B', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Andrulis, Mindaugas', 'Lier, Amelie', 'Milsom, Michael D', 'Witte, Tania', 'Gu, Lei', 'Kim-Wanner, Soo-Zin', 'Schirmacher, Peter', 'Wulfert, Michael', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Rosenbauer, Frank', 'Rehli, Michael', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Weichenhan, Dieter', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Sonnet M', 'Claus R', 'Becker N', 'Zucknick M', 'Petersen J', 'Lipka DB', 'Oakes CC', 'Andrulis M', 'Lier A', 'Milsom MD', 'Witte T', 'Gu L', 'Kim-Wanner SZ', 'Schirmacher P', 'Wulfert M', 'Gattermann N', 'Lubbert M', 'Rosenbauer F', 'Rehli M', 'Bullinger L', 'Weichenhan D', 'Plass C']","['Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany ; Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of General Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany ; Division of Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of General Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine University, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine University, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology, Westfalische Wilhelms Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, D-93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,,,,2014/06/20 06:00,2014/06/20 06:01,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/gm551 [doi]', 'gm551 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2014 Apr 30;6(4):34. doi: 10.1186/gm551. eCollection 2014.,,20140430,,PMC4062060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compelling evidence indicates that rituximab and another CD20 mAb, ofatumumab, must use the body's cellular and humoral immune effector functions to kill malignant cells. Other U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved mAbs, including obinutuzumab, cetuximab, and trastuzumab, require, in part, these effector mechanisms to eliminate tumor cells. Although gram quantities of mAbs can be administered to patients, our investigations of CD20 mAb-based therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including correlative measurements in clinical trials and studies with primary cells and cell lines, indicate that effector mechanisms necessary for mAb activity can be saturated or exhausted if tumor burdens are high, thus substantially compromising the efficacy of high-dose mAb therapy. Under these conditions, another reaction (trogocytosis) predominates in which bound CD20 mAb and CD20 are removed from targeted cells by effector cells that express Fcgamma receptors, thereby allowing malignant cells to escape unharmed and continue to promote disease pathology. To address this problem, we propose that a low-dose strategy, based on administering 30-50 mg of CD20 mAb three times per week, may be far more effective for CLL than standard dosing because it will minimize effector function saturation and reduce trogocytosis. This approach may have general applicability to other mAbs that use immune effector functions, and could be formulated into a subcutaneous treatment strategy that would be more accessible and possibly more efficacious for patients.","['Taylor, Ronald P', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A']","['Taylor RP', 'Lindorfer MA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia rpt@virginia.edu.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*immunology']",2014/06/20 06:00,2015/01/08 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.114.092684 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.114.092684 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2014 Nov;86(5):485-91. doi: 10.1124/mol.114.092684.

This updated analysis of the BELA trial assessed the safety profile and management of toxicities of bosutinib versus imatinib in adults with newly diagnosed (</=6 months) CP CML after >30 months from accrual completion. Among patients randomized to bosutinib 500 mg/d (n = 250) or imatinib 400 mg/d (n = 252), 248 and 251, respectively, received >/=1 dose of study treatment. Adverse events (AEs; any grade) with bosutinib versus imatinib were significantly more common for certain gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, 70% vs. 26%; P < 0.001; vomiting, 33% vs. 16%; P < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (33% vs. 9%; P < 0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (28% vs. 10%; P < 0.001) elevations, and pyrexia (19% vs. 12%; P = 0.046). AEs significantly less common with bosutinib included edema (periorbital, 2% vs. 14%; P < 0.001; peripheral, 5% vs. 12%; P = 0.006), musculoskeletal (myalgia, 5% vs. 12%; P = 0.010; muscle cramps, 5% vs. 22%; P < 0.001; bone pain, 4% vs. 11%; P = 0.003), increased creatine phosphokinase (8% vs. 20%; P < 0.001), neutropenia (13% vs. 30%; P < 0.001), and leukopenia (9% vs. 22%; P < 0.001). Between-group differences in the incidence of cardiac and vascular AEs were not significant. Diarrhea was typically transient, mostly Grade 1/2, occurring early during treatment, and was manageable with antidiarrheal medication. Despite higher rates of aminotransferase elevation with bosutinib, events were managed in most patients with dose modification and/or concomitant medication. Bosutinib had a manageable safety profile distinct from that of imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed CP CML.","['Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Lipton, Jeff H', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Wong, Raymond S', 'Rossiev, Victor', 'Pavlov, Dmitri', 'Gogat Marchant, Karin', 'Duvillie, Ladan', 'Khattry, Navin', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Cortes JE', 'Lipton JH', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Wong RS', 'Rossiev V', 'Pavlov D', 'Gogat Marchant K', 'Duvillie L', 'Khattry N', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/blood', '*Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', '*Benzamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Diarrhea/blood/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Fever/blood/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Cramp/blood/chemically induced', 'Myalgia/blood/chemically induced', '*Nitriles/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pain/blood/chemically induced', '*Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Quinolines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vomiting/blood/chemically induced']",2014/06/20 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23788 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Oct;89(10):947-53. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23788.

The tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) functions as a stress sensor. Loss of PML results in impaired mitochondrial complex II activity, increased ROS, and subsequent activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidative pathway. We also demonstrate that sulforaphane (SFN), an antioxidant, regulates Nrf2 activity by controlling abundance and subcellular distribution of PML and that PML is essential for SFN-mediated ROS increase, Nrf2 activation, antiproliferation, antimigration, and antiangiogenesis. Taking the results together, we have uncovered a novel antioxidative mechanism by which PML regulates cellular oxidant homeostasis by controlling complex II integrity and Nrf2 activity and identified PML as an indispensable mediator of SFN activity.","['Guo, Shuang', 'Cheng, Xiwen', 'Lim, Jun-Hee', 'Liu, Yu', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Guo S', 'Cheng X', 'Lim JH', 'Liu Y', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106Comprehensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106 hxk43@cwru.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Nfe2l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfoxides', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/06/20 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['mbc.E13-11-0692 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.E13-11-0692 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2014 Aug 15;25(16):2485-98. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E13-11-0692.

BIRC3 mutations (2.5%) were associated with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL), del(11q) and trisomy 12, whereas MYD88 mutations (2.2%) were exclusively found among M-CLL. NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53 exhibited variable frequencies and were mostly enriched within clinically aggressive cases. Interestingly, as the timespan between diagnosis and mutational screening increased, so too did the incidence of SF3B1 mutations; no such increase was observed for NOTCH1 mutations. Regarding the clinical impact, NOTCH1 mutations, SF3B1 mutations and TP53 aberrations (deletion/mutation, TP53ab) correlated with shorter time-to-first-treatment (P<0.0001) in 889 treatment-naive Binet stage A cases. In multivariate analysis (n=774), SF3B1 mutations and TP53ab along with del(11q) and U-CLL, but not NOTCH1 mutations, retained independent significance. Importantly, TP53ab and SF3B1 mutations had an adverse impact even in U-CLL. In conclusion, we support the clinical relevance of novel recurrent mutations in CLL, highlighting the adverse impact of SF3B1 and TP53 mutations, even independent of IGHV mutational status, thus underscoring the need for urgent standardization/harmonization of the detection methods.","['Baliakas, P', 'Hadzidimitriou, A', 'Sutton, L-A', 'Rossi, D', 'Minga, E', 'Villamor, N', 'Larrayoz, M',

It is mainly reported from HIV-positive individuals. However, a few cases have been reported in other immunosuppressed individuals including renal transplant patients, and those with lymphoma and leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a period of 5 years (2008-2012), approximately 1700 stool samples of immunosuppressed patients were screened for the presence of opportunistic parasitic infections by a modified acid fast staining technique. RESULTS: A total of 41 C. belli were reported, out of which 30 were HIV-positive individuals while 11 were HIV negative. The latter individuals were also immunosuppressed due to prolonged use of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs. Twenty-six out of 30 HIV-positive patients and all the HIV-negative individuals with C. belli infection had diarrhea. CONCLUSION: All immunosuppressed individuals should be examined for the presence of opportunistic coccidian parasitic infections and treated accordingly and alternatively, isolation of opportunistic parasites should trigger a hunt for immunocompromised state to reduce the morbidity and mortality in such patients.","['Gautam, Neha', 'Khurana, Sumeeta', 'Sharma, Aman', 'Sehgal, Rakesh']","['Gautam N', 'Khurana S', 'Sharma A', 'Sehgal R']","['Department of Parasitology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/*epidemiology/parasitology', 'Feces/parasitology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'India', 'Isosporiasis/*epidemiology/parasitology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Sarcocystidae/*isolation & purification', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/20 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2014_57_2_272_134707 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.134707 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2014 Apr-Jun;57(2):272-4. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.134707.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reviews have summarized these effects in adults, but a comprehensive review on corticosteroid effects in children has not been published since 2005. Here, we systematically review articles published since then that, we find, naturally divide into 3 main areas: (1) chronic effects of acute prenatal and neonatal exposure associated with prematurity and congenital conditions; (2) immediate behavioral effects of acute exposure via oncological protocols; and (3) acute behavioral effects of sporadic use in children and adolescents with other conditions. PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus were queried to identify articles reporting psychiatric adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients. Search terms included corticosteroids, adrenal cortex hormones, steroid psychosis, substance-induced psychoses, glucocorticoids, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, adverse effects, mood disorders, mental disorders, psychosis, psychotic, psychoses, side effect, chemically induced, emotions, affective symptoms, toxicity, behavior, behavioral symptoms, infant, child, adolescent, pediatric, paediatric, neonatal, children, teen, and teenager. Following guidelines for systematic reviews from the Potsdam Consultation on Meta-Analysis, we have found it difficult to draw specific conclusions that are more than general impressions owing to the quality of the available studies. We find a mixed picture with neonates exposed to dexamethasone, with some articles reporting eventual deficits in neuropsychiatric functioning and others reporting no effect. In pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, corticosteroid use appears to correlate with negative psychiatric and behavioral effects. In children treated with corticosteroids for noncancer conditions, adverse effects have been observed both during treatment and after cessation, although the data from article to article are not consistent enough to establish dose relationships. By and large, inhaled corticosteroids are considered safe and free of severe neuropsychiatric effects. Although both antipsychotic medications and benzodiazepines have been used to treat corticosteroid-induced mania and psychosis, no unified management strategy has emerged. Large-scale standardized investigations are needed to clarify the psychiatric effect of corticosteroids on children in all these conditions. Meanwhile, there is general agreement that patients as well as caregivers should be warned of the potential for behavioral adverse effects when patients receive these drugs.","['Drozdowicz, Linda B', 'Bostwick, J Michael']","['Drozdowicz LB', 'Bostwick JM']","['Mayo Medical School, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

Immunotherapy is a potentially effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of colorectal carcinoma. Preclinical studies have supported the antitumor activity of immunization with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) producing murine colon tumor cell vaccine. METHODS: A novel colorectal cancer vaccine composed of irradiated, allogeneic human colon cancer cells and GM-CSF-producing bystander cells was developed and tested in combination with a single intravenous low dose of cyclophosphamide in a phase 1 study of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. RESULTS: A total of nine patients were enrolled onto and treated in this study. Six patients had a history of colorectal adenocarcinoma hepatic metastases and underwent curative metastasectomy, while three other patients had unresectable stage IV disease. This study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of this vaccine administered in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. At last follow-up, the six patients who underwent curative metastasectomy survived longer than 36 months, and four of these six patients were without disease recurrence. Immunologic correlate results suggest that the GM-CSF-producing colon cancer vaccine enhances the production of anti-MUC1 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: This vaccine is feasible and safe. Future investigation of the efficacy and antitumor immunity of this vaccine is warranted.","['Zheng, Lei', 'Edil, Barish H', 'Soares, Kevin C', 'El-Shami, Khaled', 'Uram, Jennifer N', 'Judkins, Carol', 'Zhang, Zhe', 'Onners, Beth', 'Laheru, Daniel', 'Pardoll, Drew', 'Jaffee, Elizabeth M', 'Schulick, Richard D']","['Zheng L', 'Edil BH', 'Soares KC', 'El-Shami K', 'Uram JN', 'Judkins C', 'Zhang Z', 'Onners B', 'Laheru D', 'Pardoll D', 'Jaffee EM', 'Schulick RD']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/immunology/mortality/secondary/*therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Cancer Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/06/20 06:00,2015/06/17 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1245/s10434-014-3844-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 2014 Nov;21(12):3931-7. doi: 10.1245/s10434-014-3844-x.

Although innate cells are generally a minor subset of thymocytes, in several strains of mice harboring mutations in T cell signaling proteins or transcriptional regulators, conventional CD8(+) T cells develop as innate cells with characteristics of memory T cells. Thus, in Itk-deficient mice, mature CD4(-)CD8(+) (CD8 single-positive [SP]) thymocytes express high levels of the transcription factor eomesodermin (Eomes) and are dependent on IL-4 being produced in the thymic environment by a poorly characterized subset of CD4(+) thymocytes expressing the transcriptional regulator promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger. In this study, we show that a sizeable proportion of mature CD4(+)CD8(-) (CD4SP) thymocytes in itk(-/-) mice also develop as innate Eomes-expressing T cells. These cells are dependent on MHC class II and IL-4 signaling for their development, indicating that they are conventional CD4(+) T cells that have been converted to an innate phenotype. Surprisingly, neither CD4SP nor CD8SP innate Eomes(+) thymocytes in itk(-/-) or SLP-76(Y145F) mice are dependent on gammadelta T cells for their development. Instead, we find that the predominant population of Eomes(+) innate itk(-/-) CD4SP thymocytes is largely absent in mice lacking CD1d-specific invariant NKT cells, with no effect on innate itk(-/-) CD8SP thymocytes. In contrast, both subsets of innate Eomes(+)itk(-/-) T cells require the presence of a novel promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-expressing, SLAM family receptor adapter protein-dependent thymocyte population that is essential for the conversion of conventional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells into innate T cells with a memory phenotype.","['Prince, Amanda L', 'Kraus, Zachary', 'Carty, Shannon A', 'Ng, Caleb', 'Yin, Catherine C', 'Jordan, Martha S', 'Schwartzberg, Pamela L', 'Berg, Leslie J']","['Prince AL', 'Kraus Z', 'Carty SA', 'Ng C', 'Yin CC', 'Jordan MS', 'Schwartzberg PL', 'Berg LJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655;', 'National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655;', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; Leslie.Berg@umassmed.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (Eomes protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (emt protein-tyrosine kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD1d/immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interleukin-15/deficiency/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymocytes/immunology/metabolism']",2014/06/20 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1302059 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1302059 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Jul 15;193(2):688-99. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1302059.

After confirming that interleukin-3 receptor (IL3R, CD123) is highly expressed on CD34(+) /CD38(-) BCR-ABL1(+) CML stem cells, we investigated whether targeting IL3R with diphtheria toxin (DT)-IL3 fusion proteins SL-401 (DT388 -IL3) and SL-501 (DT388 -IL3[K116W]) could eradicate these stem cells. SL-401 and SL-501 inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in the KBM5 cell line and its TKI-resistant KBM5-STI subline. Combinations of imatinib with these agents increased apoptosis in KBM5 and in primary CML cells. In six primary CML samples, including CML cells harbouring the ABL1 T315I mutation, SL-401 and SL-501 decreased the absolute numbers of viable CD34(+) /CD38(-) /CD123(+) CML progenitor cells by inducing apoptosis. IL3-targeting agents reduced clonogenic growth and diminished the fraction of primitive long-term culture-initiating cells in samples from patients with advanced phase CML that were resistant to TKIs or harboured an ABL1 mutation. Survival was also extended in a mouse model of primary TKI-resistant CML blast crisis. These data suggest that the DT-IL3 fusion proteins, SL-401 and SL-501, deplete CML stem cells and may increase the effectiveness of current CML treatment, which principally targets tumour bulk.","['Frolova, Olga', 'Benito, Juliana', 'Brooks, Chris', 'Wang, Rui-Yu', 'Korchin, Borys', 'Rowinsky, Eric K', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Frankel, Arthur E', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Frolova O', 'Benito J', 'Brooks C', 'Wang RY', 'Korchin B', 'Rowinsky EK', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'Frankel AE', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (diphtheria toxin (1-388)-Trp(116)-interleukin-3 fusion protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8ZHS5657EH (tagraxofusp)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/06/20 06:00,2014/10/22 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12978 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Sep;166(6):862-74. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12978.

Recent advances in comprehensive genomic analyses in acute myeloid leukemia have revealed prevalent mutations in regulators of epigenetic phenomena including global DNA methylation status. The examples include mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), IDH2, and ten-eleven translocation 2. These mutations are proposed to inhibit conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC), leading to global accumulation of 5 mC. These changes in global DNA methylation status can be visualized immunohistochemically using specific antibodies against 5 mC and 5 hmC. We examined the global DNA methylation status of B-cell lymphomas and that of their normal counterparts by immunohistochemistry for 5 mC and 5 hmC. Non-tumor lymphoid cells inside germinal centers (GC) in reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) were stained positive for 5 mC, but they were negative for 5 hmC. Similarly, follicular lymphomas, whose postulated normal counterparts are centrocytes in GCs, were 5 mC-positive but 5 hmC-negative by immunohistochemistry. This immunostaining pattern was also observed in Burkitt lymphoma. In contrast, non-tumor lymphoid cells in mantle zones were stained positive for 5 mC as well as for 5 hmC. Likewise, most mantle cell lymphomas, whose postulated normal counterparts are mantle zone B cells in RLH, were stained positive for 5 mC as well as for 5 hmC. This immunostaining pattern was also observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. These results suggest that, in terms of 5 mC/5 hmC immunohistochemistry, B-cell lymphomas with different histological subtypes are associated with distinct global DNA methylation statuses that resemble those of their postulated normal counterparts.","['Matsuda, Ikuo', 'Imai, Yukihiro', 'Hirota, Seiichi']","['Matsuda I', 'Imai Y', 'Hirota S']","['Department of Surgical Pathology, Hyogo College of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Epigenomics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/20 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jslrt/54.67 [pii]', '10.3960/jslrt.54.67 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2014;54(1):67-73. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.54.67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD25 is also known as the IL-2Ralpha chain on cell membranes, while soluble IL-2R (sIL-2R) is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of the IL-2Ralpha chain. Levels of sIL-2R in sera are monitored as a marker of disease activity in patients with lymphoma. However, elevated serum sIL-2R levels are also found in inflammatory diseases, such as infectious diseases. Levels of sIL-2R in sera are thought to reflect tumor burden in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma due to the expression of CD25 on tumor cells. Conversely, sIL-2R is thought to be mainly derived from activated T cells infiltrating tumor tissues in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) because lymphoma cells except for a subtype of DLBCL are mainly negative for CD25. Matrix metalloproteinase-9, a protease capable of cleaving the membrane bound IL-2Ralpha chain, is mainly produced by tissue-associated macrophages. Increased macrophages in tumor tissues are reported to be associated with poor prognosis, especially in Hodgkin's lymphoma. We found increased macrophages in DLBCL and FL compared with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia as well as a positive correlation between the levels of sIL-2R in sera and the number of macrophages in tumor tissues in FL and extranodal DLBCL.","['Sakai, Akira', 'Yoshida, Noriaki']","['Sakai A', 'Yoshida N']","['Department of Radiation Life Sciences, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Interleukin-2/blood/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*blood/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Macrophages/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*blood/metabolism']",2014/06/20 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jslrt/54.49 [pii]', '10.3960/jslrt.54.49 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2014;54(1):49-57. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.54.49.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMO1 peptides are limiting in quantity and are thus mainly conjugated to high-affinity targets. Conjugation of SUMO2/3 paralogues is primarily stress inducible and may initiate target degradation. Here we demonstrate that the expression of SUMO1/2/3 is dramatically enhanced by interferons through an miRNA-based mechanism involving the Lin28/let-7 axis, a master regulator of stemness. Normal haematopoietic progenitors indeed display much higher SUMO contents than their differentiated progeny. Critically, SUMOs contribute to the antiviral effects of interferons against HSV1 or HIV. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies are interferon-induced domains, which facilitate sumoylation of a subset of targets. Our findings thus identify an integrated interferon-responsive PML/SUMO pathway that impedes viral replication by enhancing SUMO conjugation and possibly also modifying the repertoire of targets. Interferon-enhanced post-translational modifications may be essential for senescence or stem cell self-renewal, and initiate SUMO-dependent proteolysis.","['Sahin, Umut', 'Ferhi, Omar', 'Carnec,

We explored the effect of Selenium as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent on pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in HSCT candidates. FINDINGS: Plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 were measured in 74 patients from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. In both groups, there were 37 patients with median age of 32 years. Patients received oral Se tablets (200 mcg) or placebo twice daily beginning from the first day of high dose chemotherapy (HDC) through 14 days after HSCT. Cytokine levels were determined before starting HDC (prior to first dose of Se), 7 and 14 days after HSCT. Plasma levels of TNF-alpha were not significantly different between Se and control group (P = 0.13). IL-1 levels were similar between two groups (P = 0.88). No significant differences were detected in IL-6 levels between Se and control group (P = 0.96). CONCLUSION: Selenium had no effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in patients undergoing HSCT. It is likely that earlier initiation and/or larger doses of Se are required to affect inflammatory cytokines significantly.","['Daeian, Nesa', 'Radfar, Mania', 'Jahangard-Rafsanjani, Zahra', 'Hadjibabaie, Molouk', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Daeian N', 'Radfar M', 'Jahangard-Rafsanjani Z', 'Hadjibabaie M', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Enqelab SQ, 16 Azar AV, PO Box: 14155/6451, Tehran, Iran. radfarma@tums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Daru,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",101125969,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cytokines)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Antioxidants/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Selenium/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Stomatitis/*prevention & control', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",2014/06/20 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2013/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['2008-2231-22-51 [pii]', '10.1186/2008-2231-22-51 [doi]']",epublish,Daru. 2014 Jun 17;22:51. doi: 10.1186/2008-2231-22-51.,,20140617,,PMC4077582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Clofarabine/cyclophosphamide (1-4 cycles) was well tolerated and resulted in a substantial reduction of leukaemic cells in all pts. HSCT was performed in 15 of 20 pts. After HSCT (myeloablative, n = 9; dose-reduced, n = 6), all pts showed engraftment and full donor chimerism (related donors, n = 4 or unrelated donors, n = 11) and all pts achieved complete haematologic remission (CR). The median survival after HSCT is 531 days (range: 48-1462 days), and six pts are still alive after a median of 1245 days. Seven pts died after they had relapsed between days +152 and +1496. One patient died from acute graft-versus-host disease (day +48) and one from systemic fungal infection (day +87). CONCLUSION: Clofarabine/cyclophosphamide is a novel effective treatment approach for pts with chemotherapy-refractory acute leukaemia prior to HSCT. Whether this novel debulking protocol leads to improved long-term outcome in pts with refractory leukaemias remains to be determined in forthcoming clinical studies.","['Rabitsch, Werner', 'Bohm, Alexandra', 'Bojic, Marija', 'Schellongowski, Peter', 'Wohrer, Stefan', 'Sliwa, Thamer', 'Keil, Felix', 'Worel, Nina', 'Greinix, Hildegard', 'Hauswirth, Alexander', 'Kalhs, Peter', 'Jaeger, Ulrich', 'Valent, Peter', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R']","['Rabitsch W', 'Bohm A', 'Bojic M', 'Schellongowski P', 'Wohrer S', 'Sliwa T', 'Keil F', 'Worel N', 'Greinix H', 'Hauswirth A', 'Kalhs P', 'Jaeger U', 'Valent P', 'Sperr WR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Intensive Care Unit, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage', 'Clofarabine', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/20 06:00,2015/04/17 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/eci.12294 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2014 Aug;44(8):775-83. doi: 10.1111/eci.12294.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Debulking', 'haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'refractory leukaemia', 'survival']",,"['(c) 2014 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal', 'Foundation.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to investigate the liquid-vapor interaction and adsorption of formaldehyde, oxocarbons, and water in graphitic slit pores. The effects of the slit width, system temperature, concentration, and the constituent ratio of the mixture on the diffusion and adsorption properties are studied. As a result of interactions between the components, the z-directional self-diffusivity (D(z)) in the mixture substantially decreased by about one order of magnitude as compared with that of pure (single-constituent) adsorbates. When the concentration exceeds a certain threshold, the D(z) values dramatically decrease due to over-saturation inducing barriers to diffusion. The binding energy between the adsorbate and graphite at the first adsorption monolayer is calculated to be 3.99, 2.01, 3.49, and 2.67 kcal mol(-1) for CO2, CO, CH2O, and H2O, respectively. These values agree well with those calculated using the density functional theory coupled cluster method and experimental results. A low solubility of CO2 in water and water preferring to react with CH2O, forming hydrated methanediol clusters, are observed. Because the cohesion in a hydrated methanediol cluster is much higher than the adhesion between clusters and the graphitic surface, the hydrated methanediol clusters were hydrophobic, exhibiting a large contact angle on graphite.","['Huang, Pei-Hsing', 'Hung, Shang-Chao', 'Huang, Ming-Yueh']","['Huang PH', 'Hung SC', 'Huang MY']","['Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung 912, Taiwan, Republic of China. phh@mail.npust.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Phys Chem Chem Phys,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,100888160,"['0 (Gases)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '7782-42-5 (Graphite)', '7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide)']",IM,"['Adsorption', 'Carbon Dioxide/*chemistry', 'Carbon Monoxide/*chemistry', 'Formaldehyde/*chemistry', '*Gases', 'Graphite/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Surface Properties', 'Water/*chemistry']",2014/06/20 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2014/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4cp01922a [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Chem Chem Phys. 2014 Aug 7;16(29):15289-98. doi: 10.1039/c4cp01922a.

The t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1) abnormality is found in 5% to 8% of de novo acute myeloid leukemia and is diagnostic of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The translocation results in fusion of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene at 17q21.1 and the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene at 15q24.1.

METHODS: Healthy 100 adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into the control group (n =20), the MODS model group (n =40), and the DG group (n =40).E. coli suspension was peritoneally injected to rats in the model group and the DG group to establish bacterial peritonitis induced MODS model. DG at 1 mL/100 g was administered by gastrogavage to rats of the DG group, twice daily for 3 successive days. Twenty-four hours after modeling, the proximal segment of intestine was taken and stained by using terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) and immunohistochemistry. Changes of apoptosis quantity of SMCs and the expression of Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and cytochrome c protein (Cyt c) in mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway were observed. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the apoptosis quantity of SMCs and the expression of Bax and Cyt c protein significantly increased, and the expression of Bcl-2 protein significantly decreased in the MODS model group (P <0.01). Compared with the MODS model group, the apoptosis quantity of SMCs and the expression of Bax and Cyt c proteins significantly decreased, and the expression of Bcl-2 protein significantly increased in the DG group (allP <0.01).

CD137L is expressed on the cell surface of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and antigen presenting cells (APC) as a transmembrane protein. The signaling of CD137L into HSPC induces their proliferation and differentiation to monocytes and macrophages, and in monocytes CD137L signaling induces differentiation to potent dendritic cells (DC). CD137L signaling is initiated by CD137 which is expressed by T cells, once they become activated. Some of these activated, CD137-expressing T cells migrate from the site of infection to the bone marrow where they interact with HSPC to induce myelopoiesis, or they induce monocyte to DC differentiation locally at the site of infection. Therapeutically, induction of CD137L signaling can be utilized to reinitiate myeloid differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia cells, and to generate potent DC for immunotherapy.","['Tang, Qianqiao', 'Jiang, Dongsheng', 'Harfuddin, Zulkarnain', 'Cheng, Kin', 'Moh, Mei Chung', 'Schwarz, Herbert']","['Tang Q', 'Jiang D', 'Harfuddin Z', 'Cheng K', 'Moh MC', 'Schwarz H']","['1Department of Physiology, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int Rev Immunol,International reviews of immunology,8712260,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['4-1BB Ligand/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Myeloid Cells/*physiology', 'Myelopoiesis/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/metabolism']",2014/06/19 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08830185.2014.921163 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Immunol. 2014 Nov-Dec;33(6):454-69. doi: 10.3109/08830185.2014.921163.

Schneid. (DDS). MTT assay was used to examine the growth inhibitory effects of the four flavonoids, including chrysin, quercetin, naringenin, and avicularin that were isolated from the rhizome of DDS, on human hematomas cell (HepG2), esophageal carcinoma cell (EC109), human cervical adenocarcinoma cell (Hela), human colon adenocarcinoma cell (SW480), and African green monkey kidney cell (Vero cells). The anti-tumor mechanism of chrysin on HepG2 was further investigated by the methods of fluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting. The results showed that the inhibitory activity of chrysin was much stronger than the other three flavonoids on HepG2, EC109, Hela, and SW480 cells for 48 h treatment in vitro. Moreover, no inhibiting effect of chrysin on the proliferation of normal cells (Vero cells) was observed. Further study revealed that chrysin caused HepG2 cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic body formation, all of which were typical characteristics of apoptosis programmed cell death. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that chrysin increased the sub G0/G1 population, which indicated the increased cell apoptosis, thus preventing cells from entering the S phase as the population in G2/M or S phase declined; whereas in G0/G1 phase, it increased. In addition, immunoblot results showed that chrysin significantly increased the expression levels of caspase-3 and Bax proteins, and it decreased the expression level of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) protein. These findings indicate that chrysin is the major flavonoid present in DDS, and it induces HepG2 cell death via apoptosis, probably through the participation of caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 proteins.","['Deng, Xukun', 'Zhao, Xiangpei', 'Lan, Zhou', 'Jiang, Jie', 'Yin, Wu', 'Chen, Lvyi']","['Deng X', 'Zhao X', 'Lan Z', 'Jiang J', 'Yin W', 'Chen L']","[""1 School of Pharmacy, South-Central University for Nationalities , Wuhan, People's Republic of China .""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Food,Journal of medicinal food,9812512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '3CN01F5ZJ5 (chrysin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Rosaceae/*chemistry', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vero Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2014/06/19 06:00,2015/03/07 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jmf.2013.2886 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Food. 2014 Jul;17(7):787-94. doi: 10.1089/jmf.2013.2886.

Upon its uptake, 6MP undergoes a complex metabolism involving many enzymes and active products. The prognostic value of all the factors engaged in this pathway still remains unclear. This study attempted to determine which components of 6MP metabolism in leukemic blasts and red blood cells are important for 6MP's sensitivity and toxicity. In addition, changes in the enzymatic activities and metabolite levels during the treatment were analyzed. In a cohort (N=236) of pediatric ALL patients enrolled in the Dutch ALL-9 protocol, we studied the enzymes inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) as well as thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) and methylthioinosine nucleotides (meTINs). Activities of selected enzymes and levels of 6MP derivatives were measured at various time points during the course of therapy. The data obtained and the toxicity related parameters available for these patients were correlated with each other. We found several interesting relations, including high concentrations of two active forms of 6MP--TGN and meTIN--showing a trend toward association with better in vitro antileukemic effect of 6MP. High concentrations of TGN and elevated activity of HGPRT were found to be significantly associated with grade III/IV leucopenia. However, a lot of data of enzymatic activities and metabolite concentrations as well as clinical toxicity were missing, thereby limiting the number of assessed relations. Therefore, although a complex study of 6MP metabolism in ALL patients is feasible, it warrants more robust and strict data collection in order to be able to draw more reliable conclusions.","['Wojtuszkiewicz, Anna', 'Barcelos, Ana', 'Dubbelman, Boas', 'De Abreu, Ronney', 'Brouwer, Connie', 'Bokkerink, Jos P', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'de Groot-Kruseman, Hester', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Kaspers, Gertjan L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Peters, G J']","['Wojtuszkiewicz A', 'Barcelos A', 'Dubbelman B', 'De Abreu R', 'Brouwer C', 'Bokkerink JP', 'de Haas V', 'de Groot-Kruseman H', 'Jansen G', 'Kaspers GL', 'Cloos J', 'Peters GJ']",['a Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Department of Hematology.'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/*enzymology']",2014/06/19 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15257770.2014.904519 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2014;33(4-6):422-33. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2014.904519.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['6-methylthioinosine nucleotide', 'Mercaptopurine', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'thioguanine nucleotide', 'thiopurine S-methyltransferase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For some cases of CLL, 2-FaraAMP as a single agent can clear the blood of leukemia cells, but leukemia stem cells usually remain protected in sanctuary sites. It is clear that 2-FaraAMP has multiple mechanisms of action that may collectively result in strand breaks in DNA, accumulation of phosphorylated p53 and apoptosis. We have demonstrated using the human Burkitt's lymphoma B-cell line, Raji, that p53, p63 and p73 all accumulate in the nucleus, following treatment of cells with fludarabine nucleoside (2-FaraA). In addition, phosphorylated p53 accumulates in the cytosol and at mitochondria. Using sophisticated methods of proteomic analysis with mass spectrometry, proteins that become differentially abundant after treatment of cells with 2-FaraA have been identified, providing considerable additional information about the cellular responses of B-lymphoid cancers to this purine analog. The levels of proteins involved in the unfolded protein response increase, indicating that endoplasmic reticulum stress is likely to be one mechanism for induction of apoptosis. The levels of a number of proteins found on the outer plasma membrane change on cells treated with 2-FaraA, suggesting that signaling from the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) is stimulated, resulting in induction of apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway. Increased levels of the cell surface proteins, CD50, CD100 and ECE-1, would promote survival of these cells; the balance between these survival and death responses would determine the fate of the cell.","['Christopherson, Richard I', 'Mactier, Swetlana', 'Almazi, Juhura G', 'Kohnke, Philippa L', 'Best, O Giles', 'Mulligan, Stephen P']","['Christopherson RI', 'Mactier S', 'Almazi JG', 'Kohnke PL', 'Best OG', 'Mulligan SP']","['a School of Molecular Bioscience , University of Sydney , Sydney , NSW , Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2014/06/19 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15257770.2013.863334 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2014;33(4-6):375-83. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2013.863334.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-lymphoid cancers', 'fludarabine', 'mechanisms', 'proteomics', 'purine analog']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conditioning regimens and indications for nmt vary considerably from centre to centre. Our institution uses intravenous fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, plus graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) prophylaxis with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. We retrospectively analyzed 89 consecutive patients who underwent nmt (65 related, 24 unrelated) at our institution from October 2002 to September 2011. The most frequent indications for nmt were acute myelocytic leukemia (high-risk in first complete or subsequent remission: n = 20, 22.5%) and relapsed follicular lymphoma (n = 18, 20.2%). The cumulative incidence of acute gvhd (grades 2-4) was 28.1% (n = 25), and rates were similar for related (n = 18, 28%) and unrelated (n = 7, 29%) nmt. At a median follow-up of 22.6 months, the cumulative incidence of chronic gvhd (limited and extensive) was 68% (n = 61): 68.5% (n = 44) for related and 71% (n = 17) for unrelated nmt. The 100-day transplant-related mortality rate was 2.2%: 1.5% for related and 4.2% for unrelated nmt. Of the 89 patients, 30 (33.7%) have relapsed: 41.5% after related and 12.5% after unrelated nmt. Relapse rates were similar in patients with myeloid and lymphoid malignancies (36.4% vs. 33.3%). The 3-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 50.0% and 43.4% respectively, with multivariate analysis showing that neither rate was affected by age, disease group, status at transplantation, or related compared with unrelated nmt. Our findings indicate that, despite its limitations, including the incidence of chronic gvhd, nmt is an important treatment modality for a selected subgroup of patients with hematologic malignancies.","['AlJohani, N I', 'Thompson, K', 'Hasegawa, W', 'White, D', 'Kew, A', 'Couban, S']","['AlJohani NI', 'Thompson K', 'Hasegawa W', 'White D', 'Kew A', 'Couban S']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, and Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, NS.', 'Research Methods Unit, Department of Medicine, Centre for Clinical Research, Dalhousie University, and Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, NS.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, and Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, NS.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, and Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, NS.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, and Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, NS.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, and Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, NS.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,,2014/06/19 06:00,2014/06/19 06:01,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.21.1846 [doi]', 'conc-21-e434 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2014 Jun;21(3):e434-40. doi: 10.3747/co.21.1846.,,,,PMC4059807,['NOTNLM'],"['Non-myeloablative stem-cell transplantation', 'conditioning regimens', 'graft-versus-host disease']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although PAX5 mutation is a critical driver of B-ALL development in mice and humans, it remains unclear how its loss contributes to leukemogenesis and whether ongoing PAX5 deficiency is required for B-ALL maintenance. Here we used transgenic RNAi to reversibly suppress endogenous Pax5 expression in the hematopoietic compartment of mice, which cooperates with activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) to induce B-ALL. In this model, restoring endogenous Pax5 expression in established B-ALL triggers immunophenotypic maturation and durable disease remission by engaging a transcriptional program reminiscent of normal B-cell differentiation. Notably, even brief Pax5 restoration in B-ALL cells causes rapid cell cycle exit and disables their leukemia-initiating capacity. These and similar findings in human B-ALL cell lines establish that Pax5 hypomorphism promotes B-ALL self-renewal by impairing a differentiation program that can be re-engaged despite the presence of additional oncogenic lesions. Our results establish a causal relationship between the hallmark genetic and phenotypic features of B-ALL and suggest that engaging the latent differentiation potential of B-ALL cells may provide new therapeutic entry points.","['Liu, Grace J', 'Cimmino, Luisa', 'Jude, Julian G', 'Hu, Yifang', 'Witkowski, Matthew T', 'McKenzie, Mark D', 'Kartal-Kaess, Mutlu', 'Best, Sarah A', 'Tuohey, Laura', 'Liao, Yang', 'Shi, Wei', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Farrar, Michael A', 'Nutt, Stephen L', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Dickins, Ross A']","['Liu GJ', 'Cimmino L', 'Jude JG', 'Hu Y', 'Witkowski MT', 'McKenzie MD', 'Kartal-Kaess M', 'Best SA', 'Tuohey L', 'Liao Y', 'Shi W', 'Mullighan CG', 'Farrar MA', 'Nutt SL', 'Smyth GK', 'Zuber J', 'Dickins RA']","['Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia;

However, there are conflicting data regarding their antigenic/allergenic cross-reactivity, with no plant Cyp allergen structures available for comparison. Because amino acid residues are fairly conserved between plant and fungal Cyps, it is particularly interesting to check whether they can cross-react. Cat r 1 was identified by immunoblotting using allergic patients' sera followed by N-terminal sequencing. Cat r 1 ( approximately 91% sequence identity to Bet v 7) was cloned from a cDNA library and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant Cat r 1 was utilized to confirm peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity by a PPIase assay and the allergenic property by an IgE-specific immunoblotting and rat basophil leukemia cell (RBL-SX38) mediator release assay. Inhibition-ELISA showed cross-reactive binding of serum IgE from Cat r 1-allergic individuals to fungal allergenic Cyps Asp f 11 and Mala s 6. The molecular structure of Cat r 1 was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The antigenic surface was examined in relation to its plant, animal, and fungal homologues. The structure revealed a typical cyclophilin fold consisting of a compact beta-barrel made up of seven anti-parallel beta-strands along with two surrounding alpha-helices. This is the first structure of an allergenic plant Cyp revealing high conservation of the antigenic surface particularly near the PPIase active site, which supports the pronounced cross-reactivity among Cyps from various sources.","['Ghosh, Debajyoti', 'Mueller, Geoffrey A', 'Schramm, Gabriele', 'Edwards, Lori L', 'Petersen, Arnd', 'London, Robert E', 'Haas, Helmut', 'Gupta Bhattacharya, Swati']","['Ghosh D', 'Mueller GA', 'Schramm G', 'Edwards LL', 'Petersen A', 'London RE', 'Haas H', 'Gupta Bhattacharya S']","['From the Bose Institute, 93/1 APC Road, Kolkata 700009, India, djghosh@yahoo.com.', 'the Laboratory of Structural Biology, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'the Research Centre Borstel, Leibniz Centre for Medicine and Biosciences, D-23845 Borstel, Germany, and.', 'the Laboratory of Structural Biology, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'the Division of Clinical and Molecular Allergology, Research Center Borstel, Airway Research Center North (ARCN), Member of the German Centre for Lung Research, Parkallee 22, D-23845 Borstel, Germany.', 'the Laboratory of Structural Biology, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.', 'the Research Centre Borstel, Leibniz Centre for Medicine and Biosciences, D-23845 Borstel, Germany, and.', 'From the Bose Institute, 93/1 APC Road, Kolkata 700009, India, swati@jcbose.ac.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Allergens/*chemistry/immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cyclophilins/*chemistry/immunology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/immunology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pollen/*chemistry/immunology', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/19 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47523-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.559971 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Aug 1;289(31):21374-85. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.559971.

The HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax controls many critical cellular pathways, including host cell DNA damage response mechanisms, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Extracellular vesicles called exosomes play critical roles during pathogenic viral infections as delivery vehicles for host and viral components, including proteins, mRNA, and microRNA. We hypothesized that exosomes derived from HTLV-1-infected cells contain unique host and viral proteins that may contribute to HTLV-1-induced pathogenesis. We found exosomes derived from infected cells to contain Tax protein and proinflammatory mediators as well as viral mRNA transcripts, including Tax, HBZ, and Env. Furthermore, we observed that exosomes released from HTLV-1-infected Tax-expressing cells contributed to enhanced survival of exosome-recipient cells when treated with Fas antibody. This survival was cFLIP-dependent, with Tax showing induction of NF-kappaB in exosome-recipient cells. Finally, IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells that received Tax-containing exosomes were protected from apoptosis through activation of AKT. Similar experiments with primary cultures showed protection and survival of peripheral blood mononuclear cells even in the absence of phytohemagglutinin/IL-2. Surviving cells contained more phosphorylated Rb, consistent with the role of Tax in regulation of the cell cycle.

The Mcl-1 protein contains PEST sequences (enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) and is normally subject to rapid turnover via multiple different pathways. One of these pathways involves a phosphodegron in the PEST region, where Thr-163 phosphorylation primes for Ser-159 phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3. Turnover via this phosphodegron-targeted pathway is reduced in Mcl-1-overexpressing BL41-3 Burkitt lymphoma and other cancer cells; turnover is further slowed in the presence of phorbol ester-induced ERK activation, resulting in Mcl-1 stabilization and an exacerbation of chemoresistance. The present studies focused on Mcl-1 dephosphorylation, which was also found to profoundly influence turnover. Exposure of BL41-3 cells to an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), okadaic acid, resulted in a rapid increase in phosphorylation at Thr-163 and Ser-159, along with a precipitous decrease in Mcl-1 expression. The decline in Mcl-1 expression preceded the appearance of cell death markers and was not slowed in the presence of phorbol ester. Upon exposure to calyculin A, which also potently inhibits PP2A, versus tautomycin, which does not, only the former increased Thr-163/Ser-159 phosphorylation and decreased Mcl-1 expression. Mcl-1 co-immunoprecipitated with PP2A upon transfection into CHO cells, and PP2A/Aalpha knockdown recapitulated the increase in Mcl-1 phosphorylation and decrease in expression. In sum, inhibition of PP2A prevents Mcl-1 dephosphorylation and results in rapid loss of this prosurvival protein in chemoresistant cancer cells.","['Nifoussi, Shanna K', 'Ratcliffe, Nora R', 'Ornstein, Deborah L', 'Kasof, Gary', 'Strack, Stefan', 'Craig, Ruth W']","['Nifoussi SK', 'Ratcliffe NR', 'Ornstein DL', 'Kasof G', 'Strack S', 'Craig RW']","['From the Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03766.', 'Pathology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, White River Junction, Vermont 05001.', 'Pathology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755.', 'Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts 01923, and.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242.', 'From the Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03766, Ruth.W.Craig@Dartmouth.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '7D07U14TK3 (calyculin A)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Marine Toxins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Oxazoles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Proteolysis', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Threonine/chemistry']",2014/06/19 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)33135-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.587873 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Aug 8;289(32):21950-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.587873.

In particular, TET1 acts as tumor suppressor preventing cell proliferation and tumor metastasis and it has frequently been found down-regulated in cancer. Thus, considering the importance of a tight control of TET1 expression, the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of TET1 gene are here investigated. The involvement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the control of DNA and histone methylation on TET1 gene was examined. PARP activity is able to positively regulate TET1 expression maintaining a permissive chromatin state characterized by DNA hypomethylation of TET1 CpG island as well as high levels of H3K4 trimethylation. These epigenetic modifications were affected by PAR depletion causing TET1 down-regulation and in turn reduced recruitment of TET1 protein on HOXA9 target gene. In conclusion, this work shows that PARP activity is a transcriptional regulator of TET1 gene through the control of epigenetic events and it suggests that deregulation of these mechanisms could account for TET1 repression in cancer.","['Ciccarone, Fabio', 'Valentini, Elisabetta', 'Bacalini, Maria Giulia', 'Zampieri, Michele', 'Calabrese, Roberta', 'Guastafierro, Tiziana', 'Mariano, Germano', 'Reale, Anna', 'Franceschi, Claudio', 'Caiafa, Paola']","['Ciccarone F', 'Valentini E', 'Bacalini MG', 'Zampieri M', 'Calabrese R', 'Guastafierro T', 'Mariano G', 'Reale A', 'Franceschi C', 'Caiafa P']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.

Moreover, OSCP1 is known as a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently down-expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinomas and acute myeloid leukemia. However, the underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear and the subcellular localization of OSCP1 has yet to be determined in detail. RESULTS: Drosophila contains a single orthologue of OSCP1 (dOSCP1) that shares 58% homology with its human counterpart. To study the expression pattern and subcellular localization of dOSCP1, we prepared a specific antibody. Subcellular localization analyses of dOSCP1 with these revealed localization in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, but no detection in cytosol. dOSCP1 signals were also detected in the nucleus, although at weaker intensity than in plasma membranes and subcellular organelles. In addition, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis with and without beta-mercaptoethanol treatment revealed that recombinant dOSCP1 forms dimers and trimers in solution. The dimer form of dOSCP1 could also be detected by Western immunoblot analyses in third instar larval extracts. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that dOSCP1 localizes not only in the plasma membrane but also in the nucleus, ER, Golgi apparatus and mitochondria. It is therefore conceivable that this protein may interact with various partners or form multimeric complexes with other proteins to play multiple roles in cells, providing clues to understanding the functions of dOSCP1 during Drosophila development.","['Huu, Nguyen Tho', 'Yoshida, Hideki', 'Umegawachi, Takanari', 'Miyata, Seiji', 'Yamaguchi, Masamitsu']","['Huu NT', 'Yoshida H', 'Umegawachi T', 'Miyata S', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Applied Biology, Matsugasaki, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8585, Japan. myamaguc@kit.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Biochem,BMC biochemistry,101084098,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (OSCP1 protein, Drosophila)', '0 (OSCP1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Drosophila/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Larva', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcriptome']",2014/06/19 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2091-15-11 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2091-15-11 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Biochem. 2014 Jun 18;15:11. doi: 10.1186/1471-2091-15-11.,,20140618,,PMC4074837,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To determine if patient weight per body mass index (BMI) category is associated with failure of initial FDR as defined by the need for additional dose(s) based on a uric acid level (UAL) >/=7.5 mg/dL within 10 days of previous rasburicase administration. METHOD: Adults who received FDR per institutional guidelines from October 2008 to August 2013 were reviewed. Patients had either a baseline UAL >/=7.5 mg/dL or were considered high risk (leukemia or lymphoma diagnosis with white blood cell count >50 000/mm(3) or lactate dehydrogenase level greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal). Patients were stratified by BMI as underweight (<18.5), normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), or obese (30+). RESULT: Overall, 12 out of 151 patients who received FDR required a repeat dose of rasburicase. The percentage of patients requiring a repeat rasburicase dose was not different between obese/overweight versus normal/underweight patients (8.7% vs 6.4%, P = 0.75). Similarly, there was no difference between obese alone versus normal/underweight patients (12.3% vs 6.4%; P = 0.51).

DNAM-1 and CRTAM are emerging NK receptors of immune cells that were described to interact with nectin and Necl. DNAM-1, constitutively expressed by CD8(+) T cells, NK or gammadelta T lymphocytes, is a ligand of Necl-5. It participates to tumor immunosurveillance promoting Necl-5 expressing tumor cell lysis. CRTAM, only expressed after lymphocyte activation, is a ligand of Necl-2. Engagement of CRTAM with Necl-2 has opposite effects depending on the type of lymphocyte. For NK or CD8(+) T cells, it promotes cytotoxicity and IFNgamma secretion favoring immunosurveillance. By contrast, CRTAM/Necl-2 interaction triggers cell death of activated TVg9Vd2 gammadelta T cells favoring immune escape.

Their synergistic effects with other anticancer drugs have been widely studied. In this study, interactions between As2O3 and BTZ were examined in imatinibresistant Bcr/Abl+ (K562r) cells. Cotreatment of K562r cells with subtoxic concentrations of As2O3 (2 microM) and BTZ (24 nM) resulted in a synergistic enhancement in growth inhibition and apoptosis, as demonstrated by increased annexin V staining. These events were associated with activation of protein kinase Cdelta, poly ADPribose polymerase cleavage and caspase3 activation, along with downregulation of Bcr/Abl mRNA and Bcr/Abl protein expression levels during apoptosis. In addition, reactive oxygen species were downregulated during combined treatment in K562r cells.

Therefore, further studies are required to assess the potential of BTZ and As2O3 combinatory treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, particularly using imatinibresistant Bcr/Abl+ clones.","['Xu, Wenbin', 'Wei, Wei', 'Yu, Qing', 'Wu, Chao', 'Ye, Chenjing', 'Wu, Yingli', 'Yan, Hua']","['Xu W', 'Wei W', 'Yu Q', 'Wu C', 'Ye C', 'Wu Y', 'Yan H']","['Exclusive Medical Care Center, RuiJin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, P.R.

In our current study, we show that rapamycin activates autophagy in pediatric t(1;19) pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) cells and thereby inhibits proliferation and induces growth arrest in these cells. Rapamycin was found to downregulate an extensive array of positive cell cycle regulators, reduce the total DNA and RNA levels, and specifically downregulate the gene transcription of DNA pol delta1 and RNA pol II. Furthermore, we show that both rapamycin and starvation caused a downregulation of the DNA pol delta1 and RNA pol II proteins which was reversed by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. Consistent with the results of our autophagic flux analysis, confocal microscopy indicated that both rapamycin and starvation cause the colocalization of DNA pol delta1 and RNA pol II with GFP-LC3 at autophagosomes. This colocalization was blocked by the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 which inhibits the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. These data suggest that rapamycin inhibits the growth of pediatric t(1;19) pre-B ALL cells through both transcriptional inhibition and autophagic degradation of DNA pol delta1 and RNA pol II.","['Wang, Zhijian', 'Xu, Fei', 'Yuan, Na', 'Niu, Yuna', 'Lin, Weiwei', 'Cao, Yan', 'Cai, Jinyang', 'Song, Lin', 'Li, Xin', 'Fang, Yixuan', 'Zhao, Wenli', 'Hu, Shaoyan', 'Chen, Suning', 'Zhang, Suping', 'Wang, Jianrong']","['Wang Z', 'Xu F', 'Yuan N', 'Niu Y', 'Lin W', 'Cao Y', 'Cai J', 'Song L', 'Li X', 'Fang Y', 'Zhao W', 'Hu S', 'Chen S', 'Zhang S', 'Wang J']","[""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China."", ""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Stem Cell Research, Affiliated Children's Hospital, Soochow University School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.

We aimed to describe such factors in children receiving treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 1,668 hospitalized children undergoing treatment for AML from the Pediatric Health Information System database (39 hospitals, 1999-2010). Antiemetic alteration, which included switch (a change in prescribed 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists) and rescue (receipt of an adjunct antiemetic), were first validated and then used as surrogates of problematic NV. Logistic and negative binomial regression modeling were used to test whether patient characteristics were associated with problematic NV. RESULTS: Increasing age is associated with greater odds of experiencing antiemetic switch and higher relative rate of antiemetic rescue. Within a treatment cycle, each consecutive inpatient chemotherapy day decreased the likelihood of requiring antiemetic alteration. Each consecutive inpatient-day post-chemotherapy was associated with decreased need for switch, but increased need for rescue. Subsequent cycles of AML therapy were associated with lower odds of antiemetic switch on both chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy days, a lower rate of antiemetic rescue on chemotherapy days, and an increased rate of rescue on non-chemotherapy days. CONCLUSION: In pediatric patients with AML, increasing age is strongly associated with greater antiemetic alteration. Antiemetic alteration occurs early in treatment overall, and early within each admission.

In 2012, a workshop was organised on this topic with two objectives: (a) review of results and discussion of methodological limitations of studies near nuclear installations; (b) identification of directions for future research into the causes and pathogenesis of childhood leukaemia. The workshop gathered 42 participants from different disciplines, extending widely outside of the radiation protection field. Regarding the proximity of nuclear installations, the need for continuous surveillance of childhood leukaemia incidence was highlighted, including a better characterisation of the local population. The creation of collaborative working groups was recommended for consistency in methodologies and the possibility of combining data for future analyses. Regarding the causes of childhood leukaemia, major fields of research were discussed (environmental risk factors, genetics, infections, immunity, stem cells, experimental research). The need for multidisciplinary collaboration in developing research activities was underlined, including the prevalence of potential predisposition markers and investigating further the infectious aetiology hypothesis. Animal studies and genetic/epigenetic approaches appear of great interest. Routes for future research were pointed out.","['Laurier, D', 'Grosche, B', 'Auvinen, A', 'Clavel, J', 'Cobaleda, C', 'Dehos, A', 'Hornhardt, S', 'Jacob, S', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Kosti, O', 'Kuehni, C', 'Lightfoot, T', 'Spycher, B', 'Van Nieuwenhuyse, A', 'Wakeford, R', 'Ziegelberger, G']","['Laurier D', 'Grosche B', 'Auvinen A', 'Clavel J', 'Cobaleda C', 'Dehos A', 'Hornhardt S', 'Jacob S', 'Kaatsch P', 'Kosti O', 'Kuehni C', 'Lightfoot T', 'Spycher B', 'Van Nieuwenhuyse A', 'Wakeford R', 'Ziegelberger G']","['Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire (IRSN), BP 17, F-92262 Fontenay-aux-Roses Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Nuclear Power Plants', 'Risk Factors']",2014/06/19 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/34/3/R53 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2014 Sep;34(3):R53-68. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/34/3/R53.

Using the gene sequence results, we amplified the p15 gene from normal peripheral blood by RT-PCR, and constructed a p15-pcDNA3.1 vector. The K562 cell line with G418 resistance was screened, synthesized and transfected for bcr-abl gene fusion point for 21-nt siRNA. In p15-pcDNA3.1-K562 cells, the growth rate was slower than that of the control K562 cells, G0/G1-phase was increased and S-phase was decreased significantly. In the siRNA group, bcr-abl fusion gene expression was significantly decreased in K562 cells accompanied by the downregulation of BCL-xL protein expression and G1-phase arrest. Cell survival rate was significantly decreased compared with the sole p15-K562 cell group and the sole RNA interference-K562 cell group. In the combination of p15-pcDNA3.1-K562 cells with STI571, the proportion of apoptosis was significantly increased and the cell survival rate was significantly decreased compared with the p15-K562 cell group and STI571-K562 cell group. siRNA at 30 pM combined with 0.5 muM STI571 promoted apoptosis compared with sole application. The p15 gene combined with siRNA had a synergistic effect on the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in K562 cells. Exogenous p15 protein expression combined with STI571 appeared to have a synergistic effect on proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction in K562 cells. The combination of low-dose RNA interference with STI571 showed a synergistic effect in inducing apoptosis.","['Wang, W', 'Du, Y', 'Li, N-N', 'Lv, F-F', 'Lin, G-Q']","['Wang W', 'Du Y', 'Li NN', 'Lv FF', 'Lin GQ']","['Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China wangwei220012@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southeast Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2014/06/19 06:00,2015/02/13 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr3095 [pii]', '10.4238/2014.May.30.4 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2014 May 30;13(2):4089-101. doi: 10.4238/2014.May.30.4.,,20140530,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome this poor prognosis, we designed an approach to maximize an allogeneic graft vs lymphoma effect in the setting of low disease burden. We conducted a multi-center prospective study of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (AutoSCT), followed by a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AlloHCT) in CAYA, with poor-risk refractory or recurrent lymphoma. Conditioning for MAC AutoSCT consisted of carmustine/etoposide/cyclophosphamide, RIC consisted of busulfan/fludarabine. Thirty patients, 16 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and 14 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with a median age of 16 years and median follow-up of 5years, were enrolled. Twenty-three patients completed both MAC AutoSCT and RIC AlloHCT. Allogeneic donor sources included unrelated cord blood (n=9), unrelated donor (n=8) and matched siblings (n=6). The incidence of transplant-related mortality following RIC AlloHCT was only 12%. In patients with HL and NHL, 10 year EFS was 59.8% and 70% (P=0.613), respectively. In summary, this approach is safe, and long-term EFS with this approach is encouraging considering the poor-risk patient characteristics and the use of unrelated donors for RIC AlloHCT in the majority of cases.","['Satwani, P', 'Jin, Z', 'Martin, P L', 'Bhatia, M', 'Garvin, J H', 'George, D', 'Chaudhury, S', 'Talano, J', 'Morris, E', 'Harrison, L', 'Sosna, J', 'Peterson, M', 'Militano, O', 'Foley, S', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Cairo, M S']","['Satwani P', 'Jin Z', 'Martin PL', 'Bhatia M', 'Garvin JH', 'George D', 'Chaudhury S', 'Talano J', 'Morris E', 'Harrison L', 'Sosna J', 'Peterson M', 'Militano O', 'Foley S', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Cairo MS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University, Chicago IL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Depatment of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.', 'Depatment of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Depatment of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.', 'Depatment of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', '1] Depatment of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA [2] Departments of Medicine, Pathology, Microbiology and Anatomy, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/19 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014194 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.194 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Feb;29(2):448-55. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.194.

METHODS: Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for 1993-2010 were used to assess the frequency of using methotrexate with TMP-SMX and associated physician specialties and diagnoses. RESULTS: TMP-SMX was coprescribed in 22,000 methotrexate visits per year (1.0% of methotrexate visits). Pediatricians prescribed the combination most frequently, and the most common diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia. There was no significant change over time in coprescription of TMP-SMX with methotrexate (P = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose TMP-SMX with methotrexate chemotherapy appears to be standard for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; however, other uses appear questionable, and clinicians should be cognizant of the risk for fatal interactions, especially when medications are prescribed by multiple providers.","['Davis, Scott A', 'Krowchuk, Daniel P', 'Feldman, Steven R']","['Davis SA', 'Krowchuk DP', 'Feldman SR']","['From the Departments of Dermatology, Pediatrics, Pathology, and Public Health Sciences, Center for Dermatology Research, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'From the Departments of Dermatology, Pediatrics, Pathology, and Public Health Sciences, Center for Dermatology Research, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'From the Departments of Dermatology, Pediatrics, Pathology, and Public Health Sciences, Center for Dermatology Research, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ambulatory Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/chemically induced', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/standards/*statistics & numerical data"", 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'United States']",2014/06/18 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/SMJ.0000000000000098 [doi]', 'SMJ13245 [pii]']",ppublish,South Med J. 2014 May;107(5):292-3. doi: 10.1097/SMJ.0000000000000098.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although beta-arrestin2 mediates the initiation and progression of myeloid leukaemia, the critical role of beta-arrestin1 in the chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is still unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the essential function of beta-arrestin1 in CML. METHODS: The expressions of beta-arrestin1 and BCR/ABL in CML patients, animal models and K562 cells were measured by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and western blotting. The effect of beta-arrestin1 on CML animal models and K562 cells by colony formation, MTT and survival analysis were assessed. BCR/ABL H4 acetylation was analysed through the use of Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -on-chip and confirmed by ChIP respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal were examined for the binding of beta-arrestin1 with enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2). RESULTS: The higher expression of beta-arrestin1 is positively correlated with clinical phases of CML patients. Depletion of beta-arrestin1 decelerates progression of K562 and primary cells, and increases survival of CML mice. Importantly, silenced beta-arrestin1 results in the decrease of BCR/ABL H4 acetylation level in K562 cells. Further data illustrate that nuclear beta-arrestin1 binds to EZH2 to mediate BCR/ABL acetylation and thus regulates cell progression in K562 cells and the survival of CML mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a novel function of beta-arrestin1 binding to EZH2 to promote CML progression by regulating BCR/ABL H4 acetylation.","['Qin, R', 'Li, K', 'Qi, X', 'Zhou, X', 'Wang, L', 'Zhang, P', 'Zou, L']","['Qin R', 'Li K', 'Qi X', 'Zhou X', 'Wang L', 'Zhang P', 'Zou L']","[""1] Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [2] Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [3] Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [4] Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""1] Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [2] Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [3] Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [4] Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""1] Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [2] Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [3] Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [4] Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""1] Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [2] Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [3] Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [4] Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Chongqing Stem Cell Therapy Engineering Technique Center, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""1] Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [2] Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [3] Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [4] Hematological Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."", ""1] Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [2] Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [3] Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China [4] Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Arrestins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (beta-Arrestins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Arrestins/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Young Adult', 'beta-Arrestins']",2014/06/18 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2014335 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2014.335 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2014 Jul 29;111(3):568-76. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.335.

De-regulation of this signaling system is linked to the promotion of more aggressive and metastatic tumor phenotypes in a large variety of human cancers, including breast, lung, and prostate cancer, melanoma, and leukemia. Thus, it is interesting to consider the case of cancer progression where de-regulation of the Eph/ephrin signaling system results in invasion and metastasis. Here, we present evidence that Pick1, one of the essential components of the adherens junction, recovers ephrinB1-induced cell-cell de-adhesion. Loss of Pick1 leads to dissociation of epithelial cells via disruption of the adherens junction, a phenotype similar to ephrinB1 overexpression. In addition, overexpressed ephrinB1-induced disruption of the adherens junction is rescued via binding to Pick1. These data indicate that Pick1 is involved in regulating the cell-cell junction in epithelial cells, and this may influence therapeutic strategy decisions with regards to cell adhesion molecules in metastatic disease.","['Son, Jungeun', 'Park, Mi Seon', 'Park, Inji', 'Lee, Hyun-Kyung', 'Lee, Soo-Ho', 'Kang, Byungwoo', 'Min, Byung-Hwa', 'Ryoo, Jaewoong', 'Lee, Sanggyu', 'Bae, Jong-Sup', 'Kim, Sang-Hyun', 'Park, Mae-Ja', 'Lee, Hyun-Shik']","['Son J', 'Park MS', 'Park I', 'Lee HK', 'Lee SH', 'Kang B', 'Min BH', 'Ryoo J', 'Lee S', 'Bae JS', 'Kim SH', 'Park MJ', 'Lee HS']","['ABRC, School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.', 'Aquaculture Management Division, National Fisheries Research and Development Institute, Busan 619-705, South Korea.', 'ABRC, School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.', 'ABRC, School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.', 'ABRC, School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.', 'ABRC, School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.', 'Aquaculture Management Division, National Fisheries Research and Development Institute, Busan 619-705, South Korea.', 'ABRC, School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.', 'ABRC, School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 700-422, South Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 700-422, South Korea.', 'ABRC, School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.

METHODS: Pretreatment bone marrow (BM) samples were acquired from mononuclear cells in 146 adult patients with de novo MDS from January 2006 to June 2013. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing were performed on exon 4 of IDH1/2 genes and mutation status was correlated with overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS). We then performed a meta-analysis combining previously published and current studies to explore the effect of IDH mutations on OS and LFS in MDS. RESULTS: In our study, somatic mutations of either IDH gene were discovered in 11 MDS patients (7.53%) and were significantly correlated with poorer OS (P = 0.007). IDH mutations were specifically associated with a poorer OS in the intermediate-1 risk group by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) (P = 0.039). In addition, we discovered decitabine achieved a better therapeutic effect compared to other treatments in IDH mutation-positive patients (P = 0.023). We identified six previous studies of IDH mutations in MDS. A meta-analysis of these studies included 111 MDS patients IDH mutations and 1671 MDS patients with wild-type IDH1/2. The hazard ratios (HRs) of OS and LFS for patients with IDH mutations were 1.62 (95% CI, 1.27-2.09) and 2.21 (95% CI, 1.48-3.30), respectively. CONCLUSION: The results from our study and the meta-analysis provide firm evidence that IDH mutations are significantly associated with poorer clinical outcomes in MDS. Identification of IDH mutations may be pivotal for better risk stratification in MDS patients and improving IPSS score. Additionally, hypomethylating agents may be an effective treatment option for MDS patients with IDH mutations.","['Jin, Jie', 'Hu, Chao', 'Yu, Mengxia', 'Chen, Feifei', 'Ye, Li', 'Yin, Xiufeng', 'Zhuang, Zhengping', 'Tong, Hongyan']","['Jin J', 'Hu C', 'Yu M', 'Chen F', 'Ye L', 'Yin X', 'Zhuang Z', 'Tong H']","[""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Surgical Neurology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Currently, there is no international consensus on drug dosing. Because of significant interindividual and intraindividual variations in drug disposition and pharmacodynamics, vigorous dose adjustments are needed to obtain a target degree of myelosuppression. As the normal white blood cell counts vary by patients' ages and ethnicity, and also within age groups, identical white blood cell levels for 2 patients may not reflect the same treatment intensity. Measurements of intracellular levels of cytotoxic metabolites of 6MP and MTX can identify nonadherent patients, but therapeutic target levels remains to be established. A rise in serum aminotransferase levels during maintenance therapy is common and often related to high levels of methylated 6MP metabolites. However, except for episodes of hypoglycemia, serious liver dysfunction is rare, the risk of permanent liver damage is low, and aminotransferase levels usually normalize within a few weeks after discontinuation of therapy. 6MP and MTX dose increments should lead to either leukopenia or a rise in aminotransferases, and if neither is experienced, poor treatment adherence should be considered. The many genetic polymorphisms that determine 6MP and MTX disposition, efficacy, and toxicity have precluded implementation of pharmacogenomics into treatment, the sole exception being dramatic 6MP dose reductions in patients who are homozygous deficient for thiopurine methyltransferase, the enzyme that methylates 6MP and several of its metabolites. In conclusion, maintenance therapy is as important as the more intensive and toxic earlier treatment phases, and often more challenging. Ongoing research address the applicability of drug metabolite measurements for dose adjustments, extensive host genome profiling to understand diversity in treatment efficacy and toxicity, and alternative thiopurine dosing regimens to improve therapy for the individual patient.","['Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Nielsen, Stine N', 'Frandsen, Thomas L', 'Nersting, Jacob']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Nielsen SN', 'Frandsen TL', 'Nersting J']","['*Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet daggerInstitute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology']",2014/06/18 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000206 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Oct;36(7):503-17. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000206.,,,,PMC4222610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we aim to further investigate the association between DNMT3A mutations and prognosis of patients with AML. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified from several data bases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials and the Cochrane Library (up to June 2013). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), while relapse-free survival (RFS) and event-free survival (EFS) were chosen as secondary endpoints. If possible, we would pool estimate effects (hazard ratio [HR] with 95% confidence interval[CI]) of outcomes in random and fixed effects models respectively. RESULTS: That twelve cohort studies with 6377 patients exploring the potential significance of DNMT3A mutations on prognosis were included. Patients with DNMT3A mutations had slightly shorter OS (HR = 1.60; 95% CI, 1.31-1.95; P<0.001), as compared to wild-type carriers. Among the patients younger than 60 years of age, DNMT3A mutations predicted a worse OS (HR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.36-2.50; P<0.001). In addition, mutant DNMT3A predicted inferior OS (HR = 2.30; 95% CI, 1.78-2.97; P = 0.862) in patients with unfavorable genotype abnormalities. Similar results were also found in some other subgroups. However, no significant prognostic value was found on OS (HR = 1.40; 95% CI, 0.98-1.99; P = 0.798) in the favorable genotype subgroup. Similar results were found on RFS and EFS under different conditions. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A mutations have slightly but significantly poor prognostic impact on OS, RFS and EFS of adults with de novo AML in total population and some specific subgroups.","['Tie, Ruxiu', 'Zhang, Tiansong', 'Fu, Huarui', 'Wang, Limengmeng', 'Wang, Yebo', 'He, Ying', 'Wang, Binsheng', 'Zhu, Ni', 'Fu, Shan', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Huang, He']","['Tie R', 'Zhang T', 'Fu H', 'Wang L', 'Wang Y', 'He Y', 'Wang B', 'Zhu N', 'Fu S', 'Lai X', 'Shi J', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', ""Department of TCM, Jing'an District Central Hospital, Shanghai, China."", 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/10/21 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0093353 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-46526 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 17;9(6):e93353. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0093353. eCollection 2014.,,20140617,,PMC4061003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adult-derived pNSCs (AdpNSCs) are GFAP(-), LIF-responsive stem cells that display pNSC properties, including Oct4 expression and the ability to integrate into the inner cell mass of blastocysts. AdpNSCs generate self-renewing, multipotent colonies that give rise to definitive GFAP(+) NSCs in vitro and repopulate the subependyma after the ablation of GFAP(+) NSCs in vivo.

Recent evidence demonstrates that signaling by HIF-1alpha contributes to cell-autonomous regulation of HSC maintenance. By investigating the role of HIF factors in bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors, we found that murine endosteal mesenchymal progenitors express high levels of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha and proliferate preferentially in hypoxic conditions ex vivo. Inactivation of either HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha dramatically affects their phenotype, propagation, and differentiation. Also, downregulation of HIF factors provokes an increase in interferon-responsive genes and triggers expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors by a STAT1-mediated mechanism. Interestingly, in conditions of demand-driven hematopoiesis HIF factors are specifically downregulated in mesenchymal progenitors in vivo. In conclusion, our findings indicate that HIF factors also regulate hematopoiesis non-cell-autonomously by preventing activation of a latent program in mesenchymal progenitors that promotes hematopoiesis.","['Guarnerio, Jlenia', 'Coltella, Nadia', 'Ala, Ugo', 'Tonon, Giovanni', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Bernardi, Rosa']","['Guarnerio J', 'Coltella N', 'Ala U', 'Tonon G', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Bernardi R']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Leukemia Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy ; Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, Leukemia Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Universita degli Studi di Torino, Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e Biologiche, Turin 10124, Italy.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, Leukemia Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, Leukemia Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cell Reports,Stem cell reports,101611300,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2014/06/18 06:00,2014/06/18 06:01,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.04.002 [doi]', 'S2213-6711(14)00109-X [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Reports. 2014 May 15;2(6):794-809. doi: 10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.04.002. eCollection 2014 Jun 3.,,20140515,,PMC4050345,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20140617'],,,,,

BACKGROUND: Total skin electron beam (TSEB) therapy is a method of irradiation with low energy electron beam dedicated to patients who have superficial skin lesions all over their body. Such skin malignancies are sparse among adults and even more uncommon with pediatric population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, all reported case reports were summed up with a special emphasis on techniques used, doses prescribed and special shielding of critical organs. Moreover, potential problems that were encountered during TSEB irradiation of very young patients were depicted. RESULTS: The literature has described only seven case reports of children undergoing TSEB therapy. Most of them were infants; however, two adolescents were also treated. For all infants, general anesthesia was provided to allow safe and accurate TSEB irradiation. The prescribed dose varied from 16 Gy to 28 Gy depending on the irradiation schedule and patient condition. Usually, boost fields were applied to the scalp and perineum. Typical shields for fingernails, toenails and lenses were usually used. CONCLUSION: This paper revealed that TSEB therapy may be considered as a palliative treatment for pediatric patients with leukemia cutis. However, its role is still unclear and should be further investigated.","['Skorska, Malgorzata']",['Skorska M'],"['Department of Medical Physics, Greater Poland Cancer Centre, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Rep Pract Oncol Radiother,Reports of practical oncology and radiotherapy : journal of Greatpoland Cancer Center in Poznan and Polish Society of Radiation Oncology,100885761,,,,2014/06/18 06:00,2014/06/18 06:01,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.rpor.2013.06.003 [doi]', 'S1507-1367(13)00998-X [pii]']",epublish,Rep Pract Oncol Radiother. 2013 Jul 19;19(2):109-13. doi: 10.1016/j.rpor.2013.06.003. eCollection 2014 Mar.,,20130719,,PMC4054996,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia cutis', 'Pediatric total skin electron beam therapy', 'TSEB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic traits of red and white blood cells (like erythrocytosis and myeloproliferative disease), autoimmune disorders (like type 1 diabetes, coeliac disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism and vitiligo), also vascular pathology (like kidney glomerular filtration rate deficits, serum urate levels, plasma beta-2-microglobulin levels, retinal microcirculation problems, diastolic and systolic blood pressure and hypertension, cardiovascular infarction), furthermore obesity, neurodegenerative conditions (like the polyglutamine-expansion disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, Parkinson's disease, the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and progressive supranuclear palsy), and finally longevity were reported. Now it is important to clarify, in which ways the loss or gain of function of the locally encoded proteins SH2B3/LNK and ataxin-2, respectively, contribute to these polygenic health problems. SH2B3/LNK is known to repress the JAK2/ABL1 dependent proliferation of white blood cells. Its null mutations in human and mouse are triggers of autoimmune traits and leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia-like), while missense mutations were found in erythrocytosis-1 patients. Ataxin-2 is known to act on RNA-processing and trophic receptor internalization. While its polyglutamine-expansion mediated gain-of-function causes neuronal atrophy in human and mouse, its deletion leads to obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Thus, it is conceivable that the polygenic pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes is enhanced by an SH2B3-dysregulation-mediated predisposition to autoimmune diseases that conspires with an ATXN2-deficiency-mediated predisposition to lipid and glucose metabolism pathology.","['Auburger, Georg', 'Gispert, Suzana', 'Lahut, Suna', 'Omur, Ozgur', 'Damrath, Ewa', 'Heck, Melanie', 'Basak, Nazli']","['Auburger G', 'Gispert S', 'Lahut S', 'Omur O', 'Damrath E', 'Heck M', 'Basak N']","['Georg Auburger, Suzana Gispert, Ewa Damrath, Melanie Heck, Experimental Neurology, Goethe University Medical School, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg Auburger, Suzana Gispert, Ewa Damrath, Melanie Heck, Experimental Neurology, Goethe University Medical School, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg Auburger, Suzana Gispert, Ewa Damrath, Melanie Heck, Experimental Neurology, Goethe University Medical School, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg Auburger, Suzana Gispert, Ewa Damrath, Melanie Heck, Experimental Neurology, Goethe University Medical School, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg Auburger, Suzana Gispert, Ewa Damrath, Melanie Heck, Experimental Neurology, Goethe University Medical School, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg Auburger, Suzana Gispert, Ewa Damrath, Melanie Heck, Experimental Neurology, Goethe University Medical School, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg Auburger, Suzana Gispert, Ewa Damrath, Melanie Heck, Experimental Neurology, Goethe University Medical School, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,World J Diabetes,World journal of diabetes,101547524,,,,2014/06/18 06:00,2014/06/18 06:01,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4239/wjd.v5.i3.316 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Diabetes. 2014 Jun 15;5(3):316-27. doi: 10.4239/wjd.v5.i3.316.,,,,PMC4058736,['NOTNLM'],"['12q24', 'ATXN2', 'Autoimmune', 'Diabetes mellitus type 1', 'Obesity', 'SH2B3']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome some disadvantages of adenoviral and retroviral vectors, we developed a hybrid vector. This hybrid vector, AdLTR-luc, was created by adding two elements from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) flanking the luciferase cDNA into an E1/E3-deleted, replication deficient serotype 5 adenovirus vector (Zheng et al., Nature Biotechnol, 2000), and demonstrated that the MoMLV element upstream of the luciferase cDNA was broken during the integration event. The purpose of the current study was to determine if the MoMLV element downstream of the luciferase cDNA was also broken when integration occurred. We used the same A5 cell clones (#10 and 11) from the earlier the paper along with restriction endonuclease digestions, plus Southern hybridization, and PCR. Southern hybridization indicated that the luciferase cDNA was intact in the cloned cells. Results from Xho I and Sal I digestions showed that integration occurred in cloned cells. Southern hybridizations after Nco I digestion suggested that there was a break in both MoMLV elements, upstream and downstream of the luciferase cDNA. After DNA digestion with Not I, hybridization analyses indicated that the MoMLV upstream element was broken during integration. Digestion of genomic DNA with either Xba I/Kpn I, Bam HI/Sac I, or Bam HI/Nco I demonstrated that the MoMLV downstream element was also broken during integration. A PCR assay was unable to amplify the junctional region between the downstream MoMLV element and the adenoviral E2B gene, consistent with a break in that element. Although AdLTR-luc integration is atypical (Zheng et al., Nature Biotechnol, 2000), the present results suggest that both MoMLV elements have important roles in this event.","['Zheng, Changyu', 'Baum, Bruce J']","['Zheng C', 'Baum BJ']","['Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1190, USA.', 'Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1190, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",Australia,Int J Med Sci,International journal of medical sciences,101213954,,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Transgenes']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/02/13 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijms.9084 [doi]', 'ijmsv11p0803 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Med Sci. 2014 Jun 1;11(8):803-9. doi: 10.7150/ijms.9084. eCollection 2014.,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],20140601,,PMC4057490,['NOTNLM'],"['Hybrid vector', 'LTR', 'adenoretrovirus', 'gene therapy', 'integration']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a systematic review of cytological and histological data from 1150 patients with peripheral blood cytopenia. We analyzed the frequency and discriminant power of single morphological abnormalities. A score to define minimal morphological criteria associated to the presence of marrow dysplasia was developed. This score showed high sensitivity/specificity (>90%), acceptable reproducibility and was independently validated. The severity of granulocytic and megakaryocytic dysplasia significantly affected survival. A close association was found between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations, and between severe granulocytic dysplasia and mutation of ASXL1, RUNX1, TP53 and SRSF2 genes. In myeloid neoplasms with fibrosis, multilineage dysplasia, hypolobulated/multinucleated megakaryocytes and increased CD34+ progenitors in the absence of JAK2, MPL and CALR gene mutations were significantly associated with a myelodysplastic phenotype. In myeloid disorders with marrow hypoplasia, granulocytic and/or megakaryocytic dysplasia, increased CD34+ progenitors and chromosomal abnormalities are consistent with a diagnosis of MDS. The proposed morphological score may be useful to evaluate the presence of dysplasia in cases without a clearly objective myelodysplastic phenotype. The integration of cytological and histological parameters improves the identification of MDS cases among myeloid disorders with fibrosis and hypocellularity.","['Della Porta, M G', 'Travaglino, E', 'Boveri, E', 'Ponzoni, M', 'Malcovati, L', 'Papaemmanuil, E', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Pascutto, C', 'Croci, G', 'Gianelli, U', 'Milani, R', 'Ambaglio, I', 'Elena, C', 'Ubezio, M', ""Da Via', M C"", 'Bono, E', 'Pietra, D', 'Quaglia, F', 'Bastia, R', 'Ferretti, V', 'Cuneo, A', 'Morra, E', 'Campbell, P J', 'Orazi, A', 'Invernizzi, R', 'Cazzola, M']","['Della Porta MG', 'Travaglino E', 'Boveri E', 'Ponzoni M', 'Malcovati L', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Rigolin GM', 'Pascutto C', 'Croci G', 'Gianelli U', 'Milani R', 'Ambaglio I', 'Elena C', 'Ubezio M', ""Da Via' MC"", 'Bono E', 'Pietra D', 'Quaglia F', 'Bastia R', 'Ferretti V', 'Cuneo A', 'Morra E', 'Campbell PJ', 'Orazi A', 'Invernizzi R', 'Cazzola M']","['1] Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy [2] Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Anatomic Pathology Section, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit and Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', '1] Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy [2] Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, University Hospital Arcispedale S.

Our results demonstrate that MP-CTLs generated from SMM patients' T cells show effective anti-MM responses including CD137 (4-1BB) upregulation, CTL proliferation, interferon-gamma production and degranulation (CD107a) in an HLA-A2-restricted and peptide-specific manner. Phenotypically, we observed increased total CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells (>80%) and cellular activation (CD69(+)) within the memory SMM MP-CTL (CD45RO(+)/CD3(+)CD8(+)) subset after repeated multipeptide stimulation. Importantly, SMM patients could be categorized into distinct groups by their level of MP-CTL expansion and antitumor activity. In high responders, the effector memory (CCR7(-)CD45RO(+)/CD3(+)CD8(+)) T-cell subset was enriched, whereas the remaining responders' CTL contained a higher frequency of the terminal effector (CCR7(-)CD45RO(-)/CD3(+)CD8(+)) subset. These results suggest that this multipeptide cocktail has the potential to induce effective and durable memory MP-CTL in SMM patients. Therefore, our findings provide the rationale for clinical evaluation of a therapeutic vaccine to prevent or delay progression of SMM to active disease.","['Bae, J', 'Prabhala, R', 'Voskertchian, A', 'Brown, A', 'Maguire, C', 'Richardson, P', 'Dranoff, G', 'Anderson, K C', 'Munshi, N C']","['Bae J', 'Prabhala R', 'Voskertchian A', 'Brown A', 'Maguire C', 'Richardson P', 'Dranoff G', 'Anderson KC', 'Munshi NC']","['1] Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA [2] Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '1] Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA [2] Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA [3] VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', '1] Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA [2] Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', '1] Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA [2] Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '1] Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA [2] Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '1] Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA [2] Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '1] Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA [2] Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA [3] VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (SDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Syndecan-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (XBP1 protein, human)', '107978-77-8 (CS1 peptide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptides/*immunology', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Syndecan-1/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*immunology', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014159 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):218-29. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.159.

In this report, we demonstrate that in mouse, Fli-1 overexpression retards the CD4(-) CD8(-) double-negative (DN) to CD4(+) CD8(+) double-positive (DP) transition by deregulating normal DN thymocyte development. Specifically, Fli-1 expression moderates the DN2 and DN3 developmental transitions. We further show that Fli-1 overexpression partially mimics strong TCR signals in developing DN thymocytes and thereby enhances gammadelta T-cell development. Conversely, Fli-1 knockdown by small hairpin RNA reverses the lineage bias from gammadelta T cells and directs DN cells to the alphabeta lineage by attenuating TCR signaling. Therefore, Fli-1 plays a critical role in both the DN2 to DN3 transition and alphabeta/gammadelta lineage commitment.","['Smeets, Monique F M A', 'Wiest, David L', 'Izon, David J']","['Smeets MF', 'Wiest DL', 'Izon DJ']","[""Haematology and Leukaemia Unit, St. Vincent's Institute, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Thymocytes/cytology/*immunology']",2014/06/18 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201444442 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2014 Sep;44(9):2617-24. doi: 10.1002/eji.201444442.

METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to invite inpatients and outpatients with lung cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma. Two hundred participants completed the questionnaire, which included the Distress Thermometer (DT), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Demoralization Scale-Mandarin Version (DS-MV), and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. All data obtained were analyzed using SPSS 18.0 and SAS 9.3. RESULTS: Tobit regression analysis showed that demoralization influenced suicidal ideation more than depression did (t = 2.84, p < 0.01). When PHQ-9 >/= 10 and DS-MV >/=42 were used as criteria for the DT, receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the AUC values were 0.77-0.79, with optimal cutoff points for both of DT >/=5; sensitivity 76.9 and 80.6 %, respectively; and specificity of 73.9 and 72.2 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Demoralization had more influence on suicidal ideation than depression did. Therefore, attention should be paid to highly demoralized patients with cancer or high demoralization comorbid with depression for the purposes of suicide evaluation and prevention. The DT scale (with a cutoff of >/=5 points) has discriminative ability as a screening tool for demoralization or depression and can also be used in clinical settings for the preliminary screening of patients with cancer and high suicide risk.","['Fang, Chun-Kai', 'Chang, Ming-Chih', 'Chen, Pei-Jan', 'Lin, Ching-Chi', 'Chen, Gon-Shen', 'Lin, Johnson', 'Hsieh, Ruey-Kuen', 'Chang, Yi-Fang', 'Chen, Hong-Wen', 'Wu, Chien-Liang', 'Lin, Kuan-Chia', 'Chiu, Yu-Jing', 'Li, Yu-Chan']","['Fang CK', 'Chang MC', 'Chen PJ', 'Lin CC', 'Chen GS', 'Lin J', 'Hsieh RK', 'Chang YF', 'Chen HW', 'Wu CL', 'Lin KC', 'Chiu YJ', 'Li YC']","['Department of Psychiatry and Suicide Prevention Center, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Area Under Curve', '*Depression/diagnosis/etiology/physiopathology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Outpatients/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Stress, Psychological/diagnosis/etiology/physiopathology', '*Suicidal Ideation', 'Suicide/*prevention & control/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Taiwan']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-014-2290-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2014 Dec;22(12):3165-74. doi: 10.1007/s00520-014-2290-4.

Karyotype, if known at the time of diagnosis, guides physicians to plan appropriate management strategies for their patients. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the cytogenetic profile of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Pakistani children in order to have insights regarding behavior of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all the cases of ALL (<15years old) diagnosed at Aga Khan University from January 2006 to June 2011 was performed. Cytogenetic analysis was made for all cases using the trypsin-Giemsa banding technique. Karyotypes were interpreted using the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) criteria. RESULTS: A total of 153 patients were diagnosed as ALL during the study period, of which 127 samples successfully yielded metaphase chromosomes. The male to female ratio was 1.8:1. A normal karyotype was present in 51.2% (n=65) of the cases whereas 48.8% (n=62) had an abnormal karyotype. Most of the abnormal cases showed hyperdiploidy(13.4%) followed by t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) (7.08%).

However, the application of anti-panCD44 can be burdened by severe side effects. We determined whether these side effects could be avoided by replacing anti-panCD44 with CD44 variant isoform (CD44v)-specific antibodies in CD44v-positive hematological malignancies using the EL4 thymoma and CD44v10-transfected EL4 (EL4-v10) as models. Subcutaneous growth of EL4 and EL4-v10 was equally well inhibited by the anti-panCD44 and anti-CD44v10 antibodies, respectively. Ex vivo analysis indicated that natural killer cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity were the main effector mechanisms. Under local inflammation, the efficacy of anti-CD44v10 prolonged the survival time twofold compared with untreated, EL4-v10 tumor-bearing mice, and this was due to inflammation-induced expression of osteopontin (OPN). A high level of OPN in EL4-v10 tumors supported leukocyte recruitment and tumor-infiltrating T-cell activation. Taken together, in hematological malignancies expressing CD44v, anti-panCD44 can be replaced by CD44v-specific antibodies without a loss in efficacy. Furthermore, CD44v10-specific antibodies appear particularly advantageous in cutaneous leukemia therapy, as CD44v10 binding of OPN drives leukocyte recruitment and activation.","['Megaptche, Amelie Pajip', 'Erb, Ulrike', 'Buchler, Markus Wolfgang', 'Zoller, Margot']","['Megaptche AP', 'Erb U', 'Buchler MW', 'Zoller M']","['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, University Hospital of Surgery, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Tumor Cell Biology, University Hospital of Surgery, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Allgemeine, Viszeral- und Transplantationschirurgie, University Hospital of Surgery, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Tumor Cell Biology, University Hospital of Surgery, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD44v10 antigen)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Inflammation/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Osteopontin/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['icb201447 [pii]', '10.1038/icb.2014.47 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2014 Sep;92(8):709-20. doi: 10.1038/icb.2014.47.

However, their role in acute myeloid leukemia has not been completely explored. We therefore used cell penetrating inhibitor peptides to define the contributions of AKT and NF-kB to survival and multi drug resistance (MDR) in HL-60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inhibition of AKT and NF-kB activity by AKT inhibitor peptide and NBD inhibitor peptide, respectively, resulted in decreased expression of mRNA for the MDR1 gene as assessed by real time PCR. In addition, treatment of HL-60 cells with AKT and NBD inhibitor peptides led to inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis in a dose dependent manner as detected by flow cytometer. RESULTS: Finally, co-treatment of HL-60 cells with sub-optimal doses of AKT and NBD inhibitor peptides led to synergistic apoptotic responses in AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data support a strong biological link between NF-kB and PI3-kinase/AKT pathways in the modulation of anti- apoptotic and multi drug resistant effects in AML cells. Synergistic targeting of these pathways using NF-kB and PI3-kinase/AK inhibitor peptides may have a therapeutic potential for AML and possibly other malignancies with constitutive activation of these pathways.","['Davoudi, Zahra', 'Akbarzadeh, Abolfazl', 'Rahmatiyamchi, Mohammad', 'Movassaghpour, Ali Akbar', 'Alipour, Mohsen', 'Nejati-Koshki, Kazem', 'Sadeghi, Zohre', 'Dariushnejad, Hassan', 'Zarghami, Nosratollah']","['Davoudi Z', 'Akbarzadeh A', 'Rahmatiyamchi M', 'Movassaghpour AA', 'Alipour M', 'Nejati-Koshki K', 'Sadeghi Z', 'Dariushnejad H', 'Zarghami N']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran E-mail : Zarghami@tbzmed.ac.ir.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.10.4353 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(10):4353-8. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.10.4353.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review the literature with particular emphasis on pathogenesis, treatment and survival of RS.

Moreover, CRLF2 gain was identified in 18 (11%) of 167 patients. Messenger RNA sequencing revealed a novel fusion transcript, CSF2RA-CRLF2, in a case with CRLF2 OE, suggesting that this fusion is associated with CRLF2 OE. In survival analysis, no significant differences in 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival were observed between patients with and without CRLF2 OE (70.7 vs. 75.4%, log rank P = 0.68 and 96.4 vs. 82.1%, log rank P = 0.11, respectively). However, a significant difference in 5-year EFS between CRLF2 OE patients with and without IKZF1 deletion was observed (44.4 vs. 83.1%, log rank P = 0.02). In multivariate analysis, only IKZF1 deletion was a significant predictor of inferior OS (hazard ratio: 2.427, P = 0.04).These findings suggest that CRLF2 OE is not an independent prognostic factor in pediatric BCPALL.","['Yano, Mio', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Asai, Daisuke', 'Moriya-Saito, Akiko', 'Suenobu, So-ichi', 'Hasegawa, Daiichiro', 'Deguchi, Takao', 'Hashii, Yoshiko', 'Kawasaki, Hirohide', 'Hori, Hiroki', 'Kosaka, Yoshiyuki', 'Kato, Koji', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Yumura-Yagi, Keiko', 'Hara, Junichi', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Oda, Megumi', 'Sato, Atsushi']","['Yano M', 'Imamura T', 'Asai D', 'Moriya-Saito A', 'Suenobu S', 'Hasegawa D', 'Deguchi T', 'Hashii Y', 'Kawasaki H', 'Hori H', 'Kosaka Y', 'Kato K', 'Horibe K', 'Yumura-Yagi K', 'Hara J', 'Matsumoto K', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Oda M', 'Sato A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (CSF2RA protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (P2RY8 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Pediatrics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22190 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Oct;53(10):815-23. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22190.

Increasing evidence indicates that AML relapse is driven by the inability to eradicate leukemia stem cells (LSC). Thus, it is imperative to identify novel therapies that can ablate LSCs. Using an in silico gene expression-based screen for compounds evoking transcriptional effects similar to the previously described anti-LSC agent parthenolide, we identified AR-42 (OSU-HDAC42), a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor that is structurally similar to phenylbutyrate, but with improved activity at submicromolar concentrations. Here, we report that AR-42 induces NF-kappaB inhibition, disrupts the ability of Hsp90 to stabilize its oncogenic clients, and causes potent and specific cell death of LSCs but not normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Unlike parthenolide, the caspase-dependent apoptosis caused by AR-42 occurs without activation of Nrf-2-driven cytoprotective pathways. As AR-42 is already being tested in early clinical trials, we expect that our results can be extended to the clinic.","['Guzman, Monica L', 'Yang, Neng', 'Sharma, Krishan K', 'Balys, Marlene', 'Corbett, Cheryl A', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'Hassane, Duane C']","['Guzman ML', 'Yang N', 'Sharma KK', 'Balys M', 'Corbett CA', 'Jordan CT', 'Becker MW', 'Steidl U', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Levine RL', 'Marcucci G', 'Roboz GJ', 'Hassane DC']","['Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine and mlg2007@med.cornell.edu dhassane@med.cornell.edu.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'James P.

METHODS: Comparative pharmacokinetics (PK), bioavailability, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity studies were performed in CD((R)) rats and Beagle dogs after intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) single-dose administration of MC0609 or Oncaspar((R)). Bioanalytical data on enzymatic activity in serum of animals were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model to simulate different dosages of MC0609 comparable to the activity time profile of Oncaspar((R)). RESULTS: In contrast to Oncaspar((R)), which showed an accelerated elimination over time, a constant serum elimination of enzymatic activity over time was seen for MC0609. Linear PK of MC0609 resulted in a prolonged and dose-dependent duration of enzymatic activity and longer depletion of L-asparagine in peripheral blood. The different PK characteristics of MC0609 and Oncaspar((R)) were confirmed by PopPK analysis and model development. The PK parameters of Oncaspar((R)) in dog scaled to body surface area were in the same range than the parameters determined in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients. Therefore, the dog is considered a clinically relevant model for PK evaluation of Oncaspar((R)). Distinct differences in immunogenic potential of both preparations were detected after single-dose administration of a therapeutic dose to dogs. An absolute bioavailability of 66 % was calculated for the intramuscular administration of MC0609. CONCLUSIONS: The new pegylated recombinant L-asparaginase preparation MC0609 revealed striking differences in PK/PD properties compared with Oncaspar((R)) in rat and dog.","['Borghorst, Stephan', 'Hempel, Georg', 'Poppenborg, Sabine', 'Franke, Dieter', 'Konig, Thorsten', 'Baumgart, Joachim']","['Borghorst S', 'Hempel G', 'Poppenborg S', 'Franke D', 'Konig T', 'Baumgart J']","['Institut fur Pharmazeutische und Medizinische Chemie, Klinische Pharmazie, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Raum A 120.210, Corrensstrasse 48, 48149, Munster, Germany, stephan-borghorst@gmx.de.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asparaginase/*blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Dogs', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/*blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",2014/06/18 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2506-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2014 Aug;74(2):367-78. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2506-9.

Baseline frailty was measured using a previously validated 35-item scale and grouped as prefrail or frail versus robust. Logistic regression and proportional hazards models were used to assess factors associated with noninitiation and discontinuation, respectively. RESULTS: Most women (76.4%) were robust. Noninitiation of hormonal therapy was low (14%), but in prefrail or frail (v robust) women the odds of noninitiation were 1.63 times as high (95% CI, 1.11 to 2.40; P = .013) after covariate adjustment. Nonwhites (v whites) had higher odds of noninitiation (odds ratio, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.80; P = .033) after covariate adjustment. Among initiators, the 5-year continuation probability was 48.5%. After adjustment, the risk of discontinuation was higher with increasing age (P = .005) and lower for stage >/= IIB (v stage I) disease (P = .003). CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with noninitiation of hormonal therapy, but it does not seem to be a major predictor of early discontinuation in older patients.","['Sheppard, Vanessa B', 'Faul, Leigh Anne', 'Luta, George', 'Clapp, Jonathan D', 'Yung, Rachel L', 'Wang, Judy Huei-Yu', 'Kimmick, Gretchen', 'Isaacs, Claudine', 'Tallarico, Michelle', 'Barry, William T', 'Pitcher, Brandelyn N', 'Hudis, Clifford', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Muss, Hyman B', 'Hurria, Arti', 'Mandelblatt, Jeanne S']","['Sheppard VB', 'Faul LA', 'Luta G', 'Clapp JD', 'Yung RL', 'Wang JH', 'Kimmick G', 'Isaacs C', 'Tallarico M', 'Barry WT', 'Pitcher BN', 'Hudis C', 'Winer EP', 'Cohen HJ', 'Muss HB', 'Hurria A', 'Mandelblatt JS']","['Vanessa B.

Initially, the platform was developed for two-group comparisons to match the independent, ""control"" versus ""disease"" experimental design. Here, we introduce an enhanced XCMS Online interface that enables users to perform dependent (paired) two-group comparisons, meta-analysis, and multigroup comparisons, with comprehensive statistical output and interactive visualization tools. Newly incorporated statistical tests cover a wide array of univariate analyses. Multigroup comparison allows for the identification of differentially expressed metabolite features across multiple classes of data while higher order meta-analysis facilitates the identification of shared metabolic patterns across multiple two-group comparisons. Given the complexity of these data sets, we have developed an interactive platform where users can monitor the statistical output of univariate (cloud plots) and multivariate (PCA plots) data analysis in real time by adjusting the threshold and range of various parameters. On the interactive cloud plot, metabolite features can be filtered out by their significance level (p-value), fold change, mass-to-charge ratio, retention time, and intensity. The variation pattern of each feature can be visualized on both extracted-ion chromatograms and box plots. The interactive principal component analysis includes scores, loadings, and scree plots that can be adjusted depending on scaling criteria. The utility of XCMS functionalities is demonstrated through the metabolomic analysis of bacterial stress response and the comparison of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines.","['Gowda, Harsha', 'Ivanisevic, Julijana', 'Johnson, Caroline H', 'Kurczy, Michael E', 'Benton, H Paul', 'Rinehart, Duane', 'Nguyen, Thomas', 'Ray, Jayashree', 'Kuehl, Jennifer', 'Arevalo, Bernardo', 'Westenskow, Peter D', 'Wang, Junhua', 'Arkin, Adam P', 'Deutschbauer, Adam M', 'Patti, Gary J', 'Siuzdak, Gary']","['Gowda H', 'Ivanisevic J', 'Johnson CH', 'Kurczy ME', 'Benton HP', 'Rinehart D', 'Nguyen T', 'Ray J', 'Kuehl J', 'Arevalo B', 'Westenskow PD', 'Wang J', 'Arkin AP', 'Deutschbauer AM', 'Patti GJ', 'Siuzdak G']","['Scripps Center for Metabolomics and Mass Spectrometry and double daggerDepartment of Cell Biology, The Scripps Research Institute , 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,IM,"['Blood/metabolism', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Databases, Factual', 'Desulfovibrio/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Male', '*Mass Spectrometry', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Metabolomics/*methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Software', '*User-Computer Interface']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/09/05 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac500734c [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2014 Jul 15;86(14):6931-9. doi: 10.1021/ac500734c.

Chem Phys Lipids 167:9-20 2013). Neoplastic cells presented morpho-functional modifications concomitant to striking membrane lipid alterations: the proportion of particular plasmalogen molecular species was drastically decreased. We wanted to test whether this pattern was representative of bivalve neoplastic cells. For the purpose, a similar study was conducted on another bivalve species affected by disseminated neoplasia, the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria). Although total reactive oxygen species production was unaffected, M. arenaria neoplastic cells presented some functional alterations: phagocytosis activity was reduced by 33 %. However, lipid compositions were not drastically altered. Particularly, sterol and plasmalogen levels did not differ between both cell types (about 43 % of membrane lipids and 35 % of phospholipids, respectively in hemocytes and neoplastic cells). This could be related to the fact that disseminated neoplasia was not related to hemolymph cell proliferation in M. arenaria (0.9 +/- 0.2 10(6)cell mL(-1), considering both healthy and neoplastic clams, n = 6). Nevertheless this study highlighted minor but specific alterations of membrane lipid composition in M. arenaria neoplastic cells. The only phospholipid subclass in which the fatty acid profile strongly differed between both cell types was serine plasmalogen (PlsSer), with neoplastic cells presenting lower specific enrichment of 20:1n-11 in PlsSer. Such specific alteration of membrane lipid composition strengthened the assumption of an implication of key plasmalogen molecular species in this leukemia-like disease in bivalves.","['Le Grand, Fabienne', 'Soudant, Philippe', 'Siah, Ahmed', 'Tremblay, Rejean', 'Marty, Yanic', 'Kraffe, Edouard']","['Le Grand F', 'Soudant P', 'Siah A', 'Tremblay R', 'Marty Y', 'Kraffe E']","['UMR CNRS 6521, Universite de Bretagne Occidentale, 29200, Brest, France, fabienne.legrand@univ-brest.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hemocytes/*metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Mya/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2013/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11745-014-3917-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 2014 Aug;49(8):807-18. doi: 10.1007/s11745-014-3917-4.

The short-chain fatty acid, butyric acid, a histone deacetylase (HD) inhibitor, has shown anticancer activity. Butyrate transcriptional activation is indeed able to withdraw cancer cells from the cell cycle, leading to programmed cell death. Since butyrate's clinical use is hampered by unfavorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, delivery systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), have been developed to overcome these constraints. METHODS: In order to outline the influence of butyrate delivery on its anticancer activity, the effects of butyrate as a free (sodium butyrate, NB) or nanoparticle (cholesteryl butyrate solid lipid nanoparticles, CBSLN) formulation on the growth of different human cancer cell lines, such as the promyelocytic leukemia, HL-60, and the breast cancer, MCF-7 was investigated. A detailed investigation into the mechanism of the induced cytotoxicity was also carried out, with a special focus on the modulation of HD and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) mRNA gene expression by real time PCR analysis. RESULTS: In HL-60 cells, CBSLN induced a higher and prolonged expression level of the butyrate target genes at lower concentrations than NB. This led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, along with considerable apoptosis, cell cycle block in the G0/G1 phase, significant inhibition of total HD activity and overexpression of the p21 protein. Conversely, in MCF-7 cells, CBSLN did not enhance the level of expression of the butyrate target genes, leading to the same anticancer activity as that of NB. CONCLUSIONS: Solid lipid nanoparticles were able to improve butyrate anticancer activity in HL-60, but not in MCF-7 cells. This is consistent with difference in properties of the cells under study, such as expression of the TP53 tumor suppressor, or the transporter for short-chain fatty acids, SLC5A8.","['Foglietta, Federica', 'Serpe, Loredana', 'Canaparo, Roberto', 'Vivenza, Nicoletta', 'Riccio, Giovanna', 'Imbalzano, Erica', 'Gasco, Paolo', 'Zara, Gian Paolo']","['Foglietta F', 'Serpe L', 'Canaparo R', 'Vivenza N', 'Riccio G', 'Imbalzano E', 'Gasco P', 'Zara GP']",['University of Torino.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,J Pharm Pharm Sci,"Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",9807281,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipids)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Butyrates/*administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lipids/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface Properties', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.18433/j3xp4r [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharm Sci. 2014;17(2):231-47. doi: 10.18433/j3xp4r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of novel therapeutic approaches is perceived to be the best strategy to combat this disease. Availability of limited effective drugs with least side effects is the major hurdle in treating leukemia. Another major concern remains initiation and engagement of therapeutic strategies that may subvert or overcome drug-resistance. Deployment of plant-based molecules in therapeutic engagements is regarded to be the most apt approach to combat different forms of leukemia. Diterpenoids of natural origin have a broad range of therapeutic activities including anti-leukemic effect. In vitro and in vivo studies establish many diterpenoids from natural sources and their synthetic derivatives to have appreciable cytotoxic and apoptotic efficacies against a series of leukemic cells. This paper attempts to identify and describe diterpenoids with their plant sources and analyze the molecular mechanistic approaches underlying their effective apoptotic activities against leukemic cells studied till date. The present review article summarizes different categories of diterpenoids having various degrees of anti-leukemic activities and discusses the measures of overcoming the bio-availability issues of these natural molecules so that they can serve as extremely viable options in future leukemia therapy.,"['Sarkar, Swadesh', 'Gopal, Priya K', 'Paul, Santanu']","['Sarkar S', 'Gopal PK', 'Paul S']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Department of Botany and Microbiology, Gurudas College, Kolkata 700054, India. spaul_1971@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Diterpenes/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Plants/metabolism']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['CPB-EPUB-60823 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201015666140604121658 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2014;15(2):127-42. doi: 10.2174/1389201015666140604121658.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping can identify novel asthma genes by enabling prioritization of putative functional variants for association testing. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated 6706 cis-acting expression-associated variants (eSNPs) identified through a genome-wide eQTL survey of CD4(+) lymphocytes for association with asthma. METHODS: eSNPs were tested for association with asthma in 359 asthmatic patients and 846 control subjects from the Childhood Asthma Management Program, with verification by using family-based testing. Significant associations were tested for replication in 579 parent-child trios with asthma from Costa Rica. Further functional validation was performed by using formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) quantitative PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR in lung-derived epithelial cell lines (Beas-2B and A549) and Jurkat cells, a leukemia cell line derived from T lymphocytes. RESULTS: Cis-acting eSNPs demonstrated associations with asthma in both cohorts. We confirmed the previously reported association of ORMDL3/GSDMB variants with asthma (combined P = 2.9 x 10(-8)). Reproducible associations were also observed for eSNPs in 3 additional genes: fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2; P = .002), N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminidase (NAGA; P = .0002), and Factor XIII, A1 (F13A1; P = .0001). Subsequently, we demonstrated that FADS2 mRNA is increased in CD4(+) lymphocytes in asthmatic patients and that the associated eSNPs reside within DNA segments with histone modifications that denote open chromatin status and confer enhancer activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the utility of eQTL mapping in the identification of novel asthma genes and provide evidence for the importance of FADS2, NAGA, and F13A1 in the pathogenesis of asthma.","['Sharma, Sunita', 'Zhou, Xiaobo', 'Thibault, Derek M', 'Himes, Blanca E', 'Liu, Andy', 'Szefler, Stanley J', 'Strunk, Robert', 'Castro, Mario', 'Hansel, Nadia N', 'Diette, Gregory B', 'Vonakis, Becky M', 'Adkinson, N Franklin Jr', 'Avila, Lydiana', 'Soto-Quiros, Manuel', 'Barraza-Villareal, Albino', 'Lemanske, Robert F Jr', 'Solway, Julian', 'Krishnan, Jerry', 'White, Steven R', 'Cheadle, Chris', 'Berger, Alan E', 'Fan, Jinshui', 'Boorgula, Meher Preethi', 'Nicolae, Dan', 'Gilliland, Frank', 'Barnes, Kathleen', 'London, Stephanie J', 'Martinez, Fernando', 'Ober, Carole', 'Celedon, Juan C', 'Carey, Vincent J', 'Weiss, Scott T', 'Raby, Benjamin A']","['Sharma S', 'Zhou X', 'Thibault DM', 'Himes BE', 'Liu A', 'Szefler SJ', 'Strunk R', 'Castro M', 'Hansel NN', 'Diette GB', 'Vonakis BM', 'Adkinson NF Jr', 'Avila L', 'Soto-Quiros M', 'Barraza-Villareal A', 'Lemanske RF Jr', 'Solway J', 'Krishnan J', 'White SR', 'Cheadle C', 'Berger AE', 'Fan J', 'Boorgula MP', 'Nicolae D', 'Gilliland F', 'Barnes K', 'London SJ', 'Martinez F', 'Ober C', 'Celedon JC', 'Carey VJ', 'Weiss ST', 'Raby BA']","[""Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Mass.

As a result, animals rescued from hoarding frequently have a variety of medical conditions including respiratory infections, gastrointestinal disease, parasitism, malnutrition, and other evidence of neglect. The purpose of this study was to characterize the infectious diseases carried by clinically affected cats and to determine the prevalence of retroviral infections among cats in large-scale cat hoarding investigations. Records were reviewed retrospectively from four large-scale seizures of cats from failed sanctuaries from November 2009 through March 2012. The number of cats seized in each case ranged from 387 to 697. Cats were screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in all four cases and for dermatophytosis in one case. A subset of cats exhibiting signs of upper respiratory disease or diarrhea had been tested for infections by PCR and fecal flotation for treatment planning. Mycoplasma felis (78%), calicivirus (78%), and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (55%) were the most common respiratory infections. Feline enteric coronavirus (88%), Giardia (56%), Clostridium perfringens (49%), and Tritrichomonas foetus (39%) were most common in cats with diarrhea. The seroprevalence of FeLV and FIV were 8% and 8%, respectively. In the one case in which cats with lesions suspicious for dermatophytosis were cultured for Microsporum canis, 69/76 lesional cats were culture-positive; of these, half were believed to be truly infected and half were believed to be fomite carriers.

The present study showed that there was high level expression of endocan in cytoplasm of bone marrow blasts of patients with acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The expression level of endocan was significantly decreased when the patients underwent remission after chemotherapy and re-bounces back when the acute leukemia relapsed. No obvious change in expression of endocan was observed before and after chemotherapy if the patients showed no remission after chemotherapy. (N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) retinamide), a potent anti-angiogenic agent, could not only down-regulate the expression of vascular epithelial growth factor, but also decrease endocan transcription and expression in NB4 cells, a human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line. These observations suggest that endocan could act as a predictor for the severity and the prognosis of acute leukemia. The findings could be used as the basis for future targeted therapy directed against bone marrow angiogenesis in acute leukemia treatment.","['Xu, Zhe', 'Zhang, Sumei', 'Zhou, Qing', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Xia, Ruixiang']","['Xu Z', 'Zhang S', 'Zhou Q', 'Wang Y', 'Xia R']","[""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital, Hefei, 230051, Anhui, People's Republic of China, xuzhe240@aliyun.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (ESM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Fenretinide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proteoglycans/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/18 06:00,2015/10/30 06:00,['2014/06/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-014-2117-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2014 Oct;395(1-2):117-23. doi: 10.1007/s11010-014-2117-0.

We show here that treatment of K562 cells with caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) induced a majority of cells to differentiate towards the megakaryocytic lineage. Microscopy analysis showed that K562 cells treated with CAPE exhibited characteristic features of physiological megakaryocytic differentiation, including the presence of vacuoles and demarcation membranes. Differentiation of K562 cells treated with CAPE was also accompanied by a net increase in megakaryocytic markers. The transcriptional activity of lactosylceramide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (GM3 synthase) and synthesis of ganglioside GM3 were increased by CAPE treatment. The promoter analysis of GM3 synthase demonstrated that CAPE induced the expression of GM3 synthase mRNA via activation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), transcription factor in nucleus. Interestingly, the inhibition of ganglioside GM3 synthesis by D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propranol (D-PDMP) and GM3 synthase-siRNA blocked the CAPE-induced expression of the megakaryocytic markers and differentiation of K562 cells.

In many situations, a matched related (MRD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) is lacking, in which case unrelated cord blood units (UCB) provide an alternative. We analyzed the outcome of consecutive high-risk AML patients prepared with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and allografted with UCB (n = 32) and compared their outcome with high-risk AML patients who underwent transplantation with MRD/MUD (n = 49) in the same period of time. Grade III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred slightly more frequently in the UCB group (25%) than in the MRD/MUD group (8%) (P = .069). Conversely, we found a lower incidence of extensive chronic GVHD in the UCB group (6%) than in the MRD/MUD group (20%, P = .085). Nonrelapse mortality at 4 years was 16% and 22% in the UCB and MRD/MUD groups, respectively (P = .529). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 4 years was significantly higher in the UCB group (60%) than in the MRD/MUD group (27%, P = .006). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) at 4 years were 25% and 34%, respectively, in the UCB group and 50% and 56%, respectively, in the MRD/MUD group (LFS, P = .029; OS, P = .072). Multivariate analyses adjusted by cytogenetics and disease status at the time of Allo-HSCT revealed that use of UCB remained an independent predictive factor of shorter LFS (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.6; P = .018), and was associated with a trend for shorter OS (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, .9 to 3.2; P = .093). Whereas UCB provides an alternative for patients with high-risk AML lacking an MRD/MUD, the high incidence of relapse after RIC-based UCB Allo-HSCT is a concern. Attempts to improve leukemic control with UCB Allo-HSCT are warranted, as well as the evaluation of other alternative donors in this context.","['Devillier, Raynier', 'Harbi, Samia', 'Furst, Sabine', 'Crocchiolo, Roberto', 'El-Cheikh, Jean', 'Castagna, Luca', 'Etienne, Anne', 'Calmels, Boris', 'Lemarie, Claude', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'Granata, Angela', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Rey, Jerome', 'Chabannon, Christian', 'Faucher, Catherine', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Blaise, Didier']","['Devillier R', 'Harbi S', 'Furst S', 'Crocchiolo R', 'El-Cheikh J', 'Castagna L', 'Etienne A', 'Calmels B', 'Lemarie C', 'Prebet T', 'Granata A', 'Charbonnier A', 'Rey J', 'Chabannon C', 'Faucher C', 'Vey N', 'Blaise D']","['Hematology Department, Transplantation Program, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France; Inserm UMR 1068/Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France.

Research data demonstrated that the peripheral CD4+ T-cell population decreased in pathogenesis of PD. The effect of damaged dopaminergic neurons on peripheral T cells of PD is still unknown. In this study, we constructed a neuronal and glial cells co-culture model by using human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y and gliomas cells U87. After the co-culture cells were treated with neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) for 24 h, the conditioned media was harvested and used to cultivate T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells for another 24 h. We then analyzed the cell proliferation, cell cycle and necrosis effect of Jurkat cells. The results showed that co-culture medium of SH-SY5Y and U87 cells with MPP+ treatment inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells compared to control medium without MPP+, even though the same concentration of MPP+ had very little toxicity to the Jurkat cell. Furthermore, co-culture medium with low concentration of MPP+ (100 microM) arrested Jurkat cells cycle in G2/M phase through increasing cell cycle division 2 (CDC2) and CyclinB1 expression level, whereas co-culture medium with high concentration of MPP+ (500 microM) induced Jurkat cell necrosis through cellular swelling and membrane breakage. Our data implies that damaged dopamine neurons with glial cells can lead to the reduced number or inhibited proliferation activity of peripheral T cells.","['Wang, Fuli', 'Awan, Umer Farooq', 'Wang, Yuanyuan', 'Wang, Luna', 'Qing, Hong', 'Ma, Hong', 'Deng, Yulin']","['Wang F', 'Awan UF', 'Wang Y', 'Wang L', 'Qing H', 'Ma H', 'Deng Y']","['School of Life Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, No. 5 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Haidian District, Beijing 100081, China. wangfuli5728@163.com.', 'School of Life Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, No. 5 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Haidian District, Beijing 100081, China. umeraliawan@gmail.com.', 'School of Life Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, No. 5 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Haidian District, Beijing 100081, China. mah_cindy@sina.com.', 'School of Life Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, No. 5 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Haidian District, Beijing 100081, China. wangluna1955@gmail.com.', 'School of Life Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, No. 5 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Haidian District, Beijing 100081, China. hqing@bit.edu.cn.', 'School of Life Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, No. 5 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Haidian District, Beijing 100081, China. 04656@bit.edu.cn.', 'School of Life Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, No. 5 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Haidian District, Beijing 100081, China. deng@bit.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Neurotoxins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'R865A5OY8J (1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclin B1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Necrosis', 'Neuroblastoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Neurotoxins/toxicity']",2014/06/17 06:00,2015/01/28 06:00,['2014/06/17 06:00'],"['2014/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms150610738 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms150610738 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2014 Jun 13;15(6):10738-50. doi: 10.3390/ijms150610738.,,20140613,,PMC4100177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since there is no physiological excretion mechanism for iron, the iron related to erythrocyte transfusions accumulates and may contribute to late cardiac, hepatic and endocrine complications in these patients. PROCEDURE: In order to evaluate the iron burden among pediatric patients with ALL and define the risk factors associated with higher iron loading, we evaluated 79 pediatric patients with ALL (36 were off-therapy). Cardiac and hepatic T2* were ordered to a total of 22 (28%) patients who were either transfused with erythrocytes >/= 10 times (n=11; 50%), had serum ferritin (SF) >/= 1000 ng/ml (n=2; 9.1%) or both (n=9; 40.9%). RESULTS: Half of the patients who were screened by T2* MRI had hepatic T2*<7 ms and six (27%) of the patients had cardiac T2*<20 ms, indicating iron loading. Patients who had serum ferritin <1000 vs >/= 1000 ng/ml had median cardiac T2* values of 28.3 ms (15-40) vs 21 (7.9-36), (p=0.324); whereas hepatic T2* of 10.8 (5.32-27) vs 4.7 (2.2-36), (p=0.017). Patients who had erythrocyte transfusion <10 vs >/= 10 times had median cardiac T2* values of 34 ms (28-38) vs 23 (7.93-40), (p=0.021); whereas hepatic T2* of 13.6 (6.6-36) vs 5.32 (2.2-27), (p=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that pediatric patients with ALL should be screened for transfusional iron load and the amount of erythrocyte transfusions seems to be a more reliable indication than serum ferritin levels to detect cardiac iron loading in these patients.","['Unal, Sule', 'Cetin, Mualla', 'Hazirolan, Tuncay', 'Yildirim, Gokce', 'Meral, Aytac', 'Birbilen, Ahmet', 'Karabulut, Erdem', 'Aytac, Selin', 'Tavil, Betul', 'Kuskonmaz, Baris', 'Tuncer, Murat', 'Gumruk, Fatma']","['Unal S', 'Cetin M', 'Hazirolan T', 'Yildirim G', 'Meral A', 'Birbilen A', 'Karabulut E', 'Aytac S', 'Tavil B', 'Kuskonmaz B', 'Tuncer M', 'Gumruk F']","['Hacettepe University, Division of Pediatric Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.

METHODS: A total of 16 children (M:F = 9:7; mean age, 8.1 years) who developed L-AP after L-asparaginase (L-asp) treatment and underwent abdominal CT scan were included. We retrospectively reviewed clinical data (age, sex, signs, and symptoms related to pancreatic toxicity and its complications, the number of L-asp doses receiving before L-AP); laboratory test results (serum amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glucose, and serum albumin); and clinical course (the number of days of hospitalization, number of NPO days, use of nasogastric tube, intravenous (IV) narcotics, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or any surgical intervention). We also reviewed CT images and modified CT severity index (MCSI) for grading the severity of AP and classified to three groups (mild, moderate, and severe) or two groups (low and high score) according to MCSI. RESULTS: L-AP typically occurred early in the course of therapy. Use of IV narcotics (P = .014) and peak amylase (P = .009) showed a significant difference between mild and severe L-AP groups according to MCSI. Between the low and high score groups, Use of IV narcotics (P = .046), BUN (P = .039), and peak amylase level (P = .013) was significantly different. However, the L-asp dose, hospital day, and other clinical date associated with prognosis did not show any significant difference. CONCLUSION: In L-AP with pediatric ALL patients, MCSI may correlate with usage of IV narcotics, BUN, and peak amylase levels.","['Oh, Hyeon Jeong', 'Im, Soo Ah', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Chung, Nak Gyun', 'Cho, Bin']","['Oh HJ', 'Im SA', 'Lee JW', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B']","[""1Department of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2014/06/17 06:00,2015/08/15 06:00,['2014/06/17 06:00'],"['2014/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2014.918681 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Oct;31(7):647-55. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2014.918681.

Although transplant-related mortality has decreased significantly in the past decade, relapse remains high after HCT for ALL; developing strategies to decrease relapse and improve survival are vital. Recent studies have shown that relapse risk can be accurately defined using measurements of minimal residual disease (MRD) both pre- and post-HCT and by knowing whether patients get GVHD in the first 2 months after transplant. With these risk definitions in hand, investigators are now applying novel agents and immunotherapeutic methods in attempt to lower MRD before transplant and modulate the GVL effect after transplant. With powerful new immunological approaches coming on line, the transplant process itself will likely expand to include pre and/or post-HCT interventions aimed at reducing relapse.","['Pulsipher, M A', 'Wayne, A S', 'Schultz, K R']","['Pulsipher MA', 'Wayne AS', 'Schultz KR']","[""Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Primary Children's Hospital, University of Utah School of Medicine/Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."", ""Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, The Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of BC, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/17 06:00,2015/04/18 06:00,['2014/06/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2014114 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2014.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2014 Oct;49(10):1259-65. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2014.114.

Hematopoietic stem/progenitor (HSPCs) cells transduced with oncogenic fusion genes are regarded as promising in vitromodels of their corresponding AML subtypes. Here, we critically assessed the potential of such in vitro models using an integrative bioinformatics approach. Surprisingly, we found that the gene-expression profiles of CD34+ human HSPCs transformed with the potent oncogenic fusion proteins AML-ETO or MLL-AF9, only weakly resembled those derived from primary AML samples.

It is well known that dasatinib may affect cellular immunity, which leads to the subsequent risk of a myriad of infections and viral reactivations, especially cytomegalovirus. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) is an opportunistic infection that typically occurs in immunocompromised hosts. Although pneumonia is not uncommon among dasatinib-treated patients, dasatinib-associated PJP has been reported only once in the literature, without a description of the clinical details. We report herein two cases of PJP in patients receiving treatment containing dasatinib. One patient developed PJP at 7 months following dasatinib in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The other patient developed pleural effusion and PJP at 2 years following dasatinib treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia. Both patients recovered well after management with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Our experience illustrates that PJP is a potentially important complication of dasatinib-based treatment. Raising clinical awareness is important as prompt diagnosis and timely management are the cornerstones of successful treatment.","['Chang, Hung', 'Hung, Yu-Shin', 'Chou, Wen-Chi']","['Chang H', 'Hung YS', 'Chou WC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, 5 Fu-Shing Street, Kweishan Township, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan; School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Kweishan Township, Taoyuan Taiwan.

Cases included a large pancreatic pseudocyst, secondary to underlying acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and two large collections of loculated ascites due to metastatic ovarian and cervical cancer, respectively. Technical success in inserting the new stents was achieved in all three patients, and resulted in symptomatic relief. There were no clinically significant complications directly attributed to the stents.

A 74-year-old male was diagnosed with peritoneal metastasis from CRC in July 2011. The patient received nine cycles of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and OXP (mFOLFOX-6 regimen) and three cycles of 5-FU and LV only, resulting in a clinical complete response. However, recurrence of CRC was detected by CT within 3 months after the last course of chemotherapy. In April 2013, laboratory tests showed pancytopenia and 15% blast cells. A bone marrow examination revealed multilineage dysplasia and 20.4% myeloblasts. Cytogenetic analysis indicated a complex karyotype that included chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities. The patient was diagnosed with TRL and treated with a combination of azacitidine (AZA) and cetuximab (Cmab) for both cancers. AZA might be useful in TRL when a patient needs to be treated simultaneously for more than one primary cancer because of its low toxicity.

These are classified as primary (central or surface) and secondary osteosarcomas arising in preexisting conditions.

X-ray chest can detect metastasis in the lungs, but computerized tomography (CT) scan of the thorax is more helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lesion delineates its extent into the soft tissues, the medullary canal, the joint, skip lesions and the proximity of the tumor to the neurovascular structures. Tc99 bone scan detects the osseous metastases. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is used for metastatic workup and/or local recurrence after resection. The role of biochemical markers like alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase is pertinent for prognosis and treatment response.

Understanding how gene regulation is affected by such aberrations is of utmost importance. One promising strategy toward this objective is to compute whether signals can reach to the transcription factors through the transcription regulatory network (TRN). Due to the uncertainty of the regulatory interactions, this is a #P-complete problem and thus solving it for very large TRNs remains to be a challenge. RESULTS: We develop a novel and scalable method to compute the probability that a signal originating at any given set of source genes can arrive at any given set of target genes (i.e., transcription factors) when the topology of the underlying signaling network is uncertain. Our method tackles this problem for large networks while providing a provably accurate result. Our method follows a divide-and-conquer strategy. We break down the given network into a sequence of non-overlapping subnetworks such that reachability can be computed autonomously and sequentially on each subnetwork. We represent each interaction using a small polynomial. The product of these polynomials express different scenarios when a signal can or cannot reach to target genes from the source genes. We introduce polynomial collapsing operators for each subnetwork. These operators reduce the size of the resulting polynomial and thus the computational complexity dramatically. We show that our method scales to entire human regulatory networks in only seconds, while the existing methods fail beyond a few tens of genes and interactions. We demonstrate that our method can successfully characterize key reachability characteristics of the entire transcriptions regulatory networks of patients affected by eight different subtypes of leukemia, as well as those from healthy control samples.

Recent studies have quantified this intra-tumor heterogeneity by clustering mutations into subpopulations according to the observed counts of DNA sequencing reads containing the variant allele. However, these clustering approaches do not consider that the population frequencies of different tumor subpopulations are correlated by their shared ancestry in the same population of cells. RESULTS: We introduce the binary tree partition (BTP), a novel combinatorial formulation of the problem of constructing the subpopulations of tumor cells from the variant allele frequencies of somatic mutations. We show that finding a BTP is an NP-complete problem; derive an approximation algorithm for an optimization version of the problem; and present a recursive algorithm to find a BTP with errors in the input. We show that the resulting algorithm outperforms existing clustering approaches on simulated and real sequencing data.

However the vast majority of ncRNAs still have no functional annotation. One prominent approach for putative function assignment is clustering of transcripts according to sequence and secondary structure. However sequence information is changed by post-transcriptional modifications, and secondary structure is only a proxy for the true 3D conformation of the RNA polymer. A different type of information that does not suffer from these issues and that can be used for the detection of RNA classes, is the pattern of processing and its traces in small RNA-seq reads data. Here we introduce BlockClust, an efficient approach to detect transcripts with similar processing patterns. We propose a novel way to encode expression profiles in compact discrete structures, which can then be processed using fast graph-kernel techniques. We perform both unsupervised clustering and develop family specific discriminative models; finally we show how the proposed approach is scalable, accurate and robust across different organisms, tissues and cell lines.

Additional studies have provided greater understanding of the cells responsible for leukemia initiation, referred to as leukemia stem cells. Emerging evidence indicates that STATs are important in maintaining leukemia stem cells and represent a promising target for eradication of this dangerous cell population. Here we summarize what is known about normal hematopoietic stem cells and the origin of leukemic stem cells.

In contrast, RAS pathway activating mutations occurred in 50% of cases, a significantly higher frequency than other acute myeloid leukaemias and higher than previously reported.

This study focuses on Mpl trafficking and Jak2 association using two model systems: human erythroleukemia cells (HEL; JAK2V617F) and K562 myeloid leukemia cells (JAK2WT). Consistent with a putative chaperone role for Jak2, Mpl and Jak2 associate on both intracellular and plasma membranes (shown by proximity ligation assay) and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Jak2 led to Mpl trapping in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Even in Jak2 sufficient cells, Mpl accumulates in punctate structures that partially colocalize with ER-tracker, the ER exit site marker (ERES) Sec31a, the autophagy marker LC3 and LAMP1. Mpl was fused to miniSOG, a genetically encoded tag for correlated light and electron microscopy. Results suggest that a fraction of Mpl is taken up into autophagic structures from the ER and routed to autolyososomes. Surface biotinylation shows that both immature and mature Mpl reach the cell surface; in K562 cells Mpl is also released in exosomes. Both forms rapidly internalize upon ligand addition, while recovery is primarily attributed to immature Mpl. Mpl appears to reach the plasma membrane via both conventional ER-Golgi and autolysosome secretory pathways, as well as recycling.","['Cleyrat, Cedric', 'Darehshouri, Anza', 'Steinkamp, Mara P', 'Vilaine, Mathias', 'Boassa, Daniela', 'Ellisman, Mark H', 'Hermouet, Sylvie', 'Wilson, Bridget S']","['Cleyrat C', 'Darehshouri A', 'Steinkamp MP', 'Vilaine M', 'Boassa D', 'Ellisman MH', 'Hermouet S', 'Wilson BS']","['Department of Pathology & Cancer Center, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA; INSERM UMR892/CNRS UMR6299, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie Nantes-Angers (CRCNA), Institut de Recherche Therapeutique-Universite de Nantes, Nantes, 44000, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Traffic,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",100939340,"['0 (LAMP1 protein, human)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (SEC31A protein, human)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Exosomes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*metabolism', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/metabolism']",2014/06/17 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/06/17 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tra.12185 [doi]'],ppublish,Traffic. 2014 Sep;15(9):961-82. doi: 10.1111/tra.12185.

There is evidence that imatinib can induce cardiotoxicity in cancer patients. Our hypothesis is that imatinib alters calcium regulatory mechanisms and can contribute to development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were treated with clinical doses (low: 2 muM; high: 5 muM) of imatinib and assessed for molecular changes. Imatinib increased peak systolic Ca(2+) and Ca(2+) transient decay rates and Western analysis revealed significant increases in phosphorylation of phospholamban (Thr-17) and the ryanodine receptor (Ser-2814), signifying activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Imatinib significantly increased NRVM volume as assessed by Coulter counter, myocyte surface area, and atrial natriuretic peptide abundance seen by Western. Imatinib induced cell death, but did not activate the classical apoptotic program as assessed by caspase-3 cleavage, indicating a necrotic mechanism of death in myocytes. We expressed AdNFATc3-green fluorescent protein in NRVMs and showed imatinib treatment significantly increased nuclear factor of activated T cells translocation that was inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 or CaMKII inhibitors. CONCLUSION: These data show that imatinib can activate pathological hypertrophic signaling pathways by altering intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics. This is likely a contributing mechanism for the adverse cardiac effects of imatinib.","['Barr, Larry A', 'Makarewich, Catherine A', 'Berretta, Remus M', 'Gao, Hui', 'Troupes, Constantine D', 'Woitek, Felix', 'Recchia, Fabio', 'Kubo, Hajime', 'Force, Thomas', 'Houser, Steven R']","['Barr LA', 'Makarewich CA', 'Berretta RM', 'Gao H', 'Troupes CD', 'Woitek F', 'Recchia F', 'Kubo H', 'Force T', 'Houser SR']","['Cardiovascular Research Center, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Transl Sci,Clinical and translational science,101474067,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Calcineurin/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cardiomegaly/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Heart Ventricles/cytology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",2014/06/17 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/06/17 06:00'],"['2014/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cts.12173 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Sci. 2014 Oct;7(5):360-7. doi: 10.1111/cts.12173.

In this study, we first evaluated the impact of the cell composition of a modified DLI (mDLI) on the prognoses of patients. A total of 194 patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled and received mDLI for various clinical reasons. The infused cellular components of the mDLI were examined by flow cytometry. The results showed that infusion with a lower dose of CD14(+) cells (<0.33 x 10(8) /kg) was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (HR = 0.104, p = 0.032) in human leukoctye antigen-identical transplant patients. In addition, a dose of CD14(+) cells greater than the 50th percentile was associated with a lower incidence of hematological relapse and longer disease-free survival (DFS) after the mDLI (relapse: HR = 0.193, p = 0.007; DFS: HR = 0.259, p = 0.016).

We show that the SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP3 controls H3K4 methylation by regulating histone-modifying SET1/MLL complexes. SET1/MLL complexes are composed of a histone methyltransferase and the regulatory components WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30. MLL1/MLL2 complexes contain menin as additional component and are particularly important for the activation of HOX genes. We demonstrate that SENP3 is associated with MLL1/MLL2 complexes and catalyzes deSUMOylation of RbBP5. This is required for activation of a subset of HOX genes, including the developmental regulator DLX3. In the absence of SENP3, the association of menin and Ash2L with the DLX3 gene is impaired, leading to decreased H3K4 methylation and reduced recruitment of active RNA polymerase II. Importantly, the SENP3-DLX3 pathway dictates osteogenic differentiation of human stem cells, thus delineating the importance of balanced SUMOylation for epigenetic control of gene expression programs.","['Nayak, Arnab', 'Viale-Bouroncle, Sandra', 'Morsczeck, Christian', 'Muller, Stefan']","['Nayak A', 'Viale-Bouroncle S', 'Morsczeck C', 'Muller S']","['Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University, Faculty of Medicine, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University, Faculty of Medicine, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.

In this study, we explored their biodistribution by labeling CIK cells with (18)F-FDG and tracking their in vivo migration by PET/CT imaging. In the nine refractory APL patients enrolled in this study, pre-treatment PET/CT scans revealed leukemia burdens in vertebrae, and the bones of the pelvis and limbs. Post-treatment serial PET/CT tracked the localization of CIK cells over time: at 1 h, the majority of these cells accumulated diffusely in the lungs, while the first minor cell activities were observed in brain, liver and spleen; at 4 and 8 h, they not only migrated to the heart, spleen, and liver, but also showed tendencies to accumulate in bone marrow and brain. This specific cell migration route suggested that CIK cells show in vivo functional kinesis and potency as a targeted immunotherapy. The clinical outcome of this small cohort of nine patients supported the efficacy of this regimen: two patients achieved rapid complete remission after three-cycle treatment, and six patients remained stable, subsequently became sensitive to conventional therapy, and also achieved complete remission.","['Wang, Hong', 'Cao, Fenglin', 'Li, Jinmei', 'Li, Yong', 'Liu, Xiuhua', 'Wang, Lifan', 'Liu, Zhiyu', 'Li, Yang', 'Zhao, Hui', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Wang H', 'Cao F', 'Li J', 'Li Y', 'Liu X', 'Wang L', 'Liu Z', 'Li Y', 'Zhao H', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Hematology and Central Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150001, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Brain/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Cell Tracking/methods', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/cytology/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Liver/immunology/pathology', 'Lung/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pelvic Bones/immunology/pathology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Remission Induction', 'Spine/immunology/pathology', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/16 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/16 06:00'],"['2014/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1618-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Aug;100(2):165-70. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1618-7.

So far, there are no comprehensive descriptions reporting diagnosed cancer group that include hematological malignancies in Bangladesh. METHODS: This was a multi-center hospital-based retrospective descriptive study of over 5000 confirmed hematological cancer cases in between January 2008 to December 2012. Morphological typing was carried out using the ""French American British"" classification system. RESULTS: A total of 5013 patients aged between 2 to 90 years had been diagnosed with malignant hematological disorders. A 69.2% were males (n=3468) and 30.8% females (n=1545), with a male to female ratio of 2.2:1. The overall median age at diagnosis was 42 years. Acute myeloid leukemia was most frequent (28.3%) with a median age of 35 years, followed by chronic myeloid leukemia with 18.2% (median age 40 years), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (16.9%; median age 48 years), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (14.1%; median age 27 years), multiple myeloma (10.5%; median age 55 years), myelodysplastic syndromes (4.5%; median age 57 years) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (3.9%; median age 36 years). The least common was chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3.7%; median age 60 years). Below the age of 20 years, acute lymphoblastic leukemia was predominant (37.3%), followed by acute myeloid leukemia (34%). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma had mostly occurred among older patients, aged 50-over. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study presents the pattern and distribution of diagnosed hematological cancers in Bangladesh. It shows differences in population distributions as compared to other settings with possibly a lower presence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There might be under-reporting of affected women. Further studies are necessary on the epidemiology, genetics and potential environmental risk factors within this rapidly aging country.","['Hossain, Mohammad Sorowar', 'Iqbal, Mohd S', 'Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed', 'Rabbani, Mohammad Golam', 'Khatun, Hazera', 'Munira, Sirajam', 'Miah, M Morshed Zaman', 'Kabir, Amin Lutful', 'Islam, Naima', 'Dipta, Tashmim Farhana', 'Rahman, Farzana', 'Mottalib, Abdul', 'Afrose, Salma', 'Ara, Tasneem', 'Biswas, Akhil Ranjan', 'Rahman, Mizanur', 'Abedin, Akm Mustafa', 'Rahman, Mahbubur', 'Yunus, A B M', 'Niessen, Louis W', 'Sultana, Tanvira Afroze']","['Hossain MS', 'Iqbal MS', 'Khan MA', 'Rabbani MG', 'Khatun H', 'Munira S', 'Miah MM', 'Kabir AL', 'Islam N', 'Dipta TF', 'Rahman F', 'Mottalib A', 'Afrose S', 'Ara T', 'Biswas AR', 'Rahman M', 'Abedin AM', 'Rahman M', 'Yunus AB', 'Niessen LW', 'Sultana TA']","['BRAC University, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh. sorowar.hossain@bracu.ac.bd.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bangladesh', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*classification/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2014/06/16 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/16 06:00'],"['2013/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-438 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-438 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jun 14;14:438. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-438.,,20140614,,PMC4063230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sites commonly involved by EMH include the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and most commonly, paravertebral regions, although other sites can sometimes be involved. Physicians rarely consider EMH in their differential diagnosis even in cases where it is warranted (diseases of ineffective erythropoiesis).

In the present investigation, we studied the flower extracts of Jasminum sambac, Mammea siamensis, Mesua ferrea, Michelia alba, Mimusops elengi, and Nelumbo nucifera and speculated that these plants might influence metabolism and substance flow in the body. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolation of porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCECs) as well as multidrug-resistance CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells, MDA-M;B-231 breast cancer, U-251 brain tumor, and HCT-116 colon cancer cells were used. The calcein-acetoxymethylester (AM) assay was used to measure inhibition of P-glycoprotein transport. XTT and resazurin assays served for measuring cytotoxicity. RESULTS: The extracts revealed cytotoxicity towards CCRF-CEM leukemia cells to a different extent. The strongest growth inhibition was found for the n-hexane extracts of Mammea siamensis and Mesua ferrea, and the dichloromethane extracts of Mesua ferrea and Michelia alba. The flower extracts also inhibited P-glycoprotein function in porcine brain capillary endothelial cells and CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells, indicating modulation of the blood-brain barrier and multidrug resistance of tumors. Bioactivity-guided isolation of coumarins from Mammea siamensis flowers revealed considerable cytotoxicity of mammea A/AA, deacetylmammea E/BA and deacetylmammea E/BB towards human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, U-251 brain tumor, HCT-116 colon cancer, and CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: The plants analyzed may be valuable in developing novel treatment strategies to overcome the blood-brain barrier and multidrug-resistance in tumor cells mediated by P-glycoprotein.","['Noysang, Chanai', 'Mahringer, Anne', 'Zeino, Maen', 'Saeed, Mohamed', 'Luanratana, Omboon', 'Fricker, Gert', 'Bauer, Rudolf', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Noysang C', 'Mahringer A', 'Zeino M', 'Saeed M', 'Luanratana O', 'Fricker G', 'Bauer R', 'Efferth T']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, Karl-Franzens-University Graz, Graz, Austria; Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; Thai Traditional Medicine College, Rajamangala University of Technology Thayaburi, Phathumthani, Thailand.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Pharmacology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Pharmacology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, Karl-Franzens-University Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.

Studies in mice harboring alterations in TCR signaling proteins or transcriptional regulators have revealed an expanded population of CD4(+) innate T cells in the thymus that produce IL-4 and express the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF). In these mice, IL-4 produced by the CD4(+)PLZF(+) T cell population leads to the conversion of conventional CD8(+) thymocytes into innate CD8(+) T cells resembling memory T cells expressing eomesodermin. The expression of PLZF, the signature invariant NKT cell transcription factor, in these innate CD4(+) T cells suggests that they might be a subset of alphabeta or gammadelta TCR(+) NKT cells or mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. To address these possibilities, we characterized the CD4(+)PLZF(+) innate T cells in itk(-/-) mice. We show that itk(-/-) innate PLZF(+)CD4(+) T cells are not CD1d-dependent NKT cells, MR1-dependent MAIT cells, or gammadelta T cells. Furthermore, although the itk(-/-) innate PLZF(+)CD4(+) T cells express alphabeta TCRs, neither beta2-microglobulin-dependent MHC class I nor any MHC class II molecules are required for their development. In contrast to invariant NKT cells and MAIT cells, this population has a highly diverse TCRalpha-chain repertoire. Analysis of peripheral tissues indicates that itk(-/-) innate PLZF(+)CD4(+) T cells preferentially home to spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes owing to increased expression of gut-homing receptors, and that their expansion is regulated by commensal gut flora. These data support the conclusion that itk(-/-) innate PLZF(+)CD4(+) T cells are a novel subset of innate T cells.","['Prince, Amanda L', 'Watkin, Levi B', 'Yin, Catherine C', 'Selin, Liisa K', 'Kang, Joonsoo', 'Schwartzberg, Pamela L', 'Berg, Leslie J']","['Prince AL', 'Watkin LB', 'Yin CC', 'Selin LK', 'Kang J', 'Schwartzberg PL', 'Berg LJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; and.', 'National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20814.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; and Leslie.Berg@umassmed.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (emt protein-tyrosine kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD1d/immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*immunology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/immunology/metabolism']",2014/06/15 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/06/15 06:00'],"['2014/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1302058 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1302058 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Jul 15;193(2):673-87. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1302058.

By controlling cell growth and differentiation it plays an important role in tumor development. This paper describes a novel approach for detection and visualization of a panel of pTyr proteins in tumors using in situ proximity ligation assay. METHODS: K562 leukemia cells were treated with tyrosine kinase and/or phosphatase inhibitors to induce differences in pTyr levels and mimic cells with different malignant properties. Cells were then probed with one antibody against the pTyr modification and another probe against the detected protein, resulting in a detectable fluorescent signal once the probes were in proximity. RESULTS: Total and protein specific pTyr levels on ABL, SHC, ERK2 and PI3K proteins were detected and samples of control and treated cells were distinguished at the pTyr level using this novel approach. Promising results were also detected for formalin fixed and paraffin embedded cells in the micro array format. CONCLUSIONS: This application of in situ proximity ligation assay is valuable in order to study the pTyr modification of a panel of proteins in large data sets to validate mass spectrometric data and to be combined with tissue microarrays. The approach offers new opportunities to reveal the pTyr signatures in cells of different malignant properties that can be used as biomarker of disease in the future.","['Elfineh, Lioudmila', 'Classon, Christina', 'Asplund, Anna', 'Pettersson, Ulf', 'Kamali-Moghaddam, Masood', 'Lind, Sara Bergstrom']","['Elfineh L', 'Classon C', 'Asplund A', 'Pettersson U', 'Kamali-Moghaddam M', 'Lind SB']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. sara.lind@kemi.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,['42HK56048U (Tyrosine)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",2014/06/15 06:00,2015/03/10 06:00,['2014/06/15 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-435 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-435 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jun 13;14:435. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-435.,,20140613,,PMC4072613,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We suggest its full potential in therapy may not have been reached. In this paper, we contrast 6-TG and the more widely used 6-mercaptopurine; discuss 6-TG metabolism, pharmacokinetics, dosage and schedule; and summarize many of the early studies that have shown infrequent but nevertheless positive results with 6-TG treatment of cancers. We also consider studies that suggest that combinations of 6-TG with other agents may enhance antitumor effects. Although not yet tested in man, 6-TG has recently been proposed to treat a wide variety of cancers with a high frequency of homozygous deletion of the gene for methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), often codeleted with the adjacent tumor suppressor CDKN2A (p16). Among the cancers with a high frequency of MTAP deficiency are leukemias, lymphomas, mesothelioma, melanoma, biliary tract cancer, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and lung, pancreatic, and squamous cell carcinomas. The method involves pretreatment with the naturally occurring nucleoside methylthioadenosine (MTA), the substrate for the enzyme MTAP. MTA pretreatment protects normal host tissues, but not MTAP-deficient cancers, from 6-TG toxicity and permits administration of doses of 6-TG that are much higher than can now be safely administered. The combination of MTA/6-TG has produced substantial shrinkage or slowing of growth in two different xenograft human tumor models: lymphoblastic leukemia and metastatic prostate carcinoma with neuroendocrine features. Further development and a clinical trial of the proposed MTA/6-TG treatment of MTAP-deficient cancers seem warranted.","['Munshi, Pashna N', 'Lubin, Martin', 'Bertino, Joseph R']","['Munshi PN', 'Lubin M', 'Bertino JR']","['Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Departments of Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Departments of Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Departments of Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA bertinoj@cinj.rutgers.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,['FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Thioguanine/*therapeutic use']",2014/06/15 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/06/15 06:00'],"['2014/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2014-0178 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0178 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2014 Jul;19(7):760-5. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0178.

Research into the mechanisms of cellular transformation employed by FeLV and other oncogenic retroviruses has provided as much information on the regulation of eukaryotic cell growth and differentiation as it has about cancer. The recognition that a cancer has a viral cause opens up the possibility of novel treatments that spare the host from cytotoxic side-effects by specifically targeting the virus, or the host's immune response to it. The ultimate prize for viral-associated cancers is their prevention. Vaccination and changes in management practices have seen the global prevalence of FeLV infection fall and, with it, the incidence of FeLV-related cancers. Remarkably, in the face of this success, the prevalence of feline lymphoma remains high. At least one other virus, the lentivirus feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), accounts for some of these cases. Transformation by FIV involves incompletely understood mechanisms that are distinct from those employed by FeLV. This review will focus on the current understanding of FeLV-associated and FIV-associated lymphoma and consider whether yet more viral aetiologies could be waiting to be discovered.","['Beatty, Julia']",['Beatty J'],"['Valentine Charlton Cat Centre, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

METHODS: The KBM7 cells were treated with 50, 100 and 200 mumol/L quercetin for 48 h respectively. And then the trypan blue assay was used to examine the proliferative inhibition of quercetin. Apoptotic cells and cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Quercetin significantly inhibited KBM7 cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and blocked cell cycle at G1 phase, which were in dose-dependent manners. The mRNA and protein expression of Smoothened and Glioma1 (Gli1), the members of Hh pathway decreased after treatment with quercetin. The Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1, targets of Hh signaling, also decreased after treatment with quercetin, respectively. Quercetin also could increase p53 and Caspase-3 expression. Bcr-abl mRNA copies decreased, but no changes of phosphorylated Bcr-abl and Bcr-abl proteins were observed, after treatment with quercetin.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of South Korean children was conducted using data collected by the national birth register between 1995 and 2006; these data were then individually linked to death data. A cohort of 6,479,406 children was followed from birth until either their death or until December 31, 2006. For surrogate measures of pesticide exposure, we used residence at birth, paternal occupation, and month of conception from the birth certificate. Farming and pesticide exposure indexes by county were calculated using information derived from the 2000 agricultural census. Poisson regression analyses were used to calculate rate ratios (RRs) of childhood leukemia deaths according to indices of exposure to agricultural pesticides after adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: In total 585 leukemia deaths were observed during the study period. Childhood leukemia mortality was significantly elevated in children born in rural areas (RR=1.43, 95%CI 1.09-1.86) compared to those in metropolises, and in counties with both the highest farming index (RR=1.33, 95%CI 1.04-1.69) and pesticide exposure index (RR=1.30, 95%CI 1.02-1.66) compared to those in the reference group. However, exposure-response associations were significant only in relation to the farming index. When the analyses were limited to rural areas, the risk of death from leukemia among boys conceived between spring and fall increased over those conceived in winter. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show an increase in mortality from childhood leukemia in rural areas; however, further studies are warranted to investigate the environmental factors contributing to the excess mortality from childhood leukemia in rural areas.","['Cha, Eun Shil', 'Hwang, Seung-sik', 'Lee, Won Jin']","['Cha ES', 'Hwang SS', 'Lee WJ']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, South Korea.', 'Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Inha University School of Medicine, South Korea.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, South Korea.

The gain of function mutation JAK3(A572V) is found in acute megakaryoplastic leukemia. Replacement of ATP coordinating lysine by alanine yields inactive JAK3(K855A). Most recent observations revealed the capacity of JAK3 to regulate ion transport. This study thus explored whether JAK3 regulates glutamate transporters EAAT1-4, carriers accomplishing transport of glutamate and aspartate in a variety of cells including intestinal cells, renal cells, glial cells, and neurons. To this end, EAAT1, 2, 3, or 4 were expressed in Xenopus oocytes with or without additional expression of mouse wild-type JAK3, constitutively active JAK3(A568V) or inactive JAK3(K851A), and electrogenic glutamate transport was determined by dual electrode voltage clamp. Moreover, Ussing chamber was employed to determine electrogenic glutamate transport in intestine from mice lacking functional JAK3 (jak3(-/-)) and from corresponding wild-type mice (jak3(+/+)). As a result, in EAAT1, 2, 3, or 4 expressing oocytes, but not in oocytes injected with water, addition of glutamate to extracellular bath generated an inward current (Ig), which was significantly increased following coexpression of JAK3. Ig in oocytes expressing EAAT3 was further increased by JAK3(A568V) but not by JAK3(K851A). Ig in EAAT3 + JAK3 expressing oocytes was significantly decreased by JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P154 (22 microM). Kinetic analysis revealed that JAK3 increased maximal Ig and significantly reduced the glutamate concentration required for half maximal Ig (Km). Intestinal electrogenic glutamate transport was significantly lower in jak3(-/-) than in jak3(+/+) mice. In conclusion, JAK3 is a powerful regulator of excitatory amino acid transporter isoforms.","['Warsi, Jamshed', 'Luo, Dong', 'Elvira, Bernat', 'Jilani, Kashif', 'Shumilina, Ekaterina', 'Hosseinzadeh, Zohreh', 'Lang, Florian']","['Warsi J', 'Luo D', 'Elvira B', 'Jilani K', 'Shumilina E', 'Hosseinzadeh Z', 'Lang F']","['Department of Physiology I, University of Tuebingen, Gmelinstr. 5, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport System X-AG)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Transport System X-AG/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Glutamic Acid/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 3/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oocytes/*metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', '*Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation', 'Xenopus laevis']",2014/06/15 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/06/15 06:00'],"['2014/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00232-014-9695-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 2014 Aug;247(8):713-20. doi: 10.1007/s00232-014-9695-3.

We analyzed the clinicoradiological features, treatments, and outcomes in NL patients. METHODS: We identified six patients with NL seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from 01/2010 to 10/2012. We extracted clinical presentations, imagings, CSF cytology, and electrodiagnostic studies from medical records. One patient had a nerve biopsy. We defined therapy response as clinical improvement of neurological deficits. FINDINGS: The mean age at onset was 57.1 years. Most were predominantly men with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) was positive in five patients. Nerve conduction demonstrated mononeuritis multiplex, plexopathy, demyelination, and axonal polyradiculoneuropathy, whereas electromyography was nonspecific. All patients received systemic chemotherapy, four intrathecal chemotherapy, and three intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange or both. One patient who received intravenous immunoglobulin showed mild neurological improvement. Two patients responded, and the median overall survival was 15 months. CONCLUSIONS: NL is an increasingly recognized complication of NHL and leukemia. A high clinical suspicion is necessary for correct diagnosis. In the present series, patients with leukemia had mononeuritis multiplex, whereas those with lymphoma had plexopathy. Electrodiagnosis and PET scans were useful diagnostic tools. No factors correlated with poorer prognosis. International collaborative studies will help to better determine the risk factors of NL, response to treatment and outcomes.","['Kamiya-Matsuoka, Carlos', 'Shroff, Sheetal', 'Gildersleeve, Kasey', 'Hormozdi, Bahram', 'Manning, John T', 'Woodman, Karin H']","['Kamiya-Matsuoka C', 'Shroff S', 'Gildersleeve K', 'Hormozdi B', 'Manning JT', 'Woodman KH']","['Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Neurology, The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, TX, USA.

This study investigated the effects of a miRNA binding site polymorphism (rs1051296) in solute carrier family 19, member 1 (SLC19A1) on serum methotrexate (MTX) concentrations in Chinese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Genotyping for SLC19A1 rs1051296 G>T in 131 children with ALL was performed using the Sequenom MassArray system. A total of 131 patients received high-dose MTX treatment, and serum MTX concentrations were measured by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay 24 (MTX C24h) and 42 h (MTX C42h) after administration. The frequency of the rs1051296 T allele observed in this study (46.2 %) was significantly lower than that previously observed in a European population (60.7 %, P = 0.002). There was significant association between rs1051296 G>T and MTX C24h (29.97, 32.34, and 39.01 micromol/L for GG, GT, and TT genotypes, respectively, P = 0.04). The percentage of patients with an MTX concentration above the therapeutic threshold (40 mumol/L) was significantly lower in GG carriers compared with that in GT and TT carriers (8.6 % for GG genotype vs. 26.8 and 40.0 % for CT and TT genotypes, respectively, P = 0.02). Delayed elimination of MTX (C42h > 1 mumol/L) was less frequent in GG carriers than in GT and TT carriers. Rs1051296 G>T was associated with MTX plasma concentration, suggesting that miRNAs might be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of SLC19A1.","['Wang, Shu-mei', 'Sun, Lu-lu', 'Zeng, Wei-xin', 'Wu, Wan-shui', 'Zhang, Guo-liang']","['Wang SM', 'Sun LL', 'Zeng WX', 'Wu WS', 'Zhang GL']","['Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/therapeutic use', 'Asians/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*blood/therapeutic use', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/06/15 06:00,2015/07/25 06:00,['2014/06/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0062-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Jul;31(7):62. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0062-0.

Dual color, dual fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) patterns are instrumental in identifying the genesis of these CT, but their prognostic implications remain controversial. The most common mechanism is a two-step process in which a standard two-way translocation (9;22) is followed by subsequent rearrangements involving other chromosomes. The second common mechanism is the one-step process wherein breakage occurs simultaneously on different chromosomes leading to CT. The typical D-FISH pattern seen with the one-step mechanism is 1F2G2R, while the pattern for the two-step mechanism can be variable (2F1G1R, 1F1G1R, 1F1G2R, 1F2G1R, etc.). We have studied 4 cases of CT using metaphase FISH with triple color, dual fusion ASS1, ABL1 and BCR probes to understand the genesis of these CT. All the patients were treated with imatinib, but only patients 3 and 4 showed remission. Our results indicate that the CT in cases 1, 3 and 4 arose from a one-step mechanism and case 2 from a multi-step mechanism. Response to imatinib varied from full remission to no response.

Jerantinine A, a novel Aspidosperma alkaloid isolated from plant species Tabernaemontana corymbosa, was previously reported to possess cytotoxic activity against vincristine-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and is therefore an ideal candidate for biological investigation. Furthermore, Tabernaemontana corymbosa, has been placed in the endangered list of threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature thus making it a priority to elucidate the biological activity of this alkaloid. Herein, we report detailed biological evaluation of jerantinine A on various human-derived carcinoma cell lines. Our preliminary screens showed that significant inhibition of cell growth and colony formation accompanied time- and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in human cancer cell lines after treatment with jerantinine A. Dose-dependent accumulations of cleaved PARP and caspase 3 further confirmed apoptosis. Profound G2/M cell cycle arrest was observed 24 h after treatment in all cell lines. Characteristics of mitotic arrest including inhibition of tubulin polymerisation, microtubule disruption, aneuploidy, and cyclin B1 down-regulation were clearly observed.

Among these, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have well-characterized roles in antibacterial and antiviral immunity. In the present study, the effects of ionizing radiation on the expression of TLRs and cellular responses to ligands were investigated in THP1 monocytes (human monocytic leukemia cells) and THP1-derived macrophage cells (macrophage-like cells), which are induced by culturing in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. TLR2 and TLR4 expression was detected in THP1 and macrophage-like cells. X-irradiation caused increased expression of these TLRs in THP1 and decreased expression in macrophage-like cells. Responses to FSL-1 (TLR2 ligand) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, TLR4 ligand) were estimated by determining the induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). After FSL-1 or LPS stimulation, TNF-alpha induction was greater in X-irradiated THP1 monocytes than in non-irradiated cells. However, although TNF-alpha expression was not affected by X-irradiation in macrophage-like cells, the expression of LPS-inducible interferon-beta was lower following X-irradiation of macrophage-like cells. To clarify the mechanisms of TLR2 and TLR4 regulation by X-irradiation, expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase was investigated. These experiments showed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediated increases in TLR expression in X-irradiated THP1 monocytes and decreases in TLR expression in X-irradiated macrophage-like cells. This study demonstrates that ionizing radiation modulates ligand-responsive TLR expression through the JNK pathway, depending on differentiation state.","['Yoshino, Hironori', 'Chiba, Kanae', 'Saitoh, Takahiro', 'Kashiwakura, Ikuo']","['Yoshino H', 'Chiba K', 'Saitoh T', 'Kashiwakura I']","['Department of Radiological Life Sciences, Division of Medical Life Sciences, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 66-1 Hon-cho, Hirosaki, Aomori 036-8564, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Life Sciences, Division of Medical Life Sciences, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 66-1 Hon-cho, Hirosaki, Aomori 036-8564, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Life Sciences, Division of Medical Life Sciences, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 66-1 Hon-cho, Hirosaki, Aomori 036-8564, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Life Sciences, Division of Medical Life Sciences, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, 66-1 Hon-cho, Hirosaki, Aomori 036-8564, Japan ikashi@cc.hirosaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,"['0 (Receptors, Pattern Recognition)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Receptors, Pattern Recognition/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*metabolism']",2014/06/15 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/06/15 06:00'],"['2014/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['rru040 [pii]', '10.1093/jrr/rru040 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2014 Sep;55(5):876-84. doi: 10.1093/jrr/rru040.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 54 children who were diagnosed with AML between July 2009 and April 2012 and who underwent bone marrow biopsy at diagnosis. The expression of SIRT1 in bone marrow was measured by immunohistochemistry. The 54 patients were divided into two groups according to the expression of SIRT1: SIRT1-negative (n=10) and SIRT1-positive (n=44). The SIRT1-positive group was further divided into three subgroups: SIRT1(+) (n=8), SIRT1(++) (n=7) and SIRT1(+++) (n=29) according to the expression levels of SIRT1. Cox multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the unfavorable factors for long survival in children with AML. RESULTS: The SIRT1(+++) subgroup had a significantly higher mortality than the SIRT1-negative group (P<0.05). Compared with the SIRT1-negative group, the SIRT1-positive group had a significantly lower 2-year overall survival rate (P<0.05) and a significantly lower 2-year event-free survival rate (P<0.05). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that positive expression of SIRT1 was an unfavorable factor for long-term survival in children with AML, with a risk coefficient of 2.071 (95% CI: 1.017-4.219; P=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 is overexpressed in some of pediatric AML patients, and the overexpression of SIRT1 is associated with poor prognosis.","['Liu, Xiao-Ming', 'Zhou, Jian-Feng', 'Zhang, Pei-Hong', 'Ruan, Min', 'Zhang, Li', 'Zou, Yao', 'Chen, Yu-Mei', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Liu XM', 'Zhou JF', 'Zhang PH', 'Ruan M', 'Zhang L', 'Zou Y', 'Chen YM', 'Zhu XF']","['Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking University Mediacal Colloge, Tianjin 300020, China. xfzhu1981@126.com.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sirtuin 1/*analysis', 'Survival Rate']",2014/06/14 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2014.06.011 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2014 Jun;16(6):614-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibody-based targeted therapies for myeloma patients could make use of the HM1.24 antigen (CD317), a surface molecule overexpressed on malignant plasma cells and efficiently internalized. Here, a novel immunotoxin, HM1.24-ETA', is described. HM1.24-ETA' was generated by genetic fusion of a CD317-specific single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody and a truncated variant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA'). HM1.24-ETA' inhibited growth of interleukin 6 (IL-6)-dependent and -independent myeloma cell lines. Half-maximal growth inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 0.3 nM. Target cell killing occurred via induction of apoptosis and was unaffected in co-culture experiments with bone marrow stromal cells. HM1.24-ETA' efficiently triggered apoptosis of freshly isolated/cryopreserved cells of patients with plasma cell leukemia and MM and was active in a preclinical severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse xenograft model. Importantly, HM1.24-ETA' was not cytotoxic against CD317-positive cells from healthy tissue (monocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells). These results indicate that CD317 may represent a promising target structure for specific and efficient immunotoxin therapy for patients with plasma cell tumors.","['Staudinger, M', 'Glorius, P', 'Burger, R', 'Kellner, C', 'Klausz, K', 'Gunther, A', 'Repp, R', 'Klapper, W', 'Gramatzki, M', 'Peipp, M']","['Staudinger M', 'Glorius P', 'Burger R', 'Kellner C', 'Klausz K', 'Gunther A', 'Repp R', 'Klapper W', 'Gramatzki M', 'Peipp M']","['Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, 2nd Department of Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BST2 protein, human)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/chemistry/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Bacterial Toxins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Epitopes', 'Exotoxins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/immunology', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Virulence Factors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/06/14 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201438 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2014.38 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2014 Jun 13;4:e219. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2014.38.,,20140613,,PMC4080209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, CD33 and CD123 expression on AML blasts was studied by flow cytometry in a cohort of 319 patients with detailed information on French-American-British/World Health Organization (FAB/WHO) classification, cytogenetics and molecular aberrations. AMLs of 87.8% express CD33 and would therefore be targetable with anti-CD33 therapies. Additionally, 9.4% of AMLs express CD123 without concomitant CD33 expression. Thus, nearly all AMLs could be either targeted via CD33 or CD123. Simultaneous presence of both antigens was observed in 69.5% of patients. Most importantly, even AMLs with adverse cytogenetics express CD33 and CD123 levels comparable to those with favorable and intermediate subtypes. Some patient groups with unfavorable alterations, such as FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations, high FLT3-ITD mutant/wild-type ratios and monosomy 5 are even characterized by high expression of CD33 and CD123. In addition, blasts of patients with mutant nucleophosmin (NPM1) revealed significantly higher CD33 and CD123 expression pointing toward the possibility of minimal residual disease-guided interventions in mutated NPM1-positive AMLs. These results stimulate the development of novel concepts to redirect immune effector cells toward CD33- and CD123-expressing blasts using bi-specific antibodies or engineered T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors.","['Ehninger, A', 'Kramer, M', 'Rollig, C', 'Thiede, C', 'Bornhauser, M', 'von Bonin, M', 'Wermke, M', 'Feldmann, A', 'Bachmann, M', 'Ehninger, G', 'Oelschlagel, U']","['Ehninger A', 'Kramer M', 'Rollig C', 'Thiede C', 'Bornhauser M', 'von Bonin M', 'Wermke M', 'Feldmann A', 'Bachmann M', 'Ehninger G', 'Oelschlagel U']","[""Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/enzymology/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Risk Factors', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*biosynthesis', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/blood/genetics']",2014/06/14 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201439 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2014.39 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2014 Jun 13;4:e218. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2014.39.,,20140613,,PMC4080210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NUP98-NSD1 fusion protein occurs in a highly aggressive subtype of acute myeloid leukemia after rearrangement of the genes NUP98 and NSD1. The methyltransferase activity of NSD1 is retained in the fusion, and it gives rise to abnormally high levels of methylation at lysine 36 on histone 3, enforcing oncogene activation. Therefore, inhibition of the methyltransferase activity of NUP98-NSD1 may be considered a viable therapeutic strategy. Here, we report the development and validation of a highly sensitive and robust luminescence-based assay for NSD1 and other methyltransferases that use S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. The assay quantifies S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is produced during methyl transfer from SAM. SAH is converted enzymatically to adenosine monophosphate (AMP); in the process, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is consumed and the amount of ATP remaining is measured using a luminescent assay kit. The assay was validated by pilot high-throughput screening (HTS), dose-response confirmation of hits, and elimination of artifacts through counterscreening against SAH detection in the absence of NSD1. The known methyltransferase inhibitor suramin was identified, and profiled for selectivity against the histone methyltransferases EZH2, SETD7, and PRMT1. HTS using the luminescent NSD1 assay described here has the potential to deliver selective NSD1 inhibitors that may serve as leads in the development of targeted therapies for NUP98-NSD1-driven leukemias.","['Drake, Katherine M', 'Watson, Venita G', 'Kisielewski, Anne', 'Glynn, Rebecca', 'Napper, Andrew D']","['Drake KM', 'Watson VG', 'Kisielewski A', 'Glynn R', 'Napper AD']","['High-Throughput Screening and Drug Discovery Lab, Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, A I duPont Hospital for Children , Wilmington, Delaware.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,Assay Drug Dev Technol,Assay and drug development technologies,101151468,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Assays/*methods', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*analysis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements/*methods', 'Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2014/06/14 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/adt.2014.583 [doi]'],ppublish,Assay Drug Dev Technol. 2014 Jun;12(5):258-71. doi: 10.1089/adt.2014.583.,['R01 CA191077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC4060815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now demonstrate that three-dimensional (3D) cultures of alginate-encapsulated mESCs cultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor can be differentially driven toward definitive erythropoiesis and cardiomyogenesis in the absence of ELC formation. Three groups were evaluated: mESCs in maintenance medium with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, control) and mESCs cultured with HepG2 CM (CM1 and CM2). Control and CM1 groups were cultivated for 8 days in early differentiation medium with murine stem cell factor (mSCF) followed by 10 days in hematopoietic differentiation medium (HDM) containing human erythropoietin, m-interleukin (mIL)-3, and mSCF. CM2 cells were cultured for 18 days in HDM, bypassing early differentiation. In CM1, a fivefold expansion of hematopoietic colonies was observed at day 14, with enhancement of erythroid progenitors, hematopoietic genes (Gata-2 and SCL), erythroid genes (EKLF and beta-major globin), and proteins (Gata-1 and beta-globin), although zeta-globin was not expressed. In contrast, CM2 primarily produced beating colonies in standard hematopoietic colony assay and expressed early cardiomyogenic markers, anti-sarcomeric alpha-actinin and Gata-4. In conclusion, a scalable, automatable, integrated, 3D bioprocess for the differentiation of mESC toward definitive erythroblasts has been established. Interestingly, cardiomyogenesis was also directed in a specific protocol with HepG2 CM and hematopoietic cytokines making this platform a useful tool for the study of erythroid and cardiomyogenic development.","['Fauzi, Iliana', 'Panoskaltsis, Nicki', 'Mantalaris, Athanasios']","['Fauzi I', 'Panoskaltsis N', 'Mantalaris A']","['1 Biological Systems Engineering Laboratory , Department of Chemical Engineering and Chemical Technology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Alginates)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Hexuronic Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '0 (zeta-Globins)', '25852-47-5 (Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate)', '8A5D83Q4RW (Glucuronic Acid)']",IM,"['Alginates/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Glucuronic Acid/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hexuronic Acids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Muscle Development/*physiology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'beta-Globins/metabolism', 'zeta-Globins/metabolism']",2014/06/14 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2014.0105 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2014 Nov 15;23(22):2720-9. doi: 10.1089/scd.2014.0105.

Obesity has also been shown to impact hematological malignancies, through as yet unknown mechanisms. Adipocytes are present in bone marrow and the microenvironments of many types of cancer, and have been found to promote cancer cell survival. In this review, we explore several ways in which obesity might cause leukemia treatment resistance. Obese patients may be at a treatment disadvantage due to altered pharmacokinetics of chemotherapy and dosage ""capping"" based on ideal body weight. The adipose tissue provides fuel to cancer cells in the form of amino acids and free fatty acids. Adipocytes have been shown to cause cancer cells to resist chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In addition, obese adipose tissue is phenotypically altered, producing a milieu of pro-inflammatory adipokines and cytokines, some of which have been linked to cancer progression. Given the prevalence of obesity, understanding its role and adipose tissue in acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment is necessary for evaluating current treatment regimen and revealing new therapeutic targets.","['Sheng, Xia', 'Mittelman, Steven D']","['Sheng X', 'Mittelman SD']","[""Diabetes and Obesity Program, Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles , Los Angeles, CA , USA ; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, CA , USA."", ""Diabetes and Obesity Program, Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles , Los Angeles, CA , USA ; Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, CA , USA ; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, CA , USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,2014/06/14 06:00,2014/06/14 06:01,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2014.00053 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2014 Jun 5;2:53. doi: 10.3389/fped.2014.00053. eCollection 2014.,,20140605,,PMC4046266,['NOTNLM'],"['adipocytes', 'apoptosis', 'drug resistance', 'leukemia', 'lipolysis', 'obesity', 'pharmacokinetics', 'tumor microenvironments']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In pathological situations, RMGs execute protective and regenerative effects, but they can also contribute to neurodegeneration. It has recently been recognized that cultured primary RMGs secrete pro-survival factors for retinal neurons for up to 2 weeks in culture, but this ability is lost when RMGs are cultivated for longer durations. In our study, we investigated RMG supernatants for novel neuroprotective factors using a quantitative proteomic approach. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) was used on primary porcine RMGs. Supernatants of RMGs cultivated for 2 weeks were compared with supernatants from cells that had already lost their protective capacity. Using this approach, we detected established neurotrophic factors such as transferrin, osteopontin, and leukemia inhibitory factor and identified C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) as a novel candidate neuroprotective factor. All factors prolonged photoreceptor survival in vitro. Ex vivo treatment of retinal explants with leukemia inhibitory factor or CXCL10 demonstrated a neuroprotective effect on photoreceptors. Western blots on CXCL10- and leukemia inhibitory factor-stimulated explanted retina and photoreceptor lysates indicated activation of pro-survival signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling and B-cell lymphoma pathways. These findings suggest that CXCL10 contributes to the supportive potential of RMGs toward retinal neurons.","['von Toerne, Christine', 'Menzler, Jacob', 'Ly, Alice', 'Senninger, Nicole', 'Ueffing, Marius', 'Hauck, Stefanie M']","['von Toerne C', 'Menzler J', 'Ly A', 'Senninger N', 'Ueffing M', 'Hauck SM']","['From the double daggerResearch Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), 85764 Neuherberg, Germany;', 'From the double daggerResearch Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), 85764 Neuherberg, Germany;', 'From the double daggerResearch Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), 85764 Neuherberg, Germany;', 'From the double daggerResearch Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), 85764 Neuherberg, Germany;', 'From the double daggerResearch Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), 85764 Neuherberg, Germany; section signInstitute for Ophthalmic Research, Centre for Ophthalmology, University of Tubingen, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'From the double daggerResearch Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), 85764 Neuherberg, Germany; hauck@helmholtz-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL10)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL10/*metabolism', 'Ependymoglial Cells/*metabolism', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate', 'Swine']",2014/06/14 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)33299-0 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M113.033613 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2014 Sep;13(9):2371-81. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M113.033613.

Previously, we have shown that transfer of the adenosine deaminase (ADA) cDNA in vivo rescues the lethal phenotype and reconstitutes immune function in ADA-deficient mice. In order to translate this approach to ADA-deficient severe combined immune deficiency patients, neonatal ADA-deficient mice and newborn rhesus monkeys were treated with species-matched and mismatched vectors and pseudotypes. We compared gene delivery by the HIV-1-based vector to murine gamma-retroviral vectors pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein or murine retroviral envelopes in ADA-deficient mice. The vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviral vectors had the highest titer and resulted in the highest vector copy number in multiple tissues, particularly liver and lung. In monkeys, HIV-1 or simian immunodeficiency virus vectors resulted in similar biodistribution in most tissues including bone marrow, spleen, liver, and lung. Simian immunodeficiency virus pseudotyped with the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope produced 10- to 30-fold lower titers than the vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein pseudotype, but had a similar tissue biodistribution and similar copy number in blood cells. The relative copy numbers achieved in mice and monkeys were similar when adjusted to the administered dose per kg. These results suggest that this approach can be scaled-up to clinical levels for treatment of ADA-deficient severe combined immune deficiency subjects with suboptimal hematopoietic stem cell transplantation options.","['Carbonaro Sarracino, Denise', 'Tarantal, Alice F', 'Lee, C Chang I', 'Martinez, Michele', 'Jin, Xiangyang', 'Wang, Xiaoyan', 'Hardee, Cinnamon L', 'Geiger, Sabine', 'Kahl, Christoph A', 'Kohn, Donald B']","['Carbonaro Sarracino D', 'Tarantal AF', 'Lee CC', 'Martinez M', 'Jin X', 'Wang X', 'Hardee CL', 'Geiger S', 'Kahl CA', 'Kohn DB']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', '1] Center for Fetal Monkey Gene Transfer for Heart, Lung, and Blood Diseases, University of California, Davis, California USA [2] Departments of Pediatrics and Cell Biology and Human Anatomy, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.', 'Center for Fetal Monkey Gene Transfer for Heart, Lung, and Blood Diseases, University of California, Davis, California USA.', 'Center for Fetal Monkey Gene Transfer for Heart, Lung, and Blood Diseases, University of California, Davis, California USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, University of California, Los Angeles California, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', ""1] Division of Research Immunology/BMT, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA [2] Current address: Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Beaverton, Oregon, USA."", '1] Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA [2] Department of Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,['EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)'],IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/deficiency/genetics', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/*genetics/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics/therapy', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes']",2014/06/14 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)30784-5 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2014.88 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2014 Oct;22(10):1803-16. doi: 10.1038/mt.2014.88.

Herein, we report the main clinical and virological features of cases reported in Spain. All individuals with HTLV-1 infection recorded at the national registry since 1989 were examined. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. A total of 229 HTLV-1 cases had been reported up to December 2012. The mean age was 41 years old and 61% were female. Their country of origin was Latin America in 59%, Africa in 15%, and Spain in 20%. Transmission had occurred following sexual contact in 41%, parenteral exposure in 12%, and vertically in 9%. HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) was diagnosed in 27 cases and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in 17 subjects. HTLV-1 subtype could be obtained for 45 patients; all but one belonged to the Cosmopolitan subtype a. One Nigerian pregnant woman harbored HTLV-1 subtype b. Within the Cosmopolitan subtype a, two individuals (from Bolivia and Peru, respectively) belonged to the Japanese subgroup B, another two (from Senegal and Mauritania) to the North African subgroup D, and 39 to the Transcontinental subgroup A. Of note, one divergent HTLV-1 strain from an Ethiopian branched off from all five known Cosmopolitan subtype 1a subgroups. Divergent HTLV-1 strains have been introduced and currently circulate in Spain. The relatively large proportion of symptomatic cases (19%) suggests that HTLV-1 infection is underdiagnosed in Spain.","['Trevino, Ana', 'Alcantara, Luiz Carlos Jr', 'Benito, Rafael', 'Caballero, Estrella', 'Aguilera, Antonio', 'Ramos, Jose Manuel', 'de Mendoza, Carmen', 'Rodriguez, Carmen', 'Garcia, Juan', 'Rodriguez-Iglesias, Manuel', 'Ortiz de Lejarazu, Raul', 'Roc, Lourdes', 'Parra, Patricia', 'Eiros, Jose', 'del Romero, Jorge', 'Soriano, Vincent']","['Trevino A', 'Alcantara LC Jr', 'Benito R', 'Caballero E', 'Aguilera A', 'Ramos JM', 'de Mendoza C', 'Rodriguez C', 'Garcia J', 'Rodriguez-Iglesias M', 'Ortiz de Lejarazu R', 'Roc L', 'Parra P', 'Eiros J', 'del Romero J', 'Soriano V']","['1 Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Carlos III , Madrid, Spain .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Molecular Epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Spain/epidemiology']",2014/06/14 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/AID.2013.0128 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2014 Sep;30(9):856-62. doi: 10.1089/AID.2013.0128.

We assessed whether children and young people with clinical standard and intermediate-risk ALL who have persistent MRD at the end of induction therapy benefit from augmented post-remission therapy. METHODS: Between Oct 1, 2003, and June 30, 2011, we enrolled eligible patients aged 1-24 years and initially categorised them into clinical standard-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups on the basis of a combination of National Cancer Institute criteria, cytogenetics, and early morphological response to induction therapy. Clinical standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with MRD of 0.01% or higher at day 29 of induction (MRD high risk) were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard therapy (treatment regimens A and B) or augmented post-remission therapy (regimen C). Compared with standard therapy, the augmented treatment regimen (regimen C) included an additional eight doses of pegylated asparaginase, 18 doses of vincristine, and escalated-dose intravenous methotrexate without folinic acid rescue during interim maintenance courses. Computer randomisation was used for treatment allocation and was balanced for sex, age (<10 years vs >/=10 years), and white blood cell count at diagnosis (<50 x 10(9)/L vs >/=50 x 10(9)/L) by minimisation. Patients, clinicians, and data analysts were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcomes were event-free survival and overall survival. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN07355119. FINDINGS: 533 MRD high-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive standard (n=266) or augmented (n=267) post-remission therapy. After a median follow-up of 70 months (IQR 52-91), 5-year event-free survival was better in the augmented treatment group (89.6% [95% CI 85.9-93.3]) than in the standard group (82.8% [78.1-87.5]; odds ratio [OR] 0.61 [95% CI 0.39-0.98], p=0.04). Overall survival at 5 years was numerically, but not significantly, higher in the augmented treatment group (92.9% [95% CI 89.8-96.0]) than in the standard therapy group (88.9% [85.0-92.8]; OR 0.67 [95% CI 0.38-1.17], p=0.16). More adverse events occurred in the augmented treatment group than in the standard group (asparaginase-related hypersensitivity in 18 [6.7%] in the augmented group vs two [0.8%] in the standard group and asparaginase-related pancreatitis in eight [3.0%] vs one [0.4%]; intravenous methotrexate-related mucositis in 11 [4.1%] vs three [1.1%] and methotrexate-related stomatitis in 48 [18.0%] vs 12 [4.5%]). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that children and young people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 0.01% or more MRD at the end of remission induction therapy could benefit from augmented post-remission therapy. However, the asparaginase and intravenous methotrexate used in the augmented treatment regimen is associated with more adverse events than is the standard post-remission treatment regimen.

Determination of this mutational status is laborious and therefore not applied in routine diagnostics. A search for ""surrogate markers"" has been conducted over the past few years. One of the most promising surrogate markers is ZAP70, but standardization of the measurement of ZAP70 has proven to be difficult. Conventionally, ZAP70 expression in CLL cells is related to ZAP70 expression in T cells. We propose a new method in which ZAP70 expression in NK cells is used as reference (new NK-MFI method). We have measured ZAP70 expression in samples of 45 previously untreated CLL patients. ZAP70 in CLL cells related to ZAP70 in NK cells correlated better to cytogenetic risk profile and mutational status than the conventional methods. Negativity of both ZAP70 (new NK-MFI method) and CD38 resulted in a probability of 90% for mutated IGHV genes. In conclusion, ZAP70 expression in CLL cells related to ZAP70 expression in NK cells is a better surrogate marker for mutational status than the conventional T cell related methods.","['Wiggers, Tom G H', 'Westra, Guus', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Abbes, Andre P', 'Strunk, Annuska', 'Kuiper-Kramer, Ellen', 'Poddighe, Pino', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Chamuleau, Martine E D']","['Wiggers TG', 'Westra G', 'Westers TM', 'Abbes AP', 'Strunk A', 'Kuiper-Kramer E', 'Poddighe P', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Chamuleau ME']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Little is known of the possible molecules that could be used to predict preferential chemosensitivity on MSTO-211H cells. Resveratrol and clofarabine induced down-regulation of Mcl-1 protein level in MSTO-211H cells. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 suggested that Mcl-1 protein levels were regulated at the post-translational step. The siRNA-based knockdown of Mcl-1 in MSTO-211H cells triggered more growth-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducing effects with the resultant cleavages of procaspase-3 and its substrate PARP, increased caspase-3/7 activity, and increased percentage of apoptotic propensities. However, the majority of the observed changes were not shown in MeT-5A cells. Collectively, these studies indicate that the preferential activation of caspase cascade in malignant cells might have important applications as a therapeutic target for MM.","['Lee, Yoon-Jin', 'Lee, Yong-Jin', 'Lee, Sang-Han']","['Lee YJ', 'Lee YJ', 'Lee SH']","['Soonchunhyung Environmental Health Center for Asbestos; Division of Molecular Cancer Research, Soonchunhyang Medical Research Institute, Cheonan 330-090, Korea.', 'Soonchunhyung Environmental Health Center for Asbestos, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan 330-090, Korea.', 'Soonchunhyung Environmental Health Center for Asbestos; Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan 330-090, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),BMB Rep,BMB reports,101465334,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clofarabine', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Mesothelioma/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",2014/06/14 06:00,2015/12/23 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['2832 [pii]', '10.5483/bmbrep.2015.48.3.105 [doi]']",ppublish,BMB Rep. 2015 Mar;48(3):166-71. doi: 10.5483/bmbrep.2015.48.3.105.,,,,PMC4453022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, zebrafish embryos and full-grown fish have been instrumental for studies of leukemia, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, bone tumors, and other malignancies. Although because of its similarities to human osteogenesis zebrafish appears to be an appealing model to investigate osteosarcoma, only a few osteosarcoma specific studies have been accomplished yet. Here, we review interesting related and unrelated reports of which the findings might be extrapolated to osteosarcoma. More importantly, rational but yet unexplored applications of zebrafish are debated to expand the window of opportunities for future establishment of osteosarcoma models. Accordingly technological advances of zebrafish based cancer research, such as robotic high-throughput multicolor injection systems and advanced imaging methods are discussed. Furthermore, various use of zebrafish embryos for screening drug regimens by combinations of chemotherapy, novel drug deliverers, and immune system modulators are suggested. Concerning the etiology, the high degree of genetic similarity between zebrafish and human cancers indicates that affected regions are evolutionarily conserved. Therefore, zebrafish as a swift model system that allows for the investigation of multiple candidate gene-defects is presented.","['Mohseny, A B', 'Hogendoorn, P C W']","['Mohseny AB', 'Hogendoorn PC']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, 9600, H1-Q, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Robotics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/06/14 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-04843-7_12 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2014;804:221-36. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-04843-7_12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds, applied at micromolar concentrations, exhibited cytotoxic activity of different intensity (compared with cisplatin as a control), modality and selectivity in these malignant cell lines. The best activity against all four cell cancer lines was exhibited by dimer-sulfides. All screened compounds exerted concentration-dependent cytotoxic activity against leukemia K562 cells. The compounds which exerted the most pronounced cytotoxic action exhibited notably higher cytotoxic activities against K562, HeLa and MDA-MB-453 cells in comparison to resting and PHA-stimulated PBMC, pointing to a significant selectivity in their antitumor actions. Examination of the mechanisms of cytotoxicity on leukemia K562 cells revealed pro-apoptotic action of each of the investigated compounds applied at concentrations 2IC50. The most prominent pro-apoptotic action was exhibited by dimer-sulfide of cholest-4-en-3-one. Furthermore, almost all of the tested compounds at IC50 concentrations induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest in K562 cells. Antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungal cells, and toxicity to brine shrimp Artemia salina, were evaluated. There was no antibacterial activity. The best antifungal activity was exhibited against Saccharomyces cerevisiae by dimers linked with trithiolane ring, indicating a selective activity of investigated compounds.","['Krstic, Natalija M', 'Matic, Ivana Z', 'Juranic, Zorica D', 'Novakovic, Irena T', 'Sladic, Dusan M']","['Krstic NM', 'Matic IZ', 'Juranic ZD', 'Novakovic IT', 'Sladic DM']","['Center for Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Technology and Metallurgy, University of Belgrade, Studentski trg 12-16, P.O.

The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical impact of NOTCH1 mutations in this setting of patients. The study included 123 progressive CLL patients homogeneously assigned to first-line induction treatment with fludarabine followed by rituximab. Fifty-nine patients either in complete remission (CR) minimal residual disease positive (MRD+) after induction (n = 39) or in partial remission (PR, n = 20) underwent consolidation/maintenance therapy with rituximab. Sixteen patients in CR MRD + or PR underwent observation only. The presence of NOTCH1 mutations was investigated by amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR and by Sanger sequencing. NOTCH1 mutations occurred in 20 out of 123 (16.3 %) cases. Consolidated patients showed longer OS than unconsolidated patients (p = 0.030). Both NOTCH1 mutated and CR MRD+ or PR NOTCH1 mutated patients showed significantly shorter OS after treatment (p = 0.00014 and p = 0.0021, respectively). Moreover, NOTCH1 wild-type consolidated cases experienced significantly longer RD and OS than NOTCH1 mutated consolidated or not consolidated cases (p = 0.00001 and p = 0.018, respectively). Finally, the independent prognostic impact of NOTCH1 mutations for OS was confirmed in multivariate analysis (p < 0.001).

Here, we investigated Jak2 activation in a normal hematopoietic cell line, 32D mouse myeloid cells. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation studies showed that c-Abl formed a stable complex with Jak2 in live cells. Co-immunoprecipitation results showed that c-Abl bound to the betac chain of IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptors. The kinase activities of both c-Abl and Jak2 were stimulated by IL-3 in 32D cells. Decreasing c-Abl protein expression in 32D cells by inducible shRNA decreased Jak2 activity and resulted in the failure of Jak2 activation in response to IL-3. Treatment of IL-3 and serum-starved 32D cells with 1 muM imatinib mysylate inhibited IL-3 stimulated kinase activities of both c-Abl and Jak2. In addition, the kinase-deficient Bcr-Abl mutant (p210K1172R) was defective for activation of Jak2 in 32D cells and impaired IL-3 independent growth, which was rescued by overexpression of c-Abl (+Abl). IL-3 efficiently inhibited apoptosis of 32Dp210K/R+Abl cells induced by imatinib mysylate but not Jak2 kinase inhibitor TG101209. In summary, our findings provide evidence that the kinase function of c-Abl and its C-terminal CT4 region is crucial for its interaction with Jak2 and its activation. c-Abl kinase activity induced by IL-3 is required for IL-3-stimulated Jak2 and Jak1 activation. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory role of c-Abl in Jak2 activation induced by IL-3 cytokine growth factor in 32D hematopoietic cells.","['Tao, Wenjing', 'Leng, Xiaohong', 'Chakraborty, Sandip N', 'Ma, Helen', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B']","['Tao W', 'Leng X', 'Chakraborty SN', 'Ma H', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['From the Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'From the Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'From the Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'From the Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'From the Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030 rarlingh@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*physiology']",2014/06/14 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47530-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.554501 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Aug 1;289(31):21463-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.554501.

But decitabine monotherapy was associated with a relatively low rate of complete remission in AML and MDS. We aimed to investigate the effect of several anti-leukemia drugs in combination with decitabine on the proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells, to select the most efficient combination group and explore the associated mechanisms of these combination therapies. METHODS: Cell proliferation was tested by MTT assay and CFU-GM assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V and PI staining in cell culture, TUNEL assay and transmission electron microscopy in animal study. MicroPET was used to imaging the tumor in mouse model. Molecular studies were conducted using microarray expression analysis, which was used to explore associated pathways, and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry, used to assess regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Statistical significance among groups was determined by one-way ANOVA analysis followed by post hoc Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. RESULTS: Among five anti-leukemia agents in combining with decitabine, the sequential combination of decitabine and idarubicin induced synergistic cell death in U937 cells, and this effect was verified in HEL, SKM-1 cells and AML cells isolated from AML patients. Importantly, tumor growth inhibition in this sequential combination was found to be higher than in single agent or controls in vivo. Moreover, sequential combination of the two agents induced apoptosis and depression of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in both AML cell culture and animal studies. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that sequentially combination of decitabine and idarubicin had synergistic anti-leukemia effects. These effects were mainly attributed to demethylation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitors and downregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway nuclear targets.","['Li, Kongfei', 'Hu, Chao', 'Mei, Chen', 'Ren, Zhigang', 'Vera, Juan Carlos', 'Zhuang, Zhengping', 'Jin, Jie', 'Tong, Hongyan']","['Li K', 'Hu C', 'Mei C', 'Ren Z', 'Vera JC', 'Zhuang Z', 'Jin J', 'Tong H']","[""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. hongyantong@aliyun.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Wnt Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', '*Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2014/06/14 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-12-167 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-12-167 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2014 Jun 12;12:167. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-12-167.,,20140612,,PMC4082426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PI3K-Akt-mTOR kinase pathway plays a vital role in pro-survival signals within leukemic cells and inhibition of this pathway is being investigated to improve patient outcomes. Tracking activation of multiple signaling proteins simultaneously in patient samples can be challenging especially with limiting cell numbers within rare sub-populations. METHODS: The NanoPro 1000 system (ProteinSimple) is built on an automated, capillary-based immunoassay platform and enables a rapid and quantitative analysis of specific proteins and their phosphorylation states. We have utilized this nano-immunoassay to examine activation of Akt 1/2/3 and downstream mTOR target--eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-Binding Protein 1 (4EBP1). RESULTS: Assays for Akt 1/2/3 and 4EBP1 were standardized using AML cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-14, OCI-AML3 and HL-60) prior to testing in patient samples. Target inhibition was studied using mTOR 1/2 inhibitor AZD-8055 and results were corroborated by Western blotting. The assay was able to quantify nanogram amounts of 4EBP1 and Akt 1/2/3 in AML cell lines and primary pediatric AML samples and results were quantifiable, consistent and reproducible. CONCLUSION: Our data provides a strong basis for testing this platform on a larger scale and our long term aim is to utilize this nano-immunoassay prospectively in de-novo AML to be able to identify poor responders who might benefit from early introduction of targeted therapy.","['Sabnis, Himalee', 'Bradley, Heath L', 'Bunting, Silvia T', 'Cooper, Todd M', 'Bunting, Kevin D']","['Sabnis H', 'Bradley HL', 'Bunting ST', 'Cooper TM', 'Bunting KD']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University, 1760 Haygood Drive NE, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. kevin.bunting@emory.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2014/06/14 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-12-166 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-12-166 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2014 Jun 12;12:166. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-12-166.,"['KL2 TR000455/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK059380/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000454/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR000454/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",20140612,,PMC4080754,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts to manipulate alloreactive T cells to spare normal cells while killing leukemic cells have been unsuccessful. In HLA-haploidentical transplantation, we reported that donor-derived T regulatory cells (Tregs), coinfused with conventional T cells (Tcons), protected recipients against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The present phase 2 study investigated whether Treg-Tcon adoptive immunotherapy prevents posttransplant leukemia relapse. Forty-three adults with high-risk acute leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia 33; acute lymphoblastic leukemia 10) were conditioned with a total body irradiation-based regimen. Grafts included CD34(+) cells (mean 9.7 x 10(6)/kg), Tregs (mean 2.5 x 10(6)/kg), and Tcons (mean 1.1 x 10(6)/kg). No posttransplant immunosuppression was given. Ninety-five percent of patients achieved full-donor type engraftment and 15% developed >/=grade 2 acute GVHD. The probability of disease-free survival was 0.56 at a median follow-up of 46 months. The very low cumulative incidence of relapse (0.05) was significantly better than in historical controls. These results demonstrate the immunosuppressive potential of Tregs can be used to suppress GVHD without loss of the benefits of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. Humanized murine models provided insights into the mechanisms underlying separation of GVL from GVHD, suggesting the GVL effect is due to largely unopposed Tcon alloantigen recognition in bone marrow.","['Martelli, Massimo F', 'Di Ianni, Mauro', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Carotti, Alessandra', 'Terenzi, Adelmo', 'Pierini, Antonio', 'Massei, Maria Speranza', 'Amico, Lucia', 'Urbani, Elena', 'Del Papa, Beatrice', 'Zei, Tiziana', 'Iacucci Ostini, Roberta', 'Cecchini, Debora', 'Tognellini, Rita', 'Reisner, Yair', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Velardi, Andrea']","['Martelli MF', 'Di Ianni M', 'Ruggeri L', 'Falzetti F', 'Carotti A', 'Terenzi A', 'Pierini A', 'Massei MS', 'Amico L', 'Urbani E', 'Del Papa B', 'Zei T', 'Iacucci Ostini R', 'Cecchini D', 'Tognellini R', 'Reisner Y', 'Aversa F', 'Falini B', 'Velardi A']","['Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', ""Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; Hematology Section, Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy;"", 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Blood Bank, Ospedale Santa Maria della Misericordia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Immunology Department, Rehovot, Israel; and.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy;']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/14 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/06/14 06:00'],"['2014/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39945-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-03-564401 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 24;124(4):638-44. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-564401.

We analyzed the clinical course of 34 AML+13 patients enrolled in the German AMLCG-1999 and SAL trials and performed exome sequencing, targeted candidate gene sequencing and gene expression profiling. Relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of AML+13 patients were inferior compared to other ELN Intermediate-II patients (n=855) (median RFS, 7.8 vs 14.1 months, P = .006; median OS 9.3 vs. 14.8 months, P = .004). Besides the known high frequency of RUNX1 mutations (75%), we identified mutations in spliceosome components in 88%, including SRSF2 codon 95 mutations in 81%. Recurring mutations were detected in ASXL1 (44%) and BCOR (25%). Two patients carried mutations in CEBPZ, suggesting that CEBPZ is a novel recurrently mutated gene in AML. Gene expression analysis revealed a homogeneous expression profile including upregulation of FOXO1 and FLT3 and downregulation of SPRY2. This is the most comprehensive clinical and biological characterization of AML+13 to date, and reveals a striking clustering of lesions in a few genes, defining AML+13 as a genetically homogeneous subgroup with alterations in a few critical cellular pathways.

A concern is whether cancer cells could develop resistance to DHA after repeated administration, thus limiting its therapeutic efficacy. In the present study, we developed a DHA-resistant Molt-4 cell line (RTN) by exposing Molt-4 cells to gradually increasing concentrations of DHA in vitro. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DHA for RTN cells is 7.1-times higher than that of Molt-4 cells. RTN cells have a higher growth rate than Molt-4 cells.

CGBayesNets implements Bayesian likelihood and inference algorithms for the conditional Gaussian Bayesian network (CGBNs) formalism, one appropriate for predicting an outcome of interest from, e.g., multimodal genomic data. We provide four different network learning algorithms, each making a different tradeoff between computational cost and network likelihood. CGBayesNets provides a full suite of functions for model exploration and verification, including cross validation, bootstrapping, and AUC manipulation. We highlight several results obtained previously with CGBayesNets, including predictive models of wood properties from tree genomics, leukemia subtype classification from mixed genomic data, and robust prediction of intensive care unit mortality outcomes from metabolomic profiles. We also provide detailed example analysis on public metabolomic and gene expression datasets. CGBayesNets is implemented in MATLAB and available as MATLAB source code, under an Open Source license and anonymous download at http://www.cgbayesnets.com.","['McGeachie, Michael J', 'Chang, Hsun-Hsien', 'Weiss, Scott T']","['McGeachie MJ', 'Chang HH', 'Weiss ST']","[""Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", ""Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Children's Hospital Informatics Program, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", ""Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America; Partners Health Care Center for Personalized Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,,IM,"['Algorithms', '*Bayes Theorem', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Internet', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Normal Distribution', 'Phenotype', '*Software', 'Wood/genetics']",2014/06/13 06:00,2015/10/21 06:00,['2014/06/13 06:00'],"['2013/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003676 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-13-02214 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2014 Jun 12;10(6):e1003676. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003676. eCollection 2014 Jun.,"['U01 HL065899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-HL065899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12-HL089990/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HL089990/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19-A1067854/PHS HHS/United States']",20140612,,PMC4055564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rarely, patients with melanoma have an underlying lymphoproliferative disease, and melanoma metastases might develop as collision tumours in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). The aim of this study was to measure the incidence and examine the effect of collision tumours on the accuracy of SLND and on the validity of staging in this setting. Between 1998 and 2012, 750 consecutive SLNDs were performed in melanoma patients using the triple technique (lymphoscintigraphy, gamma probe and blue dye). The validity of SLND in collision tumours was analysed. False negativity was reflected by the disease-free survival. The literature was reviewed on collision tumours in melanoma. Collision tumours of melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were found in two SLN and in one RLND (0.4%). Subsequent RLNDs of SLND-positive cases were negative for melanoma. The patient with negative SLND developed relapse after 28 months with an inguinal lymph node metastasis of melanoma; RLND showed collision tumours. The literature review identified 12 cases of collision tumours. CLL was associated with increased melanoma incidence and reduced overall survival. This is, to our knowledge, the first assessment of the clinical value of SLND when collision tumours of melanoma and CLL are found. In this small series of three patients with both malignancies present in the same lymph node basin, lymphocytic infiltration of the CLL did not alter radioisotope uptake into the SLN. No false-negative result was observed. Our data suggest the validity of SLND in collision tumours, but given the rarity of the problem, further studies are necessary to confirm this reliability.","['Gero, Daniel', 'Queiros da Mota, Vanessa', 'Boubaker, Ariane', 'Berthod, Gregoire', 'de Leval, Laurence', 'Demartines, Nicolas', 'Matter, Maurice']","['Gero D', 'Queiros da Mota V', 'Boubaker A', 'Berthod G', 'de Leval L', 'Demartines N', 'Matter M']","['Departments of aVisceral Surgery bPathology cNuclear Medicine dOncology, Melanoma Clinic, University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Melanoma Res,Melanoma research,9109623,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Node Excision/methods', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*pathology/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy/methods', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology/*surgery']",2014/06/13 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/06/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CMR.0000000000000098 [doi]'],ppublish,Melanoma Res. 2014 Aug;24(4):371-6. doi: 10.1097/CMR.0000000000000098.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans retinoic acid (RA) is the standard therapeutic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, but 10-20% of patients are not responsive, and initially responsive patients relapse and develop retinoic acid resistance. The patient-derived, lineage-bipotent acute myeloblastic leukemia (FAB M2) HL-60 cell line is a potent tool for characterizing differentiation-induction therapy responsiveness and resistance in t(15;17)-negative cells. Wild-type (WT) HL-60 cells undergo RA-induced granulocytic differentiation, or monocytic differentiation in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3). Two sequentially emergent RA-resistant HL-60 cell lines, R38+ and R38-, distinguishable by RA-inducible CD38 expression, do not arrest in G1/G0 and fail to upregulate CD11b and the myeloid-associated signaling factors Vav1, c-Cbl, Lyn, Fgr, and c-Raf after RA treatment. Here, we show that the R38+ and R38- HL-60 cell lines display a progressive reduced response to D3-induced differentiation therapy. Exploiting the biphasic dynamic of induced HL-60 differentiation, we examined if resistance-related defects occurred during the first 24 h (the early or ""precommitment"" phase) or subsequently (the late or ""lineage-commitment"" phase). HL-60 were treated with RA or D3 for 24 h, washed and retreated with either the same, different, or no differentiation agent. Using flow cytometry, D3 was able to induce CD38, CD11b and CD14 expression, and G1/G0 arrest when present during the lineage-commitment stage in R38+ cells, and to a lesser degree in R38- cells. Clustering analysis of cytometry and quantified Western blot data indicated that WT, R38+ and R38- HL-60 cells exhibited decreasing correlation between phenotypic markers and signaling factor expression. Thus differentiation induction therapy resistance can develop in stages, with initial partial RA resistance and moderate vitamin D3 responsiveness (unilineage maturation block), followed by bilineage maturation block and progressive signaling defects, notably the reduced expression of Vav1, Fgr, and c-Raf.","['Jensen, Holly A', 'Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Ibabao, Christopher N', 'Myers, Rebecca', 'Varner, Jeffrey D', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Jensen HA', 'Bunaciu RP', 'Ibabao CN', 'Myers R', 'Varner JD', 'Yen A']","['School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Biology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States of America.', 'School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2014/06/13 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/06/13 06:00'],"['2014/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0098929 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-03033 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 12;9(6):e98929. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0098929. eCollection 2014.,"['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20140612,,PMC4055670,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant activation of c-Kit results in dysregulated signaling and is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers. The development of more specific and effective c-Kit therapies is warranted given its essential role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we describe the biological properties of CK6, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the extracellular region of human c-Kit. CK6 specifically binds c-Kit receptor with high affinity (EC 50 = 0.06 nM) and strongly blocks its interaction with SCF (IC 50 = 0.41 nM) in solid phase assays. Flow cytometry shows CK6 binding to c-Kit on the cell surface of human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), melanoma, and leukemia tumor cell lines. Furthermore, exposure to CK6 inhibits SCF stimulation of c-Kit tyrosine kinase activity and downstream signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT), in addition to reducing tumor cell line growth in vitro. CK6 treatment significantly decreases human xenograft tumor growth in NCI-H526 SCLC (T/C% = 57) and Malme-3M melanoma (T/C% = 58) models in vivo. The combination of CK6 with standard of care chemotherapy agents, cisplatin and etoposide for SCLC or dacarbazine for melanoma, more potently reduces tumor growth (SCLC T/C% = 24, melanoma T/C% = 38) compared with CK6 or chemotherapy alone. In summary, our results demonstrate that CK6 is a c-Kit antagonist antibody with tumor growth neutralizing properties and are highly suggestive of potential therapeutic application in treating human malignancies harboring c-Kit receptor.","['Lebron, Maria B', 'Brennan, Laura', 'Damoci, Christopher B', 'Prewett, Marie C', ""O'Mahony, Marguerita"", 'Duignan, Inga J', 'Credille, Kelly M', 'DeLigio, James T', 'Starodubtseva, Marina', 'Amatulli, Michael', 'Zhang, Yiwei', 'Schwartz, Kaben D', 'Burtrum, Douglas', 'Balderes, Paul', 'Persaud, Kris', 'Surguladze, David', 'Loizos, Nick', 'Paz, Keren', 'Kotanides, Helen']","['Lebron MB', 'Brennan L', 'Damoci CB', 'Prewett MC', ""O'Mahony M"", 'Duignan IJ', 'Credille KM', 'DeLigio JT', 'Starodubtseva M', 'Amatulli M', 'Zhang Y', 'Schwartz KD', 'Burtrum D', 'Balderes P', 'Persaud K', 'Surguladze D', 'Loizos N', 'Paz K', 'Kotanides H']","['ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'Eli Lilly and Company; Indianapolis, IN USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.', 'ImClone Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; New York, NY USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",2014/06/13 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/06/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['29523 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.29523 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2014 Sep;15(9):1208-18. doi: 10.4161/cbt.29523.

Here, we provide evidence that, in addition to the RNA genomes that canonical retroviruses package, modern HERV-K viruses can contain reverse-transcribed DNA (RT-DNA) genomes. Indeed, reverse transcription of genomic HERV-K RNA into the DNA form is able to occur in three distinct times and locations: (i) in the virus-producing cell prior to viral release, yielding a DNA-containing extracellular virus particle similar to the spumaviruses; (ii) within the extracellular virus particle itself, transitioning from an RNA-containing particle to a DNA-containing particle; and (iii) after entry of the RNA-containing virus into the target cell, similar to canonical retroviruses, such as murine leukemia virus and HIV. Moreover, using a resuscitated HERV-K virus construct, we show that both viruses with RNA genomes and viruses with DNA genomes are capable of infecting target cells. This high level of genomic flexibility historically could have permitted these viruses to replicate in various host cell environments, potentially assisting in their many integration events and resulting in their high prevalence in the human genome. Moreover, the ability of modern HERV-K viruses to proceed through reverse transcription and package RT-DNA genomes suggests a higher level of replication competency than was previously understood, and it may be relevant in HERV-K-associated human diseases. IMPORTANCE: Retroviral elements comprise at least 8% of the human genome. Of all the endogenous retroviruses, HERV-K viruses are the most intact and biologically active. While a modern infectious HERV-K has yet to be found, HERV-K activation has been associated with cancers, autoimmune diseases, and HIV-1 infection. Thus, determining how this virus family became such a prevalent member of our genome and what it is capable of in its current form are of the utmost importance. Here, we provide evidence that HERV-K viruses currently found in the human genome are able to proceed through reverse transcription and historically utilized a life cycle with a surprising degree of genomic flexibility in which both RNA- and DNA-containing viruses were capable of mediating infection.","['Dube, Derek', 'Contreras-Galindo, Rafael', 'He, Shirley', 'King, Steven R', 'Gonzalez-Hernandez, Marta J', 'Gitlin, Scott D', 'Kaplan, Mark H', 'Markovitz, David M']","['Dube D', 'Contreras-Galindo R', 'He S', 'King SR', 'Gonzalez-Hernandez MJ', 'Gitlin SD', 'Kaplan MH', 'Markovitz DM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA Veterans Affairs Health System, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA Programs in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA dmarkov@umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics/physiology', '*Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Virus Assembly']",2014/06/13 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01147-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01147-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Sep 1;88(17):9673-82. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01147-14.

Here, we show that CD7 promotes EMI of the human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Tanoue. The Tanoue cell line expressing firefly luciferase, Luc-Tanoue, was transplanted into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice, and cells infiltrated into the brain were cultured ex vivo. This process was repeated 4 times to obtain the highly invasive line Luc-Tanoue-F4. Comparison of the global gene expression signatures of Luc-Tanoue-F4 and Luc-Tanoue indicated that the CD7 gene showed the largest increase in expression among EMI-related genes in Luc-Tanoue-F4 cells. Overexpression of CD7 in Tanoue enhanced cell invasiveness. Among cell migration, proliferation, adhesion and protease activity, only cell adhesiveness showed enhancement in Luc-Tanoue-F4. Expression of the intracellular domain, but not the extracellular domain, of CD7 enhanced cell adhesiveness. Luc-Tanoue-F4 showed a higher level of integrin beta2 expression; overexpression of CD7 induced the expression of integrin beta2 in Luc-Tanoue. These results show that CD7 induces integrin beta2 and enhances cell adhesiveness and invasiveness in Tanoue cells. This study highlights the role of the CD7/integrin beta2 axis as a critical pathway in the process of EMI of human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Kondoh, Takashi', 'Kuribayashi, Kageaki', 'Tanaka, Maki', 'Kobayashi, Daisuke', 'Yanagihara, Nozomi', 'Watanabe, Naoki']","['Kondoh T', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Tanaka M', 'Kobayashi D', 'Yanagihara N', 'Watanabe N']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,['0 (CD18 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CD18 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology']",2014/06/13 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/06/13 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2492 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Sep;45(3):1073-81. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2492.

PROCEDURE: Between January 2006 and February 2013, 70 patients (</=16 years of age) with AML1/ETO AML were included in our study. Bone marrow samples were evaluated using by both RT-PCR and RQ-PCR assays. AML1/ETO transcripts were normalized to 10(5) ABL copies. RESULTS: When treated with fewer than four courses of therapy, no association was found between positive RT-PCR results and relapse. After four courses of therapy, a positive RT-PCR result was correlated with a probability of relapse. After induction chemotherapy, a >1.8 log reduction in AML1/ETO transcripts in BM determined by RQ-PCR may represent a subgroup of patients at low risk for relapse. MRD levels after consolidation (Courses 2 and 3) were also informative. CONCLUSION: Both RT-PCR and RQ-PCR can be used to detect MRD in childhood AML1/ETO AML. RQ-PCR can identify patients who are at high risk of relapse earlier than can RT-PCR.","['Zhang, Li', 'Cao, Zeng', 'Ruan, Min', 'Zeng, Qiang', 'Zhao, Liang', 'Li, Qinghua', 'Zou, Yao', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Zhu, Xiaofan']","['Zhang L', 'Cao Z', 'Ruan M', 'Zeng Q', 'Zhao L', 'Li Q', 'Zou Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhu X']","['Department of Pediatrics, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, P.R.

Using deep sequencing of flow-sorted cell populations from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we established the presence of acquired mutations in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. Mutations affected known lymphoid oncogenes, including BRAF, NOTCH1, and SF3B1. NFKBIE and EGR2 mutations were observed at unexpectedly high frequencies, 10.7% and 8.3% of 168 advanced-stage patients, respectively. EGR2 mutations were associated with a shorter time to treatment and poor overall survival. Analyses of BRAF and EGR2 mutations suggest that they result in deregulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) intracellular signaling. Our data propose disruption of hematopoietic and early B-cell differentiation through the deregulation of pre-BCR signaling as a phenotypic outcome of CLL mutations and show that CLL develops from a pre-leukemic phase. SIGNIFICANCE: The origin and pathogenic mechanisms of CLL are not fully understood. The current work indicates that CLL develops from pre-leukemic multipotent hematopoietic progenitors carrying somatic mutations. It advocates for abnormalities in early B-cell differentiation as a phenotypic convergence of the diverse acquired mutations observed in CLL.","['Damm, Frederik', 'Mylonas, Elena', 'Cosson, Adrien', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Della Valle, Veronique', 'Mouly, Enguerran', ""Diop, M'boyba"", 'Scourzic, Laurianne', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Chiba, Kenichi', 'Tanaka, Hiroko', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Kikushige, Yoshikane', 'Davi, Frederick', 'Lambert, Jerome', 'Gautheret, Daniel', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Sutton, Laurent', 'Dessen, Philippe', 'Solary, Eric', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Mercher, Thomas', 'Droin, Nathalie', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Bernard, Olivier A']","['Damm F', 'Mylonas E', 'Cosson A', 'Yoshida K', 'Della Valle V', 'Mouly E', 'Diop M', 'Scourzic L', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Chiba K', 'Tanaka H', 'Miyano S', 'Kikushige Y', 'Davi F', 'Lambert J', 'Gautheret D', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Sutton L', 'Dessen P', 'Solary E', 'Akashi K', 'Vainchenker W', 'Mercher T', 'Droin N', 'Ogawa S', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Bernard OA']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U985;

With an increasing interest in genetically-engineered foods, there is a growing need for development of sensitive and specific tests to evaluate potential allergenicity of foods and novel proteins as well as to determine allergic responses to ensure consumer safety. This review covers progress made in the field of development of cell models, specifically that involving a rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cell-based immunoassay, for use in allergen identification, diagnosis, and immunotherapy. The RBL assay has been extensively employed for determining biologically relevant cross-reactivities of food proteins, assessing the effect of processing on the allergenicity of food proteins, diagnosing allergic responses to whole-food products, and identifying anti-allergy food compounds. From the review of the literature, one might conclude the RBL cell-based assay is a better test system when compared to wild-type mast cell and basophil model systems for use in allergen identification, diagnosis, and analyses of potential immunotherapeutics. However, it is important to emphasize that this assay will only be able to identify those allergens to which the human has already been exposed, but will not identify a truly novel allergen, i.e. one that has never been encountered as in its preferred (humanized) configuration.","['Sun, Na', 'Zhou, Cui', 'Zhou, Xin', 'Sun, Lu', 'Che, Huilian']","['Sun N', 'Zhou C', 'Zhou X', 'Sun L', 'Che H']","['College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, China Agricultural University , Beijing , PR China and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Immunotoxicol,Journal of immunotoxicology,101201960,['0 (Allergens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Allergens/immunology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cross Reactions', 'Desensitization, Immunologic/*methods', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Food Hypersensitivity/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunoassay', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Rats', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2014/06/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/1547691X.2014.920063 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunotoxicol. 2015 Apr-Jun;12(2):199-205. doi: 10.3109/1547691X.2014.920063.

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using data pooled from 3 studies of patients (n = 870) with solid tumors or Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia. Patients (aged 18-91 y, weighing 35-221 kg) who received bosutinib 50 to 600 mg orally with food each contributed 6-9 pharmacokinetic samples. The final pharmacokinetic model was a linear two-compartment model with first-order absorption, an absorption lag-time, and dose-dependent bioavailability. Oral absorption was relatively slow, with a half-time of 1.14 h and a lag-time of 0.87 h; time to peak concentration was 5-6 h. Apparent clearance was 120 L/h. The apparent volume of the peripheral compartment was large with a slow turnover; alpha and beta half-lives were 19 h and 290 days, respectively. All parameters were estimated with acceptable precision (standard error <30%). No tested covariate (protocol, baseline demographic/clinical characteristics, or laboratory results) explained the high inter-individual variability of bosutinib pharmacokinetics. Therefore, adjusting bosutinib dose for body size (weight, surface area) would not provide benefit over fixed dosing. Using this exposure model in pharmacodynamic assessment of one study, adverse event incidence was shown to be similar in overall and bosutinib-responsive populations.","['Hsyu, Poe-Hirr', 'Mould, Diane R', 'Abbas, Richat', 'Amantea, Michael']","['Hsyu PH', 'Mould DR', 'Abbas R', 'Amantea M']",['Pfizer Inc.'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",England,Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,101164773,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aniline Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Absorption', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Nitriles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Quinolines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/13 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/06/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2133/dmpk.DMPK-13-RG-126 [doi]', 'DN/JST.JSTAGE/dmpk/DMPK-13-RG-126 [pii]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 2014;29(6):441-8. doi: 10.2133/dmpk.DMPK-13-RG-126.

A second allogeneic stem cell transplant could be envisaged as an effective and feasible salvage option in younger patients having a late relapse and an available donor. Unmanipulated or minimally manipulated donor T cells may also be effective in a minority of patients but the main limit remains the induction of severe graft-versus-host disease. This clinical complication has brought about a huge research effort that led to the development of leukemia-specific T-cell therapy aiming at the direct recognition of leukemia-specific rather than minor histocompatibility antigens. Despite a great scientific interest, the clinical feasibility of such an approach has proven to be quite problematic. To overcome this limitation, more research has moved toward the choice of targeting commonly expressed hematopoietic specific antigens by the genetic modification of unselected T cells. The best example of this is represented by the anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CD19.CAR) T cells. As a possible alternative to the genetic manipulation of unselected T cells, specific T-cell subpopulations with in vivo favorable homing and long-term survival properties have been genetically modified by CAR molecules. Finally, the use of naturally cytotoxic effector cells such as natural killer and cytokine-induced killer cells has been proposed in several clinical trials. The clinical development of these latter cells could also be further expanded by additional genetic modifications using the CAR technology.","['Rambaldi, A', 'Biagi, E', 'Bonini, C', 'Biondi, A', 'Introna, M']","['Rambaldi A', 'Biagi E', 'Bonini C', 'Biondi A', 'Introna M']","[""Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit and Center of Cell Therapy 'G.

In order to manage physical and psychological aspects of the disease and its treatment, complementary therapies like yoga are coming increasingly into focus. However, the effectiveness of yoga practice for people suffering from haematological malignancies remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of yoga practice in addition to standard cancer treatment for people with haematological malignancies. SEARCH METHODS: Our search strategy included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to 4th February 2014), databases of ongoing trials (controlled-trials.com; clinicaltrials.gov), conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Hematology, the European Haematology Association, the European Congress for Integrative Medicine, and Global Advances in Health and Medicine. We handsearched references of these studies from identified trials and relevant review articles. Two review authors independently screened the search results. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga in addition to standard care for haematological malignancies compared with standard care only. We did not restrict this to any specific style of yoga. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data for eligible studies and assessed the risk of bias according to predefined criteria. We evaluated distress, fatigue, anxiety, depression and quality of sleep. Further outcomes we planned to assess were health-related quality of life (HRQoL), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AE), but data on these were not available. MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategies led to 149 potentially relevant references, but only a single small study met our inclusion criteria. The included study was published as a full text article and investigated the feasibility and effect of Tibetan Yoga additional to standard care (N = 20; 1 person dropped out before attending any classes and no data were collected) compared to standard care only (N = 19). The study included people with all stages of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with and without current cancer treatment. The mean age was 51 years.We judged the overall risk of bias as high as we found a high risk for performance, detection and attrition bias. Additionally, potential outcome reporting bias could not be completely ruled out. Following the recommendations of GRADE, we judged the overall quality of the body of evidence for all predefined outcomes as 'very low', due to the methodical limitations and the very small sample size.The influence of yoga on HRQoL and OS was not reported. There is no evidence that yoga in addition to standard care compared with standard care only can improve distress in people with haematological malignancies (mean difference (MD) -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.55 to 4.95; P = 0.91). Similarly, there is no evidence of a difference between either group for fatigue (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.94; P = 1.00), anxiety (MD 0.30, 95% CI -5.01 to 5.61; P = 0.91) or depression (MD -0.70, 95% CI -3.21 to 1.81; P = 0.58).There is very low quality evidence that yoga improves the overall quality of sleep (MD -2.30, 95% CI -3.78 to -0.82; P = 0.002). The yoga groups' total score for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was 5.8 (+/- 2.3 SD) and better than the total score (8.1 (+/- 2.4 SD)) of the control group. A PSQI total score of 0 to 5 indicates good sleep whereas PSQI total score 6 to 21 points towards significant sleep disturbances. The occurrence of AEs was not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The currently available data provide little information about the effectiveness of yoga interventions for people suffering from haematological malignancies.

MTHFR (677 and 1298) genotype of children with ALL and healthy adult controls were done by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and were compared using various models of inheritance. A total of 150 patients and 300 controls were included. The 677T allele was found protective (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.94), whereas 1298C allele led to an increase in risk (OR 4.44, 95% CI 2.19-8.99) of childhood ALL. Meta-analysis included 31 and 27 studies examining the association of 677 and 1298 genotypes, respectively. The 677 C -> T polymorphism was protective (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.99). Protection was more pronounced in folate-sufficient populations as compared with those not covered by folate fortification guidelines.

Integrin diversity and function is regulated by alternative splicing. Membrane-bound and truncated beta3-integrins were shown to be key players in cancer metastasis. However, the immunomodulatory functions of the soluble (s) beta3-integrin have not been investigated yet. In this study, we described a novel form of sbeta3-integrin in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. Furthermore, we assessed the role of the sbeta3-integrin in the modulation of natural killer (NK)-cell activity. Levels of sbeta3-integrin were analysed in plasma samples of 23 AML patients and 26 healthy donors by ELISA. The capacity of sbeta3-integrin to regulate NK cell activity was investigated using proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxicity assays. Circulating sbeta3-integrin was detected in the plasma of 8 AML patients. NK cells showed significantly higher proliferation rates after stimulation with sbeta3-integrin and IL-2, IL-15 (73%). Significant increases in the NK cells' secreted levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma were measured in presence of sbeta3-integrin. In addition, sbeta3-integrin caused the upregulation of Granzyme B transcripts levels as well as FasL expression levels in NK cells. Most importantly, significantly higher K562 or AML blast target cell lysis rates were observed when NK cells were exposed to sbeta3-integrin. This study reports the identification of a novel sbeta3-integrin in AML patients and provides novel insights into its role in the immunomodulation of NK cell activity.","['Skaik, Younis', 'Vahlsing, Stefanie', 'Goudeva, Lilia', 'Eiz-Vesper, Britta', 'Battermann, Anja', 'Blasczyk, Rainer', 'Figueiredo, Constanca']","['Skaik Y', 'Vahlsing S', 'Goudeva L', 'Eiz-Vesper B', 'Battermann A', 'Blasczyk R', 'Figueiredo C']","['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granzymes/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3/blood/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/*immunology', 'Protein Isoforms/blood/immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation']",2014/06/12 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0098936 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-04772 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 11;9(2):e98936. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0098936. eCollection 2014.,,20140611,,PMC4053493,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BTK has been found to be important in the function of B-cell receptor signaling and therefore in the maintenance and expansion of various B-cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Targeting BTK with ibrutinib has been found to be an effective strategy in treating these malignancies. Phase I clinical testing in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and CLL showed that the drug was extremely well tolerated with no major dose-limiting toxicities and a 54% overall response rate. Subsequently, two phase Ib/II studies were performed on patients with CLL, one in relapsed/refractory CLL and one in previously untreated elderly patients with CLL. Both of these studies continued to show good tolerability of the drug and an overall response rate of about 71% with extended duration of response. Another phase II study using ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory MCL was conducted and also showed that it was well tolerated with an overall response rate of 68% and extended duration of response. Due to these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for ibrutinib in November 2013 for patients with MCL who had received at least one prior therapy and in February 2014 for patients with CLL who had received at least one prior therapy. This review will discuss the preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy to date of ibrutinib in the treatment of CLL and MCL.","['McDermott, J', 'Jimeno, A']","['McDermott J', 'Jimeno A']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Developmental Therapeutics Program, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.

Valproic acid (VPA) is an anti-epileptic drug that also acts as a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor. The aim of this research was to determine the anti-leukemic effects of dasatinib and VPA in combination and to identify their mechanism of action in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Dasatinib was found to exert potent synergistic inhibitory effects on VPA-treated AML cells in association with G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction involving the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, -7 and -9. Dasatinib/VPA-induced cell death thus occurred via caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK inhibitors efficiently inhibited dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis. The combined effect of dasatinib and VPA on the differentiation capacity of AML cells was more powerful than the effect of each drug alone, being sufficiently strong to promote AML cell death through G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK were found to control dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis as upstream regulators, and co-treatment with dasatinib and VPA to contribute to AML cell death through the regulation of differentiation capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that combined dasatinib and VPA treatment has a potential role in anti-leukemic therapy.","['Heo, Sook-Kyoung', 'Noh, Eui-Kyu', 'Yoon, Dong-Joon', 'Jo, Jae-Cheol', 'Park, Jae-Hoo', 'Kim, Hawk']","['Heo SK', 'Noh EK', 'Yoon DJ', 'Jo JC', 'Park JH', 'Kim H']","['Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Republic of Korea; Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2014/06/12 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0098859 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-01273 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 11;9(2):e98859. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0098859. eCollection 2014.,,20140611,,PMC4053340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such multiclass classification problems pose new methodological and computational challenges for developing novel and effective statistical approaches. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for classifying multiple disease states associated with cancer based on gene expression profiles. Our method focuses on detecting small sets of genes in which the relative comparison of their expression values leads to class discrimination. For an m-class problem, the classification rule typically depends on a small number of m-gene sets, which provide transparent decision boundaries and allow for potential biological interpretations. We first test our approach on seven common gene expression datasets and compare it with popular classification methods including support vector machines and random forests. We then consider an extremely large cohort of leukemia cancer patients to further assess its effectiveness. In both experiments, our method yields comparable or even better results to benchmark classifiers. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach can integrate pathway analysis of gene expression to provide accurate and biological meaningful classification.","['Yang, Sitan', 'Naiman, Daniel Q']","['Yang S', 'Naiman DQ']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Germany,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,101176023,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Support Vector Machine', '*Transcriptome']",2014/06/12 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/sagmb-2013-0053 [doi]', '/j/sagmb.ahead-of-print/sagmb-2013-0053/sagmb-2013-0053.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol. 2014 Aug;13(4):477-96. doi: 10.1515/sagmb-2013-0053.,"['UL1 RR025005/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR 025005/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4775275,,,,,['NIHMS757203'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Pleural effusion caused by leukemic infiltration is an unusual extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with fewer than 20 cases reported (1-11). We report a case of pericardial and pleural effusions in a patient with AML and review the literature. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: In this case, a 55-year-old man with previous history of myeloproliferative neoplasm experienced transformation AML, heralded by appearance of leukemic pleural effusions. The patient was identified to have leukemic pleural effusion based on the extended cytogenetic analysis of the pleural fluid, as morphologic analysis alone was insufficient. INTERVENTION: The patient was treated with hypomethylator-based and intensive chemotherapy strategies, both of which maintained resolution of the effusions in the remission setting. CONCLUSION: Due to the rarity of diagnosis of leukemic pleural effusions, both cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization testing are recommended. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy directed at the AML can lead to complete resolution of leukemic pleural effusions.","['Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Chang, Elaine', 'Daver, Naval', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey', 'Sabloff, Bradley', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Pemmaraju N', 'Chang E', 'Daver N', 'Patel K', 'Jorgensen J', 'Sabloff B', 'Verstovsek S', 'Borthakur G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2014/06/12 06:00,2014/06/12 06:01,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00130 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 Jun 2;4:130. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00130. eCollection 2014.,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20140602,,PMC4040935,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'extramedullary AML', 'malignant pleural effusion']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified five cases of potential donor leukemia cases during past five years. The precise mechanism of the origin of such leukemias, however, remains poorly defined. In this short communication, we report a well documented case of donor-derived de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that developed fourteen years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for treatment induced AML for his primary malignancy Immunoblastic lymphoma. This case allows us to postulate a possible mechanism of the origin of donor leukemia. The de novo AML clone contained a distinct cytogenetic abnormality, trisomy 11, which was simultaneously detected in preserved peripheral blood obtained at the time of transplantation as well as in the current bone marrow from an otherwise clinically and phenotypically normal donor. The findings from this unique case, provides insight into the process of leukemogenesis, and suggests that the sequence of events leading to leukemogenesis in this patient involved the senescence/apoptosis of normal donor hematopoietic cells due to telomere shortening resulting in the selective proliferation and transformation of this clone with MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) gene amplification.","['Dickson, Mark A', 'Papadopoulos, Esperanza B', 'Hedvat, Cyrus V', 'Jhanwar, Suresh C', 'Brentjens, Renier J']","['Dickson MA', 'Papadopoulos EB', 'Hedvat CV', 'Jhanwar SC', 'Brentjens RJ']","['Departments of Medicine (M.A.D., E.B.P., S.C.J., R.J.B.) and Pathology (S.C.J., C.V.H.), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, N.Y. 10065, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine (M.A.D., E.B.P., S.C.J., R.J.B.) and Pathology (S.C.J., C.V.H.), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, N.Y. 10065, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine (M.A.D., E.B.P., S.C.J., R.J.B.) and Pathology (S.C.J., C.V.H.), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, N.Y. 10065, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine (M.A.D., E.B.P., S.C.J., R.J.B.) and Pathology (S.C.J., C.V.H.), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, N.Y. 10065, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine (M.A.D., E.B.P., S.C.J., R.J.B.) and Pathology (S.C.J., C.V.H.), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, N.Y. 10065, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Leuk Res Rep,Leukemia research reports,101608906,,,,2014/06/12 06:00,2014/06/12 06:01,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.lrr.2014.04.001 [doi]', 'S2213-0489(14)00004-1 [pii]']",epublish,Leuk Res Rep. 2014 May 20;3(2):38-41. doi: 10.1016/j.lrr.2014.04.001. eCollection 2014.,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20140520,,PMC4050285,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute secondary leukemia', 'Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation', 'Donor leukemia', 'Origin of donor leukemia mechanism', 'Telomere length in translantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that the novel enhydrazinone ester CEE-1 (ethyl 4-phenylhydrazinocyclohex-3-en-2-oxo-6-phenyl-1-oate) possesses potent anti-inflammatory activity. We have now tested whether the compound also possesses antiallergic and antiasthmatic effects in vitro and in vivo. The compound significantly inhibited degranulation and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) release from activated human eosinophils, as well as IgE-dependent degranulation and LTC4 release from passively sensitized rat basophilic leukemia cells and bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells. In human eosinophils, the drug was more potent in inhibiting degranulation than LTC4 release {IC50 = 0.4 muM [confidence interval (CI): 0.1-0.9] versus 3.8 muM (CI: 0.9-8.3)}, whereas in mast cells the reverse was essentially the case. The drug did not affect stimulus-induced calcium transients in eosinophils but significantly inhibited early phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). In vivo, topical application of 4.5-15 mg/kg of the compound significantly inhibited allergen-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice. Similarly, in the mouse asthma model, the intranasal administration of 6.5-12.5 mg/kg of the compound significantly inhibited bronchial inflammation and eosinophil accumulation in bronchial lavage fluid, as well as abolishing airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine. These results show that CEE-1 inhibits the activation of both mast cells and eosinophils in vitro, probably by blocking MAPK-activation pathways, and that these effects are translated into antiallergic and antiasthmatic effects in vivo. The compound, therefore, has potential application in the treatment of asthma and other allergic diseases.","['Ezeamuzie, Charles I', 'El-Hashim, Ahmed Z', 'Renno, Waleed M', 'Edafiogho, Ivan O']","['Ezeamuzie CI', 'El-Hashim AZ', 'Renno WM', 'Edafiogho IO']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine (C.I.E.), Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy (A.Z.E.-H.), and Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine (W.M.R.), Kuwait University, Kuwait City, Kuwait; and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Saint Joseph, Hartford, Connecticut (I.O.E.) ezeamuzie@hsc.edu.kw.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine (C.I.E.), Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy (A.Z.E.-H.), and Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine (W.M.R.), Kuwait University, Kuwait City, Kuwait; and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Saint Joseph, Hartford, Connecticut (I.O.E.).', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine (C.I.E.), Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy (A.Z.E.-H.), and Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine (W.M.R.), Kuwait University, Kuwait City, Kuwait; and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Saint Joseph, Hartford, Connecticut (I.O.E.).', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine (C.I.E.), Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy (A.Z.E.-H.), and Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine (W.M.R.), Kuwait University, Kuwait City, Kuwait; and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Saint Joseph, Hartford, Connecticut (I.O.E.).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Anti-Asthmatic Agents)', '0 (Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids)', '0 (Phenylhydrazines)', '0 (ethyl 4-phenylhydrazinocyclohex-3-en-2-oxo-6-phenyl-1-oate)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/physiology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Leukotriene C4/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis/drug effects', 'Phenylhydrazines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats']",2014/06/12 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.114.213751 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.114.213751 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2014 Aug;350(2):444-54. doi: 10.1124/jpet.114.213751.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the prevalence and impact of comorbidities in patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27). METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, a total of 349 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PMF who presented to the study institution from 2000 to 2008 were evaluated. The authors evaluated the frequency and severity of comorbidities in these patients and assessed their impact on survival in a bivariable model that included the ACE-27 and Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System scores as covariates. RESULTS: Approximately 64% of patients had at least 1 comorbid condition, and diseases of the cardiovascular system (63%) were most common. Comorbidities had a significant negative impact on survival (P < .001). Patients with severe comorbidities had twice the risk of death as those with no comorbidities. When stratified by demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidities were found to be significantly associated with worse survival in patients aged < 65 years (P < .001) and those with an ECOG performance status < 1 (P < .001). In a multivariable model that included the ACE-27 and Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System scores, comorbidities retained a significant association with shorter survival (P </= .001). CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of comorbid conditions in patients with PMF, particularly those who are younger and with a good performance status, has important implications for overall prognosis and treatment planning.","['Newberry, Kate J', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Nguyen, Khanh T', 'Cardenas-Turanzas, Marylou', 'Florencia Tanaka, Maria', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Newberry KJ', 'Naqvi K', 'Nguyen KT', 'Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Florencia Tanaka M', 'Pierce S', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', '*Comorbidity', 'Endocrine System Diseases/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",2014/06/12 06:00,2014/11/08 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28857 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Oct 1;120(19):2996-3002. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28857.

Approximately 30% of CLL patients express a stereotypic BCR, which may indicate that specific antigenic stimulation is driving CLL pathogenesis. Recently, it was reported that BCRs from CLL cells are capable of antigen-independent, cell-autonomous signaling, through recognition of an internal framework 2 (FR2) BCR epitope. We hypothesized that the level of cell-autonomous signaling may differ between CLL subgroups. Therefore, we analyzed Ca(2+) signaling in a series of primary stereotypic or heterogeneous U-CLL and M-CLL (n=68) and healthy controls (n=14). We confirmed that basal Ca(2+) signaling in CLL cells is higher than in normal B cells. Interestingly, we found that basal signaling was particularly increased in M-CLL. The degree of basal signaling did not correlate with membrane immunoglobulin levels, HCDR3 characteristics or FR2/FR3 sequence. We conclude that the level of basal Ca(2+) signaling is not uniformly enhanced in CLL B cells, but is associated with CLL immunoglobulin heavy chain V mutational status, reflecting a distinct cellular origin and possibly a different anergic state induced by repetitive or continuous antigen binding in vivo.","['Muggen, A F', 'Pillai, S Y', 'Kil, L P', 'van Zelm, M C', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Hendriks, R W', 'Langerak, A W']","['Muggen AF', 'Pillai SY', 'Kil LP', 'van Zelm MC', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Hendriks RW', 'Langerak AW']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', '*Calcium Signaling', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/chemistry', 'Immunoglobulins/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phylogeny']",2014/06/12 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014188 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.188 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Feb;29(2):321-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.188.

However, earlier studies have several potentially important limitations. To overcome some of these, we investigated hospital contact rates, and predictors thereof, among 5-year survivors of ALL in a population-based setting, and compared them to a control cohort regarding outcome measures from a comprehensive nation-wide health register. METHODS: All individuals diagnosed with ALL before the age of 18 in Southern Sweden during 1970-1999 and alive January 2007 (n=213; male=107) were identified through the Swedish Cancer Register. Each subject was matched to fifty controls, identified in the Swedish Population Register. All study subjects were linked to the National Hospital Register and detailed information was obtained on all hospital contacts (hospital admissions and outpatients visits) starting five years after cancer diagnosis, and the corresponding date for the controls, until 2009. RESULTS: The median follow-up among the 5-year survivors of ALL was 16 years (range 5-33), accruing a total of 3,527 person-years. Of the 213 5-year survivors, 105 (49.3%) had at least one hospital contact compared to 3,634 (34.1%) of the controls (p<0.001). Survivors had more hospital contacts (3 [1-6] vs. 2 [1-4] contacts, p<0.001) and more total days in hospital (6 [2-18] vs. 3 [1-7] days, p<0.001) than the controls during the study period. Logistic regression analysis showed that survivors treated with cranial irradiation and/or total body irradiation (45% and 7%, respectively) had an increased risk of at least one hospital contact (OR 2.3, 95%CI; 1.5-3.6 and OR 11.0, 95%CI; 3.2-50.7, respectively), while there was no significant difference between the non-irradiated survivors and controls. CONCLUSIONS: We show that irradiated survivors of childhood ALL have an increased morbidity measured in terms of hospital contacts, in comparison to non-irradiated survivors and controls, while non-irradiated survivors have not. These findings are encouraging regarding the future morbidity of children currently treated for ALL, as radiotherapy is necessary only for a minority of these.","['Holmqvist, Anna Sallfors', 'Moell, Christian', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Lindgren, Anna', 'Garwicz, Stanislaw', 'Wiebe, Thomas', 'Ora, Ingrid']","['Holmqvist AS', 'Moell C', 'Hjorth L', 'Lindgren A', 'Garwicz S', 'Wiebe T', 'Ora I']","['Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. anna.sallfors-holmqvist@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors', 'Sweden', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/12 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-419 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-419 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jun 10;14:419. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-419.,,20140610,,PMC4059084,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

24916915,NLM,MEDLINE,20150420,20211021,2211-3436 (Electronic) 2211-3428 (Linking),37,3,2014 Jun,Identification of GPM6A and GPM6B as potential new human lymphoid leukemia-associated oncogenes.,179-91,10.1007/s13402-014-0171-y [doi],"BACKGROUND: Previously, we found that the Graffi murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is able to induce a wide spectrum of hematologic malignancies in vivo. Using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays, we established the gene expression profiles of several of these malignancies, thereby specifically focusing on genes deregulated in the lymphoid sub-types. We observed over-expression of a variety of genes, including Arntl2, Bfsp2, Gfra2, Gpm6a, Gpm6b, Nln, Fbln1, Bmp7, Etv5 and Celsr1 and, in addition, provided evidence that Fmn2 and Parm-1 may act as novel oncogenes. In the present study, we assessed the expression patterns of eight selected human homologs of these genes in primary human B-cell malignancies, and explored the putative oncogenic potential of GPM6A and GPM6B. METHODS: The gene expression levels of the selected human homologs were tested in human B-cell malignancies by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The protein expression profiles of human GPM6A and GPM6B were analyzed by Western blotting. The localization and the effect of GPM6A and GPM6B on the cytoskeleton were determined using confocal and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. To confirm the oncogenic potential of GPM6A and GPM6B, classical colony formation assays in soft agar and focus forming assays were used. The effects of these proteins on the cell cycle were assessed by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we found that most of the primary B-cell malignancies assessed showed altered expression patterns of the genes tested, including GPM6A and GPM6B. Using confocal microscopy, we found that the GPM6A protein (isoform 3) exhibits a punctate cytoplasmic localization and that the GPM6B protein (isoform 4) exhibits a peri-nuclear and punctate cytoplasmic localization. Interestingly, we found that exogenous over-expression of both proteins in NIH/3T3 cells alters the actin and microtubule networks and induces the formation of long filopodia-like protrusions. Additionally, we found that these over-expressing NIH/3T3 cells exhibit anchorage-independent growth and enhanced proliferation rates. Cellular transformation (i.e., loss of contact inhibition) was, however, only observed after exogenous over-expression of GPM6B. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that several human homologs of the genes found to be deregulated in Graffi MuLV experimental mouse models may serve as candidate biomarkers for human B-cell malignancies. In addition, we found that GPM6A and GPM6B may act as novel oncogenes in the development of these malignancies.","['Charfi, Cyndia', 'Edouard, Elsy', 'Rassart, Eric']","['Charfi C', 'Edouard E', 'Rassart E']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire, Departement des Sciences Biologiques, Centre BioMed, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Case Postale 8888, Succursale Centre-ville, Montreal, QC, H3C-3P8, Canada, charfi.cyndia@courrier.uqam.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,"['0 (GPM6A protein, human)', '0 (GPM6B protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2014/06/12 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13402-014-0171-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2014 Jun;37(3):179-91. doi: 10.1007/s13402-014-0171-y.

Binding of BLV to its cellular receptor is mediated by the surface envelope glycoprotein subunit (SU). Previous studies have identified eight different epitopes (A through H) on the BLV SU. In this study, a new sequential epitope was identified using the monoclonal antibody 2G7 (MAb 2G7) on the C-terminal region of the BLV SU. To localise and refine the map of this epitope, a series of deleted forms in the C and N-terminal ends of the glycoprotein were made and synthesised in baculovirus and Escherichia coli expression systems. The synthetic proteins were analysed both in Western blot and MAb-capture ELISA assays. MAb 2G7 recognised a stretch of 11 amino acids, named epitope E', corresponding to residues 189-SDWVPSVRSWA-199 (comprising the 33 amino acids signal peptide) overlapping with the E epitope of the SU. The data obtained by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) revealed that the E' epitope was hidden on whole BLV particles and that the variation in reactivity between epitope E' and MAb 2G7 depends on the glycosylation state of SU. Similarly, the analysis of immunological data evidenced that the failure of interaction between the MAb anti-DD' and its epitope was also due to a steric hindrance of the glycosylation. Finally, the ELISA assay analysis performed with the deleted and mutated forms of rSU evidenced that the conformational epitopes F, G and H lied into in the 34-173 amino-acids residues of N-terminal region of SU.","['Forti, Katia', 'Rizzo, Giorgia', 'Cagiola, Monica', 'Ferrante, Giovanna', 'Marini, Carla', 'Feliziani, Francesco', 'Pezzotti, Giovanni', 'De Giuseppe, Antonio']","['Forti K', 'Rizzo G', 'Cagiola M', 'Ferrante G', 'Marini C', 'Feliziani F', 'Pezzotti G', 'De Giuseppe A']","[""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell' Umbria e delle Marche, Perugia, Italy."", ""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell' Umbria e delle Marche, Perugia, Italy."", ""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell' Umbria e delle Marche, Perugia, Italy."", ""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell' Umbria e delle Marche, Perugia, Italy."", ""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell' Umbria e delle Marche, Perugia, Italy."", ""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell' Umbria e delle Marche, Perugia, Italy."", ""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell' Umbria e delle Marche, Perugia, Italy."", ""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell' Umbria e delle Marche, Perugia, Italy.

To establish the potential pathogenic role of miRNAs, the identification of deregulated miRNAs in CLL is crucial. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed the expression of 723 mature miRNAs in 217 early-stage CLL cases and in various different normal B-cell subpopulations from tonsils and peripheral blood. RESULTS: Our analyses indicated that CLL cells exhibited a miRNA expression pattern that was most similar to the subsets of antigen-experienced and marginal zone-like B cells. These normal subpopulations were used as reference to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in comparison with CLL. Differences related to the expression of 25 miRNAs were found to be independent from IGHV mutation status or cytogenetic aberrations. These differences, confirmed in an independent validation set, led to a novel comprehensive description of miRNAs potentially involved in CLL. We also identified miRNAs whose expression was distinctive of cases with mutated versus unmutated IGHV genes or cases with 13q, 11q, and 17p deletions and trisomy 12. Finally, analysis of clinical data in relation to miRNA expression revealed that miR26a, miR532-3p, miR146-5p, and miR29c* were strongly associated with progression-free survival. CONCLUSION: This study provides novel information on miRNAs expressed by CLL and normal B-cell subtypes, with implication on the cell of origin of CLL. In addition, our findings indicate a number of deregulated miRNAs in CLL, which may play a pathogenic role and promote disease progression. Collectively, this information can be used for developing miRNA-based therapeutic strategies in CLL.","['Negrini, Massimo', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Bassi, Cristian', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Zagatti, Barbara', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Ferracin, Manuela', ""D'Abundo, Lucilla"", 'Saccenti, Elena', 'Matis, Serena', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Bossio, Sabrina', 'Reverberi, Daniele', 'Rigolin, Gianmatteo', 'Calin, George A', 'Sabbioni, Silvia', 'Russo, Giandomenico', 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Negrini M', 'Cutrona G', 'Bassi C', 'Fabris S', 'Zagatti B', 'Colombo M', 'Ferracin M', ""D'Abundo L"", 'Saccenti E', 'Matis S', 'Lionetti M', 'Agnelli L', 'Gentile M', 'Recchia AG', 'Bossio S', 'Reverberi D', 'Rigolin G', 'Calin GA', 'Sabbioni S', 'Russo G', 'Tassone P', 'Morabito F', 'Ferrarini M', 'Neri A']","['Dipartimento di Morfologia, Chirurgia e Medicina Sperimentale, Laboratorio per Tecnologie delle Terapie Avanzate, Tecnopolo, ngm@unife.it.', 'IRCCS San Martino-IST, Genova;', 'Dipartimento di Morfologia, Chirurgia e Medicina Sperimentale.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e di Comunita, Universita di Milano and UOC Oncoematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Milano;', 'Dipartimento di Morfologia, Chirurgia e Medicina Sperimentale.', 'IRCCS San Martino-IST, Genova;', 'Dipartimento di Morfologia, Chirurgia e Medicina Sperimentale, Laboratorio per Tecnologie delle Terapie Avanzate, Tecnopolo.', 'Dipartimento di Morfologia, Chirurgia e Medicina Sperimentale.', ""Sezione di Ematologia e Fisiopatologia dell'Emostasi, Azienda Universita Ospedale di Ferrara, Ferrara;"", 'IRCCS San Martino-IST, Genova;', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e di Comunita, Universita di Milano and UOC Oncoematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Milano;', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e di Comunita, Universita di Milano and UOC Oncoematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Milano;', 'Dipartimento di Oncoematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza;', 'Dipartimento di Oncoematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza;', 'Dipartimento di Oncoematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza;', 'IRCCS San Martino-IST, Genova;', ""Sezione di Ematologia e Fisiopatologia dell'Emostasi, Azienda Universita Ospedale di Ferrara, Ferrara;"", 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita e Biotecnologie, Universita di Ferrara;', ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, Roma;"", 'Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Clinica, Magna Graecia University, Catanzaro, Italy; and.', 'Dipartimento di Oncoematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza;', 'IRCCS San Martino-IST, Genova;', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e di Comunita, Universita di Milano and UOC Oncoematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Milano;']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Trisomy/genetics']",2014/06/12 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-2497 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2497 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Aug 1;20(15):4141-53. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2497.

Whether baseline gene expression can identify patients who will benefit from immunochemotherapy over chemotherapy alone has not been determined. We assessed genome-wide expression of 300 pretreatment specimens from a subset of 552 patients in REACH, a study of FC or R-FC in relapsed CLL. An independent test set was derived from 282 pretreatment specimens from CLL8, a study of FC or R-FC in treatment-naive patients. Genes specific for benefit from R-FC were determined by assessing treatment-gene interactions in Cox proportional hazards models. REACH patients with higher pretreatment protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) messenger RNA levels derived greater benefit from R-FC, with significant improvements in progression-free survival, independent of known prognostic factors in a multivariate model. Examination of PTK2 gene expression in CLL8 patients yielded similar results. Furthermore, PTK2 inhibition blunted R-dependent cell death in vitro.

Cattle were divided into two groups, EBL and BLV-infected, based on meat inspection data. The number of BLV copies in all specimens of EBL cattle was significantly higher than those of BLV-infected cattle (p < 0.0001), and the number of BLV copies in the lymph nodes was particularly large. Over 70 % of the superficial cervical, medial iliac and jejunal lymph nodes from EBL cattle had more than 1,000 copies/10 ng DNA, whereas lymph nodes from BLV-infected cattle did not. These findings suggest that the cattle harboring more than 1,000 BLV copies may be diagnosed with EBL.","['Somura, Yoshiko', 'Sugiyama, Emi', 'Fujikawa, Hiroshi', 'Murakami, Kenji']","['Somura Y', 'Sugiyama E', 'Fujikawa H', 'Murakami K']","['Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 169-0073, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/pathology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Lymph Nodes/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Viral Load/*genetics', 'Virus Latency']",2014/06/12 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00705-014-2137-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 2014 Oct;159(10):2693-7. doi: 10.1007/s00705-014-2137-9.

This study investigates the cytotoxicity of DS/Cu complex in lymphoid malignant cell lines in vitro and in vivo. METHOD: Raji cells were subjected to different treatments and thereafter MTT assay, flow cytometry were used to determine IC50 and apoptotic status. We also tested the cytotoxicity of DS/Cu in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Molt4 in vitro. In vivo experiments were also performed to demonstrate the anticancer efficacy of DS/Cu in Raji cells xenografted nude mice. RESULTS: In combination with a low concentration (1 muM) of Cu2+, DS induced cytotoxicity in Raji cells with an IC50 of 0.085 +/- 0.015 muM and in Molt4 cells with an IC50 of 0.435 +/- 0.109 muM. The results of our animal experiments also showed that the mean tumor volume in DS/Cu-treated mice was significantly smaller than that in DS or control group, indicating that DS/Cu inhibits the proliferation of Raji cells in vivo. DS/Cu also induced apoptosis in 2 lymphoid malignant cell lines. After exposure to DS (3.3 muM)/Cu (1 muM) for 24 hours, apoptosis was detected in 81.03 +/- 7.91% of Raji cells. DS/Cu induced significant apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner with the highest apoptotic proportion (DS/Cu: 89.867 +/- 4.69%) at a concentration of 2 muM in Molt4 cells. After 24 h exposure, DS/Cu inhibits Nrf2 expression. Flow cytometric analysis shows that DS/Cu induced ROS generation. DS/Cu induced phosphorylation of JNK and inhibits p65 expression as well as Nrf2 expression both in vitro and in vivo. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, can partially attenuate DS/Cu complex-induced apoptosis and block JNK activation in vitro. In addition, NAC is able to restore Nrf2 nuclear translocation and p65 expression. CONCLUSION: Our study manifests that DS/Cu complex targets lymphoid malignant cells in vitro and in vivo. Generation of ROS might be one of core steps in DS/Cu induced apoptosis. Moreover, ROS-related activation of JNK pathway and inhibition of NF-kappaB and Nrf2 may also contribute to the DS/Cu induced apoptosis.","['Zha, Jie', 'Chen, Feili', 'Dong, Huijuan', 'Shi, Pengcheng', 'Yao, Yao', 'Zhang, Yanyan', 'Li, Rongwei', 'Wang, Shiyun', 'Li, Peng', 'Wang, Weiguang', 'Xu, Bing']","['Zha J', 'Chen F', 'Dong H', 'Shi P', 'Yao Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Li R', 'Wang S', 'Li P', 'Wang W', 'Xu B']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. xubingzhangjian@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'TR3MLJ1UAI (Disulfiram)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disulfiram/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2014/06/12 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-12-163 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-12-163 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2014 Jun 11;12:163. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-12-163.,,20140611,,PMC4075939,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Between August 2009 and December 2012, 30 children (<16 years old) with newly diagnosed CN-AML were included. The clinical characteristics were analyzed in these patients. PCR combined with direct sequencing was used to detect NPM1, CEBPA gene mutations. All the data were statistically analyzed using SPSS17.0 software. RESULT: The gene mutations were detected in each of the 30 patients. NPM1 mutation was positive in three patients (10%) with type A mutation, while CEBPA mutation was positive in two patients (6.7%) with double mutations (TAD, bZIP) . Besides, FLT3/ITD mutation was positive in three patients. Patients with NPM1 or FLT3/ITD had a significantly elevated diagnostic WBC count with a median diagnostic WBC count of 102.80x10(9)/L compared with 18.56x10(9)/L for the patients without mutations(t = 2.353, P = 0.043), as well as the marrow blast percentage (94.0% vs. 80.0%, t = 3.804, P = 0.002). The complete remission was achieved in all the 3 patients with NPM1 mutations and 2 patients with CEBPA mutations. All the patients with these mutations also achieved 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and 2-year overall survival (OS), while 2-year EFS and 2-year OS of the other patients were (40.1 +/- 11.2)% and (51.8 +/- 10.9)% (P = 0.044, 0.091, respectively).

Nonetheless, the prognostic value of reciprocal 13q14 translocations [t(13q)] with related 13q losses has not been fully elucidated. We described clinical and biological characteristics of 25 CLL patients with t(13q), and compared with 62 patients carrying interstitial del(13q) by conventional G-banding cytogenetics (CGC) [i-del(13q)] and 295 patients with del(13q) only detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [F-del(13q)]. Besides from the CLL FISH panel (D13S319, CEP12, ATM, TP53), we studied RB1 deletions in all t(13q) cases and a representative group of i-del(13q) and F-del(13q). We analyzed NOTCH1, SF3B1, and MYD88 mutations in t(13q) cases by Sanger sequencing. In all, 25 distinct t(13q) were described. All these cases showed D13S319 deletion while 32% also lost RB1. The median percentage of 13q-deleted nuclei did not differ from i-del(13q) patients (73% vs. 64%), but both were significantly higher than F-del(13q) (52%, P < 0.001). Moreover, t(13q) patients showed an increased incidence of biallelic del(13q) (52% vs. 11.3% and 14.9%, P < 0.001) and higher rates of concomitant 17p deletion (37.5% vs. 8.6% and 7.2%, P < 0.001). RB1 involvement was significantly higher in the i-del(13q) group (79%, P < 0.001). Two t(13q) patients (11.8%) carried NOTCH1 mutations. Time to first treatment in t(13q) and i-del(13q) was shorter than F-del(13q) (67, 44, and 137 months, P = 0.029), and preserved significance in the multivariate analysis. In conclusion, t(13q) and del(13q) patients detected by CGC constitute a subgroup within the 13q-deleted CLL patients associated with a worse clinical outcome.","['Puiggros, Anna', 'Venturas, Marta', 'Salido, Marta', 'Blanco, Gonzalo', 'Fernandez-Rodriguez, Concepcion', 'Collado, Rosa', 'Valiente, Alberto', 'Ruiz-Xiville, Neus', 'Carrio, Ana', 'Ortuno, Francisco Jose', 'Luno, Elisa', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Ardanaz, Maria Teresa', 'Pinan, Maria Angeles', 'Talavera, Elisabet', 'Gonzalez, Maria Teresa', 'Ortega, Margarita', 'Marugan, Isabel', 'Ferrer, Ana', 'Gimeno, Eva', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Hernandez, Jose Angel', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria', 'Espinet, Blanca']","['Puiggros A', 'Venturas M', 'Salido M', 'Blanco G', 'Fernandez-Rodriguez C', 'Collado R', 'Valiente A', 'Ruiz-Xiville N', 'Carrio A', 'Ortuno FJ', 'Luno E', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Ardanaz MT', 'Pinan MA', 'Talavera E', 'Gonzalez MT', 'Ortega M', 'Marugan I', 'Ferrer A', 'Gimeno E', 'Bellosillo B', 'Delgado J', 'Hernandez JA', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Espinet B']","['Laboratori de Citogenetica Molecular, Laboratori de Citologia Hematologica, Servei de Patologia, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain; Grup de Recerca Translacional en Neoplasies Hematologiques, Cancer Res Program, IMIM-Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2014/06/12 06:00,2015/02/27 06:00,['2014/06/12 06:00'],"['2014/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22188 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Sep;53(9):788-97. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22188.

We report results from a study designed to assess the comparability of the two alignment strategies. DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty follow-up samples from chronic myeloid leukemia patients were included. Two commercial methods calibrated on the genetic reference panel were compared to two conversion factor methods routinely used at Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, and at Lille University Hospital. Results were matched against concordance criteria (i.e., obtaining at least two of the three following landmarks: 50, 75 and 90% of the patient samples within a 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold range, respectively). RESULTS: Out of the 60 samples, more than 32 were available for comparison. Compared to the conversion factor method, the two commercial methods were within a 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold range for 53 and 59%, 89 and 88%, 100 and 97%, respectively of the samples analyzed at Saint-Louis. At Lille, results were 45 and 85%, 76 and 97%, 100 and 100%, respectively. Agreements between methods were observed in the four comparisons performed. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the two commercial methods selected are concordant with the conversion factor methods. This study brings the proof of principle that alignment on the international scale using the genetic reference panel is compatible with the patient sample exchange procedure. We believe that these results are particularly important for diagnostic laboratories wishing to adopt commercial methods.","['Maute, Carole', 'Nibourel, Olivier', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Coiteux, Valerie', 'Grardel, Nathalie', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel']","['Maute C', 'Nibourel O', 'Rea D', 'Coiteux V', 'Grardel N', 'Preudhomme C', 'Cayuela JM']","['Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHRU, Lille, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology Immunology Oncology, University Hospital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, CHRU Lille, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHRU, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, CHRU, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France; EA3518, University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.

The use of tools to assess the Quality of Life Health Related (HRQOL) has increased in recent decades. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most commonly diagnosed primary immunodeficiency. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of life in patients with CVID using the questionnaire SF -36. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional survey included 23 patients diagnosed with CVID, belonging to the Immunodeficiency Clinic Service of Allergology and Clinical Immunology in CMN Siglo XXI, IMSS. The questionnaire SF- 36 validated in Spanish was applied. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: descriptive statistics with simple frequencies and percentages, inferential statistics: Fisher exact test and ANOVA to compare means. RESULTS: The study involved 23 patients, 14 women (60%) and 9 men (40%), mean age 38.6 +/- 14.7 years. The highest score was obtained in 83% emotional role. Dimensions with further deterioration in both genders were: 54% general health, vitality 59% and physical performance 72%. No differences were found regarding gender. The only issue in which statistically significant differences were found in patients with more than 3 comorbidities was change in health status in the past year (p=0.007). Patients with severe comorbidities, such as haematologicaloncological (leukemias, lymphomas, neoplasms), and pulmonary (severe bronchiectasis) showed further deterioration in the aspects of physical performance 73% and 64% emotional role. 65% of patients reported an improvement in health status in 74% in the last year. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with CVID show deterioration in different dimensions, particularly in the areas of general health, vitality and physical performance. Patients with severe comorbidities such as leukemia, lymphomas, malignancies and severe bronchiectasis show further deterioration in some aspects of quality of life, especially in physical performance and emotional role. A higher number of comorbidities was significantly associated with a lower score in changing health. The questionnaire SF-36 is useful for evaluating the quality of life of our patients with CVID.","['Lopez-Perez, Patricia', 'Miranda-Novales, Guadalupe', 'Segura-Mendez, Nora Hilda', 'Del Rivero-Hernandez, Leonel', 'Cambray-Gutierrez, Cesar', 'Chavez-Garcia, Aurora']","['Lopez-Perez P', 'Miranda-Novales G', 'Segura-Mendez NH', 'Del Rivero-Hernandez L', 'Cambray-Gutierrez C', 'Chavez-Garcia A']","['Servicio de Alergia e Inmunologia Clinica, Hospital de Especialidades Dr. Bernardo Sepulveda Gutierrez, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico, DF. pati333@hotmail.com.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Rev Alerg Mex,"Revista alergia Mexico (Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico : 1993)",9438824,,IM,"['Adult', '*Common Variable Immunodeficiency/diagnosis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life', '*Surveys and Questionnaires']",2014/06/11 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Alerg Mex. 2014 Apr-Jun;61(2):52-8.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Common variable immunodeficiency', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaire SF-36']",,,,,,,,Estudio de la calidad de vida en pacientes adultos con inmunodeficiencia comun variable usando el Cuestionario SF-36.,,,,,,,

Rapamycin also extends lifespan in experimental animals. Because AICAR is a relatively weak activator of p53, we investigated whether stimulation of p53 by the strong activator actinomycin D is also sensitive to the inhibitory effect of rapamycin. In A549 lung cancer cells, activation of p53 by actinomycin D was associated with phosphorylation of p53 on Ser46. Rapamycin inhibited the accumulation of phospho-Ser46 p53, attenuated upregulation of some p53 target genes, and altered cell-cycle progression. Moreover, in cells exposed to actinomycin D, rapamycin attenuated the accumulation of PML, a protein that in some conditions stimulates Ser46 phosphorylation. However, Ser46 phosphorylation was not diminished in PML-knockdown cells, suggesting that in our system PML does not play a major role in stimulating p53 phosphorylation on Ser46. Knockdown of p53 diminished the upregulation of PML by stress-inducing agents, consistent with the idea that PML is a p53-regulated gene. Our data suggest that the attenuation of p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 may play a significant role in the biological activity of anti-aging rapamycin.","['Krzesniak, Malgorzata', 'Zajkowicz, Artur', 'Matuszczyk, Iwona', 'Rusin, Marek']","['Krzesniak M', 'Zajkowicz A', 'Matuszczyk I', 'Rusin M']","['Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska - Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, 44-101 Gliwice, Poland.', 'Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska - Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, 44-101 Gliwice, Poland.', 'Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska - Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, 44-101 Gliwice, Poland.', 'Center for Translational Research and Molecular Biology of Cancer, Maria Sklodowska - Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, 44-101 Gliwice, Poland.

They have been shown to confer worse prognosis in some of these entities. Notably, about 2/3 of these mutations are missense mutations in codon R882 of the gene. We aimed at the development and validation of a novel easily applicable in routine practice method for quantitative detection of the DNMT3A p.R882C/H/R/S mutations bead-based suspension assay. Initial testing on plasmid constructs showed excellent performance of BNA(NC)-modified probes with an optimal hybridization temperature of 66 degrees C. The method appeared to be quantitative and showed sensitivity of 2.5% for different mutant alleles, making it significantly superior to direct sequencing. The assay was further validated on plasmid standards at different ratios between wild type and mutant alleles and on clinical samples from 120 patients with known or suspected myeloid malignancies. This is the first report on the quantitative detection of DNMT3A R882 mutations using bead-based suspension assay with BNA(NC)-modified probes. Our data showed that it could be successfully implemented in the diagnostic work-up for patients with myeloid malignancies, as it is rapid, easy and reliable in terms of specificity and sensitivity.","['Shivarov, Velizar', 'Ivanova, Milena', 'Naumova, Elissaveta']","['Shivarov V', 'Ivanova M', 'Naumova E']","['Laboratory of Hematopathology and Immunology, National Hematology Hospital, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Alexandrovska University Hospital, Medical University, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Alexandrovska University Hospital, Medical University, Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'DNA Probes/*metabolism', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', '*Microspheres', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/genetics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards']",2014/06/11 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0099769 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-16528 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 10;9(6):e99769. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0099769. eCollection 2014.,,20140610,,PMC4051762,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the effect of lycopene in the free and encapsulated forms on the telomerase activity in human leukemia cell line K562 have not been investigated. The aim of the present study was to prepare a novel lycopene-loaded nanosphere and compare its anti-telomearse activity in K562 cell line with those of free lycopene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lycopene-loaded nanospheres were prepared by nanoprecipitation method. The lycopene entrapment efficacy was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The anti-proliferation effect of the lycopene in the free and encapsulated forms in the different times (0-72 h) and the different doses (0-100 mug/ml) on K562 cell line was studied using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. The changes of telomerase activity, following treatment with the lycopene in the free and encapsulated forms, were detected using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The entrapment efficacy of lycopene was 78.5% +/- 2. Treatment of the K562 cell line with lycopene, in particular in encapsulated form, resulted in a significant inhibition of the cell growth and increasing of percentage of apoptotic cells. It has also been observed that the telomerase activity in the lycopene-loaded nanospheres-treated cells was significantly inhibited in a dose and time-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a novel mechanism in the anti-cancer activity of the lycopene, in particular in encapsulated form, and could be provided a basis for the future development of anti-telomerase therapies.","['Gharib, Amir', 'Faezizadeh, Zohreh']","['Gharib A', 'Faezizadeh Z']","['Department of Laboratory Sciences, Borujerd Branch, Islamic Azad University, Borujerd, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Sciences, Borujerd Branch, Islamic Azad University, Borujerd, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Pharmacogn Mag,Pharmacognosy magazine,101300403,,,,2014/06/11 06:00,2014/06/11 06:01,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2012/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0973-1296.127368 [doi]', 'PM-10-157 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogn Mag. 2014 Jan;10(Suppl 1):S157-63. doi: 10.4103/0973-1296.127368.,,,,PMC4047593,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'K562', 'lycopene', 'nanosphere', 'telomerase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Water extracts of willow leaves were prepared for this studies in different level of nitrogen nutrition. RESULTS: The extracts obtained from the leaves and stem exhibited anti-leukemic activities prominently. The crude hot water extracts of the young growing parts including apex, matured leaves and stem, killed the blasts of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, (HL60 and NB4) after 48h incubation, however, such desperation was far less in the root extract. Similar to the plant parts, response of extracts obtained from different willow species was not identical; the proportion of dead cells relative to whole cells of the culture medium ranged from 21% to 93% among the species. Leaf extracts obtained from the responsive willow species decreased the live cell percentage and increased the dead cell percentage at higher level of nitrogen nutrition. The mode of desperation of leaf extract treated AML cells in such species appeared to be cell apoptosis as shown by binding with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled Annexin V. CONCLUSION: Differentiation of alive AML cells continued unabated and apoptosis was poor when extract of an unresponsive species added to the culture medium.","['Fujita, Kounosuke', 'Nomura, Yuji', 'Sawajiri, Masahiko', 'Mohapatra, Pravat K', 'El-Shemy, Hany A', 'Nguyen, Nguyen T', 'Hosokawa, Masashi', 'Miyashita, Kazuo', 'Maeda, Teruo', 'Saneoka, Hirofumi', 'Fujita, Shohei', 'Fujita, Takayuki']","['Fujita K', 'Nomura Y', 'Sawajiri M', 'Mohapatra PK', 'El-Shemy HA', 'Nguyen NT', 'Hosokawa M', 'Miyashita K', 'Maeda T', 'Saneoka H', 'Fujita S', 'Fujita T']","['Fazenda Fuiita LLC, Nanaehama, HOkuto, 049-0111, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima - 734-0037, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima - 734-0037, Japan.', 'School of Life Science, Sambalpur University, Jyoti Vihar, Sambalpur, India.', 'Cairo Universty Research Park, Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University,12613 Giza, Egypt.', 'Graduate School of Biosphere Science, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8528, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Fisheriers Sciences, Hokkaido University, Minato, Hakodate, 041-8611, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Fisheriers Sciences, Hokkaido University, Minato, Hakodate, 041-8611, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Biosphere Science, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8528, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Biosphere Science, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8528, Japan.', 'Fazenda Fuiita LLC, Nanaehama, HOkuto, 049-0111, Japan.', 'Fazenda Fuiita LLC, Nanaehama, HOkuto, 049-0111, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Pharmacogn Mag,Pharmacognosy magazine,101300403,,,,2014/06/11 06:00,2014/06/11 06:01,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2012/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0973-1296.131023 [doi]', 'PM-10-125 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogn Mag. 2014 Apr;10(38):125-31. doi: 10.4103/0973-1296.131023.,,,,PMC4048558,['NOTNLM'],"['Annexin V', 'Japanese willow tree species', 'apoptosis', 'differentiation', 'leukemia cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL with high-level miR-155 expressed lower levels of Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 and were more responsive to B-cell receptor (BCR) ligation than CLL with low-level miR-155. Transfection with miR-155 enhanced responsiveness to BCR ligation, whereas transfection with a miR-155 inhibitor had the opposite effect. CLL in lymphoid tissue expressed higher levels of miR155HG than CLL in the blood of the same patient. Also, isolated CD5(bright)CXCR4(dim) cells, representing CLL that had been newly released from the microenvironment, expressed higher levels of miR-155 and were more responsive to BCR ligation than isolated CD5(dim)CXCR4(bright) cells of the same patient. Treatment of CLL or normal B cells with CD40-ligand or B-cell-activating factor upregulated miR-155 and enhanced sensitivity to BCR ligation, effects that could be blocked by inhibitors to miR-155. This study demonstrates that the sensitivity to BCR ligation can be enhanced by high-level expression of miR-155, which in turn can be induced by crosstalk within the tissue microenvironment, potentially contributing to its association with adverse clinical outcome in patients with CLL.","['Cui, Bing', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Zhang, Suping', 'Mraz, Marek', 'Fecteau, Jessie-F', 'Yu, Jian', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Bao, Lei', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Messer, Karen', 'Calin, George A', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Cui B', 'Chen L', 'Zhang S', 'Mraz M', 'Fecteau JF', 'Yu J', 'Ghia EM', 'Zhang L', 'Bao L', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Messer K', 'Calin GA', 'Croce CM', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA; Center of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; and.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, of the CLL Research Consortium.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, of the CLL Research Consortium.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD40 Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",2014/06/11 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39936-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-03-559690 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 24;124(4):546-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-559690.

This complication can be treated by either surgical or endovascular intervention or a combination; however, in critically ill patients or in those with impaired coagulation, therapeutic options are more limited. We describe successful endovascular management of inadvertent subclavian artery cannulation during insertion of a triple lumen central line catheter in a 35-year-old man suffering from leukemia, with sepsis and multi-organ failure. He was hypotensive and hemodynamically unstable, with severe coagulopathy. The catheter had entered the artery at the level of the origin of the internal mammary artery, just above the origin of the vertebral artery. The tip was lying in the aortic arch. The artery was successfully closed by endovascular deployment of an 8 French Angio-Seal device (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA). The device is licensed for use in femoral arterial puncture sites but provided safe and effective closure of the subclavian artery puncture in our patient.","['Cohen, Jose E', 'Moshe Gomori, J', 'Anner, Haim', 'Itshayek, Eyal']","['Cohen JE', 'Moshe Gomori J', 'Anner H', 'Itshayek E']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, POB 12000, Jerusalem 91120, Israel; Department of Endovascular Neurosurgery and Interventional Neuroradiology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.

Individual genetic variation linked to inherited polymorphisms of GSTT1 and GSTM1 leading to a complete loss of enzyme activity could expose subjects to develop cancer or to induce drug resistance. Indeed, despite the impressive results obtained with the imatinib, some patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) fail to achieve the expected results or develop resistance. The present study aimed to examine the impact of GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms on the response to imatinib in patients with CML. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the genotypes of GSTT1 and GSTM1 in 60 CML patients. We found that side effects were more frequent in patients carrying GSTT1 null when compared to GSTT1 present carriers (31 vs. 16.6 %; chi (2) = 6.2; p = 0.013). The loss of hematologic response was statistically greater in patients carrying the combined genotype GSTT1 present/GSTM1 present (26.3 %) when compared to GSTT1 null/GSTM1 present (12.8 %), GSTT1 present/GSTM1 null (8.3 %) and GSTT1 null/GSTM1 null (0 %), (chi (2) = 18.85; p < 0.001). The complete cytogenetic response was higher in patients harboring the GSTT1 null/GSTM1 null (75 %) compared with GSTT1 null/GSTM1 present (55.6 %), GSTT1 present/GSTM1 null (50 %) and GSTT1 present/GSTM1 present (47.8). On the other hand, the frequency of none cytogenetic responders was more common in patients carrying GSTT1 present/GSTM1 present (34.8 %) when compared to other genotype combinations (chi (2) = 20.99; p = 0.05). Moreover, the GSTT1 present/GSTM1 present appeared to be associated with a final dose of 600 or 800 mg of imatinib, but not significantly. Based on these findings, we find that the interaction between GSTT1 and GSTM1 seems to influence treatment outcome in patients with CML. Therefore, further investigations are required to confirm these results, for better genotype-phenotype correlation.","['Kassogue, Y', 'Quachouh, M', 'Dehbi, H', 'Quessar, A', 'Benchekroun, S', 'Nadifi, S']","['Kassogue Y', 'Quachouh M', 'Dehbi H', 'Quessar A', 'Benchekroun S', 'Nadifi S']","['Genetics and Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Medical School of Casablanca, University Hassan II, 19 Rue Tarik Ibnou Ziad, BP. 9154, Casablanca, Morocco, kassoy2@yahoo.fr.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/11 06:00,2015/07/25 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0047-z [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2014 Jul;31(7):47. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0047-z.

However, precise mechanisms of how gene mutations lead to leukemias and how epigenetic therapies induce clinical remissions are elusive. Current scientific inquiries that take advantage of techniques that can distinguish among the various covalent cytosine modifications at single base resolution are likely to shed light on the ways epigenetic pathways drive leukemogenesis as well as how the hypomethylating drugs induce clinical remissions. The hope is that these studies will also reveal which patients are likely to respond to epigenetic therapies. Thus, the future is likely to bring a new wave of diagnostic and prognostic tools that probe the epigenomics of leukemia to help clinicians in their management of patients.","['Jasielec, J', 'Saloura, V', 'Godley, L A']","['Jasielec J', 'Saloura V', 'Godley LA']","['Section of Medicine/Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Medicine/Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', '1] Section of Medicine/Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA [2] The University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation']",2014/06/11 06:00,2014/11/02 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014163 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.163 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Sep;28(9):1765-73. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.163.

We set out to integrate the parameters of both scores in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) receiving reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) alloHSCT. All parameters from the HCT-CI and the EBMT-score with the addition of patient and donor cytomegalovirus serology were evaluated in 812 patients by multivariable analysis with end-point NRM at 2 years. Subsequently, 16 parameters were selected based on hazard ratio >1.2, and were incorporated into a novel score, which was further internally validated by bootstrapping. Both the HCT-CI and the EBMT-score showed relatively weak predictive value, whereas the integrated score allowed to identify three clearly distinct risk groups with 2-year NRM estimates of 8+/-2% (low-risk), 17+/-2% (intermediate-risk) and 38+/-4% (high-risk), which also translated in prediction of overall survival. Collectively, integration of the most dominant parameters from the HCT-CI and the EBMT-score allowed to develop a simple and robust, integrated score with improved prediction of NRM for AML patients proceeding to RIC alloHSCT in CR1.","['Versluis, J', 'Labopin, M', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Socie, G', 'Schlenk, R F', 'Milpied, N', 'Nagler, A', 'Blaise, D', 'Rocha, V', 'Cornelissen, J J', 'Mohty, M']","['Versluis J', 'Labopin M', 'Niederwieser D', 'Socie G', 'Schlenk RF', 'Milpied N', 'Nagler A', 'Blaise D', 'Rocha V', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Mohty M']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Sorbonne Universites, Paris, France [2] Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Paris, France [3] AP-HP, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', '1] Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Paris, France [2] Department of Hematology/Transplantation, Hopital Saint-Louis, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Transplant Program, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Eurocord International Registry, Hopital Saint Louis, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Sorbonne Universites, Paris, France [2] Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Paris, France [3] AP-HP, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/11 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014164 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.164 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):51-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.164.

Recent evidence suggests that Chk1 inhibitors may demonstrate significant single agent activity in tumors with specific DNA repair defects, a constitutively activated DNA damage response or oncogene induced replicative stress. METHODS: Growth inhibition induced by the small molecule Chk1 inhibitor V158411 was assessed in a panel of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and compared to cancer cell lines derived from solid tumors. The effects on cell cycle and DNA damage response markers were further evaluated. RESULTS: Leukemia and lymphoma cell lines were identified as particularly sensitive to the Chk1 inhibitor V158411 (mean GI50 0.17 muM) compared to colon (2.8 muM) or lung (6.9 muM) cancer cell lines. Chk1 inhibition by V158411 in the leukemia and lymphoma cell lines induced DNA fragmentation and cell death that was both caspase dependent and independent, and prevented cells undergoing mitosis. An analysis of in vitro pharmacodynamic markers identified a dose dependent decrease in Chk1 and cyclin B1 protein levels and Cdc2 Thr15 phosphorylation along with a concomitant increase in H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139 following V158411 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the further evaluation of Chk1 inhibitors in hematopoietic cancers as single agents as well as in combination with standard of care cytotoxic drugs.","['Bryant, Christopher', 'Scriven, Kirsten', 'Massey, Andrew J']","['Bryant C', 'Scriven K', 'Massey AJ']","['Vernalis R&D Ltd, Granta Park, Cambridge CB21 6GB, UK. a.massey@vernalis.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (V158411)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mitosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridones/administration & dosage']",2014/06/11 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-147 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-147 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 Jun 10;13:147. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-147.,,20140610,,PMC4082411,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the outcomes of these patients were reviewed retrospectively to determine whether they underwent alloSCT and why patients did not undergo alloSCT. Fifty-two patients with 17p- CLL who were referred to the transplant service from 2007 to 2010 were identified. Of these patients, 32 (62%) did not undergo alloSCT, mainly because of treatment- or disease-related complications (n = 15).

Recently, the LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) was identified as a component of a six gene signature that is strongly predictive for disease progression and relapse in CML patients. However, the underlying mechanisms why LASP1 expression correlates with dismal outcome remained unresolved. Here, we identified LASP1 as a novel and overexpressed direct substrate of BCR-ABL in CML. We demonstrate that LASP1 is specifically phosphorylated by BCR-ABL at tyrosine-171 in CML patients, which is abolished by tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Further studies revealed that LASP1 phosphorylation results in an association with CRKL - another specific BCR-ABL substrate and bona fide biomarker for BCR-ABL activity. pLASP1-Y171 binds to non-phosphorylated CRKL at its SH2 domain. Accordingly, the BCR-ABL-mediated pathophysiological hyper-phosphorylation of LASP1 in CML disrupts normal regulation of CRKL and LASP1, which likely has implications on downstream BCR-ABL signaling. Collectively, our results suggest that LASP1 phosphorylation might serve as an additional candidate biomarker for assessment of BCR-ABL activity and provide a first step toward a molecular understanding of LASP1 function in CML.","['Frietsch, Jochen J', 'Kastner, Carolin', 'Grunewald, Thomas G P', 'Schweigel, Hardy', 'Nollau, Peter', 'Ziermann, Janine', 'Clement, Joachim H', 'La Rosee, Paul', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Butt, Elke']","['Frietsch JJ', 'Kastner C', 'Grunewald TG', 'Schweigel H', 'Nollau P', 'Ziermann J', 'Clement JH', 'La Rosee P', 'Hochhaus A', 'Butt E']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.

Here we show that Mll2, a TrxG member, is required for proliferation but is dispensable for maintaining the pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In addition, differentiation of ESCs toward mesodermal and endodermal lineages is severely altered and, in particular, the cardiac lineage differentiation of ESCs is completely abolished in the absence of Mll2. Moreover, the expression of core cardiac transcription factors and the levels of H3K4 tri-methylation of these cardiac-specific promoters are significantly decreased by the loss of Mll2. Taken together, our results reveal a critical role for Mll2 in proliferation and cardiac lineage differentiation of mouse ESCs, and provide novel molecular insight into the mechanisms of cardiac development and disease.","['Wan, Xiaoling', 'Liu, Lulu', 'Ding, Xiaodan', 'Zhou, Peipei', 'Yuan, Xiujie', 'Zhou, Zhongwen', 'Hu, Ping', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Li, Qiang', 'Zhang, Shenghai', 'Xiong, Sidong', 'Zhang, Yan']","['Wan X', 'Liu L', 'Ding X', 'Zhou P', 'Yuan X', 'Zhou Z', 'Hu P', 'Zhou H', 'Li Q', 'Zhang S', 'Xiong S', 'Zhang Y']","['Institute of Biology and Medical Sciences, Soochow University, 199 Renai Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 215123, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2014/06/11 06:00,2015/06/09 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12015-014-9527-y [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2014 Oct;10(5):643-52. doi: 10.1007/s12015-014-9527-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent decades there have been a significant number of reports of haematological neoplasms with rearrangement of JAK2. Published data on such cases have therefore been analysed to determine if any specific entities could be identified. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms associated with t(8;9)(p22;p24); PCM1-JAK2 fusion should be recognized as an entity. Furthermore, lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms associated respectively with t(9;12)(p24;p13); ETV6-JAK2 and with t(9;22)(p24;q11.2); BCR-JAK2 should be documented carefully in order to define their features more clearly and assess whether they can be recognized as entities.

Inevitably, resistance to therapy develops, and thus the clinical efficacy of bortezomib is hampered by drug resistance. The oncogene B-cellspecific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site1 (Bmi-1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human malignancies. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi)mediated Bmi-1 silencing has been shown to sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation. The role of Bmi-1 in influencing the response to bortezomib therapy has not been investigated to date. In the present study, Bmi-1 was silenced in two MM cell lines (U266 and RPMI8226) using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Bmi-1 (shBmi-1). A cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to analyze cell proliferation and evaluate the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of bortezomib. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM), and the mRNA and protein expression of associated genes (Bmi-1, p14, p21, Bcl-2 and Bax) was quantified by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The IC50 values significantly decreased in the cells transfected with shBmi-1 (p<0.05). The depletion of Bmi-1 sensitized the MM cells to bortezomib, which increased the G1 phase duration and enhanced bortezomibinduced apoptosis (p<0.05). The expression of p21 and Bax (apoptosis inducer) was upregulated, whereas that of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, was downregulated in the Bmi-1silenced cells (p<0.05). The depletion of Bmi-1 enhanced the sensitivity of MM cells to bortezomib by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our data suggest that Bmi-1 may serve as an important novel therapeutic target in MM.","['Wu, Shun-Quan', 'Xu, Zhen-Zhen', 'Niu, Wen-Yan', 'Huang, Hao-Bo', 'Zhan, Rong']","['Wu SQ', 'Xu ZZ', 'Niu WY', 'Huang HB', 'Zhan R']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, P.R.

Results of current treatment strategies in selected populations do exist but are largely unreported for unselected series. Here, we aimed to investigate treatment outcome in a population-based cohort. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were identified through the Swedish Lymphoma Registry and data was retrospectively collected for all adult (>/= 18 years) Swedish T-LBL patients diagnosed during 2000-2009. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with median age 40 years (range 18-78) were identified with females being significantly older than males (median age 66 vs. 37, p = 0.027). The five-year overall survival for all patients was 42%. Female gender was associated with shorter survival also when adjusted for treatment strategy and age [hazard ratio (HR) 4.29; p = 0.002]. Thirty patients received intensive chemotherapy, otherwise used for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which resulted in an overall response rate of 97% and a five-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 49%. In this group only CNS involvement at diagnosis predicted shorter PFS (HR 13.3; p = 0.03). Among patients treated with hyper-CVAD the addition of mediastinal irradiation resulted in prolonged time to progression compared to patients receiving only chemotherapy (p = 0.047). The major reason for treatment failure was relapse and in this series 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) did not predict this risk. CONCLUSION: This population-based study indicates that all fit T-LBL patients should be considered for intensive treatment. Our results also suggest a beneficial effect of mediastinal irradiation in combination with hyper-CVAD treatment. Relapsing patients have a dismal outcome irrespective of salvage treatment.","['Ellin, Fredrik', 'Jerkeman, Mats', 'Hagberg, Hans', 'Relander, Thomas']","['Ellin F', 'Jerkeman M', 'Hagberg H', 'Relander T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kalmar County Hospital , Kalmar , Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mediastinum/radiation effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/methods', 'Registries', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/11 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/0284186X.2014.889850 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2014 Jul;53(7):927-34. doi: 10.3109/0284186X.2014.889850.

The aim of our study was to analyze the association of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). METHODS: We carried out a retrospective cohort study on 565 patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) followed in the French referral center for adult's immune cytopenia. A literature review using MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) was also performed. RESULTS: Eight patients (5 male, 76.3 + 9.8 yr old) with ITP-associated CMML were identified in our national cohort. Thirteen cases were reported in literature from 1984 to 2013. Mean age was 65.3 +/- 18.5 yr. Sex ratio (M/F) was 1/0.6. ITP unveiled CMML in all but four cases (17/21; 80.9%). ITP occurred in the setting of low-grade CMML in all cases, with neither reported progression nor acute myeloid leukemia transformation during follow-up. Overall, karyotype analysis revealed cytogenetic abnormalities in six cases (6/16; 37.5%). ITP had a chronic course in most cases and shares, according to the low level of bleeding complications and the high response rate to treatment such as corticosteroids and splenectomy, the usual characteristics of primary ITP. CONCLUSION: Although the association of a well-defined ITP and CMML is rare, our study suggests that CMML-associated ITP should be treated according to current guidelines for primary ITP.","['Hadjadj, Jerome', 'Michel, Marc', 'Chauveheid, Marie-Paule', 'Godeau, Bertrand', 'Papo, Thomas', 'Sacre, Karim']","['Hadjadj J', 'Michel M', 'Chauveheid MP', 'Godeau B', 'Papo T', 'Sacre K']","['Universite Paris Diderot, PRES Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France; Departement de Medecine Interne, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/11 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12393 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2014 Dec;93(6):521-6. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12393.

One year after remission she presented malar rash, hair loss, arthralgias, conjuntival redness, dyspnea and thoracic oppression. The initial blood count only showed hypereosinophilia, and a bone marrow biopsy did not show blasts and had a negative immunophenotyping. Autoantibodies were negative, except for ANA (1:1,280 in one determination after one negative), complement was normal, lupic band in skin was negative for complement and immunoglobulins; serum IgG 2,195 mg/dL, IgA 231, IgM 327, IgE 109 U/mL; skin testing for aeroallergens and food allergens were negative. Prednisone was started at 1 mg/kg. Abdominal ultrasound only reported biliary sludge flow and hepatosplenomegaly; chest tomography showed centrolobullar interstitial pattern, suggesting eosinophilic pneumonitis. The patient started with a generalized dermatosis, and a biopsy reported leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Six months after the onset of symptomatology there were generalized malaise, uncontrolled fever, gingival haemorrhage, asthenia and adynamia; a blood cell count reported blasts, and bone marrow smear confirmed the diagnosis of cell B lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient deteriorated rapidly showing signs of respiratory difficulty and acute pulmonary edema, therefore chemotherapy was started without response, and finally the patient died. There are several causes of HS, yet one of the least frequent presentations in childhood is the association with neoplasms.","['Arias-Martinez, Isabel', 'Venancio-Hernandez, Marco']","['Arias-Martinez I', 'Venancio-Hernandez M']","['Servicio de Alergia e Inmunologia Clinica, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital de Especialidades Antonio Fraga Mouret, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social, Mexico, DF. arisa1082@hotmail.com.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Rev Alerg Mex,"Revista alergia Mexico (Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico : 1993)",9438824,['Erythema elevatum diutinum'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Autoimmune Diseases/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*etiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Pulmonary Edema/etiology', 'Pulmonary Eosinophilia/etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Vasculitis, Leukocytoclastic, Cutaneous/etiology']",2014/06/11 06:00,2014/07/18 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Alerg Mex. 2013 Oct-Dec;60(4):193-7.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Eosinophilia', 'Hypereosinophilia', 'Leukemia']",,,,,,,,Sindrome hipereosinofilico como presentacion paraneoplasica en una adolescente.,,,,,,,

In children, both sickle cell and leukaemic emergencies demand prompt action to prevent additional morbidity but detailed protocols for small children are lacking, and often are performed using guidelines shown to work in larger patients. We report a 3-year experience with children weighing 11-25 kg at a large academic medical centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients were treated with the COBE(R) Spectra apheresis system; circuit was primed with blood not adjusted for haematocrit and anticoagulant citrate dextrose A was used as anticoagulation. Procedures were performed in the paediatric intensive care unit by apheresis nursing staff. RESULTS: Twenty-five apheresis procedures in 19 patients were performed; 17 of 19 patients presented with sickle cell-related acute complications and two (2/19) with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia and hyperleucocytosis. None of the patients required medications during the procedures. Vital signs and clinical condition remained stable and did not worsen during or postapheresis. One patient had a delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction 1 week posterythrocytapheresis as he developed alloantibodies as a result of the procedure. All sickle cell patients achieved a target haematocrit of 21-30% and Haemoglobin A of >/=68%. Both leukaemia patients who underwent LPE had no further signs of leukostasis and achieved marked reductions in leucocyte counts. CONCLUSIONS: Apheresis of children weighing 11-25 kg can be safely performed without increased morbidity. We outline a protocol that can be used to perform apheresis with minimal complications.","['Maitta, R W', 'Vasovic, L V', 'Mohandas, K', 'Music-Aplenc, L', 'Bonzon-Adelson, A', 'Uehlinger, J']","['Maitta RW', 'Vasovic LV', 'Mohandas K', 'Music-Aplenc L', 'Bonzon-Adelson A', 'Uehlinger J']","['Departments of Pathology, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA; Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Vox Sang,Vox sanguinis,0413606,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '9034-51-9 (Hemoglobin A)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/diagnosis/therapy', 'Anticoagulants/pharmacology', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', '*Blood Component Removal/adverse effects', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Hemoglobin A/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Isoantibodies/blood', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukostasis/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male']",2014/06/11 06:00,2015/06/26 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/vox.12164 [doi]'],ppublish,Vox Sang. 2014 Nov;107(4):375-80. doi: 10.1111/vox.12164.

We hereby analyzed the clinico-biological features and treatment outcome of APL patients in relation to CD34 expression, even when expressed in a small subpopulation: 114 APL patients homogeneously treated with the AIDA schedule were included in the study and prognostic correlation with respect to CD34 expression, both when expressed in association with CD2 and as isolated expression (cutoff >/=2 to <10 % or >/=10 %), were investigated. CD34 was associated to CD2 in 30 patients and was isolated in 19 patients. When compared to the CD34-negative population, CD34/CD2 expression identified a subgroup with characteristic features: M3 variant subtype (26 vs 7 % in the negative group, p = 0.02), bcr3 transcript subtype (73 vs 32 %, p = 0.001), high risk according to the risk of relapse (66 vs 17 %, p = 0.002), high incidence of differentiation syndrome (26 vs 12 %, p = 0.01), lower overall survival (88 vs 95 %), and a significantly higher rate of relapse (22 vs 13.8 %, p = 0.05). We then evaluated the prognostic value of isolated CD34 expression: it was detected in nine patients with a cutoff of expression >/=10 % and in 10 patients with a cutoff >/=2 but <10 %. Isolated CD34 positivity identified a subgroup with a classic morphology (79 %), bcr1 prevalence (53 %), higher rate of relapse (37 vs 13.8 % in the negative group, p = 0.002), higher incidence of differentiation syndrome (55 vs 12 %, p = 0.03), and lower overall survival (60 vs 95 %, p = 0.001). The results of our study confirm that CD34/CD2 expression characterizes a subset of APL with a high WBC count and a variant morphological subtype, associated with an unfavorable clinical course. We also show that the isolated expression of CD34, even at a low cutoff, identifies a group of classic APL with a negative prognosis. Further studies aimed at identifying other molecular signatures in CD34-positive patients are needed in order to optimize the therapeutic strategy for this subset of patients.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Stefanizzi, Caterina', 'Raponi, Sara', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Colafigli, Gioia', 'Minotti, Clara', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Breccia M', 'De Propris MS', 'Stefanizzi C', 'Raponi S', 'Molica M', 'Colafigli G', 'Minotti C', 'Latagliata R', 'Diverio D', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy, breccia@bce.uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2014/06/11 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2130-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Nov;93(11):1819-23. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2130-0.

In this study, toxic effect of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylates (PEG-DMAs) with various ethylene glycol repeating units was investigated in terms of cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and the expression of co-stimulatory factors in human leukemia cell line (THP-1 cells) to verify the effect of ethylene glycol repeating units. Note that the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient of PEG-based dimethacrylates decreased with increasing the ethylene glycol repeating units, indicating that the hydrophilicity of PEG-DMAs increased with ethylene glycol repeating units. The toxic effect of PEG-DMAs such as cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and the expression of CD86 in treated THP-1 cells are reduced with increasing the ethylene glycol repeating units in PEG-DMAs. However, the expression of CD54 in treated THP-1 cells was not influenced with the ethylene glycol repeating units and the maximal expression level of CD54 was observed at the concentration range of 2-4 mM for all samples. Accordingly, hydrophilic character of PEG-DMAs with long ethylene glycol chains definitely alleviates the some toxic aspect of PEG-based DMAs. This finding would provide important insight into the design of new biomaterials and dental materials with superior biocompatibility.","['Tamura, Atsushi', 'Fukumoto, Izumi', 'Yui, Nobuhiko', 'Matsumura, Mitsuaki', 'Miura, Hiroyuki']","['Tamura A', 'Fukumoto I', 'Yui N', 'Matsumura M', 'Miura H']","['Department of Organic Biomaterials, Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 2-3-10 Kanda-Surugadai, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 101-0062, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biomed Mater Res A,Journal of biomedical materials research.

We highlighted the importance and significance of a proper phospho-quantitative design and strategy for paediatric ALL between relapse and remission, when human body fluids from cerebrospinal, peripheral blood, or bone-marrow were applied. The present article also assessed the schedule for the analysis of body fluids from patients at different states, importance of proteomics-based tools to discover ALL-specific and sensitive biomarkers, to stimulate paediatric ALL research via proteomics to 'build' the reference map of the signalling networks from leukemic cells at relapse, and to monitor significant clinical therapies for ALL-relapse.","['Lopez Villar, Elena', 'Wu, Duojiao', 'Cho, William C', 'Madero, Luis', 'Wang, Xiangdong']","['Lopez Villar E', 'Wu D', 'Cho WC', 'Madero L', 'Wang X']","['Hospital Universitario Infantil Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*metabolism/therapy', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proteomics/*methods']",2014/06/11 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcmm.12319 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2014 Jul;18(7):1239-46. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.12319.

Most studies consider that NS plays its role through combining with p53 and inhibiting it, however our previous studies revealed that NS could also function without the existence of p53. To date, few studies have focused on the p53-independent pathway of NS, and its molecular mechanism remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the p53-independent pathway of NS in the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 which was p53-null by using the DNA microarray technique. Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference technique was used to knock down NS expression in HL-60 cells, and then DNA microarray and bioinformatics were used to analyze the gene expression profiling changes. The microarray data showed that after knocking down NS in HL-60 cells, 2,628 differentially expressed genes were identified through >/= 2 or </= 0.5-fold-change, in which 818 genes were upregulated and 1,810 genes were downregulated. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) validated the reliability of DNA microarray data. Pathway analysis showed extensive signal pathways in HL-60 cells were influenced by inhibiting NS expression. In particular, the inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway, JAK-STAT pathway, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway and activation of JNK pathway, p38 MAPK pathway may associate with the apoptosis of HL-60 cells after knocking down NS. The findings of this study provide insight to further explore the specific molecular mechanism of NS function in p53-null leukemia and they also lay the foundations for exploring new therapeutic targets for p53-null leukemia and even p53-null tumors.","['Sun, Xiaoli', 'Jia, Yu', 'Wei, Yuanyu', 'Liu, Shuai', 'Yue, Baohong']","['Sun X', 'Jia Y', 'Wei Y', 'Liu S', 'Yue B']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, P.R.

We engineered WM cells to express the most common WHIM (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections and Myelokathexis), CXCR(S338X) mutation in WM. Following SDF-1a stimulation, CXCR4(S338X) WM cells exhibited decreased receptor internalization, enhanced and sustained AKT kinase (AKT) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, decreased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase 3 cleavage, and decreased Annexin V staining versus CXCR4 wild-type (WT) cells. CXCR4(S338X)-related signaling and survival effects were blocked by the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100. SDF-1a-treated CXCR4(S338X) WM cells showed sustained AKT and ERK activation and decreased apoptotic changes versus CXCR4(WT) cells following ibrutinib treatment, findings which were also reversed by AMD3100. AKT or ERK antagonists restored ibrutinib-triggered apoptotic changes in SDF-1a-treated CXCR4(S338X) WM cells demonstrating their role in SDF-1a-mediated ibrutinib resistance. Enhanced bone marrow pAKT staining was also evident in CXCR4(WHIM) versus CXCR4(WT) WM patients, and remained active despite ibrutinib therapy in CXCR4(WHIM) patients. Last, CXCR4(S338X) WM cells showed varying levels of resistance to other WM relevant therapeutics, including bendamustine, fludarabine, bortezomib and idelalisib in the presence of SDF-1a.

However, data on the value of earlier flow MRD assessment are lacking. Therefore, the value of flow MRD detection was determined during aplasia in 178 patients achieving complete remission after treatment according to AMLCG (AML Cooperative Group) induction protocols. Flow MRD positivity during aplasia predicted poor outcome (5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) 16% vs 43%, P<0.001) independently from age and cytogenetic risk group (hazard ratio for MRD positivity 1.71; P=0.009). Importantly, the prognosis of patients without detectable MRD was neither impacted by morphological blast count during aplasia nor by MRD status postinduction. Early flow MRD was also evaluated in the context of existing risk factors. Flow MRD was prognostic within the intermediate cytogenetic risk group (5-year RFS 15% vs 37%, P=0.016) as well as for patients with normal karyotype and NPM1 mutations (5-year RFS 13% vs 49%, P=0.02) or FLT3-ITD (3-year RFS rates 9% vs 44%, P=0.016).

However, these Bcl-2 family proteins also block the proapoptotic activity of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak), and many inducers of autophagy also cause cell death. Therefore, when the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway is functional, interpretation of such experiments is complicated. To directly test the impact of the endogenous antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members on autophagy in the absence of apoptosis, we inhibited their activity in cells lacking the essential cell death mediators Bax and Bak. We also used inducible lentiviral vectors to overexpress Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 in cells and subjected them to treatments that promote autophagy. In the absence of Bax and Bak, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 had no detectable effect on autophagy or cell death in myeloid or fibroblast cell lines. On the other hand, when Bax and Bak were present, inhibiting the prosurvival Bcl-2 family members stimulated autophagy, but this correlated with increased cell death. In addition, inhibition of autophagy induced by amino acid starvation, etoposide, or interleukin-3 withdrawal did not affect cell death in the absence of Bax and Bak. These results demonstrate that the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members do not directly inhibit components of the autophagic pathway but instead affect autophagy indirectly, owing to their inhibition of Bax and Bak.","['Lindqvist, Lisa M', 'Heinlein, Melanie', 'Huang, David C S', 'Vaux, David L']","['Lindqvist LM', 'Heinlein M', 'Huang DC', 'Vaux DL']","['Cell Signalling and Cell Death Division andDepartment of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3050, Australia lindqvist@wehi.edu.au.', 'Cell Signalling and Cell Death Division andDepartment of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3050, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3050, AustraliaCancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC 3052, Australia; and.', 'Cell Signalling and Cell Death Division andDepartment of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Atg5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Map1lc3b protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', '*Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Phagosomes/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/06/10 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1406425111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1406425111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jun 10;111(23):8512-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1406425111.

In studies designed to define neoplastic stem cells of primary myelofibrosis (PMF), a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by profound disruption of the hematopoietic microenvironment, we observed a high frequency of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in NSG mice. AML was of mouse origin, confined to PMF-xenografted mice, and contained multiple clonal integrations of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MuLV). Significantly, MuLV replication was not only observed in diseased mice, but also in nontreated NSG controls. Furthermore, in addition to the single ecotropic endogenous retrovirus (eERV) located on chromosome 11 (Emv30) in the NOD genome, multiple de novo germ-line eERV integrations were observed in mice from each of four independent NSG mouse colonies. Analysis confirmed that E-MuLV originated from the Emv30 provirus and that recombination events were not necessary for virus replication or AML induction. Pathogenicity is thus likely attributable to PMF-mediated paracrine stimulation of mouse myeloid cells, which serve as targets for retroviral infection and transformation, as evidenced by integration into the Evi1 locus, a hotspot for retroviral-induced myeloid leukemia. This study thus corroborates a role of paracrine stimulation in PMF disease progression, underlines the importance of target cell type and numbers in MuLV-induced disease, and mandates awareness of replicating MuLV in NOD immunodeficient mice, which can significantly influence experimental results and their interpretation.","['Triviai, Ioanna', 'Ziegler, Marion', 'Bergholz, Ulla', 'Oler, Andrew J', 'Stubig, Thomas', 'Prassolov, Vladimir', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Kozak, Christine A', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Triviai I', 'Ziegler M', 'Bergholz U', 'Oler AJ', 'Stubig T', 'Prassolov V', 'Fehse B', 'Kozak CA', 'Kroger N', 'Stocking C']","['Retrovirus Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute of Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany;Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, 20246 Hamburg, Germany;', 'Retrovirus Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute of Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany;', 'Retrovirus Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute of Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany;', 'Computational Biology Section, Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch, and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, 20246 Hamburg, Germany;', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow 119991, Russia.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, 20246 Hamburg, Germany;', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892; and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, 20246 Hamburg, Germany;', 'Retrovirus Pathogenesis, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute of Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany; carol.stocking@hpi.uni-hamburg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Virus Integration/genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/10 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1401215111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1401215111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jun 10;111(23):8595-600. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1401215111.

We evaluated the composition and development of distinct T-cell subtypes in AML patients (n=12) compared with healthy probands (n=5) before and during stimulation with leukemia-derived dendritic cells-containing DC (DC) or blast-containing mononuclear cells (MNC) in 0-7 days mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) by flow cytometry. AML patients' T-cell subgroups were correlated with antileukemic functionality before and after DC/MNC stimulation by functional fluorolysis assays.

(2) After 7 days of DC or MNC stimulation, T-cell profiles were characterized by (significantly) increased proportions of activated T cells with effector function and significantly decreased proportions of beta-integrin T cells. (3) Antileukemic cytotoxicity was achieved in 40% of T cells after MNC stimulation compared with 64% after DC stimulation.

Furthermore, cutoff values for defined T-cell activation/differentiation markers and beta-integrin T cells could be defined, allowing a prediction of antileukemic reactivity. We could demonstrate the potential of the composition of unstimulated/DC-stimulated T cells for the lysis of AML blasts. Especially, AML patients with high numbers of Tnaive and Tcm could benefit from DC stimulation; proportions of activated and beta-integrin T cells correlated with increased antileukemic functionality and could serve to predict T cells' reactivity during stimulation.

However, current cellular immunotherapy approaches lack predictive biomarkers identifying patient cohorts most susceptible to immune attack. For this purpose we performed a comprehensive analysis of clinical, genetic, metabolic, and immunophenotypic features of 19 primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples and correlated these factors with AML blast recognition by allogeneic Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells. We show that 36% of primary AML samples were intrinsically susceptible to allogeneic Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells. Among several evaluated features, only UL-16 binding protein 1 (ULBP1) expression (P<0.01) determines intrinsic AML susceptibility to allogeneic Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells. Within the intrinsically resistant AML samples, pretreatment of AML blasts with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBP) significantly induced Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell cytotoxicity in 50% of AML samples, whereas 50% of AML samples were consistently refractory to gammadelta T-cell cytolysis. Activity of the mevalonate pathway (P<0.05) and myelomonocytic differentiation of AML (P<0.05) correlated with sensitivity of primary AML samples toward NBP pretreatment. In conclusion, this study identifies subsets of AML patients most likely to benefit from allogeneic Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell-mediated immunotherapy.","['Gundermann, Stefan', 'Klinker, Erdwine', 'Kimmel, Brigitte', 'Flierl, Ulrike', 'Wilhelm, Martin', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Kunzmann, Volker']","['Gundermann S', 'Klinker E', 'Kimmel B', 'Flierl U', 'Wilhelm M', 'Einsele H', 'Kunzmann V']","['*Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II daggerInstitut fur Klinische Transfusionsmedizin und Hamotherapie, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg section signMedizinische Klinik V, Klinikum Nurnberg Nord, Nurnberg, Germany double daggerBaker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (T-cell receptor Vdelta2, human)', '0 (T-cell receptor Vgamma9, human)', '0 (ULBP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/metabolism', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2014/06/10 06:00,2015/04/17 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000043 [doi]', '00002371-201407000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2014 Jul-Aug;37(6):321-30. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000043.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alignment-free methods have been developed over past decade for more efficient comparison and classification of DNA sequences than MSA. However, most alignment-free methods may lose structural and functional information of DNA sequences because they are based on feature extractions. Therefore, they may not fully reflect the actual differences among DNA sequences. Alignment-free methods with information conservation are needed for more accurate comparison and classification of DNA sequences. We propose a new alignment-free similarity measure of DNA sequences using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). In this method, we map DNA sequences into four binary indicator sequences and apply DFT to the indicator sequences to transform them into frequency domain. The Euclidean distance of full DFT power spectra of the DNA sequences is used as similarity distance metric. To compare the DFT power spectra of DNA sequences with different lengths, we propose an even scaling method to extend shorter DFT power spectra to equal the longest length of the sequences compared. After the DFT power spectra are evenly scaled, the DNA sequences are compared in the same DFT frequency space dimensionality. We assess the accuracy of the similarity metric in hierarchical clustering using simulated DNA and virus sequences. The results demonstrate that the DFT based method is an effective and accurate measure of DNA sequence similarity.","['Yin, Changchuan', 'Chen, Ying', 'Yau, Stephen S-T']","['Yin C', 'Chen Y', 'Yau SS']","['College of Information Systems and Technology, University of Phoenix, Chicago, IL 60601, USA.', 'Department of Mathematical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Department of Mathematical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.

Several MAGE proteins interact with ubiquitin E3 ligases and modulate their activities. However, it remains unknown whether MAGE family proteins interact with SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) E3 ligases such as PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family, Nsmce2/Mms21 and Cbx4/Pc2. In the present study, we examined whether necdin interacts with these SUMO E3 ligases. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that necdin, MAGED1, MAGEF1 and MAGEL2 bound to PIAS1 but not to Nsmce2 or Cbx4. These SUMO E3 ligases bound to MAGEA1 but failed to interact with necdin-like 2/MAGEG1. Necdin bound to PIAS1 central domains that are highly conserved among PIAS family proteins and suppressed PIAS1-dependent sumoylation of the substrates STAT1 and PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein). Remarkably, necdin promoted degradation of PIAS1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In transfected HEK293A cells, amino- and carboxyl-terminally truncated mutants of PIAS1 bound to necdin but failed to undergo necdin-dependent ubiquitination. Both PIAS1 and necdin were associated with the nuclear matrix, where the PIAS1 terminal deletion mutants failed to localize, implying that the nuclear matrix is indispensable for necdin-dependent ubiquitination of PIAS1. Our data suggest that necdin suppresses PIAS1 both by inhibiting SUMO E3 ligase activity and by promoting ubiquitin-dependent degradation.","['Gur, Ibrahim', 'Fujiwara, Kazushiro', 'Hasegawa, Koichi', 'Yoshikawa, Kazuaki']","['Gur I', 'Fujiwara K', 'Hasegawa K', 'Yoshikawa K']","['Laboratory of Regulation of Neuronal Development, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Regulation of Neuronal Development, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Regulation of Neuronal Development, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Regulation of Neuronal Development, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Melanoma-Specific Antigens)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (necdin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Melanoma-Specific Antigens/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proteolysis', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sumoylation', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",2014/06/10 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0099503 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-06529 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 9;9(6):e99503. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0099503. eCollection 2014.,,20140609,,PMC4049815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies in the MET-1 cell/NOD/SCID mouse model of ATL demonstrated that MET-1 cells are very susceptible to measles virus (MV) oncolytic therapy. To further evaluate the potential of MV therapy in ATL, the susceptibility of several HTLV-1 transformed CD4+ T cell lines (MT-1, MT-2, MT-4 and C8166-45) as well as HTLV-1 negative CD4+ T cell lines (Jurkat and CCRF-CEM) to infection with MV was tested in vitro. All cell lines were permissive to MV infection and subsequent cell death, except MT-1 and CCRF-CEM cells which were susceptible and permissive to MV infection, but resistant to cell death. The resistance to MV-mediated cell death was associated with IFNbeta produced by MT-1 and CCRF-CEM cells. Inhibition of IFNbeta rendered MT-1 and CCRF-CEM cells susceptible to MV-mediated cell death. Cells susceptible to MV-induced cell death did not produce nor were responsive to IFNbeta. Upon infection with Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), MT-1 and CCRF-CEM but not the susceptible cell lines up-regulated pSTAT-2. In vivo, treatment of tumors induced by MT-1 cell lines which produce IFNbeta demonstrated only small increases in mean survival time, while only two treatments prolonged mean survival time in mice with MET-1 tumors deficient in type I interferon production. These results indicate that type I interferon production is closely linked with the inability of tumor cells to respond to type I interferon. Screening of tumor cells for type I interferon could be a useful strategy to select candidate patients for MV virotherapy.","['M Parrula, M Cecilia', 'Fernandez, Soledad A', 'Landes, Kristina', 'Huey, Devra', 'Lairmore, Michael', 'Niewiesk, Stefan']","['M Parrula MC', 'Fernandez SA', 'Landes K', 'Huey D', 'Lairmore M', 'Niewiesk S']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States; Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States; Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States; Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States; Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States; Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.

METHODS: We studied 167 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases 0-7 years of age and 214 birth certificate controls matched on date of birth, sex, and race/ethnicity from the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study. In 2001-2007, we sampled carpets in the room where the child spent the most time while awake; we used a high-volume small-surface sampler or we took dust from the home vacuum. We measured concentrations of 14 PBDE congeners including penta (28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154), octa (183, 196, 197, 203), and decaBDEs (206-209). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression, adjusting for demographics, income, year of dust collection, and sampling method. RESULTS: BDE-47, BDE-99, and BDE-209 were found at the highest concentrations (medians, 1,173, 1,579, and 938 ng/g, respectively). Comparing the highest to lowest quartile, we found no association with ALL for summed pentaBDEs (OR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.3), octaBDEs (OR = 1.3; 95% CI: 0.7, 2.3), or decaBDEs (OR = 1.0; 95% CI: 0.6, 1.8). Comparing homes in the highest concentration (nanograms per gram) tertile to those with no detections, we observed significantly increased ALL risk for BDE-196 (OR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.8), BDE-203 (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.6), BDE-206 (OR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.9), and BDE-207 (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.8).

Sixty-three patients were enrolled in this study to explore the distribution of this gene in Iranian population. METHODS: This study used 63 peripheral blood and bone marrow (PB/BM) samples from children with ALL. Immunophenotyping of PB and BM samples were performed using flow cytometry to illustrate the lineage. Moreover, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to amplify transcripts of leukemia-specific chromosome fusion gene ETV6/RUNX1 and to monitor the expression levels of the ETV6/RUNX1 in patients according to Van Dongen et al protocol. FINDINGS: On the basis of French-American-British (FAB) classification, 47 individuals had ALL-L1. The incidence of ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene in this study was 34.9%. The laboratory and clinical features of twenty two ETV6/RUNX1 positive ALL cases were similar to those of other studies. The most positive cases of ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene had the early pre B ALL and pre B ALL immunophenotypes. CONCLUSION: The ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene is a common genetic anomaly in Iranian childhood ALL patients and the prevalence of the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene is similar to that of ALL patients in other countries. However early pre B cells were the most common type in studied patients.","['Rahnemoon, Ahmad-Reza', 'Zaker, Farhad', 'Izadyar, Mina', 'Ansari, Shahla', 'Poopak, Behzad', 'Tadavosyan, Yuri']","['Rahnemoon AR', 'Zaker F', 'Izadyar M', 'Ansari S', 'Poopak B', 'Tadavosyan Y']","['Allied Medical School, Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Allied Medical School, Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran ; Children's Medical Center, Pediatrics Center of Excellence, Tehran, Iran."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Islamic Azad University of Medical Sciences, Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA, Yerevan, Armenia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Pediatr,Iranian journal of pediatrics,101274724,,,,2014/06/10 06:00,2014/06/10 06:01,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2012/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pediatr. 2013 Dec;23(6):681-6.,,,,PMC4025127,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'ETV6/RUNX1 Fusion', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It describes the background for this fear and evidence in the first UNSCEAR report of a reduction in leukemia of the Hiroshima survivors in the low dose zone. The data are plotted and dose-response models are drawn. While UNSCEAR suggested the extra leukemia incidence is proportional to radiation dose, the data are consistent with a hormetic J-shape and a threshold at about 100 rem (1 Sv). UNSCEAR data on lifespan reduction of mammals exposed continuously to gamma rays indicate a 2 gray/year threshold. This contradicts the conceptual basis for radiation protection and risk determination established in 1956-58. In this paper, beneficial effects and thresholds for harmful effects are discussed, and the biological mechanism is explained. The key point: the rate of DNA damage (double-strand breaks) caused by background radiation is 1000 times less than the endogenous (spontaneous) rate. It is the effect of radiation on an organism's very powerful adaptive protection systems that determines the dose-response characteristic. Low radiation up-regulates the protection systems, while high radiation impairs these systems. The remedy for radiation fear is to expose and discard the politicized science.","['Cuttler, Jerry M']",['Cuttler JM'],"['Cuttler & Associates Inc, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dose Response,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,101308899,,,,2014/06/10 06:00,2014/06/10 06:01,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2203/dose-response.13-055.Cuttler [doi]', 'drp-12-170 [pii]']",epublish,Dose Response. 2014 Mar 13;12(2):170-84. doi: 10.2203/dose-response.13-055.Cuttler. eCollection 2014 May.,,20140313,,PMC4036393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that one of their early effects is the loss of conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO from its targets via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent inhibition of the SUMO-conjugating enzymes. Desumoylation regulates the expression of specific genes, such as the proapoptotic gene DDIT3, and helps induce apoptosis in chemosensitive AMLs. In contrast, chemotherapeutics do not activate the ROS/SUMO axis in chemoresistant cells. However, pro-oxidants or inhibition of the SUMO pathway by anacardic acid restores DDIT3 expression and apoptosis in chemoresistant cell lines and patient samples, including leukemic stem cells. Finally, inhibition of the SUMO pathway decreases tumor growth in mice xenografted with AML cells. Thus, targeting the ROS/SUMO axis might constitute a therapeutic strategy for AML patients resistant to conventional chemotherapies.","['Bossis, Guillaume', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Kifagi, Chamseddine', 'Ristic, Marko', 'Saland, Estelle', 'Vergez, Francois', 'Salem, Tamara', 'Boutzen, Helena', 'Baik, Hayeon', 'Brockly, Frederique', 'Pelegrin, Mireia', 'Kaoma, Tony', 'Vallar, Laurent', 'Recher, Christian', 'Manenti, Stephane', 'Piechaczyk, Marc']","['Bossis G', 'Sarry JE', 'Kifagi C', 'Ristic M', 'Saland E', 'Vergez F', 'Salem T', 'Boutzen H', 'Baik H', 'Brockly F', 'Pelegrin M', 'Kaoma T', 'Vallar L', 'Recher C', 'Manenti S', 'Piechaczyk M']","['Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, UMR 5535 CNRS, Universite Montpellier 1, Universite Montpellier 2, 1919 Route de Mende, 34293 Montpellier, France.

Inhibition of DDX5 expression in AML cells induces apoptosis via induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This apoptotic response can be blocked either by BCL2 overexpression or treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Combining DDX5 knockdown with a BCL2 family inhibitor cooperates to induce cell death in AML cells. By inhibiting DDX5 expression in vivo, we show that DDX5 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis and tissue homeostasis.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate in the SIB recipients; antithymocyte globulin for the MUD, mmUD, and UCB recipients; and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate in the HAPLO recipients. Conditioning regimens were mostly myeloablative (69%). Advanced disease phase was more frequent, but not significantly so, in the HAPLO and mmUD groups (P = .08). Acute GVHD grade II-IV was significantly less frequent in the HAPLO, UCB, and MUD groups (14% to 21%) compared with the SIB (31%) and mmUD (42%) groups (P < .001), and there was a trend toward less moderate-severe chronic GVHD in the HAPLO and UCB groups (P = .053). The proportion of patients off cyclosporine at 1 year ranged from 55% for the SIB group to 81% for the HAPLO group (P < .001). Transplantation-related mortality at 2 years was lower in the HAPLO and SIB groups (18% to 24%) compared with the MUD, mmUD, and UCB groups (33% to 35%; P = .10). Relapse rate was comparable in the 5 groups (P = .80). The 4-year actuarial survival was 45% in the SIB group, 43% in the MUD group, 40% in the mmUD group, 34% in the UCB group, and 52% in the HAPLO group (P = .10). In multivariate analysis, advanced disease was a negative predictor of survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.4; P < .0001), together with a diagnosis of acute leukemia (HR, 1.8; P = .0001); HAPLO grafts were comparable to SIB (P = .80), whereas UCB had inferior survival (P = .03).

The immune system has to recognize syngeneic tumour cells and has to be primed and respond in an adequate manner. Priming of a leukaemia-specific immune response is a crucial step in tumour immunology that can mislead to tumour tolerance either by T cell ignorance, deletion or Treg induction. To resemble the situation of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in patients, we used the murine BALB/c model with syngeneic BM185 tumour cells. We established a tumour cell line that expresses the neo-antigen ovalbumin (BM185-OVA/GFP) to allow the application of T cell receptor transgenic, antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells. Here, we demonstrate that effective anti-ALL immunity can be established by in vivo priming of CD4(+) T cells that is sufficient to differentiate into effector cells. Yet they failed to control tumour alone, but initiated a Th1 response. An efficient tumour clearance was dependent on both antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) effector T cells from the endogenous repertoire. The tolerogeneic milieu was characterized by increased Tregs numbers and elevated IL-10 level. Tregs hamper effective antitumour immune response, but their depletion did not result in reduced tumour growth. In contrast, neutralization of IL-10 improved median mouse survival. Future therapies should focus on establishing a strong CD4+ T cells response, either by adjuvant or by adoptive transfer.","['Noyan, F', 'Lieke, T', 'Taubert, R', 'Sievers, M', 'Dywicki, J', 'Hapke, M', 'Falk, C S', 'Manns, M P', 'Jaeckel, E', 'Hardtke-Wolenski, M']","['Noyan F', 'Lieke T', 'Taubert R', 'Sievers M', 'Dywicki J', 'Hapke M', 'Falk CS', 'Manns MP', 'Jaeckel E', 'Hardtke-Wolenski M']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/blood/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/blood/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/blood/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/blood/immunology/metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Ovalbumin/genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Time Factors']",2014/06/10 06:00,2014/10/21 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/sji.12198 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2014 Sep;80(3):161-8. doi: 10.1111/sji.12198.,,,,,,,,['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although intense chemotherapeutic regimens have been useful to combat the disease, approximately 20% of patients will relapse despite treatment. Diagnosing ALL requires bone marrow puncture procedure, which many parents do not consent to for it is invasive. Additionally, metabolic alterations associated with the disease are unclear. METHODS: Metabolic alterations associated with ALL were investigated by performing serum metabolomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was also performed. RESULTS: Thirty metabolites (17 detected in positive mode and 13 in negative mode) were differentially expressed between patients with ALL and control patients; these metabolites were selected as potential biomarkers. Based on IPA analysis, glycerophospholipid metabolism is deregulated in patients with ALL and may represent an underlying metabolic pathway associated with disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolomics can be used to analyze the metabolic activity of ALL patients compared to healthy controls. The data we provide here suggest that glycerophospholipid metabolism may be a key mechanism underlying disease progression and development.","['Bai, Yunnuo', 'Zhang, Haitao', 'Sun, Xiaohan', 'Sun, Changhao', 'Ren, Lihong']","['Bai Y', 'Zhang H', 'Sun X', 'Sun C', 'Ren L']","['Department of Pediatrics, The 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Xuefu Road 246, Nangang District, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Xuefu Road 246, Nangang District, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Xuefu Road 246, Nangang District, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Baojian Road 157, Nangang District, Harbin 150081, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Xuefu Road 246, Nangang District, Harbin 150001, China.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to tumor progression in various cancers. Moreover, Notch signaling is one of the important upstream effectors of EMT promotion. Currently, it is unclear whether EMT causes pathological progression of IPMN. AIM: We evaluated the expression of EMT-promoting transcription factors Twist and B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi1) in IPMN. METHODS: Patients who underwent resections at our institute and its affiliated hospital were enrolled in this study (n = 35). Protein expression of EMT markers Twist, Bmi1, Jagged1, and E-cadherin in resected specimens was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Expression of these proteins was compared with the clinicopathological factors and patient survival. RESULTS: Positive expression of Twist and Bmi1 was observed in 40.0% and 42.9% of IPMNs, respectively. Twist and Bmi1 expression was significantly higher in IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia (P < 0.05) and invasive carcinoma (P < 0.05) than that in IPMNs with low-grade dysplasia. High expression of Twist was correlated with Jagged1 expression and inversely correlated with expression of E-cadherin (P = 0.06 and P < 0.05, respectively). In survival analyses, the recurrence rate was significantly higher in the group that showed simultaneous high expression of Twist and Bmi1 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Expression of Twist and Bmi1 is associated with aggressiveness and poor prognoses of IPMN through EMT promotion that might be induced by Notch signaling.","['Ishikawa, Daichi', 'Shimada, Mitsuo', 'Utsunomiya, Tohru', 'Morine, Yuji', 'Imura, Satoru', 'Ikemoto, Tetsuya', 'Arakawa, Yusuke', 'Kanamoto, Mami', 'Iwahashi, Shuichi', 'Saito, Yu', 'Yamada, Shinichiro', 'Miyake, Hidenori']","['Ishikawa D', 'Shimada M', 'Utsunomiya T', 'Morine Y', 'Imura S', 'Ikemoto T', 'Arakawa Y', 'Kanamoto M', 'Iwahashi S', 'Saito Y', 'Yamada S', 'Miyake H']","['Department of Surgery, The University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,8607909,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (TWIST1 protein, human)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous/*genetics/*pathology', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/*genetics/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics/*physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/*genetics/*physiology']",2014/06/10 06:00,2015/08/11 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jgh.12652 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2014 Dec;29(12):2032-7. doi: 10.1111/jgh.12652.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bmi1', 'Twist', 'cancers: biology', 'diagnosis and therapy', 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'pancreatic neoplasms: biology and therapy']",,"['(c) 2014 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley', 'Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome shows a significant anticancer effect on hematopoietic malignancies that is usually associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the role of endogenous oxidants in various cellular events of K562 leukemic cells in response to treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. MG132 at 1.4 microM potently triggered G2/M arrest, mitochondrial depolarization, and apoptosis. By such treatment, the protein level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was doubled and cellular oxidants, including nitric oxide, superoxide, and their derivatives, were increasingly produced. In MG132-treated cells, the increase in iNOS-derived oxidants was responsible for mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-dependent apoptosis, but was insignificant in G2/M arrest. The amount of iNOS was negatively correlated with that of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Whereas iNOS activity was inhibited by aminoguanidine, cellular MnSOD levels as well as mitochondrial membrane potentials were upregulated, and consequentially G2/M arrest and apoptosis were thoroughly reversed. It is suggested that cells rich in functional mitochondria possess improved proteasome activity, which antagonizes the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of MG132. In contrast to iNOS, endothelial NOS-driven cGMP-dependent signaling promoted mitochondrial function and survival of MG132-stressed cells. In conclusion, the functional interplay of proteasomes and mitochondria is crucial for leukemic cell growth, wherein iNOS plays a key role.","['Chao, Tung Hui', 'Chang, Meng-Ya', 'Su, Shu-Jem', 'Su, Shu-Hui']","['Chao TH', 'Chang MY', 'Su SJ', 'Su SH']","['Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Buddhist Tzu-Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, FooYin University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan; Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, College of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in RTX-treated patients, eventually leading to fatal liver failure, has been reported more often among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients (overt infection) than in HBsAg-negative, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) seropositive patients (resolved infection). AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews the safety of RTX in patients with overt or resolved HBV infection, providing recommendations for its safe use in such patients. EXPERT OPINION: Prior to starting RTX treatment, all patients should be screened for HBV infection. While HBsAg-positive active carriers should receive long-term antiviral treatment with entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir, inactive carriers are candidates for universal prophylaxis with lamivudine, or ETV or tenofovir in selected cases, to prevent hepatitis reactivation. Conversely, for HBsAg-negative anti-HBc positive carriers, that is, those with resolved HBV infection, universal prophylaxis with lamivudine is recommended for those with onco-hematological diseases, whereas watchful monitoring of HBsAg/HBV DNA levels is advisable for all the other indications.","['Vigano, Mauro', 'Mangia, Giampaolo', 'Lampertico, Pietro']","['Vigano M', 'Mangia G', 'Lampertico P']","['Universita degli Studi di Milano, Ospedale San Giuseppe, Division of Hepatology , Milan , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5968Y6H45M (entecavir)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '99YXE507IL (Tenofovir)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis/complications/drug therapy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*adverse effects', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/drug therapy', 'Autoimmune Diseases/complications/*drug therapy', 'Carrier State/*drug therapy', 'DNA, Viral/*blood', 'Disease Management', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Hepatitis B/chemically induced/complications/*drug therapy', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/immunology', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/*drug therapy', 'Organophosphonates/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Tenofovir', '*Virus Activation']",2014/06/10 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2014.912273 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2014 Jul;14(7):1019-31. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2014.912273.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'hepatitis B reactivation', 'hepatitis B virus', 'nucleos(t)ides analogs', 'prophylaxis', 'rituximab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MKL1 has three RPEL motifs (RPEL1, RPEL2, and RPEL3) in its N-terminal region. MKL1 binds to monomeric G-actin through RPEL motifs, and the dissociation of MKL1 from G-actin promotes the translocation of MKL1 to the nucleus. Although structural data are available for RPEL motifs of MKL1 in complex with G-actin, the structural characteristics of RPEL motifs in the free state have been poorly defined. Here we characterized the structures of free RPEL motifs using NMR and CD spectroscopy. NMR and CD measurements showed that free RPEL motifs are largely unstructured in solution. However, NMR analysis identified transient alpha-helices in the regions where helices alpha1 and alpha2 are induced upon binding to G-actin. Proline mutagenesis showed that the transient alpha-helices are locally formed without helix-helix interactions. The helix content is higher in the order of RPEL1, RPEL2, and RPEL3. The amount of preformed structure may correlate with the binding affinity between the intrinsically disordered protein and its target molecule.","['Mizuguchi, Mineyuki', 'Fuju, Takahiro', 'Obita, Takayuki', 'Ishikawa, Mitsuru', 'Tsuda, Masaaki', 'Tabuchi, Akiko']","['Mizuguchi M', 'Fuju T', 'Obita T', 'Ishikawa M', 'Tsuda M', 'Tabuchi A']","['Laboratory of Structural Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Structural Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Structural Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', '1] Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan [2].', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Actins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Motifs/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary/*physiology', 'Serum Response Factor/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*chemistry/metabolism']",2014/06/10 06:00,2015/10/23 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['srep05224 [pii]', '10.1038/srep05224 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2014 Jun 9;4:5224. doi: 10.1038/srep05224.,,20140609,,PMC4048911,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: KG1-alpha cells were cultured in 96-well plate and harvested in the exponential phase. The cells were induced in the presence of different concentrations of Rg1, Rb1, Rh2 respectively for 24, 48, 72 hours. The conventional culture was performed in blank control group, and cytarabine hydrochloride as the positive control. The inhibitory effects of ginsenoside Rb1, Rg1, Rh2 on the growth of KG1-alpha cells were tested by CCK-8 assay. Then the most efficient ginsenoside was chosen for the further study by IC50. The effects of the ginsenoside Rh2 on cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry (FCM) combined with PI staining and annexin V-FITC/PI, respectively. The expressions of P53, P21, cyclin D1 and cleaved-caspase-3 were examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: CCK-8 assay results showed that IC50 of ginsenoside Rh2, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rg1 and cytarabine were 75, 207, 268, 1058 mumol/L, respectively. Compared with those in blank control group, the KG1-alpha cells after treated with 75 mumol/L ginsenoside Rh2 showed up-regulated apoptosis rates from (5.37+/-0.02)% to (8.37+/-0.015)% at 24 hours and to (33.22+/-1.67)% at 48 hours (P<0.05). In addition, the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase increased significantly from (26.78+/-3.14)% to (29.26+/-2.31)% at 24 hours and to (44.77+/-2.26)% at 48 hours, and the percentage in S phase decreased significantly from (65.43+/-2.22)% to (51.46+/-0.57)% and (48.29+/-1.80)%, respectively. The expression levels of cleaved-caspase 3, P53 and P21 proteins went up significantly when the cells were treated with 75 mumol/L Rh2(P<0.05), meanwhile cyclin D1 protein dropped significantly (P<0.05).

Long-term risks of performing X-ray procedures on children and adolescents for medical diagnosis have raised significant concerns. METHODS: In this study, we adopt the case-control methodology to evaluate the relationship between the incidence rate of acute leukaemia and exposure to radiation during diagnostic X-ray examinations for children. Based on 1998-2010 data obtained from the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance database, we selected 58 children with leukaemia and randomly selected an additional 232 children as the control group. RESULTS: The mean age of children with leukaemia is 8.92 +/- 5.24 years. The risk of leukaemia in children who underwent X-ray examinations increased 2.14-fold (95% CI, 1.18-3.87). In this study, we identified that, when undergoing X-ray examinations, the risk of leukaemia in children increased for both sex and age groups. Specifically, the relationship between leukaemia and X-ray in boys (OR = 3.28, 95%CI, 1.33-8.07) and in ages of 6 to 11 years (OR = 2.58, 95%CI, 1.09-6.10) was significant. Overall, the risk of leukaemia in children who underwent X-ray examinations progressively increased from a ratio of 1.65 to 3.14. Moreover, an identical trend was observed for boys (1.85 to 6.42).

Fli-1 has since been recognized to play critical roles in normal development and homeostasis. For example, it transcriptionally regulates genes that drive normal hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis. Indeed, Fli-1 is one of 10 key regulators of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation. Aberrant expression of Fli-1 also underlies a number of virally induced leukemias, including Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia and various types of human cancers, and it is the target of chromosomal translocations in childhood Ewing's sarcoma. Abnormal expression of Fli-1 is important in the etiology of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. These studies establish Fli-1 as a strong candidate for drug development. Despite difficulties in targeting transcription factors, recent studies identified small-molecule inhibitors for Fli-1. Here we review past and ongoing research on Fli-1 with emphasis on its mechanistic function in autoimmune disease and malignant transformation. The significance of identifying Fli-1 inhibitors and their clinical applications for treatment of disease and cancer with deregulated Fli-1 expression are discussed.","['Li, Y', 'Luo, H', 'Liu, T', 'Zacksenhaus, E', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Li Y', 'Luo H', 'Liu T', 'Zacksenhaus E', 'Ben-David Y']","['Department of Anatomy, Norman Bethune College of Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Division of Biology, the Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, China.', 'Division of Biology, the Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, China.', '1] Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada [2] Division of Advanced Diagnostics, Toronto General Research Institute-University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] Division of Biology, the Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, China [2] Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/genetics', 'Mice', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/genetics']",2014/06/10 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014162 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.162 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Apr 16;34(16):2022-31. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.162.

However, whether or not the self-renewal program is retained from stem cells or conferred on progenitors by leukemogenic molecules remains unknown. We have addressed the issue in the context of TEL-AML1-associated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by profiling a refined program edited from genes essential for self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and B-cell development. Bioinformatic analysis shows that ALL populations are loosely clustered and close to the normal population that contains stem and primitive progenitor cells. This finding indicates that immunophenotypes do not reflect maturation stages in ALL and that the self-renewal program may be retained from stem cells. Results of assessing 'first hit' function of TEL-AML1 in different populations of normal cells demonstrate the molecular model. Therefore, the current study shows a leukemogenic scenario of human ALL in which programs of stem cells are sustained in distinct fractions by leukemogenic mutations.","['Fan, D', 'Zhou, X', 'Li, Z', 'Li, Z-Q', 'Duan, C', 'Liu, T', 'Zhang, F', 'Huang, Y', 'Zhang, Y', 'Gao, F', 'Guo, Y', 'Gupta, R', 'Chen, G', 'Enver, T', 'Tang, J', 'Hong, D']","['Fan D', 'Zhou X', 'Li Z', 'Li ZQ', 'Duan C', 'Liu T', 'Zhang F', 'Huang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Gao F', 'Guo Y', 'Gupta R', 'Chen G', 'Enver T', 'Tang J', 'Hong D']","[""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Ruijin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Ruijin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Ruijin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Cord Blood Bank, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Cord Blood Bank, Shanghai, China.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China."", ""1] Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China [2] Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology']",2014/06/10 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2014/06/10 06:00'],"['2013/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014148 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.148 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Apr 16;34(16):2083-93. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.148.

Self -esteem and stress coping mechanism developed during education period is foundation for professional practice. So, this study was conducted to identify self-esteem, coping activities, and their relationship. METHODS: Descriptive cross sectional study was conducted among 287 PCL nursing students currently studying in different level in nursing campuses of the Institute of Medicine during June and July 2013. Self administered semi structured questionnaire and rating scales were used for the data collection. RESULTS: Findings showed that 21 (7.31%), 194 (67.5%), and 67 (23.34%), students had have very high, high and moderate, self-esteem and only five (1.74%) have low self-esteem.The difference in self-esteem level was insignificant with the level of the students. Students most frequently used problem focused (3.36+/-0.54) followed by emotion focused (3.04+/-0.45) and avoidance coping activities (2.91+/-0.63). The relationship of use of coping activities and level of students was statistically insignificant. Self-esteem level had positive relation with problem focused and emotion focused coping activities (Pearson r: 0.114 and 0.118), though the correlation was significant with emotion focused coping activities only.

METHODS: Ninety-one children with ALL who received high-dose MTX were recruited. The polymorphisms FPGS (rs1544105 G>A), GGH (rs3758149 C>T), and MTHFR (rs1801133 C>T) were genotyped through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Serum MTX was measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The association between targeted polymorphisms and MTX concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratios was assessed, and between targeted polymorphisms and the percent of MTX above the therapeutic threshold (40 micromol/L). RESULTS: The minor allele frequencies of rs1544105 G (34.1%), rs3758149 T (19.2%), and rs1801133 C (48.4%) observed in our population were significantly lower than those reported for European populations (64.2, 30.8, and 69.0%, respectively). The association between the GGH rs3758149 polymorphism and MTX C/D was gender-specific; in girls, the MTX C/D at 24 h of GGH rs3758149 CC carriers (12.09 mumol/L per g/m(2)) was significantly lower than that of CT or TT carriers (16.80 mumol/L per g/m(2)). The percent of serum MTX above the therapeutic threshold in GGH rs3758149 CC carriers (18.3%) was significantly lower than that of CT and TT carriers (38.7%). The MTX C/D ratios at 24 h and the percent of MTX >40 micromol/L for the A-T-T (three variant alleles) haplotype were significantly higher than those for other haplotypes combined (P < 0.05).

The term ""toxic erythema of chemotherapy"" (TEC) has been coined to describe a spectrum of skin findings, ranging from palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia to erythema of major body folds, with erythroderma representing its most severe form. To clarify the types and frequencies of cutaneous reactions associated with clofarabine plus cytarabine chemotherapy and to compare these to those observed with clofarabine alone, we reviewed our institutional experience over a 5-year period. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 49 patients who were treated with either regimen for acute leukemia. To facilitate comparison of the cutaneous toxicities, only patients treated with clofarabine 40 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days (days 1-5) with or without cytarabine 1 g/m(2) daily for 5 days (days 2-6) were included. RESULTS: Ten patients were treated with clofarabine alone, and 40 patients received clofarabine plus cytarabine; one patient received both regimens. Treatment-associated skin toxicity developed 3-9 days following the initiation of chemotherapy and was more common in the group receiving the two-drug combination as compared to those receiving clofarabine alone [22/40 (55%) vs. 1/10 (10%) respectively, p = 0.014]. The majority of chemotherapy-related cutaneous side effects represented TEC. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous toxicity was common and more frequent in the clofarabine plus cytarabine group when compared to patients treated with clofarabine alone. This finding is relevant for both clinicians and patients.","['Zhang, Bingnan', 'Bolognia, Jean', 'Marks, Peter', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai']","['Zhang B', 'Bolognia J', 'Marks P', 'Podoltsev N']","['Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA, bingnan.zhang@yale.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/*chemically induced']",2014/06/09 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2014/06/09 06:00'],"['2014/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2504-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2014 Aug;74(2):303-7. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2504-y.

However, their low response rates and adverse effects continue to drive the discovery of newer DNMT1 depleting agents. Herein, we identified two novel 2'-deoxycytidine (dCyd) analogs, 4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine (T-dCyd) and 5-aza-4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-T-dCyd) that potently deplete DNMT1 in both in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and concomitantly inhibit tumor growth. METHODS: DNMT1 protein levels in in vitro and in vivo cancer models were determined by Western blotting and antitumor efficacy was evaluated using xenografts. Effects on CpG methylation were evaluated using methylation-specific PCR. T-dCyd metabolism was evaluated using radiolabeled substrate. RESULTS: T-dCyd markedly depleted DNMT1 in CCRF-CEM and KG1a leukemia and NCI-H23 lung carcinoma cell lines, while it was ineffective in the HCT-116 colon or IGROV-1 ovarian tumor lines. On the other hand, aza-T-dCyd potently depleted DNMT1 in all of these lines indicating that dCyd analogs with minor structural dissimilarities induce different DNMT1 turnover mechanisms. Although T-dCyd was deaminated to 4'-thio-2'-deoxyuridine, very little was converted to 4'-thio-thymidine nucleotides, suggesting that inhibition of thymidylate synthase would be minimal with 4'-thio dCyd analogs. Both T-dCyd and aza-T-dCyd also depleted DNMT1 in human tumor xenografts and markedly reduced in vivo tumor growth. Interestingly, the selectivity index of aza-T-dCyd was at least tenfold greater than that of decitabine. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data show that 4'-thio modified dCyd analogs, such as T-dCyd or aza-T-dCyd, could be a new source of clinically effective DNMT1 depleting anticancer compounds with less toxicity.","['Thottassery, Jaideep V', 'Sambandam, Vijaya', 'Allan, Paula W', 'Maddry, Joseph A', 'Maxuitenko, Yulia Y', 'Tiwari, Kamal', 'Hollingshead, Melinda', 'Parker, William B']","['Thottassery JV', 'Sambandam V', 'Allan PW', 'Maddry JA', 'Maxuitenko YY', 'Tiwari K', 'Hollingshead M', 'Parker WB']","['Drug Discovery Division, Southern Research Institute, 2000 Ninth Avenue South, Birmingham, AL, 35205, USA, thottassery@southernresearch.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""134111-30-1 (2'-deoxy-4'-thiocytidine)"", 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thionucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/06/09 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2014/06/09 06:00'],"['2013/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2503-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2014 Aug;74(2):291-302. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2503-z.

METHOD: The highly tumorigenic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice to establish a human leukemia xenograft model. The HL-60 xenograft nude mice models were randomly divided into four groups: control (Normal saline, NS), 50mg/kg DFO, 3mg/kg ATO, the combined treatment (50mg/kg DFO+1.5mg/kg ATO) once HL-60 cells were inoculated. Tumor sizes, growth curves, inhibitory rates, cell apoptosis, and the expression of apoptosis related markers were measured to evaluate the tumor growth. RESULTS: Xenografted tumors were observed in all nude mice since the 5th day of inoculation. The inhibitory rates of tumor weight were 2.67%, 10.69%, and 25.57% in DFO, ATO and combination therapy groups, respectively. The combination of DFO with ATO induces significantly more tumor cell apoptosis than either agent alone (p<0.05). The expression of NF-kappaBp65 and survivin proteins decreased significantly while the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax increased in the combination therapy group (p<0.05). Double immunofluorescence for Caspase-3 and NFkappaBp65 demonstrated an inverse relationship between Caspase-3-positive areas and NFkappaBp65-positive areas, as well as the co-localization of Bax and survivin in xenografted tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of DFO and ATO has synergistic effects on tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis-inducing in vivo with no significant side effects. The DFO and ATO can up-regulate the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax, and down-regulate the expression of NF-kappaBp65 and survivin, especially for their combination.","['Yu, Runhong', 'Wang, Dao', 'Ren, Xiuhua', 'Zeng, Li', 'Liu, Yufeng']","['Yu R', 'Wang D', 'Ren X', 'Zeng L', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Key Discipline Laboratory of Clinical Medicine, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Key Discipline Laboratory of Clinical Medicine, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Human Anatomy, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Key Discipline Laboratory of Clinical Medicine, Zhengzhou 450052, China.

Aberrant expression of TGFbeta1 and IL-10 has been associated with many types of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, as well as with many types of cancer and leukemia. Patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) have high levels of malignant CD4+ T cells expressing IL-10 and TGFbeta1 that suppress the immune system and diminish the antitumor responses. The transcriptional regulation of TGFbeta1 and IL-10 expression is orchestrated by several transcription factors, including NFkappaB. However, while the transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes by NFkappaB has been studied extensively, much less is known about the NFkappaB regulation of immunosuppressive genes. In this chapter, we describe a protocol that uses chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to analyze the transcriptional regulation of TGFbeta1 and IL-10 by measuring recruitment of NFkappaB p65, p50, c-Rel, Rel-B, and p52 subunits to TGFbeta1 and IL-10 promoters in human CTCL Hut-78 cells.","['Chang, Tzu-Pei', 'Kim, Myra', 'Vancurova, Ivana']","['Chang TP', 'Kim M', 'Vancurova I']","[""Department of Biology, St. John's University, 8000 Utopia Parkway, Queens, NY, 11439, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelB/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/06/09 06:00,2015/01/21 06:00,['2014/06/09 06:00'],"['2014/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-0928-5_30 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1172:329-41. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-0928-5_30.,"['R15 CA173452/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA173452/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the number of tissue macrophages is low and not likely to cope satisfactorily with the excess number of dying neutrophils. Although recent studies have reported that neutrophils are able to engulf apoptotic neutrophils, the mechanisms by which living neutrophils are attracted to apoptotic neutrophils are poorly defined. Increased amounts of CX3CL1 and microparticles (MPs) are rapidly released by apoptotic cells, and are involved in the chemoattraction of mononuclear phagocytes toward apoptotic cells. The current study investigated the role of CX3CL1 in the chemoattraction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-treated NB4 (ATRA-NB4) cells toward apoptotic cells. METHODS: Conditioning medium and MPs were harvested from apoptotic ATRA-NB4 cell cultures to determine their effects on living ATRA-NB4 cells by transmigration assay and adhesion assay. The cytokine levels in the conditioning medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of CX3CR1 (a receptor of CX3CL1) on ATRA-NB4 cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: ATRA-NB4 cells transmigrated toward the apoptotic ATRA-NB4 cells, and this chemoattraction was partially inhibited when the CX3CR1 on ATRA-NB4 cells was blocked by its specific antibody. Both exogenous CX3CL1 and MPs released by apoptotic ATRA-NB4 cells were able to enhance the chemoattraction of ATRA-NB4 cells toward apoptotic cells or the adhesion of ATRA-NB4 cells to endothelial cells. CX3CL1 was expressed on the surface of MPs, and blocking this CX3CL1 with its specific antibody was able to partially inhibit the chemoattractive property of MPs. CONCLUSION: CX3CL1, in either the free or MP form, is released rapidly by apoptotic ATRA-NB4 cells after induction of apoptosis to mediate the chemoattraction of living ATRA-NB4 cells toward apoptotic cells.","['Tsai, Wen-Hui', 'Shih, Chung-Hung', 'Feng, Shan-Yu', 'Chang, Shao-Chi', 'Lin, Yu-Chieh', 'Hsu, Hui-Chi']","['Tsai WH', 'Shih CH', 'Feng SY', 'Chang SC', 'Lin YC', 'Hsu HC']","['Department of Respiratory Therapy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Respiratory Therapy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Physiology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Physiology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Physiology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Physiology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC; Division of General Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.

Transmission electron microscopy and acridine orange staining demonstrated the presence of autophagic vesicles and intracellular acidification, respectively, in idarubicin-treated REH leukemic cell line. Idarubicin increased punctuation/aggregation of microtubule-associated light chain 3B (LC3B), enhanced the conversion of LC3B-I to autophagosome-associated LC3B-II in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors, and promoted the degradation of the selective autophagic target p62, thus indicating the increase in autophagic flux. Idarubicin inhibited the phosphorylation of the main autophagy repressor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream target p70S6 kinase. The treatment with the mTOR activator leucine prevented idarubicin-mediated autophagy induction. Idarubicin-induced mTOR repression was associated with the activation of the mTOR inhibitor AMP-activated protein kinase and down-regulation of the mTOR activator Akt. The suppression of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or LC3B and beclin-1 genetic knockdown rescued REH cells from idarubicin-mediated oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization, caspase activation and apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Idarubicin also caused mTOR inhibition and cytotoxic autophagy in K562 leukemic cell line and leukocytes from chronic myeloid leukemia patients, but not healthy controls. By demonstrating mTOR-dependent cytotoxic autophagy in idarubicin-treated leukemic cells, our results warrant caution when considering combining idarubicin with autophagy inhibitors in leukemia therapy.","['Ristic, Biljana', 'Bosnjak, Mihajlo', 'Arsikin, Katarina', 'Mircic, Aleksandar', 'Suzin-Zivkovic, Violeta', 'Bogdanovic, Andrija', 'Perovic, Vladimir', 'Martinovic, Tamara', 'Kravic-Stevovic, Tamara', 'Bumbasirevic, Vladimir', 'Trajkovic, Vladimir', 'Harhaji-Trajkovic, Ljubica']","['Ristic B', 'Bosnjak M', 'Arsikin K', 'Mircic A', 'Suzin-Zivkovic V', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Perovic V', 'Martinovic T', 'Kravic-Stevovic T', 'Bumbasirevic V', 'Trajkovic V', 'Harhaji-Trajkovic L']","['Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Dr. Subotica 1, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Dr. Subotica 1, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinic for Hematology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Dr. Subotica 1, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Dr. Subotica 1, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.

We performed a retrospective analysis of serial chimerism assessments in 101 adult HCT recipients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and of serial MRD assessments in a subgroup of 22 patients. All patients had received myeloablative conditioning. The cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly higher in the patients with increasing mixed chimerism (in-MC) compared with those with complete chimerism, low-level MC, and decreasing MC, but the sensitivity of in-MC detection with regard to relapse prediction was only modest. In contrast, MRD assessment was highly sensitive and specific. Patients with MRD positivity after HCT had the highest incidence of relapse among all prognostic groups analyzed. The median time from MRD positivity to relapse was longer than the median time from detection of in-MC, but in some cases in-MC preceded MRD positivity. We conclude that MRD assessment is a powerful prognostic tool that should be included in the routine post-transplantation monitoring of patients with ALL, but chimerism analysis may provide additional information in some cases. Integration of these tools and clinical judgment should allow optimal decision making with regard to post-transplantation therapeutic interventions.","['Terwey, Theis Helge', 'Hemmati, Philipp Georg', 'Nagy, Marion', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Le Duc, Tanja Melinh', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Arnold, Renate']","['Terwey TH', 'Hemmati PG', 'Nagy M', 'Pfeifer H', 'Gokbuget N', 'Bruggemann M', 'Le Duc TM', 'le Coutre P', 'Dorken B', 'Arnold R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite-University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

However, the functional interplay of KAP1 PTMs in regulating KAP1 turnover during DNA damage response remains unclear. To decipher the role and cross-talk of multiple KAP1 PTMs, we show here that DNA double strand break-induced KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation promoted the recruitment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase, ring finger protein 4 (RNF4), and subsequent RNF4-mediated, SUMO-dependent degradation. Besides the SUMO interacting motif (SIM), a previously unrecognized, but evolutionarily conserved, arginine-rich motif (ARM) in RNF4 acts as a novel recognition motif for selective target recruitment. Results from combined mutagenesis and computational modeling studies suggest that RNF4 utilizes concerted bimodular recognition, namely SIM for Lys-676 SUMOylation and ARM for Ser(P)-824 of simultaneously phosphorylated and SUMOylated KAP1 (Ser(P)-824-SUMO-KAP1). Furthermore, we proved that arginines 73 and 74 within the ARM of RNF4 are required for efficient recruitment to KAP1 or accelerated degradation of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) under stress. In parallel, results of bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays validated the role of the ARM in recognizing Ser(P)-824 in living cells. Taken together, we establish that the ARM is required for RNF4 to efficiently target Ser(P)-824-SUMO-KAP1, conferring ubiquitin Lys-48-mediated proteasomal degradation in the context of double strand breaks. The conservation of such a motif may possibly explain the requirement for timely substrate selectivity determination among a myriad of SUMOylated proteins under stress conditions. Thus, the ARM dynamically regulates the SIM-dependent recruitment of targets to RNF4, which could be critical to dynamically fine-tune the abundance of Ser(P)-824-SUMO-KAP1 and, potentially, other SUMOylated proteins during DNA damage response.","['Kuo, Ching-Ying', 'Li, Xu', 'Kong, Xiang-Qian', 'Luo, Cheng', 'Chang, Che-Chang', 'Chung, Yiyin', 'Shih, Hsiu-Ming', 'Li, Keqin Kathy', 'Ann, David K']","['Kuo CY', 'Li X', 'Kong XQ', 'Luo C', 'Chang CC', 'Chung Y', 'Shih HM', 'Li KK', 'Ann DK']","['From the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010.', 'From the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and.', 'the Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zu Chong Zhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'the Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zu Chong Zhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan, and.', 'From the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and.', 'the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan, and.', 'the State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Ruijin II Road, Shanghai 200025, China kli@epigenetic.us.', 'From the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, dann@coh.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM28 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', '*DNA Damage', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proteolysis', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28']",2014/06/08 06:00,2015/02/12 06:00,['2014/06/08 06:00'],"['2014/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47595-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.555672 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 25;289(30):20757-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.555672.

RESULTS: Among patients of the discovery group, allergies, and pancreatitis were more frequent in individuals who are homozygous for the triple-repeat allele (3R) of the asparagine synthetase (ASNS) gene, resulting in remarkably higher risk of these toxicities associated with 3R3R genotype [OR for allergies, 14.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.6-58.7; P < 0.0005 and OR for pancreatitis, 8.6; 95% CI, 2.0-37.3; P = 0.01]. In contrast, the ASNS haplotype *1 harboring double-repeat (2R) allele had protective effect against these adverse reactions (P </= 0.01). The same haplotype was previously reported to confer reduction in EFS. The risk effect of 3R3R genotype was not replicated in the validation cohort, whereas the protective effect of haplotype *1 against allergies was maintained (P </= 0.002). Analysis with additional polymorphisms in ASNS locus in lymphoblastoid cell lines showed that haplotype *1 is diversified in several subtypes of which one was associated with reduced in vitro sensitivity to ASNase (rs10486009, P = 0.01) possibly explaining an association seen in clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS: This finding might have implication for treatment individualization in ALL and other cancers using asparagine depletion strategies. Clin Cancer Res; 21(2); 329-34. (c)2014 AACR.

Paediatric patients are more likely to present with high risk features including elevated WBC count or microgranular variant (M3v). Yet the early death rate is lower in paediatric patients compared to adult patients. Overall outcomes such as CR, OS and EFS appear similar in paediatric and adult patients treated on similar regimens except that very young children may have a higher risk of relapse. While contemporary studies have clearly demonstrated improved survival in adults receiving ATO therapy, currently there is more limited data on the role of ATO in paediatric patients.

This raises questions about the relevance of post-remission monitoring for PML-RARA transcripts, which has been widely used to predict relapse, guiding early intervention to prevent disease progression and the inherent risk of fatal bleeding. Given the treatability of haematological relapse, survival benefits would only be seen if monitoring could identify patients who could be salvaged if treated early but not later on, although it could be argued that early deployment of arsenic trioxide (ATO) can avoid inducing hyperleucocytosis and the associated differentiation syndrome, which frequently complicate treatment of frank relapse. However, given the low rates of relapse now observed in patients presenting with standard risk disease (i.e. presenting WBC<10x10(9)/l) who achieve early molecular remission, subsequent sequential minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring confers only a marginal benefit, so could be avoided in this group. However, sequential MRD monitoring may still be of value in patients with high risk APL, although evidence tends to come from historically controlled studies. Therefore, there may remain a role for MRD monitoring in the most clinically challenging subsets of APL, but the continuing debate highlights the need for robust evidence in developing a more individualized approach to management of other subtypes of acute leukaemia.","['Grimwade, David', 'Jovanovic, Jelena V', 'Hills, Robert K']","['Grimwade D', 'Jovanovic JV', 'Hills RK']","[""Cancer Genetics Lab, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, 8th Floor, Tower Wing, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, UK.

Additionally, the intensity of consolidation chemotherapy has evolved according to a universally accepted relapse-risk stratification algorithm based on the white cell and platelet counts at presentation. That standard of care is being challenged by the increasing incorporation of arsenic trioxide into front-line treatment protocols, based on two complementary observations. The first is the undoubted anti-leukaemic activity of arsenic trioxide as shown in the relapsed and refractory setting, and in the initial management of low- and intermediate-risk patients. The second is an improved understanding of the action of both all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide in mediating APL cell eradication, with increasing recognition that PML-RARA fusion protein degradation rather than direct induction of terminal differentiation is the primary mechanism for their ability to eliminate leukaemia initiating cells. As a result, we believe the standard of care for initial therapy in APL is shifting towards an all-trans retinoic acid plus arsenic trioxide-based approach, with additional chemotherapy reserved for patients with high-risk disease.","['Iland, Harry J', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Seymour, John F']","['Iland HJ', 'Wei A', 'Seymour JF']","['Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Missenden Road, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

In this chapter, the known causes of abnormalities in haemostatic function, namely the coagulopathy and changes in the fibrinolytic system, will be reviewed. Major risk factors for these complications are identified. Current available measures for correction of the coagulopathy and their effectiveness are critically examined. Unless the coagulopathy can be effectively controlled, bleeding complications will remain an obstacle to achieving a cure for this disease.

At the genetic level, APL is featured by a unique chromosome translocation t(15;17) which results in the PML-RARalpha gene fusion and chimeric protein. APL is the first example of differentiation therapy targeted to a defined genetic target i.e. PML-RARalpha. PML-RARalpha behaves as an altered retinoic acid receptor with an ability of transmitting oncogenic signaling leading to accumulation of undifferentiated promyelocytes. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces disease remission in APL patients by triggering terminal differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes. More recently, arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to contribute degradation of the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein through bonding the PML moiety and has shown excellent synergism with ATRA in clinical trials. Elucidating the oncogenic signaling of PML-RARalpha through various transcription factors and the study of APL mouse models have greatly helped to understand the molecular pathogenesis of APL. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which t(15;17) is formed and initiates leukemia remains unknown. While transforming oncogenic potential of PML-RARalpha has been described extensively, the mechanistic events important for the formation of t(15;17) have been taken from the model of Therapy-related APL (t-APL).","['Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Hasan, Syed Khizer']","['Lo-Coco F', 'Hasan SK']","[""Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome 'Tor Vergata' and Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy.

To date, cross-sectional evidence indicates that LP/BMA procedures continue to elicit distress over the course of treatment in children and parents. METHOD: The current study used prospective analyses investigating in 28 children diagnosed with leukemia, the course of parental and child distress when confronted with consecutive LP/BMA procedures and potential moderation by catastrophic thinking. Parents' level of catastrophic thoughts was assessed before the first treatment-related LP/BMA, while child and parent distress was reported on after each LP/BMA procedure. RESULTS: Whereas parental distress decreased over time among low catastrophizing parents, LP/BMA procedures remained highly distressing for high catastrophizing parents. Child distress during LP/BMA procedures increased over time and was positively related with parental distress. CONCLUSION: These findings stress the importance of targeting child and parent distress as early as possible in treatment.","['Caes, Line', 'Goubert, Liesbet', 'Devos, Patricia', 'Verlooy, Joris', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Vervoort, Tine']","['Caes L', 'Goubert L', 'Devos P', 'Verlooy J', 'Benoit Y', 'Vervoort T']","['Centre for Pediatric Pain Research, IWK Health Centre, Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, and Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Ghent University line.caes@outlook.com.', 'Centre for Pediatric Pain Research, IWK Health Centre, Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, and Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Ghent University.', 'Centre for Pediatric Pain Research, IWK Health Centre, Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, and Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Ghent University.', 'Centre for Pediatric Pain Research, IWK Health Centre, Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, and Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Ghent University.', 'Centre for Pediatric Pain Research, IWK Health Centre, Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, and Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Ghent UniversityCentre for Pediatric Pain Research, IWK Health Centre, Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, and Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Ghent University.', 'Centre for Pediatric Pain Research, IWK Health Centre, Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, and Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Ghent University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Psychol,Journal of pediatric psychology,7801773,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Catastrophization/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/*psychology', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Spinal Puncture/psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/08 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2014/06/08 06:00'],"['2014/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['jsu034 [pii]', '10.1093/jpepsy/jsu034 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Psychol. 2014 Aug;39(7):677-86. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/jsu034.

On the basis of the recent demonstration that nuclear G-actin regulates MRTF nuclear export and observations from our laboratory and others that the RhoA effector, mDia2, shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, we investigated whether nuclear RhoA signaling plays a role in regulating MRTF activity. We identified sequences that control mDia2 nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling and used mDia2 variants to demonstrate that the ability of mDia2 to fully stimulate MRTF nuclear accumulation and SMC-specific gene transcription was dependent on its localization to the nucleus. To test whether RhoA signaling promotes nuclear actin polymerization, we established a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)-based assay to measure green fluorescent protein-actin diffusion in the nuclear compartment. Nuclear actin FRAP was delayed in cells expressing nuclear-targeted constitutively active mDia1 and mDia2 variants and in cells treated with the polymerization inducer, jasplakinolide. In contrast, FRAP was enhanced in cells expressing a nuclear-targeted variant of mDia that inhibits both mDia1 and mDia2. Treatment of 10T1/2 cells with sphingosine 1-phosphate induced RhoA activity in the nucleus and forced nuclear localization of RhoA or the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), leukemia-associated RhoGEF, enhanced the ability of these proteins to stimulate MRTF activity. Taken together, these data support the emerging idea that RhoA-dependent nuclear actin polymerization has important effects on transcription and nuclear structure.","['Staus, Dean P', 'Weise-Cross, Laura', 'Mangum, Kevin D', 'Medlin, Matt D', 'Mangiante, Lee', 'Taylor, Joan M', 'Mack, Christopher P']","['Staus DP', 'Weise-Cross L', 'Mangum KD', 'Medlin MD', 'Mangiante L', 'Taylor JM', 'Mack CP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina cmack@med.unc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Compound (1S,2S)-16b exhibited antiviral activity against Influenza A H3N2 subtype (EC50=20muM-visual CPE score; EC50=18muM-MTS method; MCC >100muM, CC50 >100muM) in Madin Darby canine kidney cell cultures (MDCK), and (1S,2S)-16k was active against vesicular stomatitis virus and respiratory syncytial virus in HeLa cells (EC50=9 and 12muM, respectively). Moreover, compound (1R,2S)-16l showed activity against both herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2) in HEL cell cultures (EC50=2.9 and 4muM, respectively) and feline herpes virus in CRFK cells (EC50=4muM) but at the same time it exhibited cytotoxicity toward uninfected cell (MCC4muM). Several other compounds have been found to inhibit proliferation of L1210, CEM as well as HeLa cells with IC50 in the 4-50muM range. Among them compounds (1S,2S)- and (1R,2S)-16l were the most active (IC50 in the 4-7muM range).","['Glowacka, Iwona E', 'Balzarini, Jan', 'Andrei, Graciela', 'Snoeck, Robert', 'Schols, Dominique', 'Piotrowska, Dorota G']","['Glowacka IE', 'Balzarini J', 'Andrei G', 'Snoeck R', 'Schols D', 'Piotrowska DG']","['Bioorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151 Lodz, Poland.

Since then, it has been shown very convincingly that viruses can directly cause several human cancers by various mechanisms. Epidemiological data imply that viruses are the second most important risk factor for cancer development in humans, exceeded only by tobacco consumption. Although the ability of certain viruses (hepatitis B and C, human papillomavirus, etc) to cause cancer has been time tested and proven scientifically, there are several other potential viral candidates whose role in oncogenesis is more controversial. One such controversial scenario involves the role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in malignant gliomas, the most common form of primary brain tumour. CMV first attracted attention about a decade ago when CMV gene products were found in glioma tissue but not in normal brain. Since this initial observation, several different groups have shown an oncomodulatory effect of CMV; however, direct association between CMV infection and incidence of glioma is lacking. In this review, we will evaluate the evidence, both preclinical and clinical, regarding the possible role of CMV in gliomagenesis and maintenance. We will also critically evaluate the rationale for using antiviral drugs in the treatment of patients with glioma.","['Dey, Mahua', 'Ahmed, Atique U', 'Lesniak, Maciej S']","['Dey M', 'Ahmed AU', 'Lesniak MS']","['The Brain Tumor Center, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'The Brain Tumor Center, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'The Brain Tumor Center, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2985191R,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/*virology', 'Carcinogenesis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*complications/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Glioma/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/*virology', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2014/06/08 06:00,2015/04/02 06:00,['2014/06/08 06:00'],"['2014/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['jnnp-2014-307727 [pii]', '10.1136/jnnp-2014-307727 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2015 Feb;86(2):191-9. doi: 10.1136/jnnp-2014-307727.

This paper reviews economic models of CML treatment to learn lessons from this experience and support ongoing efforts to model CML. A search of databases and submissions to key health technology assessment agencies identified 12 studies that reported 22 models. Common practice included the use of cohort Markov models-most models used health states organised around the key stages in CML: chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast phase-and the use of utility estimates in the literature that correspond with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case. Two key areas of uncertainty were the extrapolation of survival outcomes beyond the period observed by the trial; and the effectiveness of second-line therapies. Further work is required to overcome these uncertainties in existing models, such as longer-term trial data collection, including trials of second-line therapies; validation of health-related quality-of-life instruments; and the testing of alternative modelling approaches. In the meantime, it is important that the impact of uncertainties is tested through the use of sensitivity and scenario analysis.","['Marsh, Kevin', 'Xu, Peng', 'Orfanos, Panagiotis', 'Benedict, Agnes', 'Desai, Kamal', 'Griebsch, Ingolf']","['Marsh K', 'Xu P', 'Orfanos P', 'Benedict A', 'Desai K', 'Griebsch I']","['Evidera, Metro Building, 6th Floor, 1 Butterwick, London, W6 8DL, UK, kevin.marsh@evidera.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*economics', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*economics/*therapy', 'Markov Chains', '*Models, Economic', 'Survival Rate']",2014/06/08 06:00,2016/02/16 06:00,['2014/06/08 06:00'],"['2014/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40273-014-0177-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2014 Sep;32(9):853-64. doi: 10.1007/s40273-014-0177-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both cases presented in neonatal period which is a rare age of presentation in this disease. A 20 days old female neonate presented with respiratory symptoms which rapidly progressed needing ventilatory support. There was hepatomegaly and no auscultatory findings in the chest. Serial CBCs (complete blood counts) showed persistent leucocytosis with predominant lymphocytosis. Her chest X-ray showed left sided consolidation which responded poorly to antibiotics. Her prompt clinical response to steroids raised the suspicion of autoimmunity and the diagnosis was established after a negative bone marrow examination for leukemia and a positive result for ALPS on flow cytometry. The second case presented with anemia, thrombocytopenia starting in neonatal period followed by persistent lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent infections which responded poorly to antibiotics. Diagnosis was delayed due to low index of suspicion, and finally achieved with multiple radiological studies, histopathology and flow cytometry.","['Naveed, Muhammad', 'Khamis Butt, Umar Bin', 'Mannan, Jovaria']","['Naveed M', 'Khamis Butt UB', 'Mannan J']","['Department of Pediatrics Medicine, Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore.', 'Department of Pediatrics Medicine, Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore.', 'Department of Pediatrics Medicine, Fatima Memorial Hospital, Lahore.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,,IM,"['*Abnormalities, Multiple', 'Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome/*diagnosis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly/congenital/pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Splenomegaly/congenital/pathology/surgery', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Thrombocytopenia/congenital/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/08 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/06/08 06:00'],"['2012/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['040579197 [pii]', '05.2014/JCPSP.S124S126 [doi]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2014 May;24 Suppl 2:S124-6. doi: 05.2014/JCPSP.S124S126.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intravenous ATO (0.25 mg/kg/day over 1-4 h) was given with intravenous AA (1 g/day over 30 min after ATO) for 5 days a week for 5 weeks (25 doses). Eleven AML patients were enrolled, including six previously untreated elderly patients aged 66-84 years in whom five had antecedent hematological disorder (ADH).

In the present study, an extracellular L-asparaginase with low glutaminase activity, produced by Bacillus licheniformis was purified to homogeneity. Protein was found to be a homotetramer of 134.8 KDa with monomeric size of 33.7 KDa and very specific for its natural substrate i.e. L-asparagine. The activity of purified L-asparaginase enhanced in presence of cations including Na+ and K+, whereas it was moderately inhibited in the presence of divalent cations and thiol group blocking reagents. The purified enzyme was maximally active over the range of pH 6.0 to 10.0 and temperature of 40 degrees C and enzyme was stable maximum at pH 9.0 and -20 degrees C. CD spectra of L-asparaginase predicted the enzyme to consist of 63.05% alpha-helix and 3.29% beta-sheets in its native form with T222 of 58 degrees C. Fluorescent spectroscopy showed the protein to be stable even in the presence of more than 3 M GdHCl. Kinetic parameters Km, Vmax and kcat of purified enzyme were found as 1.4x10(-5) M, 4.03 IU and 2.68x10(3) s(-1), respectively. The purified L-asparaginase had cytotoxic activity against various cancerous cell lines viz. Jurkat clone E6-1, MCF-7 and K-562 with IC50 of 0.22 IU, 0.78 IU and 0.153 IU respectively. However the enzyme had no toxic effect on human erythrocytes and CHO cell lines hence should be considered potential candidate for further pharmaceutical use as an anticancer drug.","['Mahajan, Richi V', 'Kumar, Vinod', 'Rajendran, Vinoth', 'Saran, Saurabh', 'Ghosh, Prahlad C', 'Saxena, Rajendra Kumar']","['Mahajan RV', 'Kumar V', 'Rajendran V', 'Saran S', 'Ghosh PC', 'Saxena RK']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, Delhi, India.', 'Technology Based Incubator, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/chemistry/*isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Bacillus/chemistry/*enzymology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetulus', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Glutaminase/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Substrate Specificity']",2014/06/07 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0099037 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-08493 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 6;9(6):e99037. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0099037. eCollection 2014.,,20140606,,PMC4048267,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We highlight the advantages of utilizing novel 'veto' cells, to facilitate induction of mixed chimerism, under nonmyeloablative conditioning. RECENT FINDINGS: Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used for leukemia patients, where reduction of graft-versus-host disease risk has been routinely attained by depleting grafts of T-cells, and escalated doses of CD34 progenitors (i.e. megadose) to overcome graft rejection. These 'megadose' transplants overcome rejection through a unique immunoregulatory 'veto' capacity. The importance of attaining mixed chimerism for allograft tolerance induction in humans has been highlighted by several studies of combined haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and kidney transplants. However, stable chimerism could only by attained by making use of T-cell replete haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, posing a significant risk for graft-versus-host or other immune abnormalities. The use of nonalloreactive 'veto' cells, such as anti-third-party central memory CD8 T cells, could potentially overcome this barrier. SUMMARY: Achieving stable mixed chimerism after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, key to utilizing transplantation as a prelude for organ tolerance, may be realized by coadministration of 'veto' cells under current nonmyeloablative protocols.","['Or-Geva, Noga', 'Reisner, Yair']","['Or-Geva N', 'Reisner Y']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Organ Transplant,Current opinion in organ transplantation,9717388,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chimerism', 'Graft Rejection/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2014/06/07 06:00,2015/01/21 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOT.0000000000000095 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Organ Transplant. 2014 Aug;19(4):334-41. doi: 10.1097/MOT.0000000000000095.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite many encouraging results obtained in laboratories, both in vitro and in vivo studies, the only really successful clinical application of differentiation therapy was all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-based therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATRA, which induces granulocytic differentiation of APL leukemic blasts, has revolutionized the therapy of this disease by converting it from a fatal to a curable one. However, ATRA does not work for other acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). Since 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) is capable of inducing monocytic differentiation of leukemic cells, the idea of treating other AMLs with vitamin D analogs (VDAs) was widely accepted. Also, some types of solid cancers responded to in vitro applied VDAs, and hence it was postulated that VDAs can be used in many clinical applications. However, early clinical trials in which cancer patients were treated either with 1,25D or with VDAs, did not lead to conclusive results. In order to search for a molecular basis of such unpredictable responses of AML patients toward VDAs, we performed ex vivo experiments using patient's blast cells. Experiments were also performed using 1,25D-responsive and 1,25D-non-responsive cell lines, to study their mechanisms of resistance toward 1,25D-induced differentiation. We found that one of the possible reasons might be due to a very low expression level of vitamin D receptor (VDR) mRNA in resistant cells, which can be increased by exposing the cells to ATRA. Our considerations concerning the molecular mechanism behind the low VDR expression and its regulation by ATRA are reported in this paper.","['Marchwicka, Aleksandra', 'Cebrat, Malgorzata', 'Sampath, Preetha', 'Sniezewski, Lukasz', 'Marcinkowska, Ewa']","['Marchwicka A', 'Cebrat M', 'Sampath P', 'Sniezewski L', 'Marcinkowska E']","['Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Science , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Science , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw , Wroclaw , Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2014/06/07 06:00,2014/06/07 06:01,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00125 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 May 27;4:125. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00125. eCollection 2014.,,20140527,,PMC4034350,['NOTNLM'],"['1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3', 'all-trans-retinoic acid', 'cancer', 'differentiation', 'exon', 'gene', 'leukemia', 'vitamin D receptor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of such signals occurs commonly in many malignancies, thereby giving the cancer cell a survival advantage, but also providing possible targets for therapeutic intervention. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway contributes to the proliferative advantage of malignant cells and may confer resistance to chemotherapy in various hematologic malignancies. The initial mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus (also known as rapamycin), was first discovered in 1975 in the soil of Easter Island. Sirolimus was originally developed as an anti-fungal agent given its macrolide properties, but was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 as an immunosuppressive agent for renal transplantation patients once its T cell suppression characteristics were recognized. Shortly thereafter, recognition of sirolimus's ability to inhibit cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression brought sirolimus to the forefront as a possible inhibitor of mTOR. In the subsequent decade, the functional roles of the mTOR protein have been more fully elucidated, and this protein is now known to be a key regulator in a highly complex signaling pathway that controls cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis. This article discusses the dysregulation of PI3K/mTOR signaling in hematologic malignancies, including acute and chronic leukemias, lymphomas, and lymphoproliferative disorders. The current repertoire of PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors in development and clinical trials to date are described with emphasis upon pediatric hematologic malignancies (Figure 1). Investigation of small molecule inhibitors of this complex signaling network is an active area of oncology drug development.","['Tasian, Sarah K', 'Teachey, David T', 'Rheingold, Susan R']","['Tasian SK', 'Teachey DT', 'Rheingold SR']","[""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia, PA , USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia, PA , USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia, PA , USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2014/06/07 06:00,2014/06/07 06:01,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00108 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 May 16;4:108. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00108. eCollection 2014.,['T32 CA128583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20140516,,PMC4032892,['NOTNLM'],"['Hodgkin lymphoma', 'PI3K/mTOR', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical trial', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'pediatric', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classical anti-leukemic drugs are non-specific cell cycle poisons; some more modern drugs target oncogenic pathways in leukemia cells, although in ALL these do not play a very significant role. By contrast, the molecular interactions between microenvironment and leukemia cells are often neglected in the design of novel therapies against drug resistant leukemia. It was shown however, that chemotherapy resistance is promoted in part through cell-cell contact of leukemia cells with bone marrow (BM) stromal cells, also called cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Incomplete response to chemotherapy results in persistence of resistant clones with or without detectable minimal residual disease (MRD). Approaches for how to address CAM-DR and MRD remain elusive. Specifically, studies using anti-functional antibodies and genetic models have identified integrin alpha4 as a critical molecule regulating BM homing and active retention of normal and leukemic cells. Pre-clinical evidence has been provided that interference with alpha4-mediated adhesion of ALL cells can sensitize them to chemotherapy and thus facilitate eradication of ALL cells in an MRD setting. To this end, Andreeff and colleagues recently provided evidence of stroma-induced and alpha4-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB signaling in leukemia cells, disruption of which depletes leukemia cells of strong survival signals. We here review the available evidence supporting the targeting of alpha4 as a novel strategy for treatment of drug resistant leukemia.","['Shishido, Stephanie', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Kim, Yong-Mi']","['Shishido S', 'Bonig H', 'Kim YM']","[""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine , Los Angeles, CA , USA."", 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wuerttemberg-Hessen, Goethe University , Frankfurt , Germany.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine , Los Angeles, CA , USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2014/06/07 06:00,2014/06/07 06:01,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00099 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 May 23;4:99. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00099. eCollection 2014.,['R01 CA172896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20140523,,PMC4033044,['NOTNLM'],"['CD49d', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adhesion', 'drug resistance', 'integrin alpha4']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum samples from eight healthy individuals were used as normal controls. We identified total 174 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs between tumors and the normal tissues, and 109 miRNAs between serum from patients and serum from healthy individuals. There are only 10 common miRNAs. This suggests that only a small portion of tumor miRNAs are released into serum selectively. Interestingly, the expression change pattern of 28 miRNAs is opposite between breast cancer tumors and serum.

Some monoallelic mutated or PTEN wild-type patients lack PTEN protein, implying that additional PTEN inactivation mechanisms exist. We show that PTEN is inactivated by small deletions affecting a few exons in 8% of pediatric T-ALL patients. These microdeletions were clonal in 3% and subclonal in 5% of patients. Conserved deletion breakpoints are flanked by cryptic recombination signal sequences (cRSSs) and frequently have non-template-derived nucleotides inserted in between breakpoints, pointing to an illegitimate RAG recombination-driven activity. Identified cRSSs drive RAG-dependent recombination in a reporter system as efficiently as bona fide RSSs that flank gene segments of the T-cell receptor locus. Remarkably, equivalent microdeletions were detected in thymocytes of healthy individuals. Microdeletions strongly associate with the TALLMO subtype characterized by TAL1 or LMO2 rearrangements. Primary and secondary xenotransplantation of TAL1-rearranged leukemia allowed development of leukemic subclones with newly acquired PTEN microdeletions. Ongoing RAG activity may therefore actively contribute to the acquisition of preleukemic hits, clonal diversification, and disease progression.","['Mendes, Rui D', 'Sarmento, Leonor M', 'Cante-Barrett, Kirsten', 'Zuurbier, Linda', 'Buijs-Gladdines, Jessica G C A M', 'Povoa, Vanda', 'Smits, Willem K', 'Abecasis, Miguel', 'Yunes, J Andres', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Horstmann, Martin A', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Barata, Joao T', 'Meijerink, Jules P P']","['Mendes RD', 'Sarmento LM', 'Cante-Barrett K', 'Zuurbier L', 'Buijs-Gladdines JG', 'Povoa V', 'Smits WK', 'Abecasis M', 'Yunes JA', 'Sonneveld E', 'Horstmann MA', 'Pieters R', 'Barata JT', 'Meijerink JP']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;"", 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal;', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;"", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;"", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;"", 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal;', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;"", 'Cardiologia Pediatrica Medico Cirurgica, Hospital Sta.

To address this, we report an analysis of all 75 cases of IRM in the United Kingdom Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Randomised Trial 2003 (UKALL 2003). The 5-year cumulative incidence of IRM was 2.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9%-3.0%), accounting for 75 (30%) of 249 trial deaths and 75 (64%) of 117 TRM deaths. Risk for IRM as a proportion of TRM was greater in induction than other phases (77% vs 56%; P = .02). Sixty-eight percent of cases were associated with bacterial infection (64% Gram-negative) and 20% with fungal infection. Down syndrome was the most significant risk factor for IRM (odds ratio [OR], 12.08; 95% CI, 6.54-22.32; P < .0001). In addition, there was a trend toward increased IRM in girls (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.02-2.61; P = .04), as well as increasing treatment intensity (regimen B vs A: OR, 2.11 [95% CI, 1.24-3.60]; regimen C vs A: OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.76-2.62]; P = .02). Importantly, patients with Down syndrome were at significantly higher risk for IRM during maintenance (P = .048). Our results confirm Down syndrome as a major risk factor for IRM. Enhanced supportive care and prophylactic antibiotics should be considered in high-risk patient groups and during periods of increased risk.

Primary nasal and nasopharyngeal lymphomas have been evaluated as distinct pathological entities; however, data on their differing clinical behavior are missing. A total of 164 endoscopic- guided URT pinch biopsies were formalin fixed and routinely processed. Imprint cytological specimens were stained with May Grunwald-Giemsa. Immunohistochemistry for anti-CD20, CD3, FeLVp27, and FeLVgp70 was performed. Prognostic significance of clinicopathological variables was investigated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Lymphoma was diagnosed in 39 cats (24%). Most cats with lymphoma were domestic shorthair (32 [82%]), were male (F/M = 0.56), and had a mean age of 10.3 years (range, 1-16 years). Lymphomas were primary nasal in 26 cats (67%), nasopharyngeal in 6 (15%), and in both locations (combined lymphomas) in 7 cats (18%). Neoplastic growth pattern was diffuse in 35 cases (90%) and nodular in 4 (10%). Epitheliotropism was observed in 10 cases (26%). Tumor cells were large in 15 cases, were small and medium in 11 cases each, and 2 had mixed cell size. Submucosal lymphoplasmacytic inflammation was observed in 23 cases (59%). Cytology was diagnostic for lymphoma in 12 of 25 cases (48%). A B-cell origin prevailed (34 [87%]). Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) p27 or gp70 antigen was detected in 21 lymphomas (54%).

Alterations in epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, miRNA and splicing machinery, are well known pathogenical events in MDS. Although many advances have been made in determining the mutational frequency, distribution and association affecting these epigenomic regulators, functional integration to better understand pathogenesis of the disease is a challenging and expanding area. Recent studies are shedding light on the molecular basis of myelodysplasia and how mutations and epimutations can induce and promote this neoplastic process through aberrant transcription factor function (RUNX1, ETV6, TP53), kinase signalling (FLT3, NRAS, KIT, CBL) and epigenetic deregulation (TET2, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, EZH2, ASXL1, SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2, ZRSR2). In this review we will try to focus on the description of these mutations, their impact on prognosis, the functional connections between the different epigenetic pathways, and the existing and future therapies targeting these processes.","['Bravo, Guillermo Montalban', 'Lee, Elinor', 'Merchan, Bryan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Bravo GM', 'Lee E', 'Merchan B', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Hematology, Universitary Hospital of La Paz, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Animals', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",2014/06/07 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12957 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Sep;166(5):646-59. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12957.

Due to low number of circulating neoplastic cells and 'dry tap' aspiration, the diagnosis is often based on BM trephine biopsy. We have performed a consecutive immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate diagnostic usefulness of various HCL markers (CD11c, CD25, CD68, CD103, CD123, CD200, annexin A1, cyclin D1, DBA.44, HBME-1, phospho-ERK1/2, TRAP, and T-bet) currently available against fixation resistant epitopes. We analyzed tissue microarrays consisting of samples gained from 73 small B-cell lymphoma cases, including hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (n = 32), HCL variant (HCL-v) (n = 4), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) (n = 11), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) (n = 3), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (n = 10), splenic diffuse red pulp small B cell lymphoma (SDRPL) (n = 2), splenic B cell marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) (n = 8), and splenic B cell lymphoma/leukemia, unclassifiable (SBCL) (n = 3) cases. The HCL cases were 100% positive for all but 2 (DBA.44 and CD123) of these markers. Annexin A1 showed 100% specificity and accuracy, which was followed by CD123, pERK, CD103, HBME-1, CD11c, CD25, CD68, cyclin D1, CD200, T-bet, DBA.44, and TRAP, in decreasing order. In conclusion, our results reassured the high specificity of annexin A1 and pERK, as well as the diagnostic value of standard HCL markers of CD11c, CD25, CD103, and CD123 also in paraffin-embedded BM samples. Additional markers, including HBME-1, cyclin D1, CD200, and T-bet also represent valuable tools in the differential diagnosis of HCL and its mimics.","['Toth-Liptak, Judit', 'Piukovics, Klara', 'Borbenyi, Zita', 'Demeter, Judit', 'Bagdi, Eniko', 'Krenacs, Laszlo']","['Toth-Liptak J', 'Piukovics K', 'Borbenyi Z', 'Demeter J', 'Bagdi E', 'Krenacs L']","['Laboratory of Tumor Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Jobb fasor 23/B, 6726, Szeged, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '8002-74-2 (Paraffin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Paraffin/chemistry', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Tissue Array Analysis/methods']",2014/06/07 06:00,2015/09/10 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12253-014-9807-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2015 Jan;21(1):203-11. doi: 10.1007/s12253-014-9807-5.

To elucidate this, CD34(+) stem cell and progenitor cell subpopulations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and their content of residual Philadelphia positive (Ph(+) ) cells was evaluated in 17 CML patients (major molecular response, n = 6; 4-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 expression (MR(4) ), n = 11) using both sensitive qPCR and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH). Despite evaluating fewer cells, iFISH proved superior to mRNA-based qPCR in detecting residual Ph(+) stem cells (P = 0.005), and detected Ph(+) stem- and progenitor cells in 9/10 patients at frequencies of 2-14%. Moreover, while all qPCR(+) samples also were iFISH(+) , 9/33 samples were qPCR-/iFISH(+) , including all positive samples from MR(4) patients. Our findings show that residual Ph(+) cells are low BCR-ABL1 producers, and that DNA-based methods are required to assess the content of persisting Ph(+) stem cells in these patients. This approach demonstrates a clinically applicable manner of assessing residual disease at the stem cell level in CML patients in MR(4) , and may enable early and safe identification of candidates for tyrosine kinase inhibitor withdrawal.","['van Kooten Niekerk, Peter B', 'Petersen, Charlotte C', 'Nyvold, Charlotte G', 'Ommen, Hans B', 'Roug, Anne S', 'Nederby, Line', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil']","['van Kooten Niekerk PB', 'Petersen CC', 'Nyvold CG', 'Ommen HB', 'Roug AS', 'Nederby L', 'Hokland P', 'Kjeldsen E']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2014/06/07 06:00,2014/09/24 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12589 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Jan;164(1):53-60. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12589.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukaemia stem cells', 'cytogenetics', 'fluorescence-activated cell sorting', 'minimal residual disease', 'quantitative polymerase chain reaction']",,['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of the present study are to a) evaluate if physicians act according to a threshold model, b) examine which of the existing threshold models [expected utility theory model (EUT), regret-based threshold model, or dual-processing theory] explains the physicians' decision-making best. METHODS: A survey employing realistic clinical treatment vignettes for patients with pulmonary embolism and acute myeloid leukemia was administered to forty-one practicing physicians across different medical specialties. Participants were randomly assigned to the order of presentation of the case vignettes and re-randomized to the order of ""high"" versus ""low"" threshold case. The main outcome measure was the proportion of physicians who would or would not prescribe treatment in relation to perceived changes in threshold probability. RESULTS: Fewer physicians choose to treat as the benefit/harms ratio decreased (i.e. the threshold increased) and more physicians administered treatment as the benefit/harms ratio increased (and the threshold decreased). When compared to the actual treatment recommendations, we found that the regret model was marginally superior to the EUT model [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 2.23; p = 0.056]. The dual-processing model was statistically significantly superior to both EUT model [OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.67 to 4.08; p < 0.001] and regret model [OR = 2.61, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.77; p = 0.018]. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first empirical evidence that physicians' decision-making can be explained by the threshold model. Of the threshold models tested, the dual-processing theory of decision-making provides the best explanation for the observed empirical results.","['Djulbegovic, Benjamin', 'Elqayam, Shira', 'Reljic, Tea', 'Hozo, Iztok', 'Miladinovic, Branko', 'Tsalatsanis, Athanasios', 'Kumar, Ambuj', 'Beckstead, Jason', 'Taylor, Stephanie', 'Cannon-Bowers, Janice']","['Djulbegovic B', 'Elqayam S', 'Reljic T', 'Hozo I', 'Miladinovic B', 'Tsalatsanis A', 'Kumar A', 'Beckstead J', 'Taylor S', 'Cannon-Bowers J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Evidence-based Medicine and Health Outcomes Research, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA. bdjulbeg@health.usf.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,BMC medical informatics and decision making,101088682,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Decision Making', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Physicians/*standards', 'Psychological Theory', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/standards', 'Threshold Limit Values']",2014/06/07 06:00,2014/10/22 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6947-14-47 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6947-14-47 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2014 Jun 5;14:47. doi: 10.1186/1472-6947-14-47.,,20140605,,PMC4055375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While investigating conditional Survivin deletion in mice, we found that Survivin was highly expressed in phenotypically defined HSCs, and Survivin deletion in mice resulted in significantly reduced total marrow HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Transcriptional analysis of Survivin(-/-) HSCs revealed altered expression of multiple genes not previously linked to Survivin activity. In particular, Survivin deletion significantly reduced expression of the Evi-1 transcription factor indispensable for HSC function, and the downstream Evi-1 target genes Gata2, Pbx1 and Sall2. The loss of HSCs following Survivin deletion and impaired long-term HSC repopulating function could be partially rescued by ectopic Evi-1 expression in Survivin -/- HSCs. These data demonstrate that Survivin partially regulates HSC function by modulating the Evi-1 transcription factor and its downstream targets and identify new genetic pathways in HSCs regulated by Survivin.","['Fukuda, S', 'Hoggatt, J', 'Singh, P', 'Abe, M', 'Speth, J M', 'Hu, P', 'Conway, E M', 'Nucifora, G', 'Yamaguchi, S', 'Pelus, L M']","['Fukuda S', 'Hoggatt J', 'Singh P', 'Abe M', 'Speth JM', 'Hu P', 'Conway EM', 'Nucifora G', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Pelus LM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Japan.', '1] Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA [2] Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Centre for Blood Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Birc5 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sall2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Survivin', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2014/06/07 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014183 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.183 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Feb;29(2):433-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.183.

We developed a novel strategy to enhance CDC using bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) that neutralize the C-regulators CD55 and CD59 to enhance C-mediated functions. Two bsAbs (MB20/55 and MB20/59) were designed to recognize CD20 on one side. The other side neutralizes CD55 or CD59. Analysis of CDC revealed that bsAbs could kill 4-25 times more cells than anti-CD20 recombinant antibody in cell lines or cells isolated from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The pharmacokinetics of the bsAbs was evaluated in a human-SCID model of Burkitt lymphoma. The distribution profile of bsAbs mimics the data obtained by studying the pharmacokinetics of anti-CD20 antibodies, showing a peak in the tumor mass 3-4 days after injection.

Most popular gene set analysis methods are based on empirical P-value that requires large number of permutations. Despite numerous gene set analysis methods developed in the past decade, the most popular methods still suffer from serious limitations. RESULTS: We present a gene set analysis method (mGSZ) based on Gene Set Z-scoring function (GSZ) and asymptotic P-values. Asymptotic P-value calculation requires fewer permutations, and thus speeds up the gene set analysis process. We compare the GSZ-scoring function with seven popular gene set scoring functions and show that GSZ stands out as the best scoring function. In addition, we show improved performance of the GSA method when the max-mean statistics is replaced by the GSZ scoring function. We demonstrate the importance of both gene and sample permutations by showing the consequences in the absence of one or the other. A comparison of asymptotic and empirical methods of P-value estimation demonstrates a clear advantage of asymptotic P-value over empirical P-value. We show that mGSZ outperforms the state-of-the-art methods based on two different evaluations. We compared mGSZ results with permutation and rotation tests and show that rotation does not improve our asymptotic P-values. We also propose well-known asymptotic distribution models for three of the compared methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: mGSZ is available as R package from cran.r-project.org.","['Mishra, Pashupati', 'Toronen, Petri', 'Leino, Yrjo', 'Holm, Liisa']","['Mishra P', 'Toronen P', 'Leino Y', 'Holm L']","['Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland and CSC - IT Center for Science, Ltd., Espoo, Finland.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland and CSC - IT Center for Science, Ltd., Espoo, Finland.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland and CSC - IT Center for Science, Ltd., Espoo, Finland.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland and CSC - IT Center for Science, Ltd., Espoo, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Sex Factors', 'Software', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",2014/06/07 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['btu374 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/btu374 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2014 Oct;30(19):2747-56. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu374.

However, there are no reports showing anti-tumor activity of A. blazei polysaccharides (ABP) on human leukemia (HL)-60 cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated that ABP efficiently inhibited proliferation of cultured HL-60 cells, which was associated with the induction of apoptosis. The increase in ABP-induced apoptosis was accompanied by loss of mitochondria membrane potential (Psim), cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, activation of caspase-3, degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and the elevated ratio of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax)/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Moreover, z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, reversed the cytotoxic effects and apoptotic characteristics induced by ABP in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that ABP could obviously inhibit the solid cancer growth of leukemia HL-60 in tumor xenograft model. These data demonstrated that ABP effectively induced the apoptosis of HL-60 cells via a signaling cascade of mitochondrial caspase-3-dependent pathway.","['Li, Xiaohui', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Wang, Hongmin', 'Han, Junqing', 'Liu, Li']","['Li X', 'Zhao X', 'Wang H', 'Han J', 'Liu L']","['The Center of Tumor Research and Therapy, Shandong Provincial Hospital to Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Agaricus/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fruiting Bodies, Fungal/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice, Nude', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/06/07 06:00,2014/12/30 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2137-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Sep;35(9):8963-8. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2137-0.

The antiproliferative activity was evaluated using the MTT assay. The cell cycle analysis and the inhibition of P-glycoprotein were tested by flow cytometry. All the tested extracts exhibited significant anti-proliferative effects. Ethyl acetate extract has the strongest cytotoxic effect with an IC50 of 18.5 mug/ml. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that cells treated with chloroform, butanol and aqueous extracts were arrested predominantly in G2-M phase. Butanol extract was the most active extract. Percentage of cells arrested in G2-M was 34 %, 36.67 % and 42.63 % respectively, after treatment with 25, 75 and 100 mug/ml of the extract, versus 19 % in the cells treated with the vehicle solvent. In addition, chloroform extract had the ability to inhibit human P-glycoprotein-mediated daunorubicin in K562/R7 leukaemic cells in a dose-dependent manner compared to the positive control, cyclosporin A.

In Saskatchewan, the provincial cancer agency addresses important barriers to adherence by providing imatinib at no cost through specialized cancer centers. OBJECTIVE: To describe adherence to imatinib dispensed through the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic pharmacy dispensation records from the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency. All dispensations for imatinib classified for hematologic malignancies were electronically abstracted by cancer center personnel and securely forwarded to investigators with all meaningful patient identifiers removed. All subjects receiving a new dispensation (i.e. using a 6-month washout period) for imatinib between 1 June 2004 and 31 December 2011 were included. The primary endpoint was optimal adherence to imatinib during the first year of therapy, defined as a medication possession ratio >/= 80%. RESULTS: Ninety-one subjects were started on imatinib during the observation period. During the first year of therapy, 82.4% (75/91) maintained a medication possession ratio >/= 80%. The percentage of individuals maintaining optimal adherence decreased only slightly when the observation period was extended to 2 (78.4%) or 3 years (78.8%).

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is an interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducible enzyme that degrades tryptophan into kynurenine, which, in turn, inhibits effector T cells and promotes regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation. It is presently unknown whether childhood AML cells express IDO1 and whether IDO1 activity correlates with patient outcome. We investigated IDO1 expression and function in 37 children with newly diagnosed AML other than acute promyelocytic leukemia. Blast cells were cultured with exogenous IFN-gamma for 24 hours, followed by the measurement of kynurenine production and tryptophan consumption. No constitutive expression of IDO1 protein was detected in blast cells from the 37 AML samples herein tested. Conversely, 19 out of 37 (51%) AML samples up-regulated functional IDO1 protein in response to IFN-gamma. The inability to express IDO1 by the remaining 18 AML samples was not apparently due to a defective IFN-gamma signaling circuitry, as suggested by the measurement of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated the occurrence of physical interactions between STAT3 and IDO1 in AML blasts. In line with this finding, STAT3 inhibitors abrogated IDO1 function in AML blasts. Interestingly, levels of IFN-gamma were significantly higher in the bone marrow fluid of IDO-expressing compared with IDO-nonexpressing AMLs. In mixed tumor lymphocyte cultures (MTLC), IDO-expressing AML blasts blunted the ability of allogeneic naive T cells to produce IFN-gamma and promoted Treg differentiation. From a clinical perspective, the 8-year event-free survival was significantly worse in IDO-expressing children (16.4%, SE 9.8) as compared with IDO-nonexpressing ones (48.0%, SE 12.1; p=0.035). These data indicate that IDO1 expression by leukemia blasts negatively affects the prognosis of childhood AML. Moreover, they speak in favor of the hypothesis that IDO can be targeted, in adjunct to current chemotherapy approaches, to improve the clinical outcome of children with AML.","['Folgiero, Valentina', 'Goffredo, Bianca M', 'Filippini, Perla', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Bonanno, Giuseppina', 'Caruso, Roberta', 'Bertaina, Valentina', 'Mastronuzzi, Angela', 'Gaspari, Stefania', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Torelli, Giovanni F', 'Testi, Anna M', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Rutella, Sergio']","['Folgiero V', 'Goffredo BM', 'Filippini P', 'Masetti R', 'Bonanno G', 'Caruso R', 'Bertaina V', 'Mastronuzzi A', 'Gaspari S', 'Zecca M', 'Torelli GF', 'Testi AM', 'Pession A', 'Locatelli F', 'Rutella S']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Transfusion Medicine, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IDO1 protein, human)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*metabolism', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/07 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1504 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.1504 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Apr 30;5(8):2052-64. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.1504.,,,,PMC4039144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate whether oridonin, a diterpenoid isolated from the Chinese traditional medicine Rabdosia rubescens, was able to interfere with NPM1c+ protein trafficking and induce apoptosis in NPM1c+ acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. METHODS: OCI-AML3 cell line harboring a NPM1 gene mutation was examined. Cell growth was detected by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining. The expression and subcellular localization of relevant proteins were detected by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining. The mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Oridonin (2-12 mumol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the viability of OCI-AML3 cells (the IC50 value was 3.27+/-0.23 mumol/L at 24 h). Moreover, oridonin induced OCI-AML3 cell apoptosis accompanied by activation of caspase-3 and nuclear translocation of NPM1c+ protein. Oridonin did not change the expression of Crm1 (the export receptor for nuclear export signal-containing proteins), but induced nuclear translocation of Crm1. Oridonin markedly increased the expression of nucleoporin98 (Nup98), which had an important role in Crm1-mediated nuclear protein export, and induced nuclear accumulation of Nup98. Furthermore, oridonin markedly increased the expression of p14arf and p53. CONCLUSION: In NPM1c+ leukemia cells, oridonin induces NPM1c+ protein translocation into the nucleus possibly via nuclear accumulation of Crm1; the compound markedly increases p53 and p14arf expression, which may contribute to cell apoptosis.","['Li, Fei-Fei', 'Yi, Sha', 'Wen, Lu', 'He, Jing', 'Yang, Li-Jing', 'Zhao, Jie', 'Zhang, Ben-Ping', 'Cui, Guo-Hui', 'Chen, Yan']","['Li FF', 'Yi S', 'Wen L', 'He J', 'Yang LJ', 'Zhao J', 'Zhang BP', 'Cui GH', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0APJ98UCLQ (oridonin)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isodon/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Transport/*drug effects']",2014/06/07 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/07 06:00'],"['2013/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['aps201425 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2014.25 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2014 Jun;35(6):806-13. doi: 10.1038/aps.2014.25.,,,,PMC4086383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reasoned that the proliferative inhibition was due to downregulation of c-Myc by DYRK1A, through mediating its degradation. Moreover, overexpression of c-Myc markedly reversed AML cell growth inhibition induced by DYRK1A. DYRK1A also had significantly lower expression in relapsed/refractory AML patients, comparing to newly-diagnosed AML patients, which indicated the role of DYRK1A in chemoresistance of AML.

Stable transfectant RBL cells were then obtained for a cell fluorescence assay with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results show that the cell surface expression of CD63 reflects degranulation, indicating that a fluorescence assay with these cells could efficiently measure the activation of antigen-stimulated transfectant cells and detect antigens with a nanogram level. Therefore, this cell-based fluorescence biosensor technique for detecting fish PV exhibits promise for quantifying fish PV after anti-PV immunoglobulin E (IgE) stimulation. Results show that fluorescence intensities increased with purified PV concentrations from 1 to 100 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.35 ng/mL [relative standard deviation (RSD) of 4.5%], confirmed by beta-hexosaminidase assays.

QT prolongation, torsades de pointes and sudden heart death have been implicated in the cardiotoxicity of As2O3. The present study was designed to explore whether the combination of As2O3 and resveratrol could generate a more powerful anti-cancer effect both in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MTT assay was performed to assess the proliferation of Hela, MCF-7 and NB4 cells. Isobolographic analysis was used to evaluate combination index values from cell viability data. The apoptosis and the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were assessed by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry separately in vitro. The effect of As2O3, alone and in combination with resveratrol on Hela tumor growth in an orthotopic nude mouse model was also investigated. The tumor volume and the immunohistochemical analysis of CD31, CD34 and VEGF were determined. RESULTS: Resveratrol dramatically enhanced the anti-cancer effect induced by As2O3 in vitro. In addition, isobolographic analysis further demonstrated that As2O3 and resveratrol generated a synergistic action. More apoptosis and ROS generation were observed in the combination treatment group. Similar synergistic effects were found in nude mice in vivo. The combination of As2O3 and resveratrol dramatically suppressed both tumor growth and angiogenesis in nude mice.

Here, we investigated the involvement of ET-1/ET(A)R axis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL cells expressed higher levels of ET-1 and ETA receptor as compared to normal B cells. ET-1 peptide stimulated phosphoinositide-3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, improved survival and promoted proliferation of leukemic cells throughout ET(A)R triggering. Moreover, the blockade of ET(A)R by the selective antagonist BQ-123 inhibited the survival advantage acquired by CLL cells in contact with endothelial layers. We also found that blocking ET(A)R via BQ-123 interferes with ERK phosphorylation and CLL pro-survival effect mediated by B-cell receptor (BCR) activation. The pro-apoptotic effect of phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta inhibitor idelalisib and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059 was decreased by the addition of ET-1 peptide. Then, ET-1 also reduced the cytotoxic effect of fludarabine on CLL cells cultured alone or co-cultured on endothelial layers. ET(A)R blockade by BQ-123 inhibited the ET-1-mediated protection against drug-induced apoptosis.

Using a structure-based design approach, we have designed BM-1197 as a potent and efficacious dual inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. BM-1197 binds to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins with Ki values less than 1 nM and shows >1,000-fold selectivity over Mcl-1. Mechanistic studies performed in the Mcl-1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells revealed that BM-1197 potently disassociates the heterodimeric interactions between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, concomitant with conformational changes in Bax protein, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent cytochrome c release to the cytosol, leading to activation of the caspase cascade and apoptosis. BM-1197 exerts potent growth-inhibitory activity in 7 of 12 small cell lung cancer cell lines tested and induces mechanism-based apoptotic cell death. When intravenously administered at daily or weekly in H146 and H1963 small-cell lung cancer xenograft models, it achieves complete and long-term tumor regression. Consistent with its targeting of Bcl-xL, BM-1197 causes transit platelet reduction in mice. Collectively, our data indicate that BM-1197 is a promising dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor which warrants further investigation as a new anticancer drug.","['Bai, Longchuan', 'Chen, Jianfang', 'McEachern, Donna', 'Liu, Liu', 'Zhou, Haibin', 'Aguilar, Angelo', 'Wang, Shaomeng']","['Bai L', 'Chen J', 'McEachern D', 'Liu L', 'Zhou H', 'Aguilar A', 'Wang S']","['University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', 'University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', 'University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', 'University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', 'University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', 'University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', 'University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BM-1197)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2014/06/06 06:00,2015/10/06 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0099404 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-03397 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 5;9(6):e99404. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0099404. eCollection 2014.,"['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA113317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19CA113317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20140605,,PMC4047118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of glabridin on tumor cells metastasis has not been clearly clarified. Here, the molecular mechanism by which glabridin anticancer effects in human promyelocytic leukemia cells was investigated. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results showed that glabridin significantly inhibited cell proliferation of four AML cell lines (HL-60, MV4-11, U937, and THP-1). Furthermore, glabridin induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells through caspases-3, -8, and -9 activations and PARP cleavage in dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, western blot analysis also showed that glabridin increase phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 in dose- and time-dependent manner. Inhibition of p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 by specific inhibitors significantly abolished the glabridin-induced activation of the caspase-3, -8 and -9. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that glabridin induced HL-60 cell apoptosis through p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 pathways and could serve as a potential additional chemotherapeutic agent for treating AML.","['Huang, Hsin-Lien', 'Hsieh, Ming-Ju', 'Chien, Ming-Hsien', 'Chen, Hui-Yu', 'Yang, Shun-Fa', 'Hsiao, Pei-Ching']","['Huang HL', 'Hsieh MJ', 'Chien MH', 'Chen HY', 'Yang SF', 'Hsiao PC']","['Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Cancer Research Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan; School of Optometry, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Phenols)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'HOC5567T41 (glabridin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phenols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2014/06/06 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0098943 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-11913 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 5;9(6):e98943. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0098943. eCollection 2014.,,20140605,,PMC4047044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we sought to understand the determinants of NAE selectivity. A series of compound 1 analogues were synthesized through iterative functionalization of the purine C6 position and evaluated for NAE specificity. Optimal NAE specificity was achieved through substitution with primary N-alkyl groups, while bulky or secondary N-alkyl substituents were poorly tolerated. When assessed in vitro, inhibitors reduced the growth and viability of malignant K562 leukemia cells. Through this study, we have successfully identified a series of sub-10 nM NAE-specific inhibitors and thereby highlighted the functionalities that promote NAE selectivity.","['Lukkarila, Julie L', 'da Silva, Sara R', 'Ali, Mohsin', 'Shahani, Vijay M', 'Xu, G Wei', 'Berman, Judd', 'Roughton, Andrew', 'Dhe-Paganon, Sirano', 'Schimmer, Aaron D', 'Gunning, Patrick T']","['Lukkarila JL', 'da Silva SR', 'Ali M', 'Shahani VM', 'Xu GW', 'Berman J', 'Roughton A', 'Dhe-Paganon S', 'Schimmer AD', 'Gunning PT']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto Mississauga , 3359 Mississauga Road North, Mississauga, ON, L5L1C6, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto Mississauga , 3359 Mississauga Road North, Mississauga, ON, L5L1C6, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Princess Margaret Hospital and the Ontario Cancer Institute , 610 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto Mississauga , 3359 Mississauga Road North, Mississauga, ON, L5L1C6, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Princess Margaret Hospital and the Ontario Cancer Institute , 610 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Dalton Medicinal Chemistry Inc. , 349 Wildcat Road, Toronto, ON, M3J 2S3, Canada.', 'Dalton Medicinal Chemistry Inc. , 349 Wildcat Road, Toronto, ON, M3J 2S3, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto , 100 College Street, Toronto, ON, M5G1L5, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Princess Margaret Hospital and the Ontario Cancer Institute , 610 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto Mississauga , 3359 Mississauga Road North, Mississauga, ON, L5L1C6, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,ACS Med Chem Lett,ACS medicinal chemistry letters,101521073,,,,2011/08/11 00:00,2011/08/11 00:01,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2011/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/11 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/ml2000615 [doi]'],epublish,ACS Med Chem Lett. 2011 May 16;2(8):577-82. doi: 10.1021/ml2000615. eCollection 2011 Aug 11.,,20110516,,PMC4018054,['NOTNLM'],"['NAE inhibitors', 'anticancer drugs', 'leukemia', 'proteasomal inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies demonstrated that manumycin induced the apoptosis of anaplastic thyroid cancer cells and leukemia cells via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. In the current study, we further evaluated the effect of manumycin in two prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and 22Rv1), and here we elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cell viability of prostate cancer cells was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay after treatment with manumycin for 48 hours. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using annexin V and propidium iodide. The expressions of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 family members and the activations of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Manumycin treatment resulted in significant decreases in the viabilities of the two prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner through apoptosis, and this apoptosis involved caspase-9 activation. A specific inhibitor of caspase-9 protected cells from caspase-3 activation, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity induced by manumycin. We also found that manumycin downregulated Bcl-2 expression and upregulated Bax expression. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that manumycin induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells through regulation of the Bcl-2 family involving caspase-9 activation. These results suggest that manumycin may be beneficial for the treatment of prostate cancer.","['Li, Jing-Gao', 'She, Miao-Rong', 'Lu, Ci-Yong', 'Wei, Shan-Shan', 'Xia, Ping-Fang', 'Lu, Ze-Sheng', 'Peng, Qi']","['Li JG', 'She MR', 'Lu CY', 'Wei SS', 'Xia PF', 'Lu ZS', 'Peng Q']","['Department of Nephrology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, China.', ""School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2014/06/06 06:00,2014/06/06 06:01,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S60253 [doi]', 'ott-7-771 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2014 May 22;7:771-7. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S60253. eCollection 2014.,,20140522,,PMC4039403,['NOTNLM'],"['Bax', 'Bcl-2', 'caspase-3', 'caspase-9', 'farnesyltransferase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous work, we synthesized and characterized Fe3O4 MNPs using a simple, rapid, safe, efficient, one-step green method involving reduction of ferric chloride solution using brown seaweed (Sargassum muticum) aqueous extract containing hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino functional groups mainly relevant to polysaccharides, which acts as a potential stabilizer and metal reductant agent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic activity and cellular effects of these Fe3O4 MNPs. Their in vitro anticancer activity was demonstrated in human cell lines for leukemia (Jurkat cells), breast cancer (MCF-7 cells), cervical cancer (HeLa cells), and liver cancer (HepG2 cells). The cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of Fe3O4 MNPs, and an MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay was used to test for cytotoxicity, resulting in an inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) value of 23.83+/-1.1 mug/mL (HepG2), 18.75+/-2.1 mug/mL (MCF-7), 12.5+/-1.7 mug/mL (HeLa), and 6.4+/-2.3 mug/mL (Jurkat) 72 hours after treatment. Therefore, Jurkat cells were selected for further investigation. The representative dot plots from flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis showed that the percentages of cells in early apoptosis and late apoptosis were increased. Cell cycle analysis showed a significant increase in accumulation of Fe3O4 MNP-treated cells at sub-G1 phase, confirming induction of apoptosis by Fe3O4 MNPs. The Fe3O4 MNPs also activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 in a time-response fashion. The nature of the biosynthesis and therapeutic potential of Fe3O4 MNPs could pave the way for further research on the green synthesis of therapeutic agents, particularly in nanomedicine, to assist in the treatment of cancer.","['Namvar, Farideh', 'Rahman, Heshu Sulaiman', 'Mohamad, Rosfarizan', 'Baharara, Javad', 'Mahdavi, Mahnaz', 'Amini, Elaheh', 'Chartrand, Max Stanley', 'Yeap, Swee Keong']","['Namvar F', 'Rahman HS', 'Mohamad R', 'Baharara J', 'Mahdavi M', 'Amini E', 'Chartrand MS', 'Yeap SK']","['Institute of Tropical Forestry and Forest Products, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Research Center for Animal Development Applied Biology, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Department of Microbiology and Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Tropical Forestry and Forest Products, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia ; Department of Bioprocess Technology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Research Center for Animal Development Applied Biology, Mashhad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz Branch, Shiraz.', 'Kharazmi University, Tehran, Iran.', 'DigiCare Behavioral Research, Casa Grande, AZ, USA.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis', 'Biological Products/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/*chemistry', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry', 'Seaweed/*chemistry', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Water/*chemistry']",2014/06/06 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S59661 [doi]', 'ijn-9-2479 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2014 May 19;9:2479-88. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S59661. eCollection 2014.,,20140519,,PMC4038451,['NOTNLM'],"['anticancer effect', 'apoptosis', 'green synthesis', 'seaweed water extract']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the findings of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at the fixation point in a case of bilateral macular coloboma. CASE REPORT: The subject is a 4-year-old boy. He visited our hospital at age 1 year and 4 months for the evaluation of strabismus. The fundus examination of both eyes showed round-shaped sharply-demarcated atrophic lesions involving the macula with large choroidal vessels and bared sclera at the base. Immunologic tests including toxoplasmosis, rubella, varicella, herpes virus, and human T-cell leukemia virus were all negative. At age 4 years and 1 month, cycloplegic refraction showed insignificant refractive errors and his best corrected visual acuity was 0.6 bilaterally. The SD-OCT showed a crater-like depression accompanying atrophic neurosensory retina, and the absence of retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. Examination of the fixation behavior by visuscope showed steady fixation with an area 0.5 degrees nasal to the nasal edge of the atrophic lesion bilaterally. The SD-OCT findings at fixation area showed remaining normal retinal structures involving inner segment-outer segment (IS/OS) junction line. CONCLUSION: The findings of SD-OCT have been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of macular coloboma. In the fixation point, the structure of retina and choroid were well preserved.","['Abe, Kosuke', 'Shirane, Jumi', 'Sakamoto, Masuo', 'Tanabe, Fumi', 'Kuniyoshi, Kazuki', 'Matsumoto, Chota', 'Shimomura, Yoshikazu']","['Abe K', 'Shirane J', 'Sakamoto M', 'Tanabe F', 'Kuniyoshi K', 'Matsumoto C', 'Shimomura Y']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan ; Nara Hospital, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Ikoma, Nara, Japan.', 'Nara Hospital, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Ikoma, Nara, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],New Zealand,Clin Ophthalmol,"Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)",101321512,,,,2014/06/06 06:00,2014/06/06 06:01,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OPTH.S63593 [doi]', 'opth-8-1017 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Ophthalmol. 2014 May 21;8:1017-20. doi: 10.2147/OPTH.S63593. eCollection 2014.,,20140521,,PMC4039399,['NOTNLM'],"['macular structure', 'pediatric macular disease', 'strabismus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a compensatory mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction previously has been associated with B-cell lymphomas, in particular chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, current evidence is limited and based on a relatively small number of cases. Using a nested case-control study, we extended these findings with a focus on subtype-specific analyses. Relative mtDNA copy number was measured in the buffy coat of prospectively collected blood of 469 lymphoma cases and 469 matched controls. The association between mtDNA copy number and the risk of developing lymphoma and histologic subtypes was examined using logistic regression models. We found no overall association between mtDNA and risk of lymphoma. Subtype analyses revealed significant increased risks of CLL (n = 102) with increasing mtDNA copy number (odds ratio = 1.34, 1.44, and 1.80 for quartiles 2-4, respectively; P trend = .001). mtDNA copy number was not associated with follow-up time, suggesting that this observation is not strongly influenced by indolent disease status. This study substantially strengthens the evidence that mtDNA copy number is related to risk of CLL and supports the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction as a possible mechanistic pathway in CLL ontogenesis.","['Hosnijeh, Fatemeh Saberi', 'Lan, Qing', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'San Liu, Chin', 'Cheng, Wen-Ling', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Guldberg, Per', 'Tjonneland, Anne', 'Campa, Daniele', 'Martino, Alessandro', 'Boeing, Heiner', 'Trichopoulou, Antonia', 'Lagiou, Pagona', 'Trichopoulos, Dimitrios', 'Krogh, Vittorio', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Panico, Salvatore', 'Masala, Giovanna', 'Weiderpass, Elisabete', 'Huerta Castano, Jose Maria', 'Ardanaz, Eva', 'Sala, Nuria', 'Dorronsoro, Miren', 'Quiros, J Ramon', 'Sanchez, Maria-Jose', 'Melin, Beatrice', 'Johansson, Ann Sofie', 'Malm, Johan', 'Borgquist, Signe', 'Peeters, Petra H', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita, H Bas', 'Wareham, Nick', 'Khaw, Kay-Tee', 'Travis, Ruth C', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Siddiq, Afshan', 'Riboli, Elio', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Vermeulen, Roel']","['Hosnijeh FS', 'Lan Q', 'Rothman N', 'San Liu C', 'Cheng WL', 'Nieters A', 'Guldberg P', 'Tjonneland A', 'Campa D', 'Martino A', 'Boeing H', 'Trichopoulou A', 'Lagiou P', 'Trichopoulos D', 'Krogh V', 'Tumino R', 'Panico S', 'Masala G', 'Weiderpass E', 'Huerta Castano JM', 'Ardanaz E', 'Sala N', 'Dorronsoro M', 'Quiros JR', 'Sanchez MJ', 'Melin B', 'Johansson AS', 'Malm J', 'Borgquist S', 'Peeters PH', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita HB', 'Wareham N', 'Khaw KT', 'Travis RC', 'Brennan P', 'Siddiq A', 'Riboli E', 'Vineis P', 'Vermeulen R']","['Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Division Environmental Epidemiology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran;', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD;', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD;', 'Department of Neurology and Vascular and Genomic Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Integrated Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan;', 'Laboratory of Mitochondrial Medicine, Chunghua Christian Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan;', 'Centre of Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Centre Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany;', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Genomic Epidemiology Group, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Genomic Epidemiology Group, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Epidemiology, German Institute of Human Nutrition, Potsdam-Rehbrucke, Nuthetal, Germany;', 'Hellenic Health Foundation, Athens, Greece; WHO Collaborating Center for Food and Nutrition Policies, Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece;', 'WHO Collaborating Center for Food and Nutrition Policies, Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA; Bureau of Epidemiologic Research, Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece;', 'Hellenic Health Foundation, Athens, Greece; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA; Bureau of Epidemiologic Research, Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece;', 'Epidemiology and Prevention Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy;', 'Cancer Registry and Histopathology Unit, ""Civic - M.P.

Recently, we showed that several angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptls) bind and activate the immune inhibitory receptor human leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) to support ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and leukemia development. However, the molecular basis for the interaction between Angptls and LILRB2 was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Angptl2 expressed in mammalian cells forms high-molecular-weight species and that ligand multimerization is required for activation of LILRB2 for downstream signaling. A novel motif in the first and fourth Ig domains of LILRB2 was identified that is necessary for the receptor to be bound and activated by Angptl2. The binding of Angptl2 to LILRB2 is more potent than and not completely overlapped with the binding of another ligand, HLA-G. Immobilized anti-LILRB2 antibodies induce a more potent activation of LILRB2 than Angptl2, and we developed a serum-free culture containing defined cytokines and immobilized anti-LILRB2 that supports a net expansion of repopulating human cord blood HSCs.

Here, we demonstrate its improved performance over other response parameters especially in a leukemia patient case study, where differential DSS between patient and control cells enabled identification of both cancer-selective drugs and drug-sensitive patient sub-groups, as well as dynamic monitoring of the response patterns and oncogenic driver signals during cancer progression and relapse in individual patient cells ex vivo. An open-source and easily extendable implementation of the DSS calculation is made freely available to support its tailored application to translating drug sensitivity testing results into clinically actionable treatment options.","['Yadav, Bhagwan', 'Pemovska, Tea', 'Szwajda, Agnieszka', 'Kulesskiy, Evgeny', 'Kontro, Mika', 'Karjalainen, Riikka', 'Majumder, Muntasir Mamun', 'Malani, Disha', 'Murumagi, Astrid', 'Knowles, Jonathan', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Heckman, Caroline', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Wennerberg, Krister', 'Aittokallio, Tero']","['Yadav B', 'Pemovska T', 'Szwajda A', 'Kulesskiy E', 'Kontro M', 'Karjalainen R', 'Majumder MM', 'Malani D', 'Murumagi A', 'Knowles J', 'Porkka K', 'Heckman C', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Wennerberg K', 'Aittokallio T']","['Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit, Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit, Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', '*Precision Medicine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/06/06 06:00,2015/11/13 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['srep05193 [pii]', '10.1038/srep05193 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2014 Jun 5;4:5193. doi: 10.1038/srep05193.,,20140605,,PMC4046135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the influence of UGT1A1 polymorphisms and nilotinib plasma trough concentrations (C0) on nilotinib-induced hyperbilirubinemia in 34 Japanese patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The proportion of patients with hyperbilirubinemia was significantly higher among patients with the UGT1A1*6/*6 and *6/*28 genotypes (poor metabolizers) than among those with other genotypes (p = 0.004). The median time to elevation of bilirubin levels in UGT1A1 poor metabolizers was 2.0 weeks (hazard ratio, 6.11). The median time to reduction in nilotinib dose in UGT1A1 poor metabolizers was 4.0 weeks (hazard ratio, 7.52; p = 0.002). Consequently, in the maintenance phase 3 months following the initiation of nilotinib therapy, the median daily dose and C0 of nilotinib were 350 mg/day and 372 ng/mL, respectively, in UGT1A1 poor metabolizers, and 600 mg/day and 804 ng/mL, respectively, in the other patients. Patients at increased hyperbilirubinemia risk could be identified by prospective UGT1A1 genotyping prior to nilotinib therapy. To avoid an interruption of CML treatment due to nilotinib-induced hyperbilirubinemia, it may be beneficial to reduce the initial nilotinib dose to 300-400 mg/day for UGT1A1 poor metabolizers.","['Abumiya, Maiko', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Niioka, Takenori', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Fujishima, Naohito', 'Tagawa, Hiroyuki', 'Sawada, Kenichi', 'Miura, Masatomo']","['Abumiya M', 'Takahashi N', 'Niioka T', 'Kameoka Y', 'Fujishima N', 'Tagawa H', 'Sawada K', 'Miura M']","['Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,101164773,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (UGT1A1 enzyme)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia/blood/*chemically induced/*enzymology/ethnology', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",2014/06/06 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2133/dmpk.DMPK-14-RG-031 [doi]', 'DN/JST.JSTAGE/dmpk/DMPK-14-RG-031 [pii]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 2014;29(6):449-54. doi: 10.2133/dmpk.DMPK-14-RG-031.

We sought to describe outcomes in cancer patients with ARDS meeting the Berlin definition. METHODS: Data from a cohort of patients admitted to 14 ICUs between 1990 and 2011 were used for a multivariable analysis of risk factors for hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 1,004 included patients (86 % with hematological malignancies and 14 % with solid tumors), 444 (44.2 %) had neutropenia. Admission SOFA score was 12 (10-13). Etiological categories were primary infection-related ARDS (n = 662, 65.9 %; 385 bacterial infections, 213 invasive aspergillosis, 64 Pneumocystis pneumonia); extrapulmonary septic shock-related ARDS (n = 225, 22.4 %; 33 % candidemia); noninfectious ARDS (n = 76, 7.6 %); and undetermined cause (n = 41, 4.1 %). Of 387 (38.6 %) patients given noninvasive ventilation (NIV), 276 (71 %) subsequently required endotracheal ventilation. Hospital mortality was 64 % overall. According to the Berlin definition, 252 (25.1 %) patients had mild, 426 (42.4 %) moderate and 326 (32.5 %) severe ARDS; mortality was 59, 63 and 68.5 %, respectively (p = 0.06). Mortality dropped from 89 % in 1990-1995 to 52 % in 2006-2011 (p < 0.0001). Solid tumors, primary ARDS, and later admission period were associated with lower mortality. Risk factors for higher mortality were allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation, modified SOFA, NIV failure, severe ARDS, and invasive fungal infection. CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients, 90 % of ARDS cases are infection-related, including one-third due to invasive fungal infections. Mortality has decreased over time. NIV failure is associated with increased mortality. The high mortality associated with invasive fungal infections warrants specific studies of early treatment strategies.","['Azoulay, Elie', 'Lemiale, Virginie', 'Mokart, Djamel', 'Pene, Frederic', 'Kouatchet, Achille', 'Perez, Pierre', 'Vincent, Francois', 'Mayaux, Julien', 'Benoit, Dominique', 'Bruneel, Fabrice', 'Meert, Anne-Pascale', 'Nyunga, Martine', 'Rabbat, Antoine', 'Darmon, Michael']","['Azoulay E', 'Lemiale V', 'Mokart D', 'Pene F', 'Kouatchet A', 'Perez P', 'Vincent F', 'Mayaux J', 'Benoit D', 'Bruneel F', 'Meert AP', 'Nyunga M', 'Rabbat A', 'Darmon M']","['Intensive Care Unit of the Saint-Louis University Hospital, Paris, France, elieazoulay.icm@sls.aphp.fr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Intensive Care Med,Intensive care medicine,7704851,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lung Diseases/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*etiology/mortality', 'Risk Factors']",2014/06/06 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00134-014-3354-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Intensive Care Med. 2014 Aug;40(8):1106-14. doi: 10.1007/s00134-014-3354-0.

The total coding region of TET2 was analyzed by direct sequencing in 215 CN-AML patients younger than 60 years from multicenter treatment trials AML-SHG 0199 (ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT00209833) and 0295. Associations were analyzed in the context of other molecular markers, such as CEBPA, DNMT3A, NMP1, FLT3, IDH1/2, RAS, and WT1. To investigate the order of appearance of TET2 and concomitant mutations, targeted deep resequencing was performed in six patients. At least one sequence variation with impact on TET2 protein sequence was found in 13 of the 215 CN-AML patients (6%). Patients with TET2 mutations tended to be older (P = 0.078) and had higher platelet counts (P = 0.041). TET2-mutated patients were more likely to have concomitant NPM1 (11 of 13; P = 0.047) and DNMT3A (10 of 13; P = 0.001) mutations but were mutually exclusive to partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene (MLL-PTD) and IDH1/2 mutations. TET2 mutations were identified as subclones in four of the six investigated patients by deep sequencing. Progenitor-derived colony assays suggest a stepwise acquisition of mutations during disease development, TET2 mutation being later than NPM1 and DNMT3A. The TET2 mutation status did not influence overall or relapse-free survival.","['Damm, Frederik', 'Markus, Birgit', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Morgan, Michael', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Ganser, Arnold']","['Damm F', 'Markus B', 'Thol F', 'Morgan M', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Krauter J', 'Heuser M', 'Bernard OA', 'Ganser A']","['INSERM U985, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Clonal Evolution', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/06 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22191 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Oct;53(10):824-32. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22191.

J Biol Chem 279: 13825-13832, 2004). This dominantly negative TnI-TnT interface mutation decreases the binding affinity of cTnI for TnT, impairs diastolic function, and blunts the beta-adrenergic response of cardiac muscle (Wei et al. J Biol Chem 285: 27806-27816, 2010). Here we further investigate cellular phenotypes of transgenic mouse cardiomyocytes expressing the equivalent mutation cTnI-K118C. Functional studies were performed on single adult cardiomyocytes after recovery in short-term culture from isolation stress. The amplitude of contraction and the velocities of shortening and relengthening were lower in cTnI-K118C cardiomyocytes than wild-type controls. The intracellular Ca(2+) transient was slower in cTnI-K118C cardiomyocytes than wild-type cells. cTnI-K118C cardiomyocytes also showed a weaker beta-adrenergic response. The resting length of cTnI-K118C cardiomyocytes was significantly greater than that of age-matched wild-type cells, with no difference in cell width. The resting sarcomere was not longer, but slightly shorter, in cTnI-K118C cardiomyocytes than wild-type cells, indicating longitudinal addition of sarcomeres. More tri- and quadrinuclei cardiomyocytes were found in TnI-K118C than wild-type hearts, suggesting increased nuclear divisions.

Identification of the microorganism changes antibiotic therapy in more than half of cases; however, in only 20-30 % of such cases pathogen isolation is achieved. This study evaluates the frequency of fungus infection and its etiology in onco-hematological patients with febrile neutropenia utilizing blood cultures and non-commercial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MT-PCR) primers. Fifty-three febrile neutropenia episodes in 35 onco-hematological patients were observed, and the results for the first unique 30 episodes are presented. Blood cultures were positive for Candida tropicalis (one case), gram-positive bacteria (two cases), and gram-negative bacteria (four cases), showing a 23.3 % microbiological isolation rate. Multiplex-PCR pan-fungal sequence was positive in 18 cases (60 %), and further sequencing identified fugal pathogens in 11 cases (Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis being the most common). MT-PCR pan-fungal sequence amplification was detected in 13 of 16 patients that later received antifungal treatment for clinical reasons only, while positivity was found in 5 out of 14 patients that did not receive antifungal treatment (p = 0.02). These results show that performing in-house non-commercial MT-PCR is feasible and may provide additional information about fungal infection without the need to wait for culture results. Further research is necessary to incorporate this technology into the decision-making process.","['Teixeira, H', 'Magalhaes, J J F', 'Matias, C', 'Lyra, J M A', 'Magalhaes, V', 'Lucena-Silva, N', 'Melo, H R L', 'Juca, M B', 'Brito, C A A']","['Teixeira H', 'Magalhaes JJ', 'Matias C', 'Lyra JM', 'Magalhaes V', 'Lucena-Silva N', 'Melo HR', 'Juca MB', 'Brito CA']","['Tropical Medicine Department, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil, contato@conscient.med.br.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', 'Candida/*pathogenicity', 'Candidiasis/*diagnosis', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards']",2014/06/06 06:00,2015/06/09 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-014-2305-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2014 Oct;22(10):2861-6. doi: 10.1007/s00520-014-2305-1.

Previously, we reported increased SET protein levels in canine lymphoma cell lines and the potential therapeutic application of SET antagonists in canine lymphoma. Here, we found that canine cells express several isoforms of the SET protein. We cloned 4 isoforms of SET, named SETalpha, beta, gamma and delta. Genomic BLAST showed that the SET genes are located on chromosomes X, 7, 1 and 8, respectively. An immunofluorescent study showed nuclear localization of SETalpha and beta, and nuclear and cytosolic localization of SETgamma and delta. We confirmed that SETalpha and beta possess the ability to associate with PP2A. Our data reveal the existence of unique SET isoforms that should be taken into account in SET-targeting drug development studies in dogs.","['Yabe, Ryotaro', 'Fujiwara, Nobuyuki', 'Mizuno, Takuya', 'Usui, Tatsuya', 'Ohama, Takashi', 'Sato, Koichi']","['Yabe R', 'Fujiwara N', 'Mizuno T', 'Usui T', 'Ohama T', 'Sato K']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmacology, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi 753-8515, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dog Diseases/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism/*veterinary', 'Microscopy, Confocal/veterinary', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transfection/veterinary']",2014/06/06 06:00,2015/06/02 06:00,['2014/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jvms/14-0209 [pii]', '10.1292/jvms.14-0209 [doi]']",ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2014 Sep;76(9):1235-40. doi: 10.1292/jvms.14-0209.

Here we explored in 121 patients, mostly with advanced stage diseases, a sirolimus-based, calcineurin-inhibitor-free prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) to allow the infusion of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts from partially HLA-matched family donors (TrRaMM study, Eudract 2007-5477-54). Conditioning regimen was based on treosulfan and fludarabine, and GvHD prophylaxis on antithymocyte globulin Fresenius (ATG-F), rituximab and oral administration of sirolimus and mycophenolate. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred in median at 17 and 19 days after HSCT, respectively, and full donor chimerism was documented in patients' bone marrow since the first post-transplant evaluation. T-cell immune reconstitution was rapid, and high frequencies of circulating functional T-regulatory cells (Treg) were documented during sirolimus prophylaxis. Incidence of acute GvHD grade II-IV was 35%, and occurrence and severity correlated negatively with Treg frequency. Chronic GvHD incidence was 47%. At 3 years after HSCT, transpant-related mortality was 31%, relapse incidence 48% and overall survival 25%. In conclusion, GvHD prophylaxis with sirolimus-mycophenolate-ATG-F-rituximab promotes a rapid immune reconstitution skewed toward Tregs, allowing the infusion of unmanipulated haploidentical PBSC grafts.","['Peccatori, J', 'Forcina, A', 'Clerici, D', 'Crocchiolo, R', 'Vago, L', 'Stanghellini, M T L', 'Noviello, M', 'Messina, C', 'Crotta, A', 'Assanelli, A', 'Marktel, S', 'Olek, S', 'Mastaglio,

In RE leukemias, activated forms of the c-KIT tyrosine kinase receptor are frequently found, thereby suggesting oncogenic cooperativity between these oncoproteins in the development and maintenance of t(8;21) malignancies. In this report, we show that activated c-KIT cooperates with a C-terminal truncated variant of RE, REtr, to expand human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors ex vivo. CD34+ cells expressing both oncogenes resemble the AML-M2 myeloblastic cell phenotype, in contrast to REtr-expressing cells which largely undergo granulocytic differentiation. Oncogenic c-KIT amplifies REtr-depended clonogenic growth and protects cells from exhaustion. Activated c-KIT reverts REtr-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. In the presence of activated c-KIT, REtr-downregulated DNA-repair genes are re-expressed leading to an enhancement of DNA-repair efficiency via homologous recombination. Together, our results provide new mechanistic insight into REtr and c-KIT oncogenic cooperativity and suggest that augmented DNA repair accounts for the increased chemoresistance observed in t(8;21)-positive AML patients with activated c-KIT mutations.

To date, this has mainly focused on ALL with MLL or ETV6-RUNX1 fusions, with hyperdiploid ALL remaining less well characterised. We examined three pairs of monozygotic twins, two concordant and one discordant for hyperdiploid ALL, for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-defined copy number alterations (CNAs), IGH/L plus TCR gene rearrangements and mutations in NRAS, KRAS, FLT3 and PTPN11 genes. We performed whole exome sequencing in one concordant twin pair. Potential 'driver' CNAs were low, 0-3 per case, and all were different within a pair. One patient had an NRAS mutation that was lacking from leukaemic cells of the twin sibling. By exome sequencing, there were 12 nonsynonymous mutations found in one twin and 5 in the other, one of which in SCL44A2 was shared or identical. Concordant pairs had some identical IGH/L and TCR rearrangements. In the twin pair with discordant hyperdiploid ALL, the healthy co-twin had persistent low level hyperdiploid CD19+ cells that lacked a CNA present in the ALL cells of her sibling. From these data, we propose that hyperdiploid ALL arises in a pre-B cell in utero and mutational changes necessary for clinical ALL accumulate subclonally and postnatally.","['Bateman, C M', 'Alpar, D', 'Ford, A M', 'Colman, S M', 'Wren, D', 'Morgan, M', 'Kearney, L', 'Greaves, M']","['Bateman CM', 'Alpar D', 'Ford AM', 'Colman SM', 'Wren D', 'Morgan M', 'Kearney L', 'Greaves M']","['Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.', 'Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['DNA Primers', '*Diploidy', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Exome', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Twins, Monozygotic']",2014/06/05 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014177 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.177 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):58-65. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.177.

The vast majority of MBL cases express the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; CLL-like MBL), although non-CLL MBL also exists. CLL-like MBL, which is the focus of this review, is divided into low-count MBL (median B-cell count: 0.001 x 109/L, typically identified in population-based screening studies using highly sensitive flow cytometry assays) and high-count MBL (clinical MBL, median B-cell count: 2.9 x 109/L, typically identified during the workup of low-level lymphocytosis). Low-count MBL has an exceedingly small risk of progression to CLL, and these patients do not require any specific follow-up. In contrast, patients with high-count MBL have a 1% to 2% per year risk of progression to CLL requiring therapy, as well as a higher risk of infectious complications and secondary malignancies. Although the overall survival of high-count MBL patients collectively is similar to the age- and sex-matched general population, 5-year survival for high-count MBL with higher-risk biologic parameters appears to be slightly lower than that of the general population. This review summarizes key concepts in the classification, diagnosis, and biology of CLL-like MBL and addresses several important issues in clinical management.","['Parikh, Sameer A', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Parikh SA', 'Kay NE', 'Shanafelt TD']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytosis/*diagnosis/epidemiology']",2014/06/05 06:00,2015/01/24 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2013 Nov;11(11):720-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of icaritin on Burkitt Lymphoma has not been elucidated. In the present study, we first screened the potential effect of icaritin on Burkitt lymphoma Raji and P3HR-1 cell lines and found that icaritin showed cytotoxicity in both cell lines. We further found that icaritin could significantly inhibit Raji cells proliferation with S-phase arrest of cell cycle and induced cell apoptosis accompanied by activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 and cleavage of PARP. We also observed that icaritin was able to decrease Bcl-2 levels, thus shifting the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and it could obviously reduce c-Myc, a specific molecular target in Burkitt lymphoma. Our findings demonstrated that icaritin showed cytotoxicity, inhibited cell growth, caused S arrest, and induced apoptosis in Burkitt lymphoma cells and provided a rationale for the further evaluation of icaritin for Burkitt lymphoma therapy.","['Li, Zi-Jian', 'Yao, Can', 'Liu, Su-Fang', 'Chen, Long', 'Xi, Ya-Ming', 'Zhang, Wen', 'Zhang, Guang-Sen']","['Li ZJ', 'Yao C', 'Liu SF', 'Chen L', 'Xi YM', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang GS']","['Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, China.', 'Division of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, China.', 'Division of Hematology, The Second Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, China.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, China.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, China.', 'Division of Hematology, The Second Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', 'UFE666UELY (icaritin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxins/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/05 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/391512 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:391512. doi: 10.1155/2014/391512.

The most common activating oncogene in human malignancy, RAS (rat sarcoma), has proved to be an elusive target. Activating mutations in RAS induce mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT pathway signaling and drive malignant progression in up to 30% of cancers. Oncogenic NRAS mutations occur in several cancer types, notably melanoma, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and less commonly, colon adenocarcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and other hematologic malignancies. Although NRAS-mutant tumors have been recalcitrant to targeted therapeutic strategies historically, newer agents targeting MAP/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1)/2 have recently shown signs of clinical efficacy as monotherapy. Combination strategies of MEK inhibitors with other targeted agents have strong preclinical support and are being evaluated in clinical trials. This review discusses the recent preclinical and clinical studies about the role of NRAS in cancer, with a focus on melanoma and AML.","['Johnson, Douglas B', 'Smalley, Keiran S M', 'Sosman, Jeffrey A']","['Johnson DB', 'Smalley KS', 'Sosman JA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee; and douglas.b.johnson@vanderbilt.edu.', 'Departments of Molecular Oncology and Cutaneous Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2014/06/05 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-3270 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3270 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Aug 15;20(16):4186-92. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3270.

However, it is not well understood why only some patients respond to hypomethylating agents. We found previously that the effect of decitabine on hematopoietic stem cell viability differed between Mll5 wild-type and null cells. We, therefore, investigated the role of MLL5 expression levels on outcome of acute myeloid leukemia patients who were treated with decitabine. MLL5 above the median expression level predicted longer overall survival independent of DNMT3A mutation status in bivariate analysis (median overall survival for high vs. low MLL5 expression 292 vs. 167 days; P=0.026). In patients who received three or more courses decitabine, high MLL5 expression and wild-type DNMT3A independently predicted improved overall survival (median overall survival for high vs. low MLL5 expression 468 vs. 243 days; P=0.012). In transformed murine cells, loss of Mll5 was associated with resistance to low-dose decitabine, less global DNA methylation in promoter regions, and reduced DNA demethylation upon decitabine treatment. Together, these data support our clinical observation of improved outcome in decitabine-treated patients who express MLL5 at high levels, and suggest a mechanistic role of MLL5 in the regulation of DNA methylation.","['Yun, Haiyang', 'Damm, Frederik', 'Yap, Damian', 'Schwarzer, Adrian', 'Chaturvedi, Anuhar', 'Jyotsana, Nidhi', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Geffers, Robert', 'Aparicio, Samuel', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Heuser, Michael']","['Yun H', 'Damm F', 'Yap D', 'Schwarzer A', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Jyotsana N', 'Lubbert M', 'Bullinger L', 'Dohner K', 'Geffers R', 'Aparicio S', 'Humphries RK', 'Ganser A', 'Heuser M']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany heuser.michael@mh-hannover.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (KMT2E protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",2014/06/05 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.101386 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.101386 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Sep;99(9):1456-64. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.101386.

Inactivation of the PHF6 gene is frequently observed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, suggesting an important tumor suppressive role for PHF6 in the pathobiology of this leukemia. Although the precise function of PHF6 is still unknown, this gene is most likely involved in chromatin regulation, a strongly emerging theme in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this context, our previous description of a cooperative microRNA regulatory network controlling several well-known T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumor suppressor genes, including PHF6, is of great importance. Given the high frequency of PHF6 lesions in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the integration of PHF6 in this microRNA regulatory network, we aimed to identify novel oncogenic microRNAs in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia which suppress PHF6. To this end, we performed an unbiased PHF6 3'UTR-microRNA library screen and combined the results with microRNA profiling data of samples from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and normal thymocyte subsets. We selected miR-128-3p as a candidate PHF6-targeting, oncogenic microRNA and demonstrated regulation of PHF6 expression upon modulation of this microRNA in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. In vivo evidence of an oncogenic role of this microRNA in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was obtained through accelerated leukemia onset in a NOTCH1-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia mouse model upon miR-128-3p over-expression. We conclude that miR-128-3p is a strong novel candidate oncogenic microRNA in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia which targets the PHF6 tumor suppressor gene.","['Mets, Evelien', 'Van Peer, Gert', 'Van der Meulen, Joni', 'Boice, Michael', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Goossens, Steven', 'Mestdagh, Pieter', 'Benoit, Yves', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Van Roy, Nadine', 'Poppe, Bruce', 'Vandesompele, Jo', 'Wendel, Hans-Guido', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Rondou, Pieter']","['Mets E', 'Van Peer G', 'Van der Meulen J', 'Boice M', 'Taghon T', 'Goossens S', 'Mestdagh P', 'Benoit Y', 'De Moerloose B', 'Van Roy N', 'Poppe B', 'Vandesompele J', 'Wendel HG', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Speleman F', 'Rondou P']","['Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University Hospital, Belgium.', 'Unit for Molecular Oncology, Inflammation Research Center, VIB, Ghent, Belgium Department for Molecular Biomedical Research, Ghent University, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium franki.speleman@ugent.be Pieter.Rondou@ugent.be.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Belgium franki.speleman@ugent.be Pieter.Rondou@ugent.be.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (MIRN128 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (PHF6 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins']",2014/06/05 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.099515 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.099515 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Aug;99(8):1326-33. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.099515.

In essential thrombocythemia, 154 (53%) Janus kinase 2 V617F, 96 (33%) calreticulin, 9 (3%) myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene gene mutation-positive and 30 triple-negative (11%) cases were identified, while in primary myelofibrosis 56 (57%) Janus kinase 2 V617F, 25 (25%) calreticulin, 7 (7%) myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene gene mutation-positive and 11 (11%) triple-negative cases were identified. Patients positive for the calreticulin mutation were younger and had higher platelet counts compared to Janus kinase 2 mutation-positive counterparts. Calreticulin mutation-positive patients with essential thrombocythemia showed a lower risk of developing venous thrombosis, but no difference in overall survival. Calreticulin mutation-positive patients with primary myelofibrosis had a better overall survival compared to that of the Janus kinase 2 mutation-positive (P=0.04) or triple-negative cases (P=0.01).

In essential thrombocythemia, the calreticulin mutational load was higher than the Janus kinase 2 mutational load (P<0.001), and increased gradually in advanced stages. Calreticulin mutational load influenced blood counts even at the time point of diagnosis in essential thrombocythemia.

Despite promising results obtained from the clinical trials, the use of ABT-263 in patients is dose-limited due to causing thrombocytopenia via inhibition of Bcl-x(L) in platelets. ABT-199 specifically inhibits Bcl-2; however, its use is limited to tumors over-expressing only Bcl-2. Besides, many tumors resist treatment due to high levels of Mcl-1 expression or develop resistance via up-regulation of Mcl-1 during long-term exposure. These obstacles highlight the demand to improve the ABT-263-based therapy. In this study, we show that anti-cancer flavones, e.g., wogonin, baicalein, apigenin, chrysin and luteolin enhance ABT-263-induced apoptosis in different cancer cell lines and in primary AML and ALL cells by down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression. Importantly, wogonin does not enhance the toxicity of ABT-263 to proliferating normal T cells and thrombocytes. Wogonin also potentiates the lethality of ABT-263 in cancer cells which have acquired resistance to ABT-263. Furthermore, we show that combination of wogonin with ABT-263 promotes in vivo tumor regression in a human T-cell leukemia xenograft mouse model. Our study demonstrates that wogonin (and related flavones) reduce the effective dose of ABT-263 thereby possibly decreasing the risk of adverse side effects.","['Polier, Gernot', 'Giaisi, Marco', 'Kohler, Rebecca', 'Muller, Wolfgang W', 'Lutz, Christoph', 'Buss, Eike C', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Li-Weber, Min']","['Polier G', 'Giaisi M', 'Kohler R', 'Muller WW', 'Lutz C', 'Buss EC', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumorimmunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'POK93PO28W (wogonin)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Flavones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/06/05 06:00,2015/01/24 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29009 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Feb 1;136(3):688-98. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29009.

Accordingly, there is substantial interest in understanding factors that affect sensitivity to these agents. In the present study we observed that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors olaparib and veliparib sensitize the myeloid leukemia cell lines ML-1 and K562, the ovarian cancer line PEO1, non-small cell lung cancer line A549, and a majority of clinical AML isolates, but not normal marrow, to TRAIL. Further analysis demonstrated that PARP inhibitor treatment results in activation of the FAS and TNFRSF10B (death receptor 5 (DR5)) promoters, increased Fas and DR5 mRNA, and elevated cell surface expression of these receptors in sensitized cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated enhanced binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the TNFRSF10B promoter in the presence of PARP inhibitor. Knockdown of PARP1 or PARP2 (but not PARP3 and PARP4) not only increased expression of Fas and DR5 at the mRNA and protein level, but also recapitulated the sensitizing effects of the PARP inhibition. Conversely, Sp1 knockdown diminished the PARP inhibitor effects. In view of the fact that TRAIL is part of the armamentarium of natural killer cells, these observations identify a new facet of PARP inhibitor action while simultaneously providing the mechanistic underpinnings of a novel therapeutic combination that warrants further investigation.","['Meng, X Wei', 'Koh, Brian D', 'Zhang, Jin-San', 'Flatten, Karen S', 'Schneider, Paula A', 'Billadeau, Daniel D', 'Hess, Allan D', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Meng XW', 'Koh BD', 'Zhang JS', 'Flatten KS', 'Schneider PA', 'Billadeau DD', 'Hess AD', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Kaufmann SH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 protein, human)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Response Elements', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2014/06/05 06:00,2015/02/12 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47578-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.549220 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 25;289(30):20543-58. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.549220.,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136393/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA15083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4110268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously identified recurrent deletions in TBL1XR1, which encodes for an F-box like protein responsible for regulating the nuclear hormone repressor complex stability. Here we model TBL1XR1 deletions in B-precursor ALL cell lines and show that TBL1XR1 knockdown results in reduced glucocorticoid receptor recruitment to glucocorticoid responsive genes and ultimately decreased glucocorticoid signaling caused by increased levels of nuclear hormone repressor 1 and HDAC3. Reduction in glucocorticoid signaling in TBL1XR1-depleted lines resulted in resistance to glucocorticoid agonists, but not to other chemotherapeutic agents. Importantly, we show that treatment with the HDAC inhibitor SAHA restores sensitivity to prednisolone in TBL1XR1-depleted cells. Altogether, our data indicate that loss of TBL1XR1 is a novel driver of glucocorticoid resistance in ALL and that epigenetic therapy may have future application in restoring drug sensitivity at relapse.","['Jones, Courtney L', 'Bhatla, Teena', 'Blum, Roy', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Paugh, Steven W', 'Wen, Xin', 'Bourgeois, Wallace', 'Bitterman, Danielle S', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Morrison, Debra J', 'Teachey, David T', 'Evans, William E', 'Garabedian, Michael J', 'Carroll, William L']","['Jones CL', 'Bhatla T', 'Blum R', 'Wang J', 'Paugh SW', 'Wen X', 'Bourgeois W', 'Bitterman DS', 'Raetz EA', 'Morrison DJ', 'Teachey DT', 'Evans WE', 'Garabedian MJ', 'Carroll WL']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TBL1XR1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/06/05 06:00,2015/02/12 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47575-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.569889 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 25;289(30):20502-15. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.569889.,"['R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA141762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2P30CA016087-33/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM066704/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4110265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By performing immunomonitoring and subsequent principal component analysis, we tracked donor NK-cell dynamics in the patients and distinguished between NK cells reconstituting from CD34(+) precursors, giving rise over time to a continuum of multiple differentiation stages, and adoptively transferred NK cells. Transferred NK cells displayed a mature phenotype and proliferated in vivo during the early days after haploSCT even in the absence of exogenous IL-2 administration. Moreover, we identified the NK-cell phenotype associated with in vivo expansion.

However, the combined function of CBFbeta-SMMHC and cooperating mutations in preleukemic expansion is not known. Here, we used Nras(LSL-G12D); Cbfb(56M) knock-in mice to show that allelic expression of oncogenic Nras(G12D) and Cbfbeta-SMMHC increases survival of preleukemic short-term HSCs and myeloid progenitor cells and maintains the differentiation block induced by the fusion protein.

First, thiol functionalized DNA probes were assembled onto a gold nanoparticles modified gold electrode surface through a Au-S bond, followed by hybridizing with target miRNA. Subsequently, DNA in RNA/DNA duplexes was digested by T7 exonuclease, which can release the microRNA molecules from the electrode surface and return into the buffer solution. Meanwhile, the released microRNA can further hybridize with the unhybridized DNA probes on the modified electrode surface. On the basis of it, an isothermal amplification cycle is realized. The T7 exonuclease-assisted CEAM achieved a low detection limit of 0.17 fM. Moreover, this assay presents excellent specificity with discriminating only a single-base mismatched microRNA sequence.

Immunofluorescence, Fluo3- AM, and JC-1 staining results showed that Cuc B treatment induced nuclear gammaH2AX foci, increased intracellular calcium ion concentration, and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), respectively.

However, to date the prognostic impact and molecular consequences of these rearrangements were poorly investigated. Single additional alterations to del(5q) by balanced chromosome rearrangements were rarely found in myelodysplasia. In particular, balanced alterations involving TP63 and FOXP1 genes were never reported in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report on a 79-year woman with an aggressive form of myelodysplastic syndrome with del(5q), no TP53 mutation, and a novel complex rearrangement of chromosome 3 in bone marrow cells. Our results revealed that the FOXP1 and TP63 genes were both relocated along chromosome 3. Strikingly, immunohistochemistry analysis showed altered protein levels, disclosing that this rearrangement triggered the expression of FOXP1 and TP63 genes. FOXP1 was also found activated in other patients with myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia, showing that it is an important, recurrent event. CONCLUSIONS: We document an apparent role of FOXP1 and TP63, up to now poorly documented, in the progression of MDS in our patient who is lacking mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene normally associated with poor outcome in myelodysplastic syndrome with 5q-. Finally, our results may suggest a possible broader role of FOXP1 in the pathogenesis and progression of myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia.","[""L'Abbate, Alberto"", 'Lo Cunsolo, Crocifissa', 'Macri, Ettore', 'Iuzzolino, Paolo', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Doglioni, Claudio', 'Coco, Michelina', 'Muscarella, Lucia Anna', 'Salati, Simona', 'Tagliafico, Enrico', 'Minoia, Carla', 'De Tullio, Giacoma', 'Guarini, Attilio', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana']","[""L'Abbate A"", 'Lo Cunsolo C', 'Macri E', 'Iuzzolino P', 'Mecucci C', 'Doglioni C', 'Coco M', 'Muscarella LA', 'Salati S', 'Tagliafico E', 'Minoia C', 'De Tullio G', 'Guarini A', 'Testoni N', 'Agostinelli C', 'Storlazzi CT']","['Department of Biology, University of Bari, Via G,Amendola 165/A, Bari 70126, Italy. cleliatiziana.storlazzi@uniba.it.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (FOXP1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', '*Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2014/06/05 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/05 06:00'],"['2013/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-396 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-396 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jun 3;14:396. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-396.,,20140603,,PMC4059025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Auroras are up-regulated by MYC dysregulation with associated aneuploidy and resistance to microtubule targeted agents such as vincristine. Myc and Bcl2 are differentially expressed in U-2932, TMD-8, OCI-Ly10 and Granta-519, but only U-2932 cells over-express mutated p53. Alisertib [MLN8237 or M], a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase, was synergistic with vincristine [VCR] and rituximab [R] for inhibition of cell proliferation, abrogation of cell cycle checkpoints and enhanced apoptosis versus single agent or doublet therapy. A DLBCL (U-2932) mouse model showed tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of approximately 10-20% (p = 0.001) for M, VCR and M-VCR respectively, while R alone showed approximately 50% TGI (p = 0.001). M-R and VCR-R led to tumor regression [TR], but relapsed 10 days after discontinuing therapy. In contrast, M-VCR-R demonstrated TR with no relapse >40 days after stopping therapy with a Kaplan-Meier survival of 100%. Genes that are modulated by M-VCR-R (CENP-C, Auroras) play a role in centromere-kinetochore function in an attempt to maintain mitosis in the presence of synthetic lethality. Together, our data suggest that the interaction between alisertib plus VCR plus rituximab is synergistic and synthetic lethal in Myc and Bcl-2 co-expressing DLBCL.

METHODS: Information was obtained from the Cancer Population Registry in Cali and the Municipal Department of Health . Childhood cancer international classification was used. The vital status was obtained from MDH death certificate and hospital databases. Additionally, clinical records were revised and, in some cases, telephone contact was carried out. Follow-up was done until 31/12/2011. Incident and mortality rates were estimated and adjusted for age. Life-tables were made to estimate overall survival. RESULTS: Between the years of 1977-2011, there were 2311 cases identified in children under 15 years of age. The IR and MR for Cali were found to be 141.2 and 55.6 per million of people per year. Leukemias, lymphomas, CNS tumors and soft tissue sarcomas showed IR of 60.1, 20.5, 25.7 and 9.4, respectively. 5-years OS was 48%, and showed an improvement from 24.9%+/-4.3 to 51.8%+/-4.6, compared 1992-96 vs 2002-06 periods. CONCLUSION: The IR found is comparable with those described in affluent countries. Taking into account that pediatric cancer is curable for about 75-80% of the cases, it presents an enormous challenge to the Colombian health system: to improve current clinical results.","['Bravo, Luis Eduardo', 'Garcia, Luz Stella', 'Collazos, Paola', 'Aristizabal, Paula', 'Ramirez, Oscar']","['Bravo LE', 'Garcia LS', 'Collazos P', 'Aristizabal P', 'Ramirez O']","['Registro Poblacional de Cancer de Cali, Pathology Department Universidad del Valle.

This industry-based cohort study aimed to examine the relationship between working in a rotating shift and cancer incidence. METHODS: The cohort consisted of male production workers (12 609 shift and 15 219 day), employed in a large chemical industry for at least one year between 1995-2005, and residing in the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Incident cancer cases from 2000-2009 were identified through record linkage with the cancer registry of Rhineland-Palatinate. Information on exposure to shift work and potential confounders, including age, smoking status, job level, and employment duration, was extracted from the personnel and health records. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Between 2000-2009, 518 and 555 cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) occurred among shift and day work employees, respectively. Compared to ""never shift work"", shift workers experienced an increased risk of cancers neither at all-sites (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89-1.21) nor for prostate cancer in particular (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71-1.21). The risks of leukemia and esophagus cancer were increased if smoking was not taken into account, albeit based on small numbers. However, adjusting for smoking changed the HR and the risk diminished. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses do not provide evidence for a carcinogenic effect of the shift system under study.","['Yong, Mei', 'Blettner, Maria', 'Emrich, Katharina', 'Nasterlack, Michael', 'Oberlinner, Christoph', 'Hammer, Gael P']","['Yong M', 'Blettner M', 'Emrich K', 'Nasterlack M', 'Oberlinner C', 'Hammer GP']","['BASF SE, GUA / CS - H306, Ludwigshafen, Germany. mei.yong@basf.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,,IM,"['Adult', '*Chemical Industry', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Work Schedule Tolerance']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3438 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.3438 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2014 Sep;40(5):502-10. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.3438.

Reports have shown CD34(+) dose to be important for transplantation outcome using myeloablative conditioning. The role of CD34(+) dose of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) has not been previously analyzed in a large population undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning/nonmyeloablative HCT. We studied 1054 patients, ages 45 to 75 years, with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent transplantation between 2002 and 2011. Results of multivariate analysis showed that PBPC from HLA-matched siblings containing <4 x 10(6) CD34(+)/kg was associated with higher nonrelapse mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; P = .001), overall mortality (HR, 1.48; P = .008), and lower neutrophil (odds ratio [OR], .76; P = .03) and platelet (OR, .76; P = .03) recovery. PBPC from unrelated donors with CD34(+) dose < 6 x 10(6) CD34(+)/kg was also associated with higher nonrelapse (HR, 1.38; P = .02) and overall mortality (HR, 1.20; P = .05). In contrast to reports after myeloablative HCT, CD34(+) dose did not affect relapse or graft-versus-host disease with either donor type. An upper cell dose limit was not associated with adverse outcomes. These data suggest that PBPC CD34(+) doses >4 x 10(6) CD34(+)/kg and >6 x 10(6) CD34(+)/kg are optimal for HLA-matched sibling and unrelated donor HCT, respectively.","['Torlen, Johan', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Le Rademacher, Jennifer', 'Batiwalla, Minoo', 'Chen, Junfang', 'Erkers, Tom', 'Ho, Vincent', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Keever-Taylor, Carolyn', 'Kindwall-Keller, Tamila', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Laughlin, Mary J', 'Lill, Michael', ""O'Brien, Tracey"", 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Szwajcer, David', 'Valcarcel, David', 'Eapen, Mary']","['Torlen J', 'Ringden O', 'Le Rademacher J', 'Batiwalla M', 'Chen J', 'Erkers T', 'Ho V', 'Kebriaei P', 'Keever-Taylor C', 'Kindwall-Keller T', 'Lazarus HM', 'Laughlin MJ', 'Lill M', ""O'Brien T"", 'Perales MA', 'Rocha V', 'Savani BN', 'Szwajcer D', 'Valcarcel D', 'Eapen M']","['Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden; Division of Therapeutic Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Society, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Therapeutic Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia.', 'Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Stem Cell Therapeutics Program, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Inc, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', ""Centre for Children's Cancer & Blood Disorders, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

We evaluated 13 B-PLL patients [7 being t(11;14)-positive (B-PLL+) and 6 negative (B-PLL-)] and compared them with MCL and CLL patients. EuroFlow-based immunophenotyping showed significant overlap between B-PLL+ and B-PLL-, as well as between B-PLL and MCL, whereas CLL clustered separately. Immunogenotyping showed specific IGHV gene usage partly resembling MCL. Gene expression profiling showed no separation between B-PLL+ and B-PLL- but identified 3 subgroups. One B-PLL subgroup clustered close to CLL and another subgroup clustered with leukemic MCL; both were associated with prolonged survival. A third subgroup clustered close to nodal MCL and was associated with short survival. Gene expression profiles of both B-PLL+ and B-PLL- showed best resemblance with normal immunoglobulin M-only B-cells. Our data confirm that B-PLL+ is highly comparable to MCL, indicate that B-PLL- also may be considered as a specific subgroup of MCL, and suggest that B-PLL is part of a spectrum, ranging from CLL-like B-PLL, to leukemic MCL-like B-PLL, to nodal MCL-like B-PLL.","['van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'Hoogeveen, Patricia G', 'de Ridder, Dick', 'Schindler-van der Struijk, Magdalena', 'van Zelm, Menno C', 'Sanders, Mathijs', 'Karsch, Dennis', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Lam, King', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Lugtenburg, Pieternella J', 'Bottcher, Sebastian', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Kappers-Klunne, Mies', 'van Lom, Kirsten']","['van der Velden VH', 'Hoogeveen PG', 'de Ridder D', 'Schindler-van der Struijk M', 'van Zelm MC', 'Sanders M', 'Karsch D', 'Beverloo HB', 'Lam K', 'Orfao A', 'Lugtenburg PJ', 'Bottcher S', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Langerak AW', 'Kappers-Klunne M', 'van Lom K']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Delft Bioinformatics Laboratory, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Second Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Schleswig Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany;', 'Department of Clinical Genetics and.', 'Department of Pathology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Cancer Research Center (Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas), Department of Medicine and Cytometry Service (Nucleus), University of Salamanca, and Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Second Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Schleswig Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany;', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, B-Cell/*classification/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*classification/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transcriptome']",2014/06/04 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39973-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-10-533869 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 17;124(3):412-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-10-533869.

Heterozygous loss of chromosome 5q (del[5q]) is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in MDS. DIAPH1 is localized to 5q31 and encodes one of the formin proteins, mDia1, which is involved in linear actin polymerization. Mice with mDia1 deficiency develop hematologic features with age mimicking human myeloid neoplasm, but its role in the pathogenesis of MDS is unclear. Here we report that mDia1 heterozygous and knockout mice develop MDS phenotypes with age. In these mice, CD14 was aberrantly overexpressed on granulocytes in a cell-autonomous manner, leading to a hypersensitive innate immune response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimuli through CD14/Toll-like receptor 4 signaling. Chronic stimulation with LPS accelerated the development of MDS in mDia1 heterozygous and knockout mice that can be rescued by lenalidomide. Similar findings of CD14 overexpression were observed on the bone marrow granulocytes of del(5q) MDS patients. Mechanistically, mDia1 deficiency led to a downregulation of membrane-associated genes and a specific upregulation of CD14 messenger RNA in granulocytes, but not in other lineages. These results underscore the significance of mDia1 heterozygosity in deregulated innate immune responses in del(5q) MDS.","['Keerthivasan, Ganesan', 'Mei, Yang', 'Zhao, Baobing', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Harris, Chad E', 'Gao, Juehua', 'Basiorka, Ashley A', 'Schipma, Matthew J', 'McElherne, James', 'Yang, Jing', 'Verma, Amit K', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'List, Alan F', 'Williams, David A', 'Ji, Peng']","['Keerthivasan G', 'Mei Y', 'Zhao B', 'Zhang L', 'Harris CE', 'Gao J', 'Basiorka AA', 'Schipma MJ', 'McElherne J', 'Yang J', 'Verma AK', 'Pellagatti A', 'Boultwood J', 'List AF', 'Williams DA', 'Ji P']","['Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL;', 'Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL;', 'Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL;', 'Department of Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine and Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

In principle, any genetic alteration affecting a protein-coding region has the potential to generate mutated peptides that are presented by surface HLA class I proteins that might be recognized by cytotoxic T cells. To test this possibility, we implemented a streamlined approach for the prediction and validation of such neoantigens derived from individual tumors and presented by patient-specific HLA alleles. We applied our computational pipeline to 91 chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs) that underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES). We predicted approximately 22 mutated HLA-binding peptides per leukemia (derived from approximately 16 missense mutations) and experimentally confirmed HLA binding for approximately 55% of such peptides. Two CLL patients that achieved long-term remission following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were monitored for CD8(+) T-cell responses against predicted or confirmed HLA-binding peptides. Long-lived cytotoxic T-cell responses were detected against peptides generated from personal tumor mutations in ALMS1, C6ORF89, and FNDC3B presented on tumor cells. Finally, we applied our computational pipeline to WES data (N = 2488 samples) across 13 different cancer types and estimated dozens to thousands of predicted neoantigens per individual tumor, suggesting that neoantigens are frequent in most tumors.","['Rajasagi, Mohini', 'Shukla, Sachet A', 'Fritsch, Edward F', 'Keskin, Derin B', 'DeLuca, David', 'Carmona, Ellese', 'Zhang, Wandi', 'Sougnez, Carrie', 'Cibulskis, Kristian', 'Sidney, John', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Brusic, Vladimir', 'Gabriel, Stacey', 'Lander, Eric S', 'Getz, Gad', 'Hacohen, Nir', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Rajasagi M', 'Shukla SA', 'Fritsch EF', 'Keskin DB', 'DeLuca D', 'Carmona E', 'Zhang W', 'Sougnez C', 'Cibulskis K', 'Sidney J', 'Stevenson K', 'Ritz J', 'Neuberg D', 'Brusic V', 'Gabriel S', 'Lander ES', 'Getz G', 'Hacohen N', 'Wu CJ']","['Cancer Vaccine Center and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Cancer Vaccine Center and Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA;', 'Cancer Vaccine Center and Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA;', 'Cancer Vaccine Center and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Cancer Vaccine Center and Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA;', 'Division of Medical Sciences: Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA;', 'Cancer Vaccine Center and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA;', 'Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA;', 'La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA;', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', ""Cancer Vaccine Center and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA;"", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Cancer Vaccine Center and.', 'Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA;', 'Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA;', 'Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; and.', 'Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Cancer Vaccine Center and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/metabolism', 'Exome', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Precision Medicine', 'Protein Binding', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2014/06/04 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39979-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-04-567933 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 17;124(3):453-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-04-567933.

We investigated the tolerability and efficacy of decitabine and vorinostat plus chemotherapy in relapse/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Decitabine (15 mg/m(2) iv) and vorinostat (230 mg/m(2) PO div BID) were given days 1-4 followed by vincristine, prednisone, PEG-asparaginase, and doxorubicin. Genome wide methylation profiles were performed in 8 matched patient bone marrow (BM) samples taken at day 0 and day 5 (postdecitabine). The median age was 16 (range, 3-54) years. All patients had a prior BM relapse, with five relapsing after allogeneic transplant. The most common nonhematological toxicities possibly related to decitabine or vorinostat were infection with neutropenia (grade 3; n = 4) and fever/neutropenia (grade 3, n = 4; grade 4, n = 1). Of the 13 eligible patients, four achieved complete remission without platelet recovery (CRp), two partial response (PR), one stable disease (SD), one progressive disease (PD), two deaths on study and three patients who did not have end of therapy disease evaluations for an overall response rate of 46.2% (CRp + PR). Following decitabine, significant genome-wide hypo-methylation was observed. Comparison of clinical responders with nonresponders identified methylation profiles of clinical and biological relevance. Decitabine and vorinostat followed by re-Induction chemotherapy was tolerable and demonstrated clinical benefit in relapsed patients with ALL. Methylation differences were identified between responders and nonresponders indicating interpatient variation, which could impact clinical outcome.

However, patients with BCR-ABL1(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia and subsets of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia are at high risk of relapse despite kinase inhibition therapy, necessitating novel treatment strategies. We previously reported synthetic lethality in BCR-ABL1(+) leukemia cells by blocking both calcineurin/NFAT signaling and BCR-ABL1, independent of drug efflux inhibition by cyclosporine. Here, using RNA-interference we confirm that calcineurin inhibition sensitizes BCR-ABL1(+) cells to tyrosine kinase inhibition in vitro. However, when we performed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of dasatinib and cyclosporine in mice, we found that co-administration of cyclosporine increases peak concentrations and the area under the curve of dasatinib, which contributes to the enhanced disease control. We also report the clinical experience of two subjects in whom we observed more hematopoietic toxicity than expected while enrolled in a Phase Ib trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of adding cyclosporine to dasatinib in humans. Thus, the anti-leukemia benefit of co-administration of cyclosporine and dasatinib is mechanistically pleiotropic, but may not be tolerable, at least as administered in this trial. These data highlight some of the challenges associated with combining targeted agents to treat leukemia.","['Gardner, Lori A', 'Klawitter, Jelena', 'Gregory, Mark A', 'Zaberezhnyy, Vadym', 'Baturin, Dmitry', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Takebe, Naoko', 'Christians, Uwe', 'Gore, Lia', 'DeGregori, James', 'Porter, Christopher C']","['Gardner LA', 'Klawitter J', 'Gregory MA', 'Zaberezhnyy V', 'Baturin D', 'Pollyea DA', 'Takebe N', 'Christians U', 'Gore L', 'DeGregori J', 'Porter CC']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Investigational Drug Branch, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD.', 'Investigational Drug Branch, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', '*Calcineurin Inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclosporine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/04 06:00,2014/10/04 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23776 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Sep;89(9):896-903. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23776.

Acute and long-term neuropsychological toxicities associated with WBRT are compared. METHODS: This multisite study included 188 children, ages 4-21 years at enrollment, who were assessed with standardized neuropsychological tests at 9, 21, and 48 months after diagnosis with intermediate risk ALL. All participating children were receiving treatment on a parent study CCG105. RESULTS: Verbal intelligence (VIQ) scores for children receiving WBRT was significantly lower than VIQ for prophylactic chemotherapy at the 48-month time point (p < 0.05). A significant cross-level interaction between time since diagnosis and treatment condition was observed (p < 0.05). WBRT did not result in differences in PIQ; both groups of children demonstrated comparable increases in PIQ. Neuropsychological findings at 48 months after diagnosis indicated diminished performance in neuromotor, visual-motor coordination, and executive functioning for children receiving WBRT. Academic achievement was unaffected by WBRT at 4 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of verbal and performance IQ as a primary endpoint in ALL clinical trials is critical to characterizing neuropsychological late effects. A trajectory of decline in neuropsychological functioning, specifically verbal IQ, was observed. Missing data within the trial occurred at random and did not impact results observed. The impact of WBRT becomes evident at 48 months after diagnosis, suggesting the need for long-term follow-up beyond the time frame typically used in Phase III trials.","['Annett, Robert D', 'Hile, Sarah', 'Bedrick, Edward', 'Kunin-Batson, Alicia S', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Embry, Leanne', 'MacLean, Willliam E Jr', 'Noll, Robert B']","['Annett RD', 'Hile S', 'Bedrick E', 'Kunin-Batson AS', 'Krull KR', 'Embry L', 'MacLean WE Jr', 'Noll RB']","['University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, MSC10-5590, 1 University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Attention/*radiation effects', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/radiation effects', 'Executive Function/*radiation effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Memory/*radiation effects', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology/*radiotherapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychomotor Performance/*radiation effects', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3586 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2015 Feb;24(2):181-9. doi: 10.1002/pon.3586.

BACKGROUND: Providing timely and accurate information to patients diagnosed with a haematological malignancy is a challenge in clinical practice; treatment often has to start promptly, with little time to inform patients. DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from all available literature to May 2013 in the databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO and PubMed (Medline). Relevant studies were reviewed regarding the perceived need for information on various topics, sources of information and satisfaction with information provided. RESULTS: The initial search revealed 215 articles, fourteen of which were relevant. Patients need basic information on the disease (diagnosis and diagnostics), treatment (various treatment options, side effects and duration), prognosis (curability and prolonging life) and all other topics (recovery, self-care and psychosocial functioning). Need for detailed information varied between studies. Patients expressed a higher need for medical than for psychosocial information. Patients preferred to receive information from their doctors the most, followed by nurses. Most studies described patients' satisfaction with the information provided. CONCLUSION: Based on the limited number of data available, medical information is for patients of higher priority compared to psychosocial information. Patients need basic information on diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and all other topics. Need for detailed information varied between studies. Patients were satisfied with the provided information, preferably offered by doctors and nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The perceived need for information and satisfaction with the information provided differs strongly between patients. In clinical practice, more attention is needed for information tailored to the patient, taking into account important moderating factors such as age, type of cancer, time since diagnosis, treatment modality and coping style.","['Rood, Janneke A J', 'Eeltink, Corien M', 'van Zuuren, Florence J', 'Verdonck-de Leeuw, Irma M', 'Huijgens, Peter C']","['Rood JA', 'Eeltink CM', 'van Zuuren FJ', 'Verdonck-de Leeuw IM', 'Huijgens PC']","['Department of Haematology (pk 2 br 018), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Internal Medicine, Medical Center, Alkmaar.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Clin Nurs,Journal of clinical nursing,9207302,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/nursing/*psychology', 'Humans', '*Information Seeking Behavior', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nursing Process', '*Patient Education as Topic', 'Patient Satisfaction']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jocn.12630 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Nurs. 2015 Feb;24(3-4):353-69. doi: 10.1111/jocn.12630.

Improved genotypic detection of impending drug resistance may follow from recent technical advances. A severely T-cell-depleted patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia developed CMV pneumonia and high plasma viral loads that were poorly responsive to antiviral therapy. Serial plasma specimens were analyzed for mutant viral populations by conventional and high-throughput deep-sequencing methods. Uncharacterized mutations were phenotyped for drug resistance using recombinant viruses. Conventional genotyping detected viruses with the UL97 kinase substitution C607Y after ganciclovir treatment, a transient subpopulation of UL54 polymerase L773V mutants first detected 8 weeks after foscarnet was started, and a subpopulation of a mutant with deletion of UL54 codons 981 and 982 2 months after the addition of cidofovir. Deep sequencing of the same serial specimens revealed the same UL54 mutants sooner, along with a more complex evolution of known and newly recognized mutant subpopulations missed by conventional sequencing. The UL54 exonuclease substitutions D413N, K513R, and C539G were newly shown to confer ganciclovir-cidofovir resistance, while L773V was shown to confer foscarnet resistance and add to the ganciclovir resistance conferred by UL97 C607Y. Increased sequencing depth provided a more timely and detailed diagnosis of mutant viral subpopulations that evolved with changing anti-CMV therapy.","['Chou, Sunwen', 'Ercolani, Ronald J', 'Sahoo, Malaya K', 'Lefterova, Martina I', 'Strasfeld, Lynne M', 'Pinsky, Benjamin A']","['Chou S', 'Ercolani RJ', 'Sahoo MK', 'Lefterova MI', 'Strasfeld LM', 'Pinsky BA']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, Oregon, USA chous@ohsu.edu.', 'Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (UL54 protein, Human herpesvirus 5)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '364P9RVW4X (Foscarnet)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'JIL713Q00N (Cidofovir)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cidofovir', 'Cytomegalovirus/drug effects/*genetics/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology/virology', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Viral', 'Foscarnet/therapeutic use', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Organophosphonates/therapeutic use', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology/virology', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/drug effects/genetics']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.03214-14 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.03214-14 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Aug;58(8):4697-702. doi: 10.1128/AAC.03214-14.

The role and mechanism of Th17 cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrated that the frequency of Th17 cells was significantly increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients compared with healthy donors. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-22, IL-23, IL-1beta, IL-6, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 were significantly increased in blood and bone marrow in AML patients compared with healthy donors. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-23, but not TGF-beta1 promoted the generation and differentiation of Th17 cells from naive CD4(+) T cells in humans. IL-17A, a signature cytokine secreted by Th17 cells, induced the proliferation of IL-17 receptor (IL-17R)-positive AML cells via IL-17R, in which activation of PI3K/Akt and Jak/Stat3 signaling pathway may play important roles. In addition, combination of IL-17A and IL-22 significantly reduced the generation of Th1 cells and the production of interferon (IFN)-gamma from healthy donor or AML patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with high Th17 cell frequency had poor prognosis, whereas patients with high Th1 cell frequency had prolonged survival. Combined analysis of Th1 and Th17 cell frequencies improved the ability to predict patient outcomes. In conclusion, Th17 cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AML and may be an important therapeutic target and prognostic predictor.","['Han, Yixiang', 'Ye, Aifang', 'Bi, Laixi', 'Wu, Jianbo', 'Yu, Kang', 'Zhang, Shenghui']","['Han Y', 'Ye A', 'Bi L', 'Wu J', 'Yu K', 'Zhang S']","['Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,['0 (Interleukin-17)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/*blood/immunology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Th1 Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Th17 Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/04 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12459 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2014 Aug;105(8):933-42. doi: 10.1111/cas.12459.

TRIM62 is a regulator of cell polarity and a tumour suppressor in breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate that human non-small cell lung cancer lesions show a step-wise loss of TRIM62 levels during disease progression, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes. To directly examine the role of Trim62 in development of lung cancer, we deleted Trim62 in a mutant K-Ras mouse model of lung cancer. In this context, haploinsufficiency of Trim62 synergized with a K-RasG12D mutation to promote invasiveness and disrupt three-dimensional morphogenesis, both of which are associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. Re-expression of Trim62 reverted these phenotypes in tumour cell lines. Thus, Trim62 loss cooperates with K-Ras mutation in tumourigenesis and metastasis in vivo, indicating that decreased levels of TRIM62 may play an important role in the evolution of lung cancer.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Post, Sean M', 'Solis, Luisa M', 'Xiong, Shunbin', 'Yang, Peirong', 'Chen, Nanyue', 'Wistuba, Ignacio I', 'Killary, Ann M', 'Lozano, Guillermina']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Post SM', 'Solis LM', 'Xiong S', 'Yang P', 'Chen N', 'Wistuba II', 'Killary AM', 'Lozano G']","['Department of Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Dear1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Angiotensin)', '0 (Receptors, Endothelin)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM62 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Angiotensin/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Endothelin/genetics/metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/06/04 06:00,2014/12/30 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.4385 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2014 Sep;234(1):108-19. doi: 10.1002/path.4385.

While much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of cellular dysregulation, the prognosis for aggressive ATL still remains poor. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches need to be developed. RESULTS: Previously, we demonstrated that the viral protein Tax inactivates p53 in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Here we show that 9-aminoacridine (9AA) through p53 reactivation and NF-kappaB inhibition has selective toxicity for infected leukemic cells independent of their p53 status. We further demonstrate that 9AA activates caspase-3/7 resulting in PARP cleavage. Next we investigated the efficacy of 9AA in the MET-1 ATL model. Alone, 9AA did not cause significant drops in surrogate tumor markers, soluble IL-2Ralpha or beta2-micorglobulin (beta2mu) levels with only a slight increase in survival of MET-1-bearing mice. However, in combination with Campath-1H, 9AA treatment resulted in low soluble IL-2Ralpha and beta2mu levels at 2 and 4 weeks. Consistent with reduced tumor cell burden, combination treatment significantly increased survival of MET-1-bearing mice compared to mice treated with either drug alone. Splenic cells isolated from 9AA or combination treated mice showed increased p53 protein levels and transcriptional activity. Consistent with increased tumor suppressor activity, we found increased PARP-1 cleavage in 9AA and combination treated cells. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that targeting reactivation of p53 and inhibition of NF-kappaB with acridine-derivatives in combination with other chemotherapeutics could result in increased efficacy and selective killing of tumor cells.","['Ju, Wei', 'Zhang, Meili', 'Petrus, Michael', 'Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Ju W', 'Zhang M', 'Petrus M', 'Maeda M', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'Waldmann TA']","['Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, 10 Center Drive, Building 10, Room 4 N115, Bethesda, MD 20892-1374, USA. masisonc@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '78OY3Z0P7Z (Aminacrine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Parp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Aminacrine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/genetics', 'Caspase 7/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/03/05 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-11-43 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-11-43 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2014 Jun 2;11:43. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-11-43.,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],20140602,,PMC4060757,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nanocomposite interface of the gold nanoparticles/polyaniline nanofibers (AuNPs/PANI-NF) was chosen to design the biosensor for electrochemical detection. Au/PANI-NF-based cytosensors coated with anti-P-glycoprotein (anti-P-gp) molecules could provide a biomimetic interface for the immunosensing of cell surface P-glycoprotein, and thus could capture the over-expression P-gp cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that the gold nanoparticles were uniformly anchored along the structure of the PANI-NF surface, displaying fibrillar morphology with a diameter of approximately 70 nm, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) further presented the morphology of the nanocomposite film. Owing to the high affinity of anti-P-gp for leukemia K562/ADM cells of the propounded sensing platform, the proposed biosensor exhibited excellent analytical performance for leukemia K562/ADM cells, ranging from 1.6 x 10(2) to 1.6 x 10(6) cells per mL with a detection limit of 80 cells per mL. Recovery experiments indicated that the sensitivity reported here is suitable for practical application. The cell surface P-gp expression level was analysed by flow cytometric experiments, which confirmed the above recognized result. This strategy is also a cost-effective and convenient operation, implying great promise for the sensitive recognition of cancer cells and cell surface receptors; thus, it is helpful in cancer diagnosis.","['Zhang, Shaolian', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Yang, Peihui', 'Cai, Jiye']","['Zhang S', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang X', 'Yang P', 'Cai J']","[""Department of Chemistry, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, People's Republic of China. typh@jnu.edu.cn zhangshaolian1990@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (polyaniline)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', 'Aniline Compounds/chemistry', 'Biosensing Techniques/*instrumentation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrochemical Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Equipment Design', 'Gold/chemistry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Nanocomposites/chemistry', 'Nanofibers/chemistry', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/08/14 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4an00420e [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2014 Jul 21;139(14):3629-35. doi: 10.1039/c4an00420e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only modality that offers the possibility of cure. To identify predictors of progression-free and overall survival, we evaluated outcomes of 43 consecutive patients who received an allograft for advanced CLL. The majority received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (n=37). Donors were HLA matched-related (n=18), matched-unrelated (n=15), mismatched-unrelated (n=7), or umbilical cord blood (n=3). The median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 31.4 months and 46.4 months respectively. Twenty (46.5%) patients were alive and in complete remission at a median follow-up of 31.4 months. NRM was higher than previously published series for CLL, likely due to a high burden of comorbidity (22 patients with HCT-CI >/= 2) and a high proportion receiving HLA mismatched-unrelated donor or umbilical cord blood cells. Presence of del (11q), del(17p), or progressive disease at HCT are independent predictors of worse PFS and OS.

Radiograph imaging of her bilateral hands and wrists showed erosive joint disease and lymph node, and bone marrow biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of T cell lymphoblastic leukemia. Our case demonstrates a unique clinical phenotype of paraneoplastic arthritis and is only the second reported case of RF, anti-CCP-positive arthritis related to a hematological malignancy. We review the only three published cases of seropositive paraneoplastic arthritis. In each case, systemic symptoms or a poor response to steroid treatment triggered additional workup. These cases highlight the importance of careful clinical assessment and vigilance to rule out secondary causes of inflammatory arthritis, even in patients with seropositive erosive arthritis.","['Handy, Catherine E', 'Robles, Glenda', 'Haque, Uzma', 'Houston, Brian']","['Handy CE', 'Robles G', 'Haque U', 'Houston B']","['Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital, 1830 East Monument Street, Suite 920, Baltimore, USA, handy@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Clin Rheumatol,Clinical rheumatology,8211469,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*diagnosis', 'Autoantibodies/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis', 'Radiography', 'Rheumatoid Factor/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Wrist Joint/diagnostic imaging']",2014/06/04 06:00,2016/05/21 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10067-014-2697-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Rheumatol. 2015 Sep;34(9):1647-50. doi: 10.1007/s10067-014-2697-9.

In contrast, knocking-down of endogenous BMI1 expression enhanced progeny production of a conditionally replicating Ad and wild-type Ad5 and Ad11p. Ad vectors overexpressing BMI1 were not impaired in the replication of progeny genomes and in the expression of E1A and Ad structural proteins. However, 293 cells infected by Ad vector overexpressing BMI1 contained a large proportion of morphologically irregular Ad particles. This effect was reversed in 293 cells pre-treated with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) in parallel with the production of infectious Ad particles. Our findings suggest an inhibitory role of BMI1 in Ad morphogenesis that can be implied in Ad tropism and Ad-mediated cancer therapy.","['Na, Manli', 'Chen, Dongfeng', 'Holmqvist, Bo', 'Ran, Liang', 'Jin, Jie', 'Rebetz, Johan', 'Fan, Xiaolong']","['Na M', 'Chen D', 'Holmqvist B', 'Ran L', 'Jin J', 'Rebetz J', 'Fan X']","['The Rausing Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

Studies on XMRV could thus bring clues on how a new retrovirus could circumvent barrier species. We observed that XMRV exhibits a weak promoter activity in human cells, similar to the transcription level of a Tat-defective HIV-1. Despite this low fitness, XMRV can efficiently propagate through the huge accumulation of viral copies ( approximately 40 copies per cell) that compensates for the low expression level of individual proviruses. We further demonstrate that there is an inverse relationship between the maximum number of viral copies per infected cell and the level of viral expression, which is explained by viral envelope interference mechanisms. Low viral expression compensation by viral copy accumulation through delayed interference could a priori contribute to the propagation of others viruses following species jumps.","['Laurent, Fanny', 'Tchenio, Thierry', 'Buckle, Malcolm', 'Hazan, Uriel', 'Bury-Mone, Stephanie']","['Laurent F', 'Tchenio T', 'Buckle M', 'Hazan U', 'Bury-Mone S']","['LBPA, UMR 8113 CNRS, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, 61 avenue du President Wilson, 94235 Cachan, France; Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.

The authors conducted an ecological analysis to characterize CCRN catchment at >200 COG institutions by demographic characteristics, diagnosis, and geographic location to determine whether the CCRN can serve as a population-based registry for childhood cancer. METHODS: During 2009 to 2011, 18,580 US children newly diagnosed with cancer were registered in the CCRN. These observed cases were compared with age-specific, sex-specific, and race/ethnicity-specific expected numbers calculated from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program cancer incidence rates and 2010 US Census data. RESULTS: Overall, 42% of children (18,580 observed/44,267 expected) who were diagnosed with cancer at age <20 years were registered in the CCRN, including 45%, 57%, 51%, 44%, and 24% of those diagnosed at birth, ages 1 to 4 years, ages 5 to 9 years, ages 10 to 14 years, and ages 15 to 19 years, respectively. Some malignancies were better represented in the CCRN (leukemia, 59%; renal tumors, 67%) than others (retinoblastoma, 34%). There was little evidence of differences by sex or race/ethnicity, although rates in nonwhites were somewhat lower than rates in whites. CONCLUSIONS: Given the low observed-to-expected ratio, it will be important to identify challenges and barriers to registration to improve case ascertainment, especially for rarer diagnoses and older age groups; however, it is encouraging that some diagnoses in younger children are fairly representative of the population.

Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) generate stable loss-of-function phenotypes and are versatile experimental tools to explore the contribution of individual genetic alterations to clonal evolution. In these experiments tumour cells carrying shRNAs are commonly tracked with fluorescent reporters. While this works well for cell culture studies and leukaemia mouse models, fluorescent reporters are poorly suited for animals with solid tumours--the most common tumour types in cancer patients. Here we develop a toolkit that uses secreted luciferases to track the fate of two different shRNA-expressing tumour cell clones competitively, both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that secreted luciferase activities can be measured robustly in the blood stream of tumour-bearing mice to accurately quantify, in a minimally invasive manner, the dynamic evolution of two genetically distinct tumour subclones in preclinical mouse models of tumour development, metastasis and therapy.","['Charles, Joel P', 'Fuchs, Jeannette', 'Hefter, Mirjam', 'Vischedyk, Jonas B', 'Kleint, Maximilian', 'Vogiatzi, Fotini', 'Schafer, Jonas A', 'Nist, Andrea', 'Timofeev, Oleg', 'Wanzel, Michael', 'Stiewe, Thorsten']","['Charles JP', 'Fuchs J', 'Hefter M', 'Vischedyk JB', 'Kleint M', 'Vogiatzi F', 'Schafer JA', 'Nist A', 'Timofeev O', 'Wanzel M', 'Stiewe T']","['1] Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany [2].', '1] Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany [2].', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, 35043 Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Luciferases', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/10/02 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms4981 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms4981 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 Jun 3;5:3981. doi: 10.1038/ncomms4981.,,20140603,,PMC4059931,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abbott Cell-Dyn Sapphire uses the fluorescence after staining with the DNA fluorochrome propidium iodide for the measurement of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) and nonviable cells (FL3+ cell fraction): We have studied the possible correlation between presence and number of morphologically identifiable smudge cells on smears and the percentage of nonviable cells produced by Cell-Dyn Sapphire. METHODS: 305 blood samples from 224 patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and 40 healthy blood donors were analyzed by CBC performed by Cell-Dyn Sapphire, peripheral blood smear, and immunophenotype characterization. RESULT: FL3+ fraction in CLPD directly correlated with the percentage of smudge cells and is significantly increased in patients with typical B-CLL. This phenomenon is much less evident in patients with atypical/mixed B-CLL and B-NHL. CONCLUSION: In small laboratories without FCM and cytogenetic, smudge cells%, can be utilized as a preliminary diagnostic and prognostic tool in differential diagnosis of CLPD.","['Fumi, M', 'Martins, D', 'Pancione, Y', 'Sale, S', 'Rocco, V']","['Fumi M', 'Martins D', 'Pancione Y', 'Sale S', 'Rocco V']","[""Clinical Pathology Laboratory, A.O.R.N 'G.

However, Rag deficiency does not prevent B-cell leukemogenesis in p53/NHEJ mutant mice, revealing that p53 and NHEJ also suppress Rag-independent mechanisms of B-cell leukemogenesis. Using several cytogenomic approaches, we identified a novel class of activating mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), a receptor tyrosine kinase important for normal hematopoiesis in Rag/p53/NHEJ triple-mutant (TM) B-cell leukemias. These mutant Flt3 alleles were created by complex genomic rearrangements with Moloney leukemia virus (MuLV)-related endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements, generating ERV-Flt3 fusion genes encoding an N-terminally truncated mutant form of Flt3 (trFlt3) that was transcribed from ERV long terminal repeats. trFlt3 protein lacked most of the Flt3 extracellular domain and induced ligand-independent STAT5 phosphorylation and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, expression of trFlt3 in p53/NHEJ mutant hematopoietic progenitor cells promoted development of clinically aggressive B-cell leukemia. Thus, repetitive MuLV-related ERV sequences can participate in aberrant end-joining events that promote development of aggressive B-cell leukemia.","['Johnson, Radia M', 'Papp, Eniko', 'Grandal, Ildiko', 'Kowalski, Paul E', 'Nutter, Lauryl', 'Wong, Raymond C C', 'Joseph-George, Ann M', 'Danska, Jayne S', 'Guidos, Cynthia J']","['Johnson RM', 'Papp E', 'Grandal I', 'Kowalski PE', 'Nutter L', 'Wong RC', 'Joseph-George AM', 'Danska JS', 'Guidos CJ']","['Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada; Department of Immunology.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada;', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada;', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada;', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada;', 'The Centre for Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada;', 'The Centre for Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada; Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada; Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada; Department of Immunology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA End-Joining Repair/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*metabolism']",2014/06/04 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['28/11/1179 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.240820.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2014 Jun 1;28(11):1179-90. doi: 10.1101/gad.240820.114.,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,PMC4052764,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell development', 'Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3', 'endogenous retrovirus', 'lymphoblastic leukemia', 'nonhomologous end-joining', 'p53']",,['(c) 2014 Johnson et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7674-2612'],,,,,,,,

The therapeutic efficacy is mainly based on the alloreactive reaction of donor lymphocytes against malignant cells of the recipient named as 'graft-versus-leukemia' or 'graft-versus-tumor' (GVL, GVT) effect. However, besides the beneficial GVL effect, alloreactive reaction attacks normal cells and provokes the deleterious 'graft-versus-host disease' (GVHD) which represents the major limitation of allo-SCT. Current trials have focused on a dual goal: augmentation of GVL and complete abolishment of GVHD. From a theoretical point of view complete dissociation of GVL from GVHD can occur by selecting antigenic targets present on malignant and absent from normal cells. Hematopoietic tissue-restricted minor histocompatibility antigens and leukemia or tumor-associated antigens are ideal candidates for tumor-targeted immunotherapy. Other options for inducing anti-tumor immunity in the absence of GVHD are natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy, amplification of immune responses by using monoclonal antibodies, and bispecific T and NK-cell engagers. Genetically modified immune effectors such as T-cells armed with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) or transduced with T-cell receptors with anti-tumor specificity are another exciting field of immunotherapy against malignancies.","['Tsirigotis, Panagiotis', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Tsirigotis P', 'Shimoni A', 'Nagler A']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Propaedeutic, Attikon General University Hospital, University of Athens , Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Med,Annals of medicine,8906388,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ipilimumab)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Ipilimumab', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/07853890.2014.918463 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Med. 2014 Sep;46(6):384-96. doi: 10.3109/07853890.2014.918463.

We describe a case of HS in an 8-year-old female who was successfully treated with an abbreviated leukemia chemotherapy regimen.","['Heath, Jessica L', 'Burgett, Shelly E', 'Gaca, Ana M', 'Jaffe, Ronald', 'Wechsler, Daniel S']","['Heath JL', 'Burgett SE', 'Gaca AM', 'Jaffe R', 'Wechsler DS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2014/06/04 06:00,2014/11/07 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2013/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25100 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Oct;61(10):1874-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25100.

We compared this association with that seen after nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning in 241 adults receiving NMA (n=86) or MA (n=155) HCT for AML in first remission with pre-HCT bone marrow aspirates assessed by flow cytometry. NMA patients were older and had more comorbidities and secondary leukemias. Three-year relapse estimates were 28% and 57% for MRD(neg) and MRD(pos) NMA patients, and 22% and 63% for MA patients. Three-year overall survival (OS) estimates were 48% and 41% for MRD(neg) and MRD(pos) NMA patients and 76% and 25% for MA patients. This similar OS after NMA conditioning was largely accounted for by higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) in MRD(neg) (30%) compared with MRD(pos) (10%) patients, whereas the reverse was found for MRD(neg) (7%) and MRD(pos) (23%) MA patients. A statistically significant difference between MA and NMA patients in the association of MRD with OS (P<0.001) and NRM (P=0.002) but not relapse (P=0.17) was confirmed. After adjustment, the risk of relapse was 4.51 times (P<0.001) higher for MRD(pos) patients. These data indicate that the negative impact of MRD on relapse risk is similar after NMA and MA conditioning.","['Walter, R B', 'Gyurkocza, B', 'Storer, B E', 'Godwin, C D', 'Pagel, J M', 'Buckley, S A', 'Sorror, M L', 'Wood, B L', 'Storb, R', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Sandmaier, B M']","['Walter RB', 'Gyurkocza B', 'Storer BE', 'Godwin CD', 'Pagel JM', 'Buckley SA', 'Sorror ML', 'Wood BL', 'Storb R', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Sandmaier BM']","['1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA [3] Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Residency Program, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Residency Program, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', '*Remission Induction', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014173 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.173 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):137-44. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.173.

A hallmark of MF is dysregulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway that has led to the development of JAK inhibitors targeting this pathway. Calreticulin gene mutations have recently been identified in JAK2 mutation-negative patients with MF. Identification of JAK inhibitor resistance and broad contributions to MF disease pathogenesis from epigenetic deregulators, pathways that work in concert with JAK/STAT (that is, mammalian target of rapamycin/AKT/phosphoinositide 3-kinase, RAS/RAF/MEK, PIM kinase), fibrosis-promoting factors and the MF megakaryocyte, suggest that numerous options may be partnered with a JAK inhibitor. Therefore, we will discuss logical and potential partners for combination therapies for the treatment of patients with MF.","['Stein, B L', 'Swords, R', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Giles, F']","['Stein BL', 'Swords R', 'Hochhaus A', 'Giles F']","['1] Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA [2] Northwestern Medicine Developmental Therapeutics Institute, Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Northwestern Medicine Developmental Therapeutics Institute, Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014176 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.176 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Nov;28(11):2139-47. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.176.

The 4-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 43.2% (95% confidence interval (CI)=30.7-55.1%) and 67.2% (53.8-77.4%), respectively. A univariate analysis showed younger age (<90 days at diagnosis), central nervous system disease and poor response to initial prednisolone therapy significantly associated with poor prognosis (P<0.05). In a multivariate analysis, younger age at diagnosis tended to be associated with poor outcome (hazard ratio=1.969; 95% CI=0.903-4.291; P=0.088). Although the strategy of early use of HSCT effectively prevented early relapse and was feasible for infants with MLL-r ALL, the fact that substantial number of patients still relapsed even though transplanted in their first remission indicates the limited efficacy of allogeneic HSCT for infants with MLL-r ALL.

We hypothesized that allogeneic CAR-engineered CD45RA-negative T cells can control cancer and infection without the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We used CD19(+) MLL-rearranged leukemia as prototype because it is an aggressive and generally drug-resistant malignancy. CD45RA(-) cells that were transduced with anti-CD19 CAR containing 4-1BB and CD3zeta signaling domains effectively lysed MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines and primary blasts in vitro. In a disseminated leukemia mouse model, CAR(+)CD45RA(-) cells significantly reduced leukemia burdens and prolonged overall survival without GVHD. CAR(+) cells were sustainable in blood, and all the treated mice remained leukemia-free even after they were re-challenged with leukemia cells. Despite the transduction process, CD45RA(-) cells retained recall activity both in vitro and in vivo against human pathogens commonly found in cancer patients. In comparison with CD45RA(+) cells, CD45RA(-) cells showed less allogeneic activity in mixed leukocyte reactions and in mouse models. Thus, the use of CAR(+)CD45RA(-) cells can separate GVHD from graft-versus-malignancy effect and infection control. These cells should also be useful in nontransplant settings and may be administered as off-the-shelf third-party cells.","['Chan, W K', 'Suwannasaen, D', 'Throm, R E', 'Li, Y', 'Eldridge, P W', 'Houston, J', 'Gray, J T', 'Pui, C-H', 'Leung, W']","['Chan WK', 'Suwannasaen D', 'Throm RE', 'Li Y', 'Eldridge PW', 'Houston J', 'Gray JT', 'Pui CH', 'Leung W']","[""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Vector Laboratory, Department of Experimental Hematology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Human Application Laboratory, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Vector Laboratory, Department of Experimental Hematology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""1] Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA [2] Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""1] Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA [2] Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia/*blood/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",2014/06/04 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014174 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.174 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Feb;29(2):387-95. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.174.

Novel studies have shown that mutations in DNMT3A and IDH1/2 influence prognosis, indicating an increasing need to detect these mutations during routine laboratory analysis. DNA sequencing for the identification of these mutations is time-consuming and cost-intensive. This study aimed to establish rapid screening tests to identify mutations in DNMT3A and IDH1/2 that could be applied in routine laboratory procedures and that could influence initial patient management. METHODS: In this study we developed an endonuclease restriction method to identify the most common DNMT3A mutation (R882H) and an amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) to analyse IDH2 R140Q mutations. Furthermore, we compared these methods with HRM analysis and evaluated the latter for the detection of IDH1 mutations. RESULTS: Of 230 samples from patients with AML 30 (13%) samples had DNMT3A mutations, 16 (7%) samples had IDH2 R140Q mutations and 36 (16%) samples had IDH1 mutations. Sensitivity assays performed using serial dilutions of mutated DNA showed that ARMS analysis had a sensitivity of 4.5%, endonuclease restriction had a sensitivity of 0.05% and HRM analysis had a sensitivity of 5.9%-7.8% for detecting different mutations. HRM analysis was the best screening method to determine the heterogeneity of IDH1 mutations. Furthermore, for the identification of mutations in IDH2 and DNMT3A, endonuclease restriction and ARMS methods showed a perfect concordance (100%) with Sanger sequencing while HRM analysis showed a near-perfect concordance (approximately 98%). CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that all the developed methods were rapid, specific and easy to use and interpret. HRM analysis is the most timesaving and cost-efficient method to rapidly screen all the 3 genes at diagnosis in samples obtained from patients with AML. Endonuclease restriction and ARMS assays can be used separately or in combination with HRM analysis to obtain more reliable results. We propose that early screening of mutations in patients with AML having normal karyotype could facilitate risk stratification and improve treatment options.","['Berenstein, Rimma', 'Blau, Igor Wolfgang', 'Kar, Asiye', 'Cay, Ruhiye', 'Sindram, Annette', 'Seide, Claudia', 'Blau, Olga']","['Berenstein R', 'Blau IW', 'Kar A', 'Cay R', 'Sindram A', 'Seide C', 'Blau O']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumourimmunology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200 Berlin, Germany. rimma.berenstein@charite.de.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Recurrence and progression of disease occurs in 15-20% of standard risk and 30-40% of high risk patients. We analysed whether circumvention of chemoresistance pathways (drug export, DNA repair and apoptotic inhibition) can restore chemotherapeutic efficacy in a panel of MB cell lines. RESULTS: We demonstrate, by immunohistochemistry in patient tissue microarrays, that ABCB1 is expressed in 43% of tumours and is significantly associated with high-risk. We show that ABCB1, O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) and BCL2 family members are differentially expressed (by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and flow cytometry) in MB cell lines. Based on these findings, each pathway was then inhibited or circumvented and cell survival assessed using clonogenic assays. Inhibition of ABCB1 using vardenafil or verapamil resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity to etoposide in ABCB1-expressing MB cell lines. Sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) was MGMT-dependent, but two novel imidazotetrazine derivatives (N-3 sulfoxide and N-3 propargyl TMZ analogues) demonstrated >/=7 fold and >/=3 fold more potent cytotoxicity respectively compared to TMZ in MGMT-expressing MB cell lines. Activity of the BAD mimetic ABT-737 was BCL2A1 and ABCB1 dependent, whereas the pan-BCL2 inhibitor obatoclax was effective as a single cytotoxic agent irrespective of MCL1, BCL2, BCL2A1, or ABCB1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: ABCB1 is associated with high-risk MB; hence, inhibition of ABCB1 by vardenafil may represent a valid approach in these patients. Imidazotetrazine analogues of TMZ and the BH3 mimetic obatoclax are promising clinical candidates in drug resistant MB tumours expressing MGMT and BCL2 anti-apoptotic members respectively.","['Othman, Ramadhan T', 'Kimishi, Ioanna', 'Bradshaw, Tracey D', 'Storer, Lisa C D', 'Korshunov, Andrey', 'Pfister, Stefan M', 'Grundy, Richard G', 'Kerr, Ian D', 'Coyle, Beth']","['Othman RT', 'Kimishi I', 'Bradshaw TD', 'Storer LC', 'Korshunov A', 'Pfister SM', 'Grundy RG', 'Kerr ID', 'Coyle B']","[""Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre, Division of Child Health, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, QMC, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. beth.coyle@nottingham.ac.uk.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Acta Neuropathol Commun,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (MGMT protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*metabolism', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/*pathology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2014/06/03 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2051-5960-2-57 [pii]', '10.1186/2051-5960-2-57 [doi]']",epublish,Acta Neuropathol Commun. 2014 May 30;2:57. doi: 10.1186/2051-5960-2-57.,,20140530,,PMC4229867,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the adult mouse brain, multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone generate new neurons throughout life, and Mll1 is required for this postnatal neurogenesis but not for glial cell differentiation. Analysis of Mll1-dependent transcription may identify neurogenic genes useful for the direct reprogramming of astrocytes into neurons. OBJECTIVE: To identify Mll1-dependent transcriptional modules and to determine whether genes in the neurogenic modules can be used to directly reprogram astrocytes into neurons. METHODS: We performed gene coexpression module analysis on microarray data from differentiating wild-type and Mll1-deleted subventricular zone NSCs. Key developmental regulators belonging to the neurogenic modules were overexpressed in Mll1-deleted cells and cultured cortical astrocytes, and cell phenotypes were analyzed by immunocytochemistry and electrophysiology. RESULTS: Transcriptional modules that correspond to neurogenesis were identified in wild-type NSCs. Modules related to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were enriched in Mll1-deleted NSCs, consistent with their gliogenic potential. Overexpression of genes selected from the neurogenic modules enhanced the production of neurons from Mll1-deleted cells, and overexpression of Brn4 (Pou3f4) in nonneurogenic cortical astroglia induced their transdifferentiation into electrophysiologically active neurons. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that Mll1 is required for the expression of neurogenic but not gliogenic transcriptional modules in a multipotent NSC population and further indicate that specific Mll1-dependent genes may be useful for direct reprogramming strategies.","['Potts, Matthew B', 'Siu, Jason J', 'Price, James D', 'Salinas, Ryan D', 'Cho, Mathew J', 'Ramos, Alexander D', 'Hahn, Junghyun', 'Margeta, Marta', 'Oldham, Michael C', 'Lim, Daniel A']","['Potts MB', 'Siu JJ', 'Price JD', 'Salinas RD', 'Cho MJ', 'Ramos AD', 'Hahn J', 'Margeta M', 'Oldham MC', 'Lim DA']","['*Department of Neurological Surgery, double daggerThe Eli and Edythe Broad Institute of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, section signDepartment of Pathology, and paragraph signDepartment of Neurology University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California; and ||Surgical Service, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,"['0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (POU Domain Factors)', '147258-09-1 (Pou3f4 protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/deficiency/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/deficiency/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Neural Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Neurogenesis/physiology', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'POU Domain Factors/*physiology']",2014/06/03 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1227/NEU.0000000000000452 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurosurgery. 2014 Oct;75(4):472-82; discussion 482. doi: 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000452.,"['R01-NS073765/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 NS073173)/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD006505/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS073765/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 NS073173/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX000252/BX/BLRD VA/United States']",,,PMC4420187,,,,,['NIHMS684259'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the present study, we further investigated the detailed molecular mechanism of ATO-mediated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis; using HL-60 cells as a test model. Oxidative stress was assessed by spectrophotometric measurements of MDA and GSH levels while genotoxicity was determined by single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay). Apoptosis pathway was analyzed by Western blot analysis of Bax, Bcl2 and caspase 3 expression, as well as immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging of Bax and Cyt c translocation and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization. RESULTS: ATO significantly (p < 0.05) induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, and caspase 3 activity in HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. It also activated the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by significantly modulating (p < 0.05) the expression and translocation of apoptotic molecules and decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential in leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our research demonstrated that ATO induces mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in HL-60 cells. This apoptotic signaling is modulated via oxidative stress, DNA damage, and change in mitochondrial membrane potential, translocation and upregulation of apoptotic proteins leading programmed cell death.","['Kumar, Sanjay', 'Yedjou, Clement G', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Kumar S', 'Yedjou CG', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD-RCMI Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lunch Street, Box18750, Jackson, Mississippi MS39217, USA. paul.b.tchounwou@jsums.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2014/06/03 06:00,2014/08/27 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-33-42 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-33-42 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2014 May 16;33:42. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-33-42.,"['G12 MD007581/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'G12MD007581/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']",20140516,,PMC4049373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymorphisms in microRNA-binding sites (miRSNPs) in target genes may alter the strength of microRNA interaction with target transcripts thereby affecting protein levels. In this study we aimed at identifying miRSNPs associated with leukemia risk and assessing impact of these miRSNPs on miRNA binding to target transcripts. METHODS: We analyzed with specialized algorithms the 3' untranslated regions of 137 leukemia-associated genes and identified 111 putative miRSNPs, of which 10 were chosen for further investigation. We genotyped patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 87), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n = 140), childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 101) and healthy controls (n = 471). Association between SNPs and leukemia risk was calculated by estimating odds ratios in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. For miRSNPs that were associated with leukemia risk we performed luciferase reporter assays to examine whether they influence miRNA binding. RESULTS: Here we show that variant alleles of TLX1_rs2742038 and ETV6_rs1573613 were associated with increased risk of childhood ALL (OR (95% CI) = 3.97 (1.43-11.02) and 1.9 (1.16-3.11), respectively), while PML_rs9479 was associated with decreased ALL risk (OR = 0.55 (0.36-0.86). In adult myeloid leukemias we found significant associations between the variant allele of PML_rs9479 and decreased AML risk (OR = 0.61 (0.38-0.97), and between variant alleles of IRF8_ rs10514611 and ARHGAP26_rs187729 and increased CML risk (OR = 2.4 (1.12-5.15) and 1.63 (1.07-2.47), respectively). Moreover, we observed a significant trend for an increasing ALL and CML risk with the growing number of risk genotypes with OR = 13.91 (4.38-44.11) for carriers of >/=3 risk genotypes in ALL and OR = 4.9 (1.27-18.85) for carriers of 2 risk genotypes in CML. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that the C allele of ARHGAP26_rs187729 creates an illegitimate binding site for miR-18a-3p, while the A allele of PML_rs9479 enhances binding of miR-510-5p and the C allele of ETV6_rs1573613 weakens binding of miR-34c-5p and miR-449b-5p. CONCLUSIONS: Our study implicates that microRNA-binding site polymorphisms modulate leukemia risk by interfering with the miRNA-mediated regulation. Our findings underscore the significance of variability in 3' untranslated regions in leukemia.","['Dzikiewicz-Krawczyk, Agnieszka', 'Macieja, Anna', 'Maly, Ewa', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska, Danuta', 'Mosor, Maria', 'Fichna, Marta', 'Strauss, Ewa', 'Nowak, Jerzy']","['Dzikiewicz-Krawczyk A', 'Macieja A', 'Maly E', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D', 'Mosor M', 'Fichna M', 'Strauss E', 'Nowak J']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479 Poznan, Poland. krawczyk@man.poznan.pl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2014/06/03 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-7-43 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-7-43 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Jun 2;7:43. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-7-43.,,20140602,,PMC4059877,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chryseobacterium indologenes is an uncommon human pathogen reported in hospital outbreaks in Taiwan and there have been some sporadic cases reported in Europe and in the USA mainly from immune-suppressed patients. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes a 42-year-old woman of Wolofa ethnicity who was hospitalized in our Department of Internal Medicine in a Senegalese university teaching hospital, with acute leukemia who died of severe sepsis 10 days following her hospitalization. A strain of Chryseobacterium indologenes isolated from her urine sample was resistant to several beta-lactams including ampicillin (minimum inhibitory concentrations >/= 256 mug/mL), cefotaxime (minimum inhibitory concentrations 32 mug/mL) and imipenem (minimum inhibitory concentrations >/= 32 mug/mL), whereas it was susceptible to piperacillin (minimum inhibitory concentrations 16 mug/mL), cefepime (minimum inhibitory concentrations 4 mug/mL), ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentrations 4 mug/mL), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (minimum inhibitory concentrations </= 0.25 mug/mL) and all tested quinolones including nalidixic acid (minimum inhibitory concentrations </= 2 mug/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Chryseobacterium indologenes although uncommon, is an important pathogen causing infection in hospitalized patients. The management of this infection needs better identification, drug susceptibility testing and monitoring of immunosuppressed patients with long hospitalizations.","['Omar, Arouna', 'Camara, Makhtar', 'Fall, Seynabou', 'Ngom-Cisse, Safietou', 'Fall, Becaye', 'Ba-Diallo, Awa', 'Diop-Ndiaye, Halimatou', 'Toure-Kane, Coumba', 'Mboup, Souleymane', 'Gaye-Diallo, Aissatou']","['Omar A', 'Camara M', 'Fall S', 'Ngom-Cisse S', 'Fall B', 'Ba-Diallo A', 'Diop-Ndiaye H', 'Toure-Kane C', 'Mboup S', 'Gaye-Diallo A']","['Laboratoire de Bacteriologie-Virologie, Universite Cheikh Anta DIOP, CHU Aristide Le Dantec, BP 7325 Dakar, Senegal. oarouna2@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chryseobacterium/*isolation & purification/physiology', '*Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Flavobacteriaceae Infections/complications/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications', 'Senegal', 'Sepsis/complications/*microbiology', 'Urinary Tract Infections/complications/*microbiology']",2014/06/03 06:00,2015/01/18 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-1947-8-138 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-8-138 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2014 May 6;8:138. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-8-138.,,20140506,,PMC4031897,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, the assignment of mouse genes to individual retroviral integration sites has been based on close proximity and expression patterns of annotated genes at target positions in the genome. We here employed next-generation RNA sequencing to map retroviral-mouse chimeric junctions genome-wide, and to identify local patterns of transcription activation in T-lymphomas induced by the murine leukemia gamma-retrovirus SL3-3. Moreover, to determine epigenetic integration preferences underlying long-range gene activation by retroviruses, the colocalization propensity with common epigenetic enhancer markers (H3K4Me1 and H3K27Ac) of 6,117 integrations derived from end-stage tumors of more than 2,000 mice was examined. RESULTS: We detected several novel mechanisms of retroviral insertional mutagenesis: bidirectional activation of mouse transcripts on opposite sides of a provirus including transcription of unannotated mouse sequence; sense/antisense-type activation of genes located on opposite DNA strands; tandem-type activation of distal genes that are positioned adjacently on the same DNA strand; activation of genes that are not the direct integration targets; combination-type insertional mutagenesis, in which enhancer activation, alternative chimeric splicing and retroviral promoter insertion are induced by a single retrovirus. We also show that irrespective of the distance to transcription start sites, the far majority of retroviruses in end-stage tumors colocalize with H3K4Me1 and H3K27Ac-enriched regions in murine lymphoid tissues. CONCLUSIONS: We expose novel retrovirus-induced host transcription activation patterns that reach beyond a single and nearest annotated gene target. Awareness of this previously undescribed layer of complexity may prove important for elucidation of adverse effects in retroviral-based gene therapies. We also show that wild-type gamma-retroviruses are frequently positioned at enhancers, suggesting that integration into regulatory regions is specific and also subject to positive selection for sustaining long-range gene activation in end-stage tumors. Altogether, this study should prove useful for extrapolating adverse outcomes of retroviral vector therapies, and for understanding fundamental cellular regulatory principles and retroviral biology.","['Sokol, Martin', 'Wabl, Matthias', 'Ruiz, Irene Rius', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Sokol M', 'Wabl M', 'Ruiz IR', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark. fsp@mb.au.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,,IM,"['Animals', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",2014/06/03 06:00,2015/03/05 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2013/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-11-36 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-11-36 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2014 May 19;11:36. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-11-36.,['R01 AI041570/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],20140519,,PMC4098794,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, not only the quality of the classification, but also its biological interpretation is important. This interpretation may be eased if interacting elements can be identified and visualized, something that requires appropriate tools and methods. RESULTS: We developed a new approach to detecting interactions in complex systems based on classification. Using rule-based classifiers, we previously proposed a rule network visualization strategy that may be applied as a heuristic for finding interactions. We now complement this work with Ciruvis, a web-based tool for the construction of rule networks from classifiers made of IF-THEN rules. Simulated and biological data served as an illustration of how the tool may be used to visualize and interpret classifiers. Furthermore, we used the rule networks to identify feature interactions, compared them to alternative methods, and computationally validated the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Rule networks enable a fast method for model visualization and provide an exploratory heuristic to interaction detection. The tool is made freely available on the web and may thus be used to aid and improve rule-based classification.","['Bornelov, Susanne', 'Marillet, Simon', 'Komorowski, Jan']","['Bornelov S', 'Marillet S', 'Komorowski J']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 751 24 Uppsala, Sweden. jan.komorowski@icm.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Classification/methods', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', '*Software']",2014/06/03 06:00,2014/08/12 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2013/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-15-139 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-15-139 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2014 May 12;15:139. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-139.,,20140512,,PMC4030460,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insights into tumour biology and biomarkers predictive of responses to chemotherapeutic drugs can also be gained from investigating xenograft models. As a first step towards examining the equivalence of epigenetic profiles between xenografts and primary tumours in paediatric leukaemia, we performed genome-scale DNA methylation and gene expression profiling on a panel of 10 paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) tumours that were stratified by prednisolone response. RESULTS: We found high correlations in DNA methylation and gene expression profiles between matching primary and xenograft tumour samples with Pearson's correlation coefficients ranging between 0.85 and 0.98. In order to demonstrate the potential utility of epigenetic analyses in BCP-ALL xenografts, we identified DNA methylation biomarkers that correlated with prednisolone responsiveness of the original tumour samples. Differential methylation of CAPS2, ARHGAP21, ARX and HOXB6 were confirmed by locus specific analysis. We identified 20 genes showing an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in association with prednisolone response. Pathway analysis of these genes implicated apoptosis, cell signalling and cell structure networks in prednisolone responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirm the stability of epigenetic and gene expression profiles of paediatric BCP-ALL propagated in mouse xenograft models. Further, our preliminary investigation of prednisolone sensitivity highlights the utility of mouse xenograft models for preclinical development of novel drug regimens with parallel investigation of underlying gene expression and epigenetic responses associated with novel drug responses.","['Wong, Nicholas C', 'Bhadri, Vivek A', 'Maksimovic, Jovana', 'Parkinson-Bates, Mandy', 'Ng, Jane', 'Craig, Jeff M', 'Saffery, Richard', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Wong NC', 'Bhadri VA', 'Maksimovic J', 'Parkinson-Bates M', 'Ng J', 'Craig JM', 'Saffery R', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, PO Box 81, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia. rlock@ccia.unsw.edu.au.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/06/03 06:00,2015/01/31 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-15-416 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-15-416 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2014 Jun 1;15:416. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-15-416.,,20140601,,PMC4057609,,,,,,,,"['GEO/GSE57491', 'GEO/GSE57581']",,,,,,,,,

Studies in adult AML have identified epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, associated with leukaemia subtype, age of onset and patient survival which highlights this heterogeneity. However, only limited DNA methylation studies have elucidated any associations in paediatric AML. METHODS: We interrogated DNA methylation on a cohort of paediatric AML FAB subtype M5 patients using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip, identifying a number of target genes with p <0.01 and Deltabeta >0.4 between leukaemic and matched remission (n = 20 primary leukaemic, n = 13 matched remission). Amongst those genes identified, we interrogate DLEU2 methylation using locus-specific SEQUENOM MassARRAY(R) EpiTYPER(R) and an increased validation cohort (n = 28 primary leukaemic, n = 14 matched remission, n = 17 additional non-leukaemic and cell lines). Following methylation analysis, expression studies were undertaken utilising the same patient samples for singleplex TaqMan gene and miRNA assays and relative expression comparisons. RESULTS: We identified differential DNA methylation at the DLEU2 locus, encompassing the tumour suppressor microRNA miR-15a/16-1 cluster. A number of HM450 probes spanning the DLEU2/Alt1 Transcriptional Start Site showed increased levels of methylation in leukaemia (average over all probes >60%) compared to disease-free haematopoietic cells and patient remission samples (<24%) (p < 0.001). Interestingly, DLEU2 mRNA down-regulation in leukaemic patients (p < 0.05) was independent of the embedded mature miR-15a/16-1 expression. To assess prognostic significance of DLEU2 DNA methylation, we stratified paediatric AML patients by their methylation status. A subset of patients recorded methylation values for DLEU2 akin to non-leukaemic specimens, specifically patients with sole trisomy 8 and/or chromosome 11 abnormalities. These patients also showed similar miR-15a/16-1 expression to non-leukaemic samples, and potential improved disease prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The DLEU2 locus and embedded miRNA cluster miR-15a/16-1 is commonly deleted in adult cancers and shown to induce leukaemogenesis, however in paediatric AML we found the region to be transcriptionally repressed. In combination, our data highlights the utility of interrogating DNA methylation and microRNA in combination with underlying genetic status to provide novel insights into AML biology.","['Morenos, Leah', 'Chatterton, Zac', 'Ng, Jane L', 'Halemba, Minhee S', 'Parkinson-Bates, Mandy', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Elwood, Ngaire', 'Saffery, Richard', 'Wong, Nicholas C']","['Morenos L', 'Chatterton Z', 'Ng JL', 'Halemba MS', 'Parkinson-Bates M', 'Mechinaud F', 'Elwood N', 'Saffery R', 'Wong NC']","['Cancer & Disease Epigenetics, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. leah.morenos@mcri.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DLEU2 lncRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Remission Induction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transferases', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/06/03 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-123 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-123 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 May 24;13:123. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-123.,['Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],20140524,,PMC4050407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, the effects of genetic mutations can cascade through within-cell signaling and regulatory networks and alter the behavior of cells, possibly leading to a wide variety of diseases. The typical approach to mitigating network perturbations is to consider the compensatory activation or deactivation of system components. Here, we propose a complementary approach wherein interactions are instead modified to alter key regulatory functions and prevent the network damage from triggering a deregulatory cascade. RESULTS: We implement this approach in a Boolean dynamic framework, which has been shown to effectively model the behavior of biological regulatory and signaling networks. We show that the method can stabilize any single state (e.g., fixed point attractors or time-averaged representations of multi-state attractors) to be an attractor of the repaired network. We show that the approach is minimalistic in that few modifications are required to provide stability to a chosen attractor and specific in that interventions do not have undesired effects on the attractor. We apply the approach to random Boolean networks, and further show that the method can in some cases successfully repair synchronous limit cycles. We also apply the methodology to case studies from drought-induced signaling in plants and T-LGL leukemia and find that it is successful in both stabilizing desired behavior and in eliminating undesired outcomes. Code is made freely available through the software package BooleanNet. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology introduced in this report offers a complementary way to manipulating node expression levels. A comprehensive approach to evaluating network manipulation should take an ""all of the above"" perspective; we anticipate that theoretical studies of interaction modification, coupled with empirical advances, will ultimately provide researchers with greater flexibility in influencing system behavior.","['Campbell, Colin', 'Albert, Reka']","['Campbell C', 'Albert R']","['Department of Physics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. cec220@psu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,['72S9A8J5GW (Abscisic Acid)'],IM,"['Abscisic Acid/pharmacology', 'Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/pathology', 'Plant Leaves/cytology/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2014/06/03 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-0509-8-53 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-0509-8-53 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2014 May 8;8:53. doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-8-53.,,20140508,,PMC4037934,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While these methods tend to filter out irrelevant genes and identify informative genes that contribute to a clustering solution, they are based on criteria that do not consider the potential interactive influence among individual genes. Motivated by ensemble clustering, there is a strong interest in leveraging the structure of gene networks for gene selection, so that the relationship information between genes can be effectively utilized, while the selected genes are expected to preserve all the possible clustering structures in the data. RESULTS: We present a new filter method that uses the gene connectivity in the gene co-expression network as the evaluation criteria for variable selection. The gene connectivity measures the importance of the genes in term of their expression similarity with others in the co-expression network. The hard threshold and soft threshold transformations are employed to construct the gene co-expression networks. Both simulation studies and real data analysis have shown that the network based on soft thresholding is more effective in selecting relevant variables and provides better clustering results compared to the hard thresholding transformation and two other canonical filter methods for variable selection. Furthermore, a new module analysis approach is proposed to reveal the higher order organization of the gene space, where the genes of a module share significant topological similarity and are associated with a consensus partition of the sample space. We demonstrate that the identified modules can lead to biologically meaningful sample partitions that might be missed by other methods. CONCLUSIONS: By leveraging the structure of gene co-expression network, first we propose a variable selection method that selects individual genes with top connectivity. Both simulation studies and real data application have demonstrated that our method has better performance in terms of the reliability of the selected genes and sample clustering results. In addition, we propose a module recovery method that can help discover novel sample partitions that might be hidden when performing clustering analyses using all available genes.

Etiological factors responsible for osteoporosis secondary to chronic illness include immobility, pubertal delay and other hormonal disturbances. Rarely, it can be a manifestation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Most of the reported bone fracture incidences associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia occur during the course of the chemotherapy, not at the point of the first symptoms of leukemic disease, as happened with the case presented here. CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old Asian Balinese boy presented with back pain. His anteroposterior pelvic radiograph showed osteoporotic bone. A bone age study revealed growth failure of his metacarpals, phalanges and sesamoid. His total bone mass density was 97% age-match. However, a peripheral blood smear showed normochromic anemia with thrombocytopenia. Immunophenotyping of his peripheral blood revealed no dominant markers, but a bone marrow aspiration confirmed a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis was the only manifestation of the child's underlying acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Leukemia was diagnosed when his bone marrow was found to contain more than 25% blasts. Because of leucopenia, the immunophenotype failed to reveal a dominant marker in this case, thus we were unable to classify the acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Salim, Hendra', 'Ariawati, Ketut', 'Suryawan, Wayan Bikin', 'Arimbawa, Made']","['Salim H', 'Ariawati K', 'Suryawan WB', 'Arimbawa M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Child Health, Medical Faculty of Udayana University, Sanglah Hospital, Kesehatan Street No, 1, Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia. misionarispelayanan@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,IM,"['Back Pain/etiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Osteoporosis/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/pathology']",2014/06/03 06:00,2014/12/20 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2013/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-1947-8-168 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-8-168 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2014 May 28;8:168. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-8-168.,,20140528,,PMC4077677,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: We propose new algorithms that process high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data to extract unnamed V(D)J junctions and gather them into clones for quantification. This analysis is based on a seed heuristic and is fast and scalable because in the first phase, no alignment is performed with germline database sequences. The algorithms were applied to TR gamma HTS data from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and also on data simulating hypermutations. Our methods identified the main clone, as well as additional clones that were not identified with standard protocols. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithms provide new insight into the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for leukemia, and also to the quantitative assessment of any immunological profile.

We and others have previously reported a vigorous acetylation of the p53 protein by nutlin-treatment. In this study we aimed to investigate the functional role of this p53 acetylation in nutlin-sensitivity, and further to explore if nutlin-induced protein acetylation in general could indicate novel targets for the enhancement of nutlin-based therapy. RESULTS: Nutlin-3 was found to enhance the acetylation of p53 in the human AML cell line MOLM-13 (wild type TP53) and in TP53 null cells transfected with wild type p53 cDNA. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with immunoprecipitation using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody and mass spectrometry analysis identified increased levels of acetylated Histone H2B, Hsp27 and Hsp90 in MOLM-13 cells after nutlin-treatment, accompanied by downregulation of total levels of Hsp27 and Hsp90. Intracellular levels of heat shock proteins Hsp27, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70 and Hsp90alpha were correlated to nutlin-sensitivity for primary AML cells (n = 40), and AML patient samples with low sensitivity to nutlin-3 tended to express higher levels of heat shock proteins than more responsive samples. Combination therapy of nutlin-3 and Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin demonstrated synergistic induction of apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary AML cells. Finally, TP53 null cells transfected with a p53 acetylation defective mutant demonstrated decreased heat shock protein acetylation and sensitivity to nutlin-3 compared to wild type p53 expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results demonstrate that nutlin-3 induces acetylation of p53, histones and heat shock proteins, and indicate that p53 acetylation status and the levels of heat shock proteins may participate in modulation of nutlin-3 sensitivity in AML.","['Haaland, Ingvild', 'Opsahl, Jill A', 'Berven, Frode S', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Fredly, Hanne K', 'Haugse, Ragnhild', 'Thiede, Bernd', 'McCormack, Emmet', 'Lain, Sonia', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Haaland I', 'Opsahl JA', 'Berven FS', 'Reikvam H', 'Fredly HK', 'Haugse R', 'Thiede B', 'McCormack E', 'Lain S', 'Bruserud O', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen N-5021, Norway. bjorn.gjertsen@med.uib.no.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/06/03 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-116 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-116 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 May 21;13:116. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-116.,,20140521,,PMC4032636,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RCAS1 is reportedly expressed in a membranous pattern on tumor cell or soluble one in serum of patients. The aim of this study was to investigate expression patterns of RCAS1 and the effect on apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. METHODS: In four kinds of OSCC cell lines (HSC-2, HSC-3, SQUU-A, and SQUU-B), RCAS1 mRNAs and proteins were determined by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Membranous RCAS1 was determined by flow cytometry. Culture supernatants were analyzed for detection of soluble RCAS1 by dot blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Apoptotic ability of RCAS1 on the erythroid leukemia cell line K562 with the putative receptor was evaluated by flow cytometry in co-culture with highly metastatic SQUU-B, with knocked-down RCAS1 cells or in a no-cell contact condition. RESULTS: RCAS1 mRNA and proteins were expressed in all of OSCC cell lines. Membranous pattern were expressed in all cell lines, while soluble pattern was detected in all supernatants. RCAS1 mRNA, membranous and soluble RCAS1 were significantly seen in SQUU-B more than the other 3 cell lines (P < 0.05). K562 apoptosis was induced in co-culture with each of all cell lines, particularly with SQUU-B. Apoptosis was markedly reduced in co-culture with RCAS1 knockdown cells, but was induced in co-culture without cell contract of SQUU-B. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that RCAS1 has an apoptotic function via membranous/soluble expression pattern in OSCC cells. RCAS1 may thus affect tumor escape from immune surveillance in OSCC by inducing apoptosis.","['Tanaka, Hideaki', 'Toyoshima, Takeshi', 'Sonoda, Kenzo', 'Kitamura, Ryoji', 'Sasaguri, Masaaki', 'Kawano, Shintaro', 'Matsubara, Ryota', 'Goto, Yuichi', 'Nakamura, Seiji']","['Tanaka H', 'Toyoshima T', 'Sonoda K', 'Kitamura R', 'Sasaguri M', 'Kawano S', 'Matsubara R', 'Goto Y', 'Nakamura S']","['Division of Maxillofacial Diagnostic and Surgical Sciences, Section of Oral and Maxillofacial Oncology, Faculty of Dental Science, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan. takesea@dent.kyushu-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (EBAG9 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mouth Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Tumor Escape']",2014/06/03 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-12-112 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-12-112 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2014 May 6;12:112. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-12-112.,,20140506,,PMC4017709,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent phase II trials demonstrated that single agent arsenic trioxide was poorly effective against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which might be due to drug resistance. METHODS: Mutation detection of p53 gene in arsenic trioxide resistant HCC cell lines was performed. The therapeutic effects of arsenic trioxide and Nutlin-3 on HCC were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. A series of experiments including MTT, apoptosis assays, co-Immunoprecipitation, siRNA transfection, lentiviral infection, cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchy-mal transition (EMT) assays were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: The acquisition of p53 mutation contributed to arsenic trioxide resistance and enhanced metastatic potential of HCC cells. Mutant p53 (Mutp53) silence could re-sensitize HCC resistant cells to arsenic trioxide and inhibit the metastatic activities, while mutp53 overexpression showed the opposite effects. Neither arsenic trioxide nor Nutlin-3 could exhibit obvious effects against arsenic trioxide resistant HCC cells, while combination of them showed significant effects. Nutlin-3 can not only increase the intracellular arsenicals through inhibition of p-gp but also promote the p73 activation and mutp53 degradation mediated by arsenic trioxide. In vivo experiments indicated that Nutlin-3 can potentiate the antitumor activities of arsenic trioxide in an orthotopic hepatic tumor model and inhibit the metastasis to lung. CONCLUSIONS: Acquisitions of p53 mutations contributed to the resistance of HCC to arsenic trioxide. Nutlin-3 could overcome arsenic trioxide resistance and inhibit tumor metastasis through p73 activation and promoting mutant p53 degradation mediated by arsenic trioxide.","['Zheng, Tongsen', 'Yin, Dalong', 'Lu, Zhaoyang', 'Wang, Jiabei', 'Li, Yuejin', 'Chen, Xi', 'Liang, Yingjian', 'Song, Xuan', 'Qi, Shuyi', 'Sun, Boshi', 'Xie, Changming', 'Meng, Xianzhi', 'Pan, Shangha', 'Liu, Jiaren', 'Jiang, Hongchi', 'Liu, Lianxin']","['Zheng T', 'Yin D', 'Lu Z', 'Wang J', 'Li Y', 'Chen X', 'Liang Y', 'Song X', 'Qi S', 'Sun B', 'Xie C', 'Meng X', 'Pan S', 'Liu J', 'Jiang H', 'Liu L']","['Key Laboratory of Hepatosplenic Surgery, Ministry of Education, Department of General Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, #23 Youzheng Street, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang Province, China. luzhaoyang112@yeah.net.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trp73 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2014/06/03 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-133 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-133 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 May 31;13:133. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-133.,,20140531,,PMC4046148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, MCIA simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis. RESULTS: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using MCIA, applied to two typical ""omics"" research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation RNA-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of RNA-sequencing data processed using RPKM had greater variance than that with MapSplice and RSEM. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. MCIA is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor ""omicade4"" package. CONCLUSION: We believe MCIA is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. MCIA provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.","['Meng, Chen', 'Kuster, Bernhard', 'Culhane, Aedin C', 'Gholami, Amin Moghaddas']","['Meng C', 'Kuster B', 'Culhane AC', 'Gholami AM']","['Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technische Universitat Munchen, Freising, Germany. aedin@jimmy.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Genomics/*methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/chemistry/genetics', 'Proteome/genetics']",2014/06/03 06:00,2014/11/18 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-15-162 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-15-162 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2014 May 29;15:162. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-162.,"['1RC4CA156551-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1U19CA148065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20140529,,PMC4053266,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of combination treatment with imatinib and cryptotanshinone (CPT) in CML cells. Cotreatment with imatinib and CPT showed a significant synergistic killing effect in both imatinib sensitive and resistant CML cell lines, as well as primary CML cells. Furthermore, combination treatment induced apoptosis significantly, as indicated by increases in apoptotic cell fraction and activities of proapoptotic proteins. Subsequent studies revealed that CPT significantly inhibited Bcr/Abl protein expression, as well as phosphorylation expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which are critical mediators of Bcr/Abl transformation. Furthermore, CPT in combination with imatinib dramatically decreased the activity of the Bcr/Abl pathway in both K562 and K562-R cells. Our results demonstrated that CPT increased imatinib-induced apoptosis in a Bcr/Abl dependent manner, suggesting a novel strategy for the treatment of CML.","['Ge, Yuqing', 'Yang, Bo', 'Xu, Xiaofeng', 'Dai, Qun', 'Chen, Zhe', 'Cheng, Rubin']","['Ge Y', 'Yang B', 'Xu X', 'Dai Q', 'Chen Z', 'Cheng R']",['Zhejiang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '5E9SXT166N (cryptotanshinone)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/06/03 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.928934 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015 Mar;56(3):730-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.928934.

Therefore, this GE-based risk score represents a powerful tool for risk stratification and outcome prediction of CLL patients and could thus be used to guide clinical and therapeutic decisions prospectively.","['Bou Samra, Elias', 'Klein, Bernard', 'Commes, Therese', 'Moreaux, Jerome']","['Bou Samra E', 'Klein B', 'Commes T', 'Moreaux J']","['INSERM, U1040, F-34197, Institute of Research in Biotherapy, CHU Montpellier, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34285 Montpellier Cedex, France.', 'INSERM, U1040, F-34197, Institute of Research in Biotherapy, CHU Montpellier, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34285 Montpellier Cedex, France ; CHU Montpellier, Institute of Research in Biotherapy, Montpellier, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34285 Montpellier, France ; Universite Montpellier 1, UFR Medecine, Montpellier, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34285 Montpellier, France.', 'INSERM, U1040, F-34197, Institute of Research in Biotherapy, CHU Montpellier, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34285 Montpellier Cedex, France ; Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier 2, 2 Place Eugene Bataillon, 34095 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.', 'INSERM, U1040, F-34197, Institute of Research in Biotherapy, CHU Montpellier, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34285 Montpellier Cedex, France ; CHU Montpellier, Institute of Research in Biotherapy, Montpellier, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34285 Montpellier, France ; Universite Montpellier 1, UFR Medecine, Montpellier, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34285 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1)', '0 (T Cell Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (TCF7 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1', '*Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'T Cell Transcription Factor 1/biosynthesis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/03 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2013/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/423174 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:423174. doi: 10.1155/2014/423174.

We aimed to gain direct insight into the angiogenic process in lymph nodes involved by CLL, focusing on proangiogenic cytokines and microvessel morphometry. The tissue levels of VEGF, Th-2 cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, IL-8 receptor CXCR2, and tyrosine p-STAT-3/SOCS-3 axis modulating cytokine expression were evaluated immunohistochemically in 62 CLL/SLL cases. Microvascular characteristics were evaluated by image analysis. Results were analyzed with regard to clinicopathological characteristics. Proliferation centers (PCs) were less well vascularised compared to non-PC areas. IL-8 and CXCR2 expression was distinctly uncommon as opposed to IL-6, VEGF and SOCS-3, which were detected in the vast majority of cases. The latter two molecule expressions were more pronounced in the PCs in approximately 40% of the cases. p-STAT-3 immunoreactivity was recorded in 66.67% of the cases with a predilection for PCs. Microvessel morphometry was unrelated to proangiogenic cytokines, p-STAT-3, SOCS-3, or survival. Microvascular caliber and VEGF expression were higher in Binet stage A, whereas IL-6 expression was higher in stage C.

Those patients harboring mutations in the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase have a particularly poor prognosis; however, significant excitement has been generated by the emergence of a variety of targeted inhibitors capable of suppressing FLT3 signaling in vivo. Here we will review results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials evaluating both first- and second-generation FLT3 inhibitors. Early FLT3 inhibitors (including sunitinib, midostaurin, and lestaurtinib) demonstrated significant promise in preclinical models of FLT3 mutant AML. Unfortunately, many of these compounds failed to achieve robust and sustained FLT3 inhibition in early clinical trials, at best resulting in only transient decreases in peripheral blast counts. These results have prompted the development of second-generation FLT3 inhibitors, epitomized by the novel agent quizartinib. These second-generation inhibitors have demonstrated enhanced FLT3 specificity and have been generally well tolerated in early clinical trials. Several FLT3 inhibitors have reached phase III clinical trials, and a variety of phase I/II trials exploring a role for these novel compounds in conjunction with conventional chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are ongoing. Finally, molecular insights provided by FLT3 inhibitors have shed light upon the variety of mechanisms underlying the acquisition of resistance and have provided a rationale supporting the use of combinatorial regimens with other emerging targeted therapies.","['Wander, Seth A', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Fathi, Amir T']","['Wander SA', 'Levis MJ', 'Fathi AT']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Zero Emerson Place, Suite 118, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,2014/06/03 06:00,2014/06/03 06:01,['2014/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620714532123 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620714532123 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2014 Jun;5(3):65-77. doi: 10.1177/2040620714532123.,,,,PMC4031904,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'quizartinib', 'targeted therapies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cure for cancer is like the Holy Grail since most of the existing treatments are not effective enough to provide full protection from this disease. In recent years the burgeoning of sophisticated genomic, proteomic and bioinformatics techniques has made it possible for us to get a glimpse of the intricate interplay of numerous cellular genes and regulatory genetic elements that are responsible for the manifestation of cancerous phenotypes. With the use of modern genomic technologies we are now beginning to understand the enormous complexity of cancer. However there are few success stories as far as the treatment of cancer is concerned. For instance the treatments of leukemia and lymphoma have been established and proved to be satisfactory. Despite occasional successes the treatment for most cancers is still a long way from reality.

How these proteins are detected and degraded is not well understood. Here we show that PML/TRIM19 and the SUMO-dependent ubiquitin ligase RNF4 act together to promote the degradation of misfolded proteins in the mammalian cell nucleus. PML selectively interacts with misfolded proteins through distinct substrate recognition sites and conjugates these proteins with the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) through its SUMO ligase activity. SUMOylated misfolded proteins are then recognized and ubiquitinated by RNF4 and are subsequently targeted for proteasomal degradation. We further show that PML deficiency exacerbates polyglutamine (polyQ) disease in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1). These findings reveal a mammalian system that removes misfolded proteins through sequential SUMOylation and ubiquitination and define its role in protection against protein-misfolding diseases.,"['Guo, Lili', 'Giasson, Benoit I', 'Glavis-Bloom, Alex', 'Brewer, Michael D', 'Shorter, James', 'Gitler, Aaron D', 'Yang, Xiaolu']","['Guo L', 'Giasson BI', 'Glavis-Bloom A', 'Brewer MD', 'Shorter J', 'Gitler AD', 'Yang X']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with outpatients from three haematology clinics in Australia. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of haematological cancer were approached by a research assistant while waiting for their appointment and invited to participate in the survey. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and self-reported demographic, disease and treatment characteristics. RESULTS: Questionnaires from 304 participants were returned. Twenty-seven percent of patients reported anxiety and 17% reported depression. Specifically, 15% reported anxiety without depression, 5% reported depression without anxiety, and 12% reported comorbid anxiety and depression. Participants who had to relocate to receive treatment had almost three times the odds of reporting anxiety and/or depression compared to those who did not have to move. Former smokers also had significantly higher odds of reporting anxiety and/or depression. LIMITATIONS: The HADS is likely to have produced some false positives and false negatives when compared with gold standard structured clinical interviews for assessing psychological morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 20% of haematological cancer patients attending outpatient clinics may experience clinically significant levels of anxiety and/or depression. Providing additional tailored support to patients who have had to relocate for treatment, and to former smokers, may help to reduce anxiety and depression among these subgroups.","['Clinton-McHarg, Tara', 'Carey, Mariko', 'Sanson-Fisher, Rob', 'Tzelepis, Flora', 'Bryant, Jamie', 'Williamson, Anna']","['Clinton-McHarg T', 'Carey M', 'Sanson-Fisher R', 'Tzelepis F', 'Bryant J', 'Williamson A']","['Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.

Donor selection in these diseases is crucial, given that transplanted cells can mediate not only the desired graft-versus-leukemia effect but also graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Here, we demonstrate that in the absence of NKp46, a major killer receptor expressed by human and mouse natural killer (NK) cells, GVHD is greatly exacerbated, resulting in rapid mortality of the transplanted animals because of infection with commensal bacteria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the exacerbated GVHD is the result of an altered ability of immune cells to respond to stimulation by immature dendritic cells. Because high and low expression of NKp46 on NK cells is observed in different individuals, our data indicate that choosing NKp46-high donors for the treatment of different hematologic malignancies might lead to better tumor eradication while minimizing GVHD.","['Ghadially, Hormas', 'Ohana, Meir', 'Elboim, Moran', 'Gazit, Roi', 'Gur, Chamutal', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mandelboim, Ofer']","['Ghadially H', 'Ohana M', 'Elboim M', 'Gazit R', 'Gur C', 'Nagler A', 'Mandelboim O']","['The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, IMRIC, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer 52621, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, IMRIC, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, IMRIC, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, IMRIC, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer 52621, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, IMRIC, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.

However, the characterization of subclones in mixed-cell populations is computationally challenging due to the short length of sequence reads that are generated by current sequencing technologies. Here, we report cloneHD, a probabilistic algorithm for the performance of subclone reconstruction from data generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing: read depth, B-allele counts at germline heterozygous loci, and somatic mutation counts. The algorithm can exploit the added information present in correlated longitudinal or multiregion samples and takes into account correlations along genomes caused by events such as copy-number changes. We apply cloneHD to two case studies: a breast cancer sample and time-resolved samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where we demonstrate that monitoring the response of a patient to therapy regimens is feasible.

However, exogenous expression of pluripotency factors raised concerns for clinical applications. Here, we show that iPS-like cells (iPSLCs) were generated from mouse somatic cells in two steps with small molecule compounds. In the first step, stable intermediate cells were generated from mouse astrocytes by Bmi1. These cells called induced epiblast stem cell (EpiSC)-like cells (iEpiSCLCs) are similar to EpiSCs in terms of expression of specific markers, epigenetic state, and ability to differentiate into three germ layers. In the second step, treatment with MEK/ERK and GSK3 pathway inhibitors in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor resulted in conversion of iEpiSCLCs into iPSLCs that were similar to mESCs, suggesting that Bmi1 is sufficient to reprogram astrocytes to partially reprogrammed pluripotency.

On day 16, he developed septic shock, and subsequently, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). After adding vancomycin, micafungin and high-dose methylprednisolone (mPSL) to his treatment regimen, these manifestations subsided. On day 22, he received hemodialysis for drug-induced acute renal failure. On day 24, he developed acute pancreatitis possibly due to mPSL; the following day he had generalized seizures, and was intubated. Cerebrospinal fluid findings were normal. Brain MRI revealed hyperintense signals on FLAIR images and increased apparent diffusion coefficient values in the sub-cortical and deep white matter areas of the bilateral temporal and occipital lobes, indicative of vasogenic edema. Thus, we diagnosed PRES. Blood pressure, seizures and volume status were controlled, with MRI findings showing improvement by day 42. He was extubated on day 32 and discharged on day 49 without complications.

We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome. METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001). Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P=0.005). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001). An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.

Moreover, many novel drugs are currently under evaluation for rapid approval or have been approved by regulatory agencies, further broadening the available therapeutic armamentarium for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The use of novel biological and genetic parameters combined with a careful clinical evaluation allows us to dissect some of the heterogeneity of the disease and to distinguish patients with a very mild onset and course, who often will not need any treatment, from those with an intermediate prognosis and a third group with a very aggressive course (high-risk leukemia). On this background, it becomes increasingly challenging to select the right treatment strategy.

This clone leads to a full malignant tumor through additional mutations and selection processes. Strikingly, the best-documented human model of early oncogenesis, i.e., transient myeloproliferative disorder followed by acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) in infants with Down syndrome (DS, or trisomy 21), exhibits important discrepancies with the SMT. Somatic mutations in megakaryocytic precursors occur at least 100,000 times more frequently in the GATA1 gene in fetuses with DS compared to the general population. Further, mutations are limited to GATA1 only; the general mutation rate does not significantly differ between individuals with DS and euploid individuals. Importantly, the mutations are also lineage-specific, occurring only in the megakaryocytic lineage, and proliferative anomalies of the megakaryocytic lineage are observed before the occurrence of GATA1 mutations. Thus, GATA1 mutations in fetuses with DS cannot be random events occurring in normal cells. Here, transcription-associated mutagenesis is proposed as the mechanism by which the earliest mutations of AMKL occur in DS. Transcription-associated mutagenesis is observed in non-dividing cells when a gene is over-expressed. The over-expression of GATA1 in the megakaryocytic lineage in DS fetal liver cells is proposed to be the cause of targeted GATA1 somatic mutations. As transcription-associated mutagenesis is a universal process, this mechanism may also apply to early oncogenesis in other situations, including after birth and following exposure to a carcinogenic agent. Thus, this hypothesis represents a new avenue for understanding and exploring oncogenesis in the context of DS and in other disease states.","['Satge, Daniel']",['Satge D'],"['Team Biostatistics Epidemiology Public Health, EA 2415, Oncodefi Project, University Institute for Clinical Research, Montpellier, France.

Chromosomal translocations, disrupting the Mll gene, lead to aggressive leukemia with poor prognosis. However, the functions of MLL in cellular processes like cell-cycle regulation are not well studied. Here we show that the MLL has a regulatory role during multiple phases of the cell cycle. RNAi-mediated knockdown reveals that MLL regulates S-phase progression and, proper segregation and cytokinesis during M phase. Using deletions and mutations, we narrow the cell-cycle regulatory role to the C subunit of MLL. Our analysis reveals that the transactivation domain and not the SET domain is important for the S-phase function of MLL. Surprisingly, disruption of MLL-WRAD interaction is sufficient to disrupt proper mitotic progression. These mitotic functions of WRAD are independent of SET domain of MLL and, therefore, define a new role of WRAD in subset of MLL functions.

They also cause D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria and Ollier and Maffucci syndromes. IDH1/2 mutations are associated with prolonged survival in glioma and in ICC, but not in AML. The reason for this is unknown. In their wild-type forms, IDH1 and IDH2 convert isocitrate and NADP(+) to alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) and NADPH. Missense mutations in the active sites of these enzymes induce a neo-enzymatic reaction wherein NADPH reduces alphaKG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). The resulting D-2HG accumulation leads to hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha degradation, and changes in epigenetics and extracellular matrix homeostasis. Such mutations also imply less NADPH production capacity. Each of these effects could play a role in cancer formation. Here, we provide an overview of the literature and discuss which downstream molecular effects are likely to be the drivers of the oncogenic and survival-prolonging properties of IDH1/2 mutations. We discuss interactions between mutant IDH1/2 inhibitors and conventional therapies. Understanding of the biochemical consequences of IDH1/2 mutations in oncogenesis and survival prolongation will yield valuable information for rational therapy design: it will tell us which oncogenic processes should be blocked and which ""survivalogenic"" effects should be retained.","['Molenaar, Remco J', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'van Noorden, Cornelis J F', 'Bleeker, Fonnet E']","['Molenaar RJ', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Maciejewski JP', 'van Noorden CJ', 'Bleeker FE']","['Department of Cell Biology & Histology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

AF1Q is highly regulated during hematopoietic progenitor differentiation and development but its regulatory mechanism has not been defined clearly. In the present study, we used pharmacological and genetic approaches to influence chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and explored the degradation mechanism of AF1Q. Pharmacological inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, such as chloroquine, increased AF1Q levels, whereas activators of CMA, including 6-aminonicotinamide and nutrient starvation, decreased AF1Q levels. AF1Q interacts with HSPA8 and LAMP-2A, which are core components of the CMA machinery. Knockdown of HSPA8 or LAMP-2A increased AF1Q protein levels, whereas overexpression showed the opposite effect. Using an amino acid deletion AF1Q mutation plasmid, we identified that AF1Q had a KFERQ-like motif which was recognized by HSPA8 for CMA-dependent proteolysis. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that AF1Q can be degraded in lysosomes by CMA.","['Li, Peng', 'Ji, Min', 'Lu, Fei', 'Zhang, Jingru', 'Li, Huanjie', 'Cui, Taixing', 'Li Wang, Xing', 'Tang, Dongqi', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Li P', 'Ji M', 'Lu F', 'Zhang J', 'Li H', 'Cui T', 'Li Wang X', 'Tang D', 'Ji C']","['Department of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, P.R.

This specific metabolism gives tumor cells growing advantages besides the effect in increasing anabolism. One of these advantages is immune evasion mediated by a lower expression of the mayor histocompatibility complex class I molecules. The extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 regulates both mayor histocompatibility complex class I expression and metabolic activity. However, the mechanisms underlying are largely unknown. We show here that extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 regulates the transcription of the NADH(+)-dependent histone deacetylase silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Sirtuin 1) in leukemic Jurkat T cells. This involves the activation of the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2 and its binding to the sirt1 promoter. In addition, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 is required for T cell receptor-induced and oxidative stress-induced full Sirtuin 1 expression. Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 induces the expression of promoters containing the antioxidant response elements through a Sirtuin 1-dependent pathway. On the other hand, down modulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 expression impairs the anti-oxidant response. Notably, the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 inhibitor BIX02189 induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia tumor cells without affecting T cells from healthy donors. Our results unveil a new pathway that modulates metabolism in tumor cells. This pathway represents a promising therapeutic target in cancers with deep metabolic layouts such as acute myeloid leukemia.","['Lopez-Royuela, Nuria', 'Rathore, Moeez G', 'Allende-Vega, Nerea', 'Annicotte, Jean-Sebastien', 'Fajas, Lluis', 'Ramachandran, Bindu', 'Gulick, Tod', 'Villalba, Martin']","['Lopez-Royuela N', 'Rathore MG', 'Allende-Vega N', 'Annicotte JS', 'Fajas L', 'Ramachandran B', 'Gulick T', 'Villalba M']","['INSERM, U1040, Universite de Montpellier 1, UFR Medecine, 80 av.

Vav1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, whereas Vav2 and Vav3 are ubiquitously distributed in almost all human tissues. All three Vav proteins contain conserved structural motifs and associate with a variety of cellular activities including proliferation, migration, and survival. Previous observation with Jurkat leukemia T cells showed that Vav1 possessed anti-apoptotic activity by enhancing Bcl-2 transcription. However the mechanism has not been unveiled. Here, we explored the effectors of Vav1 in promoting Bcl-2 expression in Jurkat cells and revealed that Rac2-Akt was specifically evoked by the expression of Vav1, but not Vav2 or Vav3. Although all three Vav isoforms existed in Jurkat cells, Rac2 was distinguishably activated by Vav1 and that led to enhanced Bcl-2 expression and cell survival. Akt was modulated downstream of Vav1-Rac2, and the activation of Akt was indispensable in the enhanced transcription of Bcl-2. Intriguingly, neither Vav2 nor Vav3 was able to activate Rac2-Akt pathway as determined by gene silencing approach. Our data illustrated a unique role of Vav1 in T leukemia survival by selectively triggering Rac2-Akt axis and elevating the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2.","['Wan, Ya-Juan', 'Yang, Yin', 'Leng, Qian-Li', 'Lan, Bei', 'Jia, Hui-Yan', 'Liu, Yao-Hui', 'Zhang, Cui-Zhu', 'Cao, Youjia']","['Wan YJ', 'Yang Y', 'Leng QL', 'Lan B', 'Jia HY', 'Liu YH', 'Zhang CZ', 'Cao Y']","['Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin 300071, PR China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin 300071, PR China.

Malignant T cells such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) express beta1 integrins, which mediate their interactions with ECM. However, the role of these interactions in T-ALL malignancy is still poorly explored. In the present study, we investigated the effect of collagen; an abundant ECM, on T-ALL survival and migration. We found that collagen through alpha2beta1 integrin promotes the survival of T-ALL cell lines in the absence of growth factors. T-ALL cell survival by collagen is associated with reduced caspase activation and maintenance of Mcl-1 levels. Collagen activated both ERK and p38 MAPKs but only MAPK/ERK was required for collagen-induced T-ALL survival. However, we found that alpha2beta1 integrin promoted T-ALL migration via both ERK and p38. Together these data indicate that alpha2beta1 integrin signaling can represent an important signaling pathway in T-ALL pathogenesis and suggest that its blockade could be beneficial in T-ALL treatment.","['Naci, Dalila', 'Aoudjit, Fawzi']","['Naci D', 'Aoudjit F']","['Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec, Axe des maladies infectieuses et immunitaires, Departement de Microbiologie-Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec, Axe des maladies infectieuses et immunitaires, Departement de Microbiologie-Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.

This study compared outcomes of myeloablative (MA) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) transplants from HLA-matched sibling donors (MSD) for CLL. From 1995 to 2007, information regarding 297 CLL subjects was reported to the Center of International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research; of these, 163 underwent MA and 134 underwent RIC MSD HCT. The MA subjects underwent transplantation less often after 2000 and less commonly received antithymocyte globulin (4% versus 13%, P = .004) or prior antibody therapy (14% versus 53%; P < .001). RIC was associated with a greater likelihood of platelet recovery and less grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease compared with MA conditioning. One- and 5-year treatment-related mortality (TRM) were 24% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 16% to 33%) versus 37% (95% CI, 30% to 45%; P = .023), and 40% (95% CI, 29% to 51%) versus 54% (95% CI, 46% to 62%; P = .036), respectively, and the relapse/progression rates at 1 and 5 years were 21% (95% CI, 14% to 29%) versus 10% (95% CI, 6% to 15%; P = .020), and 35% (95% CI, 26% to 46%) versus 17% (95% CI, 12% to 24%; P = .003), respectively. MA conditioning was associated with better progression-free (PFS) (relative risk, .60; 95% CI, .37 to .97; P = .038) and 3-year survival in transplantations before 2001, but for subsequent years, RIC was associated with better PFS and survival (relative risk, 1.49 [95% CI, .92 to 2.42]; P = .10; and relative risk, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.11 to 3.13]; P = .019). Pretransplantation disease status was the most important predictor of relapse (P = .003) and PFS (P = .0007) for both forms of transplantation conditioning.

Fifty-five patients (76.3%) underwent peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization, after first consolidation, and 24 of 55 (44%) collected >3 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg. Among the 55 patients eligible for PBSC mobilization, 7 did not receive the planned treatment, 23 were allocated for ASCT, and 25 were allocated for GO on an intention-to-treat basis.

In order to independently validate these associations, we reexamined 58 candidate gene/regions previously reported to be associated with cervical cancer using the gene-based Adaptive Rank Truncated Product test in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1034 cervical cancer patients and 3948 controls from the Swedish population. Of the 58 gene/regions, 8 had a nominal P value < 0.05 [tumor necrosis factor (TNF), P = 5.0 x 10(-4); DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box helicase 1 [DDX1], P = 2.2 x 10(-3); exonuclease 1 [EXO1], P = 4.7 x 10(-3); excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group 1 [ERCC1], P = 0.020; transmembrane channel-like 6 and 8 genes [TMC6-TMC8], P = 0.023; secreted phosphoprotein 1 [SPP1], P = 0.028; v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 [ERBB2], P = 0.033 and chloride channel, voltage-sensitive 7 [CLCN7], P = 0.047). After correction for multiple testing, only TNF remained statistically significant (P = 0.028). Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are in nearly perfect linkage disequilibrium (rs2857602 and rs2844484) contributed most to the association with TNF. However, they are not independent from the previously reported associations within the MHC region. The very low number of previously reported associations with cervical cancer that replicate in the Swedish population underscore the need to apply more stringent criteria when reporting associations, including the prerequisite of replicating the association as part of the original study.","['Johanneson, Bo', 'Chen, Dan', 'Enroth, Stefan', 'Cui, Tao', 'Gyllensten, Ulf']","['Johanneson B', 'Chen D', 'Enroth S', 'Cui T', 'Gyllensten U']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, SciLifeLab Uppsala, Biomedical center, Uppsala University, Box 815, Uppsala 75108, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, SciLifeLab Uppsala, Biomedical center, Uppsala University, Box 815, Uppsala 75108, Sweden dan.chen@igp.uu.se.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, SciLifeLab Uppsala, Biomedical center, Uppsala University, Box 815, Uppsala 75108, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, SciLifeLab Uppsala, Biomedical center, Uppsala University, Box 815, Uppsala 75108, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, SciLifeLab Uppsala, Biomedical center, Uppsala University, Box 815, Uppsala 75108, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*genetics']",2014/06/01 06:00,2014/10/22 06:00,['2014/06/01 06:00'],"['2014/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['bgu125 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgu125 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2014 Sep;35(9):2084-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgu125.

Caspase9 (CASP9), an initiator caspase activated by mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway (intrinsic pathway), triggers cascade of effector caspases and executes apoptosis. Functional SNPs in CASP9 might influence the gene expression leading to altered apoptosis which confer the risk to AML. To test this hypothesis, we have analyzed four CASP9 gene polymorphisms [CASP9 - 1263A > G (rs4645978), CASP9 - 712C > T (rs4645981), CASP9 - 293_275del CGTGAGGTC AGTGCGGGGA (-293del) (rs4645982), and CASP9 Ex5 + 32G > A (rs1052576)] in 180 AML cases and 304 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We performed various statistical analyses to determine the potential interactions between these SNPs and AML. The study revealed that presence of G allele at CASP9 - 1263 position elevates the risk of AML 1.53-fold and CT/TT genotype at CASP9 - 712 position by 2.60-fold under dominant model of inheritance. Two CASP9 haplotypes, G-del(+)-C-A and G-del(+)-T-A, were found to be significantly associated with increased AML risk by 2.19- (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.09-4.39; p = 0.028) and 11.75-fold (95 % CI, 1.01-136.57; p = 0.05), respectively. Further, multidimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis had revealed single locus CASP9 - 712C > T SNP and four loci CASP9 - 1263A > G, CASP9 - 293del, CASP9 - 712C > T, and CASP9 Ex5 + 32G > A SNPs as highest predicting models for AML development. Our results revealed a significant association of two SNPs in CASP9 (-1263A > G and -712C > T) and two haplotypes of the four SNP combinations with AML susceptibility.","['Cingeetham, Anuradha', 'Vuree, Sugunakar', 'Dunna, Nageswara Rao', 'Gorre, Manjula', 'Nanchari, Santhoshi Rani', 'Edathara, Prajitha Mohandas', 'Mekkaw, Phannibhusan', 'Annamaneni, Sandhya', 'Digumarthi, Raghunadha Rao', 'Sinha, Sudha', 'Satti, Vishnupriya']","['Cingeetham A', 'Vuree S', 'Dunna NR', 'Gorre M', 'Nanchari SR', 'Edathara PM', 'Mekkaw P', 'Annamaneni S', 'Digumarthi RR', 'Sinha S', 'Satti V']","['Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,['EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Caspase 9/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2014/06/01 06:00,2014/12/30 06:00,['2014/06/01 06:00'],"['2014/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2096-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Sep;35(9):8813-22. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2096-5.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a significant role in pathogenesis and autoimmune diseases. The major function of MIF is to promote the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The aim of the present study is to identify the association between MIF-173 (rs755662) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and AML in Taiwanese population. DNA samples extracted from 256 AML patients and 256 healthy controls were investigated using polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The association between MIF-173 SNP genotype and AML patients were assessed with SPSS software. The results show that the GC genotype of MIF-173 SNP is significantly higher in AML patients than in the healthy controls (OR 1.58, 95 % CI 1.06, P = 0.034). Carrier genotypes GC and CC may be a causative factor for AML cancer (OR 1.39, 95 % CI 0.95, P = 0.085). White blood cell count (10(3)/microl) were significantly associated with AML MIF-173 polymorphism patients (P = 0.002). Our results in this study provide the first evidence that the MIF-173 polymorphism is associated with AML. MIF is a potential biomarker for development of AML cancer in male adult in Taiwanese population. Further validations in other populations are warranted.","['Ramireddy, Latha', 'Lin, Chien-Yu', 'Liu, Su-Ching', 'Lo, Wan-Yu', 'Hu, Rouh-Mei', 'Peng, Yi-Chin', 'Peng, Ching-Tien']","['Ramireddy L', 'Lin CY', 'Liu SC', 'Lo WY', 'Hu RM', 'Peng YC', 'Peng CT']","['Department of Biomedical Informatics, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,['0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Taiwan']",2014/06/01 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2014/06/01 06:00'],"['2014/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12013-014-0036-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2014 Nov;70(2):1159-65. doi: 10.1007/s12013-014-0036-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This problem could be addressed by using differences between cancer and normal cells for controlled delivery of drugs to cancer cells. One such difference is the ubiquitously elevated glutathione expression in cancer cells. We report a simple and versatile synthesis of water-soluble gold nanoparticles passivated with amine-containing molecules, which allow for controlled drug release via ligand exchange with bio-available glutathione. Taking methotrexate-passivated gold nanoparticles (Au:MTX) as an example, drug delivery and controlled release via glutathione-mediated ligand exchange was evaluated. Furthermore, the possibility of using Au:MTX to improve therapeutic index in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models was examined in vitro and in vivo. Au:MTX exhibited cancer selectivity in vitro. Au:MTX had an elevated potency toward an AML cell line THP-1 in a dosage range of 1-5 nM, and therefore an enhanced delivery of drug, whereas normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) growth was minimally affected by Au:MTX and MTX treatments within the same range of dosage. In vivo efficacy and safety of Au:MTX was evaluated in a murine xenotransplant model of primary human AML. Au:MTX treatment, compared to control groups including MTX-only and Au nanoparticle-only treatments, produced better leukemia suppression without added toxicity, indicating an enhanced therapeutic index.","['Egusa, Shunji', 'Ebrahem, Quteba', 'Mahfouz, Reda Z', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen']","['Egusa S', 'Ebrahem Q', 'Mahfouz RZ', 'Saunthararajah Y']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA saunthy@ccf.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,,,,2014/06/01 06:00,2014/06/01 06:01,['2014/06/01 06:00'],"['2014/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/01 06:01 [medline]']","['1535370214536648 [pii]', '10.1177/1535370214536648 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2014 Jul;239(7):853-861. doi: 10.1177/1535370214536648.

Combining all risk scores for baseline risk assessment may be useful in clinical practice for identifying groups of patients who may benefit from treatment initiation with a more potent TKI among the currently available first-line TKIs.","['Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Jang, Eun-Jung', 'Choi, Soo-Young', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Kim, Dong-Wook']","['Yahng SA', 'Jang EJ', 'Choi SY', 'Lee SE', 'Kim SH', 'Kim DW']","[""Department of Hematology, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea, dwkim@catholic.ac.kr.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/06/01 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/06/01 06:00'],"['2014/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1600-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Aug;100(2):132-40. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1600-4.

This design is used to overcome transcriptional interference and prevent downstream transcription from the 3' long terminal repeat. SIN vectors were derived from a number of different retroviruses. Studies of SIN vectors show that extensive U3 deletions in HIV-based vectors do not alter viral titers or the in vitro and in vivo properties of the vectors. However, deletion of the U3 sequences in gamma- and alpha-retroviruses correlates with defects in 3' RNA processing and reduces viral titers by >10-fold. Here, we studied the steps in the retroviral life cycle that are affected by the deletion of sequences in the 3' U3 region of Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral vectors. The results show that the amounts of both full-length and internal RNA transcripts of U3-minus vectors are reduced in the nuclei of transfected cells, an effect that is probably due to a general defect in 3' RNA processing. Furthermore, full-length RNA transcripts were also defective in terms of nuclear export. This defect was complemented by transferring the U3 region to another position within the retroviral vector, indicating that the U3 region contains position-independent cis-acting sequences that are required for the transport of full-length viral transcripts. The results also suggest that the leader region of Moloney murine leukemia virus contains inhibitory/regulatory sequences, which prevent export and mediate nuclear retention of full-length viral RNA.","['Volkova, Natalia A', 'Fomina, Elena G', 'Smolnikova, Viktoryia V', 'Zinovieva, Natalia A', 'Fomin, Igor K']","['Volkova NA', 'Fomina EG', 'Smolnikova VV', 'Zinovieva NA', 'Fomin IK']","['From the The Laboratory of Cellular Engineering, All-Russian State Research Institute of Animal Breeding, 142132 Moscow region, Russia.', 'The Laboratory for Biotechnology and Immunodiagnosis, The Republic Research and Practical Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, 220114 Minsk, Belarus, and.', 'The Republic Center of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, 220116 Minsk, Belarus.', 'From the The Laboratory of Cellular Engineering, All-Russian State Research Institute of Animal Breeding, 142132 Moscow region, Russia, n_zinovieva@mail.ru.', 'From the The Laboratory of Cellular Engineering, All-Russian State Research Institute of Animal Breeding, 142132 Moscow region, Russia, ikfomin@mail.ru.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",2014/06/01 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2014/06/01 06:00'],"['2014/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47664-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.545855 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 18;289(29):20158-69. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.545855.

This study determined the frequency of CIPN among children who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoma, brain tumour or Wilms tumour. PROCEDURE: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 252 patients treated at the Children's hospital of Eastern Ontario from 2001-2011. Patients were considered to have CIPN if they developed clinical symptoms of CIPN such as limb paraesthesia, weakness and/or ataxia during chemotherapy and their treating neurologist or oncologist deemed that their symptoms were due to a peripheral cause. Patients were excluded if their treatment regime did not include chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall frequency of CIPN was 18.3% (46/252). Tumour-specific CIPN rates were: 18.9% (29/154) for ALL; 9.4% (3/32) for lymphoma; 17.9% (5/28) for Wilms tumour; and 23.7% (9/38) for brain tumour patients. Nerve conduction studies were completed for 17% of patients (all tumour types) and were abnormal in all but one patient. Among surviving CIPN patients (41/46), 93% showed no clinical deficits at their last examination, which was on average 56 months from time of diagnosis to last follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of CIPN was less than that previously reported in adults receiving chemotherapy. Children with CIPN have a favourable outcome with most showing clinical improvement during the maintenance phase of treatment or after chemotherapy completion.","['Purser, M J', 'Johnston, D L', 'McMillan, H J']","['Purser MJ', 'Johnston DL', 'McMillan HJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Can J Neurol Sci,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

Nilotinib provides a choice as a second-line treatment. The objective of this report was to show the results of a group of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who received nilotinib as a second-line treatment. METHODS: The medical records of 16 patients of both sexes, of any age, diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, who received nilotinib as a second-line treatment, were reviewed. All of them had received imatinib prior as first-line treatment; the causes to switch to nilotinib were intolerance, resistance and clinical progression of leukemia. RESULTS: The sample was of 16 patients, who achieved at least a hematologic response; 10 were males (62.5%). The age range was 24 to 75 years. Two patients received nilotinib due to intolerance to imatinib; seven due to resistance to imatinib and seven due to lack of response. There was response in the two patients who received nilotinib due to intolerance.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of adding metformin to chemotherapy regimen over the percentage of early relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal and experimental study was performed in patients with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in the Hospital General de Mexico. They were divided in two groups: first group received chemotherapy + metformin (850 mg three times a day); second group only received standard chemotherapy. The sample was randomized 3:1 in favor of the second group. RESULTS: 93 patients were included (73 treated with chemotherapy + metformin and 20 received standard chemotherapy), with 303 +/- 53 days of follow-up. Complete remission was higher in the group without metformin (81.3 % [n = 61] versus 70 % [n = 14]), which also presented more patients with relapse (47.9 % versus 25 %). Overall survival at one year was of 68 % and free survival disease was 64 %, without significant differences between groups. Absence of metformin was the only variable of adverse prognostic considered significant (p = 0.55). Cox regression showed that adding metfomin reduced 56 % the risk of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The adding metformin to the treatment of leukemias showed that was useful in our research.

Imatinib mesylate is an inhibitor of kinase tyrosine that has proved to be useful in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Our aim was to evaluate the major molecular response to 12 months with triple therapy, analyze the evolution of these patients, and the hematological and non-hematological toxicity. METHODS: It was performed a longitudinal study in patients with diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia who were treated with sequential triple therapy: Pegylated interferon alpha 2a (90 mug/week for four weeks) + imatinib (800 mg a day for 30 days) + cytarabine (20 mg/m2 from day 1 to 10). Molecular and hematologic responses at 12 months of treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty eight patients with chronic myeloid leukemia were eligible; the mean age was 43.4 years and the medians of hemoglobin levels, leukocyte and platelet counts at diagnosis were 10 g/dL (5.1 to 16.0 g/dL), 208 000/muL3 (10 600 to 529 000/muL3) and 573 500/muL3 (130 000 to 4 272 000/muL3), respectively. According to the Sokal score, 68.4 % had low risk, 26.3 % intermediate and 5.3 % high risk. CONCLUSIONS: The hematologic response was similar to that reported in the IRIS study, but the molecular response was greater in more cases. The adverse hematological effects grades 3-4 and non-hematological were significative: 45 % and 87 %, which forces to continous monitoring.

The objective was to determine the frequency of strains that colonize the nasal mucosa in patients with leukemia and its relationship with peripheral blood cultures. METHODS: A retrospective, observational, transversal, retrolective study was done. We analyzed the weekly results of nasal cultures and peripheral blood cultures in patients with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy. The chi-squared test and odds ratio value were estimated in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: We included 67 patients, 55 of them with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL); 28.5 % of the cultures (n = 47) corresponded to a positive nasal culture. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus were the most isolated bacteria. During the first week of treatment, the positive cultures were the most frequently. All the samples isolated were sensitive to vancomycin or linezolid. It was established only the association between negative nasal cultures and negative peripheral blood cultures (p = 0.0005).

We demonstrate that in Kiss1(-/-) female mice, acute replacement of gonadotropins and estradiol restores ovulation, mating, and fertilization; however, these mice are still unable to achieve pregnancy because embryos fail to implant. Progesterone treatment did not overcome this defect. Kiss1(+/-) embryos transferred to a wild-type female mouse can successfully implant, demonstrating the defect is due to maternal factors. Kisspeptin and its receptor are expressed in the mouse uterus, and we suggest that it is the absence of uterine kisspeptin signaling that underlies the implantation failure. This absence, however, does not prevent the closure of the uterine implantation chamber, proper alignment of the embryo, and the ability of the uterus to undergo decidualization. Instead, the loss of Kiss1 expression specifically disrupts embryo attachment to the uterus. We observed that on the day of implantation, leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), a cytokine that is absolutely required for implantation in mice, is weakly expressed in Kiss1(-/-) uterine glands and that the administration of exogenous Lif to hormone-primed Kiss1(-/-) female mice is sufficient to partially rescue implantation. Taken together, our study reveals that uterine kisspeptin signaling regulates glandular Lif levels, thereby identifying a novel and critical role for kisspeptin in regulating embryo implantation in the mouse. This study provides compelling reasons to explore this role in other species, particularly livestock and humans.","['Calder, Michele', 'Chan, Yee-Ming', 'Raj, Renju', 'Pampillo, Macarena', 'Elbert, Adrienne', 'Noonan, Michelle', 'Gillio-Meina, Carolina', 'Caligioni, Claudia', 'Berube, Nathalie G', 'Bhattacharya, Moshmi', 'Watson, Andrew J', 'Seminara, Stephanie B', 'Babwah, Andy V']","['Calder M', 'Chan YM', 'Raj R', 'Pampillo M', 'Elbert A', 'Noonan M', 'Gillio-Meina C', 'Caligioni C', 'Berube NG', 'Bhattacharya M', 'Watson AJ', 'Seminara SB', 'Babwah AV']","[""The Children's Health Research Institute (M.C., M.P., A.E., C.G.-M., N.G.B., A.J.W., A.V.B.), Lawson Health Research Institute (M.C., M.P., A.E., C.G.-M., N.G.B., A.J.W., A.V.B.), and Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (M.C., M.P., A.J.W., A.V.B.), London, Ontario, Canada N6C 2V5; Harvard Reproductive Endocrine Sciences Center (Y.-M.C., C.C., S.B.S.), Reproductive Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114; Division of Endocrinology (Y.-M.C.), Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences (R.R.), University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont 05405; and Departments of Paediatrics (A.E., N.G.B.), Biochemistry (A.E., N.G.B.), Physiology and Pharmacology (M.N., M.B., A.J.W., A.V.B.), and Oncology (M.B.), The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada N6A 5C1.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Gonadotropins)', '0 (Kiss1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kisspeptins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Estradiol/physiology', 'Female', 'Gonadotropins/physiology', 'Kisspeptins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal/*physiology', 'Progesterone/metabolism', 'Superovulation', 'Uterus/*physiology']",2014/06/01 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/06/01 06:00'],"['2014/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1210/en.2013-1916 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2014 Aug;155(8):3065-78. doi: 10.1210/en.2013-1916.

Factors specifically related to the treatment, patient, and health care provider may influence medication adherence. Treatment-related factors include the complexity of the regimen, the cost of therapy, the possibility of side effects, and the delay in treatment benefits. Meanwhile, patients may not have an adequate support system or an understanding of the need for the medication, and providers may not fully succeed in communicating the importance of adherence and the types of side effects that may occur. Nonadherence may lead to an increased risk of toxicity, decreased effectiveness, and increased utilization of health care resources. Although various methods for measuring adherence are available, self-reporting is the most widely used. Studies describing adherence in a broad range of cancers are reviewed. Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia has been revolutionized by the development of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are highly effective in managing the disease when taken consistently. However, nonadherence is relatively common and can lead to reduced rates of response and increased medical costs. Similar effects of nonadherence on outcome and cost have also been observed in patients with various other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Interventions to improve adherence to oral chemotherapy regimens include communication about the importance of adherence and the potential consequences of nonadherence, simplification of the patient's medication schedule (if possible), and inclusion of a caregiver or family member in the conversation. Written materials should always be provided to accompany verbal instructions. This review summarizes factors influencing medication adherence, impact of nonadherence on patient outcomes, methods for measuring adherence, previous studies of nonadherence in patients with cancer, common barriers to access, and interventions to improve adherence in the community setting.","['McCue, Debbie A', 'Lohr, Lisa K', 'Pick, Amy M']","['McCue DA', 'Lohr LK', 'Pick AM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/05/31 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/05/31 06:00'],"['2014/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1399 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2014 May;34(5):481-94. doi: 10.1002/phar.1399.,,,['Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2019 Dec 2;76(24):2009-2012.

Endocrine and paracrine control of these cells can be direct, but they are also exerted indirectly, either by influencing progenitor cell differentiation or by stimulating paracrine signals from local accessory cells including osteocytes (which form a critical communication and regulation network within the bone matrix), macrophages and T lymphocytes. Here we review the osteotropic actions of the interleukin-6 family member cytokine oncostatin M (OSM), which is of particular interest because of its ability to stimulate bone accrual. OSM is produced within the bone microenvironment by cells of both mesenchymal and hematopoietic origin, including osteocytes, osteoblasts, macrophages and T lymphocytes, and can act via two receptor complexes: OSM receptor:gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR):gp130. Although OSM can directly stimulate osteoblast mineralization activity and differentiation, it can also stimulate mesenchymal stem cell osteoblastic commitment at the expense of adipogenesis. In osteocytes, OSM can suppress the production of the bone formation inhibitor sclerostin, an action that is mediated by LIFR:gp130. OSM also stimulates the production of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand by osteoblasts and thereby drives the formation of osteoclasts particularly in pathological conditions. Thus, cellular effects of OSM on bone metabolism include direct and indirect actions mediated by two related receptor/ligand complexes. OSM therefore provides an example of paracrine and endocrine control mechanisms that regulate bone mass by controlling both bone formation and resorption.","['Sims, Natalie A', 'Quinn, Julian M W']","['Sims NA', 'Quinn JM']","[""Bone Cell Biology and Disease Unit, St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research , Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Department of Medicine at St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, The University of Melbourne , Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Prince Henry's Institute, Monash Medical Centre , Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University , Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bonekey Rep,BoneKEy reports,101586246,,,,2014/05/31 06:00,2014/05/31 06:01,['2014/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/bonekey.2014.22 [doi]'],epublish,Bonekey Rep. 2014 May 14;3:527. doi: 10.1038/bonekey.2014.22. eCollection 2014.,,20140514,,PMC4037876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We suggest a potential transfusion-associated graft versus-host-diseases (TA-GVHD) and graft-versus leukemia (GVL) reaction which might lead to spontaneous hematological remission. However, we did not observe clinical symptoms of such reactions apart from a short episode of non-infectious diarrhea. Additionally, steroids were administered but their role in inducing SR, in our opinion, seems less probable. This 77-year-old man remained in SR for 7 months, when repeated analysis showed AML recurrence. He died due to septic shock 2.5 months later.

Treatment of these patients has not been unified within Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (PPLLSG) so far. The goal of this study is to analyze the results of this therapy performed between 2005-2011. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The outcome data of 16 patients with refAML and 62 with relAML were analyzed retrospectively. Reinduction was usually based on idarubicine, fludarabine and cytarabine with allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) in 5 refAML and 30 relAML children. RESULTS: Seventy seven percent relAML patients entered second complete remission (CR2). Five-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated at 16% and 30%. The outcome for patients after alloHSCT in CR2 (63%) was better than that of those not transplanted (36%) with 5-year OS of 34% vs. 2-year of 7% and 5-year DFS of 40% vs. 12.5%. Second complete remission achievement and alloHSCT were the most significant predictors of better prognosis (p = 0.000 and p = 0.024). The outcome of refAML children was significantly worse than relAML with first remission (CR1) rate of 33%, OS and DFS of 25% at 3 years and 53% at 2 years, respectively. All survivors of refAML were treated with alloHSCT after CR1. CONCLUSIONS: The uniform reinduction regimen of the documented efficacy and subsequent alloHSCT in remission is needed to improve the outcome for ref/relAML children treated within PPLLSG. The focus should be on the future risk-directed both front and second line AML therapy.","['Skalska-Sadowska, Jolanta', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Skalska-Sadowska, Jolanta', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Niewiadomska-Wojnalowicz, Izabela', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska, Danuta', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Pawinska-Wasikowska, Katarzyna', 'Gozdzik, Jolanta', 'Chybicka, Alicja', 'Potocka, Kinga', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska, Lucyna', 'Karolczyk, Grazyna', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Wojcik, Beata', 'Badowska, Wanda', 'Urasinski, Tomasz', 'Ociepa, Tomasz', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Sikorska-Fic, Barbara', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Tomaszewska, Renata', 'Sobol, Grazyna', 'Wieczorek, Maria', 'Karpinska-Derda, Irena']","['Skalska-Sadowska J', 'Wachowiak J', 'Skalska-Sadowska J', 'Wachowiak J', 'Zajac-Spychala O', 'Niewiadomska-Wojnalowicz I', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D', 'Balwierz W', 'Pawinska-Wasikowska K', 'Gozdzik J', 'Chybicka A', 'Potocka K', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Maciejka-Kapuscinska L', 'Karolczyk G', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Wojcik B', 'Badowska W', 'Urasinski T', 'Ociepa T', 'Matysiak M', 'Sikorska-Fic B', 'Szczepanski T', 'Tomaszewska R', 'Sobol G', 'Wieczorek M', 'Karpinska-Derda I']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', ""Department of Transplantology, Jagiellonian University Children's Hospital, Krakow, Poland."", 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children Hospital, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Clinic of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Clinic of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Center Chorzow, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Center Chorzow, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Contemp Oncol (Pozn),"Contemporary oncology (Poznan, Poland)",101233223,,,,2014/05/31 06:00,2014/05/31 06:01,['2014/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/wo.2014.40436 [doi]', '22200 [pii]']",ppublish,Contemp Oncol (Pozn). 2014;18(1):48-53. doi: 10.5114/wo.2014.40436.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially life-threatening toxicity that has been observed following administration of natural and bispecific antibodies and, more recently, following adoptive T-cell therapies for cancer. CRS is associated with elevated circulating levels of several cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon gamma, and uncontrolled studies demonstrate that immunosuppression using tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, with or without corticosteroids, can reverse the syndrome. However, because early and aggressive immunosuppression could limit the efficacy of the immunotherapy, current approaches seek to limit administration of immunosuppressive therapy to patients at risk for life-threatening consequences of the syndrome. This report presents a novel system to grade the severity of CRS in individual patients and a treatment algorithm for management of CRS based on severity. The goal of our approach is to maximize the chance for therapeutic benefit from the immunotherapy while minimizing the risk for life threatening complications of CRS.","['Lee, Daniel W', 'Gardner, Rebecca', 'Porter, David L', 'Louis, Chrystal U', 'Ahmed, Nabil', 'Jensen, Michael', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Mackall, Crystal L']","['Lee DW', 'Gardner R', 'Porter DL', 'Louis CU', 'Ahmed N', 'Jensen M', 'Grupp SA', 'Mackall CL']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD;', ""Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA;"", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA;', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and."", ""Texas Children's Hospital, Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and."", ""Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA;"", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD;']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Child', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/*diagnosis/metabolism/*therapy', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/immunology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/metabolism/*therapy', 'Young Adult']",2014/05/31 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/05/31 06:00'],"['2014/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39995-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-552729 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 10;124(2):188-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-552729.

Knockdown of RPL39 and MLF2 by specific siRNA nanoparticles in patient-derived and human cancer xenografts reduced tumor volume and lung metastases with a concomitant decrease in BCSCs. RNA deep sequencing identified damaging mutations in both genes.

Molecular techniques identified the presence of the rare e19a2 BCR-ABL1 transcript. The patient was treated by 1(st) generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) (imatinib). Disease monitoring was performed by cytogenetic analyses and quantification of the BCR-ABL1 transcript. After 3 months, the treatment was modified due to an absence of biological response and poor tolerance. After 21 months with 2nd generation TKIs (nilotinib), the patient was responding optimally to treatment, with a complete cytogenetic response and a major molecular response. This observation emphasizes the importance of determining the chromosomal breakpoints at diagnosis to enable adequate molecular monitoring of residual disease. Careful monitoring of minimal residual disease is important to thoroughly assess the response to treatment, detect resistance and adapt the therapeutic strategy. The kinetics and the depth of the response to TKI also represent major prognostic factors. Molecular monitoring is performed using real-time quantitative PCR, which has to be adapted to each type of transcript. For rare BCR-ABL1 transcripts, an international standardization, as it is developed for conventional transcripts, is lacking. Yet, such a harmonization would be useful to assess in an optimal and large scale way the response to TKI in these patients, and to determine what the best management is.","['Gendron, Nicolas', 'Belhouachi, Nabila', 'Morel, Veronique', 'Azgui, Zahia', 'Maloum, Karim', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Chapiro, Elise']","['Gendron N', 'Belhouachi N', 'Morel V', 'Azgui Z', 'Maloum K', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Cayuela JM', 'Davi F', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Chapiro E']","[""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie clinique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France, Inserm U1138, Centre de recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris 6, France."", ""Laboratoire d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France, Inserm U1138, Centre de recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris 6, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France, Inserm U1138, Centre de recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris 6, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, France, Inserm U1138, Centre de recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris 6, France.""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2014/05/31 06:00,2016/05/18 06:00,['2014/05/31 06:00'],"['2014/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['abc.2014.0960 [pii]', '10.1684/abc.2014.0960 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2014 May-Jun;72(3):359-66. doi: 10.1684/abc.2014.0960.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'e19a2', 'minimal residual disease', 'variant transcript']",,,,,,,,Leucemie myeloide chronique avec transcrit de fusion variant BCR-ABL1 e19a2 : interet de l'identification moleculaire au diagnostic pour le suivi de la maladie residuelle.,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 281 patients with MDS who had received previous chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for previous malignancy. Potential prognostic factors were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified 7 factors that independently predicted short survival in t-MDS: age >/= 65 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2-4 (HR, 1.86), poor cytogenetics (-7 and/or complex; HR, 2.47), World Health Organization MDS subtype (RARs or RAEB-1/2; HR, 1.92), hemoglobin (< 11 g/dL; HR, 2.24), platelets (< 50 x 10(9)/dL; HR, 2.01), and transfusion dependency (HR, 1.59). These risk factors were used to create a prognostic model that segregated patients into 3 groups with distinct median overall survival: good (0-2 risk factors; 34 months), intermediate (3-4 risk factors; 12 months), and poor (5-7 risk factors; 5 months) (P < .001) and 1-year leukemia-free survival (96%, 84%, and 72%, respectively, P = .003). This model also identified distinct survival groups according to t-MDS therapy. CONCLUSION: In summary, we devised a prognostic model specifically for patients with t-MDS that predicted overall survival and leukemia-free survival. This model might facilitate the development of risk-adapted therapeutic strategies.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Daver, Naval', 'Kim, Hawk', 'Dinardo, Courtney', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Cardenas-Turanzas, Marylou', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Wierda, William', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Wei, Yue', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Daver N', 'Kim H', 'Dinardo C', 'Jabbour E', 'Kadia T', 'Borthakur G', 'Pierce S', 'Shan J', 'Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F', 'Wierda W', 'Estrov Z', 'Faderl S', 'Wei Y', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

However, the precise role of TET1 in DNA methylation regulation outside of developmental reprogramming is still unclear. Here, we show that overexpression of the TET1 catalytic domain but not full length TET1 (TET1-FL) induces massive global DNA demethylation in differentiated cells. Genome-wide mapping reveals that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine production by TET1-FL is inhibited as DNA methylation increases, which can be explained by the preferential binding of TET1-FL to unmethylated CpG islands (CGIs) through its CXXC domain. TET1-FL specifically accumulates 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at the edges of hypomethylated CGIs, while knockdown of endogenous TET1 induces methylation spreading from methylated edges into hypomethylated CGIs. We also found that gene expression changes after TET1-FL overexpression are relatively small and independent of its dioxygenase function. Thus, our results identify TET1 as a maintenance DNA demethylase that does not purposely decrease methylation levels, but specifically prevents aberrant methylation spreading into CGIs in differentiated cells.","['Jin, Chunlei', 'Lu, Yue', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Liang, Shoudan', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Barton, Michelle Craig', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Jin C', 'Lu Y', 'Jelinek J', 'Liang S', 'Estecio MR', 'Barton MC', 'Issa JP']","['The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA jpissa@temple.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/analogs & derivatives', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Dioxygenases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2014/05/31 06:00,2014/08/20 06:00,['2014/05/31 06:00'],"['2014/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['gku372 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gku372 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jun;42(11):6956-71. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku372.

PLA2 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-elicited p38 MAPK activation and ERK inactivation in U937 cells. Catalytically inactive bromophenacylated PLA2 (BPB-PLA2) and PLA2 mutants evoked Ca(2+)-mediated p38 MAPK activation, and the level of phosphorylated ERK remained unchanged. PLA2 treatment reduced mature ADAM17 expression and secreted TNF-alpha (sTNF-alpha) production. Co-treatment of SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) and catalytically inactive PLA2 increased ERK phosphorylation, ADAM17 maturation and sTNF-alpha production. Nevertheless, mRNA levels of ADAM17 and TNF-alpha were insignificantly altered after PLA2 and SB202190/BPB-PLA2 treatment. ADAM17 activity assay and knock-down of ADAM17 revealed that ADAM17 was involved in sTNF-alpha production. Restoration of ERK activation increased the processing of proADAM17 into ADAM17 in PLA2-treated cells, while inactivation of ERK reduced ADAM17 maturation in untreated and SB202190/BPB-PLA2-treated cells. Removal of cell surface heparan sulfate abrogated PLA2 and SB202190/BPB-PLA2 effect on ADAM17 maturation. Taken together, the present data reveal that PLA2 suppresses ERK-mediated ADAM17 maturation, thus reducing sTNF-alpha production in U937 cells. Moreover, the binding with heparan sulfate is crucial for the PLA2 effect.","['Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Lin, Hui-Chen', 'Chen, Ku-Chung', 'Lin, Shinne-Ren', 'Cheng, Tian-Lu', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chen YJ', 'Lin HC', 'Chen KC', 'Lin SR', 'Cheng TL', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nutrition Room, Zuoying Branch of Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medicinal and Applied Chemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Science and Environmental Biology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.

Autophagy and apoptosis are both engaged in selenite-induced cell death. In a previous report, we have identified heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as a critical modulator of the balance between autophagy and apoptosis in selenite-treated leukemia cells. However, the mechanisms by which selenite mediates the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway and p38 are core modules for the selenite-induced switch to apoptosis from autophagy. We found that selenite activated PERK and eIF2alpha/ATF4 downstream to promote apoptosis. During this progression, p38 was dissociated from PERK-inhibiting Hsp90 and became autophosphorylated. Then, activated p38 further enhanced the docking of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) onto the CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) promoter via eIF2alpha to enhance apoptosis. We also found that activated p38 suppressed the phosphorylation of eIF4E that directed ATF4 to bind to the MAP1LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B) promoter. Because of the deactivation of eIF4E, the association of ATF4 with the MAP1LC3B promoter was inhibited, and autophagy was compromised. Intriguingly, p53 played important roles in mediating the p38-mediated regulation of eIF2alpha and eIF4E. When activated by p38, p53 induced the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and the dephosphorylation of eIF4E, particularly in the nucleus where the ATF4 transcription factor was modulated, ultimately resulting in differential expression of CHOP and LC3. Moreover, selenite exhibited potent antitumor effects in vivo. In an NB4 cell xenograft model, selenite induced apoptosis and hampered autophagy. In addition, related signaling proteins demonstrated similar changes to those observed in vitro. These data suggest that selenite may be a candidate drug for leukemia therapy.","['Jiang, Q', 'Li, F', 'Shi, K', 'Wu, P', 'An, J', 'Yang, Y', 'Xu, C']","['Jiang Q', 'Li F', 'Shi K', 'Wu P', 'An J', 'Yang Y', 'Xu C']","['National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (MAP1LC3C protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Trace Elements)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (EIF2AK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'F6A27P4Q4R (Selenious Acid)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Response Elements', 'Selenious Acid/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Trace Elements/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'eIF-2 Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",2014/05/31 06:00,2015/02/13 06:00,['2014/05/31 06:00'],"['2013/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014200 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.200 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 May 29;5:e1270. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.200.,,20140529,,PMC4047911,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which Tal1 differentially influences transcription of distinct genes is not fully understood. Here we show that Tal1 interacts with the peptidylarginine deiminase IV (PADI4). We demonstrate that PADI4 can act as an epigenetic coactivator through influencing H3R2me2a. At the Tal1/PADI4 target gene IL6ST the repressive H3R2me2a mark triggered by PRMT6 is counteracted by PADI4, which augments the active H3K4me3 mark and thus increases IL6ST expression. In contrast, at the CTCF promoter PADI4 acts as a repressor. We propose that the influence of PADI4 on IL6ST transcription plays a role in the control of IL6ST expression during lineage differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. These results open the possibility to pharmacologically influence Tal1 in leukaemia.","['Kolodziej, Stephan', 'Kuvardina, Olga N', 'Oellerich, Thomas', 'Herglotz, Julia', 'Backert, Ingo', 'Kohrs, Nicole', 'Buscato, Estel la', 'Wittmann, Sandra K', 'Salinas-Riester, Gabriela', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Karas, Michael', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Proschak, Ewgenij', 'Lausen, Jorn']","['Kolodziej S', 'Kuvardina ON', 'Oellerich T', 'Herglotz J', 'Backert I', 'Kohrs N', 'Buscato El', 'Wittmann SK', 'Salinas-Riester G', 'Bonig H', 'Karas M', 'Serve H', 'Proschak E', 'Lausen J']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, D-60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, D-60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', '1] Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, D-60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany [2].', '1] Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, D-60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany [2].', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, D-60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University, Max-von-Laue-Strasse 9, D-60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University, Max-von-Laue-Strasse 9, D-60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Medical-University Goettingen, Transcriptome Analysis Laboratory, Justus-von-Liebig-Weg 11, D-37077 Goettingen, Germany.', 'German Red Cross Blood Service and Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University, Sandhofstrasse 1, D-60528 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University, Max-von-Laue-Strasse 9, D-60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', '1] Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany [2] German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', '1] Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University, Max-von-Laue-Strasse 9, D-60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany [2] German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, D-60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (PADI4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 4)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (Protein-Arginine Deiminases)']",IM,"['Arginine/*metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 4', 'Protein-Arginine Deiminases', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2014/05/31 06:00,2015/10/02 06:00,['2014/05/31 06:00'],"['2014/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms4995 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms4995 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 May 29;5:3995. doi: 10.1038/ncomms4995.,,20140529,,PMC4050257,,,,,,,,['GEO/GSE54075'],,,,,,,,,

In cancer, these protein kinases are often overexpressed and dysregulated, thus contributing to uncontrolled cell proliferation and growth. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a heterogeneous malignancy arising in the thymus from T-cell progenitors. Primary chemoresistant and relapsed T-ALL patients have yet a poor outcome, therefore novel therapies, targeting signaling pathways important for leukemic cell proliferation, are required. Here, we demonstrate the potential therapeutic effects of BI6727, MK-5108, and GSK1070916, three selective inhibitors of PLK1, AK-A, and AK-B/C, respectively, in a panel of T-ALL cell lines and primary cells from T-ALL patients. The drugs were both cytostatic and cytotoxic to T-ALL cells by inducing G2/M-phase arrest and apoptosis. The drugs retained part of their pro-apoptotic activity in the presence of MS-5 bone marrow stromal cells. Moreover, we document for the first time that BI6727 perturbed both the PI3K/Akt/mTORC2 and the MEK/ERK/mTORC1 signaling pathways, and that a combination of BI6727 with specific inhibitors of the aforementioned pathways (MK-2206, CCI-779) displayed significantly synergistic cytotoxic effects.

Unfortunately, many cellular processes, including signaling, motility, and molecular transport, occur transiently over relatively short periods of time and at different magnitudes between cells. Here we demonstrate the multitrap nanophysiometer (MTNP), a low-volume microfluidic platform housing an array of cell traps, as an effective tool that can be used to study individual unattached cells over time with precise control over the intercellular microenvironment. We show how the MTNP platform can be used for hematologic cancer cell characterization by measuring single T cell levels of CRAC channel modulation, non-translational motility, and ABC-transporter inhibition via a calcein-AM efflux assay.

We have previously characterized HTLV-3- and HTLV-4-encoded antisense genes, termed APH-3 and APH-4, respectively, which, in contrast to HBZ, the HTLV-1 homologue, do not contain a typical bZIP domain (M. Larocque E Halin, S. Landry, S. J. Marriott, W. M. Switzer, and B. Barbeau, J. Virol. 85:12673-12685, 2011, doi:10.1128/JVI.05296-11). As HBZ differentially modulates the transactivation potential of various Jun family members, the effect of APH-3 and APH-4 on JunD-, c-Jun-, and JunB-mediated transcriptional activation was investigated. We first showed that APH-3 and APH-4 upregulated the transactivation potential of all tested Jun family members. Using an human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) promoter construct, our results also highlighted that, unlike HBZ, which solely modulates hTERT expression via JunD, both APH-3 and APH-4 acted positively on the transactivation of the hTERT promoter mediated by tested Jun factors. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that these Jun proteins interacted with APH-3 and APH-4. Although no activation domain was identified for APH proteins, the activation domain of c-Jun was very important in the observed upregulation of its activation potential. We further showed that APH-3 and APH-4 required their putative bZIP-like domains and corresponding leucine residues for interaction and modulation of the transactivation potential of Jun factors. Our results demonstrate that HTLV-encoded antisense proteins behave differently, and that the bZIP-like domains of both APH-3 and APH-4 have retained their interaction potential for Jun members. These studies are important in assessing the differences between HBZ and other antisense proteins, which might further contribute to determining the role of HBZ in HTLV-1-associated diseases. IMPORTANCE HBZ, the antisense transcript-encoded protein from HTLV-1, is now well recognized as a potential factor for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma development. In order to better appreciate the mechanism of action of HBZ, comparison to antisense proteins from other HTLV viruses is important. Little is known in relation to the seemingly nonpathogenic HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 viruses, and studies of their antisense proteins are limited to our previously reported study (M. Larocque E Halin, S. Landry, S. J. Marriott, W. M. Switzer, and B. Barbeau, J. Virol. 85:12673-12685, 2011, doi:10.1128/JVI.05296-11). Here, we demonstrate that Jun transcription factors are differently affected by APH-3 and APH-4 compared to HBZ. These intriguing findings suggest that these proteins act differently on viral replication but also on cellular gene expression, and that highlighting their differences of action might lead to important information allowing us to understand the link between HTLV-1 HBZ and ATL in infected individuals.","['Larocque, Emilie', 'Andre-Arpin, Charlotte', 'Borowiak, Malgorzata', 'Lemay, Guy', 'Switzer, William M', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Barbeau, Benoit']","['Larocque E', 'Andre-Arpin C', 'Borowiak M', 'Lemay G', 'Switzer WM', 'Duc Dodon M', 'Mesnard JM', 'Barbeau B']","['Departement des Sciences Biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Centre de Recherche BioMed, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Departement de Microbiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite Montpellier 1, CNRS, UM5236, CPBS, Montpellier, France.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5239, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Ecole Normale Superieure, UMS3444 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland, Lyon, France.', 'Departement de Microbiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5239, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Ecole Normale Superieure, UMS3444 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland, Lyon, France.', 'Universite Montpellier 1, CNRS, UM5236, CPBS, Montpellier, France.', 'Departement des Sciences Biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Centre de Recherche BioMed, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada barbeau.benoit@uqam.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 3/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2014/05/30 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01094-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01094-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Aug;88(16):8956-70. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01094-14.

Leukemia cells resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis have been found to be sensitive to oridonin, a natural agent with potent anticancer activity. To investigate its mechanisms of action in reversing chemoresistance, we compared the response of human leukemia cells with oridonin and the antileukemia drugs Ara-C and VP-16. Compared with HL60 cells, K562 and K562/ADR cells displayed resistance to apoptosis stimulated by Ara-C and VP-16 but sensitivity to oridonin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that oridonin upregulated BIM-S by diminishing the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a, leading to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, neither Ara-C nor VP-16 could reduce miR-17 and miR-20a expression or could trigger BIM-S-mediated apoptosis. Notably, silencing miR-17 or miR-20a expression by treatment with microRNA (miRNA; miR) inhibitors or oridonin restored sensitivity of K562 cells to VP-16. Synergistic effects of oridonin and VP-16 were documented in cultured cells as well as mouse tumor xenograft assays. Inhibiting miR-17 or miR-20a also augmented the proapoptotic activity of oridonin. Taken together, our results identify a miRNA-dependent mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of oridonin and provide a rationale for its combination with chemotherapy drugs in addressing chemoresistant leukemia cells.","['Weng, Hengyou', 'Huang, Huilin', 'Dong, Bowen', 'Zhao, Panpan', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Qu, Lianghu']","['Weng H', 'Huang H', 'Dong B', 'Zhao P', 'Zhou H', 'Qu L']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China lssqlh@mail.sysu.edu.cn lsszh@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, PR China lssqlh@mail.sysu.edu.cn lsszh@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (MIRN17 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN20a microRNA, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0APJ98UCLQ (oridonin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2014/05/30 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-13-1748 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1748 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2014 Aug 15;74(16):4409-19. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1748.

Metabolic changes in CSC could hold a key to their targeting. Here, we report that the dietary micronutrient selenium can trigger apoptosis of CSC derived from chronic or acute myelogenous leukemias when administered at supraphysiologic but nontoxic doses. In leukemia CSC, selenium treatment activated ATM-p53-dependent apoptosis accompanied by increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Importantly, the same treatment did not trigger apoptosis in hematopoietic stem cells. Serial transplantation studies with BCR-ABL-expressing CSC revealed that the selenium status in mice was a key determinant of CSC survival. Selenium action relied upon the endogenous production of the cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins Delta(12)-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2. Accordingly, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and NADPH oxidase inhibitors abrogated the ability of selenium to trigger apoptosis in leukemia CSC. Our results reveal how selenium-dependent modulation of arachidonic acid metabolism can be directed to trigger apoptosis of primary human and murine CSC in leukemia.","['Gandhi, Ujjawal H', 'Kaushal, Naveen', 'Hegde, Shailaja', 'Finch, Emily R', 'Kudva, Avinash K', 'Kennett, Mary J', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Paulson, Robert F', 'Prabhu, K Sandeep']","['Gandhi UH', 'Kaushal N', 'Hegde S', 'Finch ER', 'Kudva AK', 'Kennett MJ', 'Jordan CT', 'Paulson RF', 'Prabhu KS']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease and Center for Molecular Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania; and."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease and Center for Molecular Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania; and."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease and Center for Molecular Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania; and."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease and Center for Molecular Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania; and."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease and Center for Molecular Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania; and."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease and Center for Molecular Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania; and."", 'Division of Hematology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Colorado, Anshutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease and Center for Molecular Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania; and ksp4@psu.edu rfp5@psu.edu."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease and Center for Molecular Toxicology and Carcinogenesis, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania; and ksp4@psu.edu rfp5@psu.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Eicosanoids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Eicosanoids/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Selenium/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Splenomegaly', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2014/05/30 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-13-3694 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3694 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2014 Jul 15;74(14):3890-901. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3694.

Mice encoding endocytosis-competent C57BL/6 Tetherin exhibited lower viremia and pathology at 7 d postinfection with Friend retrovirus (FV) compared with mice encoding endocytosis-defective NZW/LacJ Tetherin. Notably, antiretroviral protection correlated with stronger NK cell responses. In addition, Friend retrovirus infection levels were significantly lower in wild-type C57BL/6 mice than in Tetherin knockout mice at 2 wk postinfection, and antiretroviral protection correlated with stronger NK cell and virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses. The results demonstrate that Tetherin acts as a modulator of the cell-mediated immune response against retrovirus infection in vivo.","['Li, Sam X', 'Barrett, Bradley S', 'Heilman, Karl J', 'Messer, Ronald J', 'Liberatore, Rachel A', 'Bieniasz, Paul D', 'Kassiotis, George', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Santiago, Mario L']","['Li SX', 'Barrett BS', 'Heilman KJ', 'Messer RJ', 'Liberatore RA', 'Bieniasz PD', 'Kassiotis G', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Santiago ML']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO 80045; Department of Microbiology, University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO 80045;', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO 80045;', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO 80045;', 'Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840;', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10016;', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10016;', 'Division of Immunoregulation, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom; and.', 'Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840;', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO 80045; Department of Microbiology, University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO 80045; Department of Immunology, University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO 80045 mario.santiago@ucdenver.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BST2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Viremia/genetics/immunology/pathology']",2014/05/30 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1400490 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1400490 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Jul 1;193(1):306-16. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1400490.

In search for the mechanisms, we demonstrated that Tat deregulates neuronal functions through a pathway that involved p73 and p53 pathway. We showed that Tat uses microRNA-196a (miR-196a) to deregulate the p73 pathway. Further, we found that the Abelson murine leukemia (c-Abl) phosphorylates p73 on tyrosine residue 99 (Tyr-99) in Tat-treated cells. Interestingly, Tat lost its ability to promote accumulation and phosphorylation of p73 in the presence of miR-196a mimic. Interestingly, accumulation of p73 did not lead to neuronal cell death by apoptosis as obtained by cell viability assay. Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against serine residues 807 and 811 of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein was also used to validate our data regarding lack of cell death. Hyperphosphorylation of RB (S807/811) is an indication of cell neuronal viability. These results highlight the key role played by p73 and microRNA in Tat-treated neurons leading to their deregulation and it deciphers mechanistically one of the pathways used by Tat to cause neuronal dysfunction that contributes to the development of HAND.","['Bagashev, Asen', 'Mukerjee, Ruma', 'Santerre, Maryline', 'Del Carpio-Cano, Fabiola E', 'Shrestha, Jenny', 'Wang, Ying', 'He, Johnny J', 'Sawaya, Bassel E']","['Bagashev A', 'Mukerjee R', 'Santerre M', 'Del Carpio-Cano FE', 'Shrestha J', 'Wang Y', 'He JJ', 'Sawaya BE']","['Molecular Studies of Neurodegenerative Diseases Lab, FELS Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, PHA # 302, 3307 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN196 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trp73 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology/*metabolism/virology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV Infections/complications/*metabolism/virology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/metabolism']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/01/31 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-014-1003-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2014 Aug;19(8):1202-14. doi: 10.1007/s10495-014-1003-2.,"['R01NS059327/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH093331/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NS076401/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS040673/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01MH093331/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that 17beta-estradiol (E2) influences production of runx1+ HSPCs in the AGM region by antagonizing VEGF signaling and subsequent assignment of hemogenic endothelial (HE) identity. Exposure to exogenous E2 during vascular niche development significantly disrupted flk1+ vessel maturation, ephrinB2+ arterial identity, and specification of scl+ HE by decreasing expression of VEGFAa and downstream arterial Notch-pathway components; heat shock induction of VEGFAa/Notch rescued E2-mediated hematovascular defects. Conversely, repression of endogenous E2 activity increased somitic VEGF expression and vascular target regulation, shifting assignment of arterial/venous fate and HE localization; blocking E2 signaling allowed venous production of scl+/runx1+ cells, independent of arterial identity acquisition. Together, these data suggest that yolk-derived E2 sets the ventral boundary of hemogenic vascular niche specification by antagonizing the dorsal-ventral regulatory limits of VEGF.","['Carroll, Kelli J', 'Esain, Virginie', 'Garnaas, Maija K', 'Cortes, Mauricio', 'Dovey, Michael C', 'Nissim, Sahar', 'Frechette, Gregory M', 'Liu, Sarah Y', 'Kwan, Wanda', 'Cutting, Claire C', 'Harris, James M', 'Gorelick, Daniel A', 'Halpern, Marnie E', 'Lawson, Nathan D', 'Goessling, Wolfram', 'North, Trista E']","['Carroll KJ', 'Esain V', 'Garnaas MK', 'Cortes M', 'Dovey MC', 'Nissim S', 'Frechette GM', 'Liu SY', 'Kwan W', 'Cutting CC', 'Harris JM', 'Gorelick DA', 'Halpern ME', 'Lawson ND', 'Goessling W', 'North TE']","['Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Carnegie Institution for Science, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA.', 'University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.

By suppressing APC(Cdc20), antimitotic agents activate the spindle-assembly checkpoint and induce apoptosis after prolonged treatment, whereas depleting endogenous Cdc20 suppresses tumorigenesis in part by triggering mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying apoptosis induced by Cdc20 abrogation remains poorly understood. Here, we report the BH3-only proapoptotic protein Bim as an APC(Cdc20) target, such that depletion of Cdc20 sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli. Strikingly, Cdc20 and multiple APC-core components were identified in a small interfering RNA screen that, upon knockdown, sensitizes otherwise resistant cancer cells to chemoradiation in a Bim-dependent manner. Consistently, human adult T cell leukemia cells that acquire elevated APC(Cdc20) activity via expressing the Tax viral oncoprotein exhibit reduced Bim levels and resistance to anticancer agents. These results reveal an important role for APC(Cdc20) in governing apoptosis, strengthening the rationale for developing specific Cdc20 inhibitors as effective anticancer agents.","['Wan, Lixin', 'Tan, Mingjia', 'Yang, Jie', 'Inuzuka, Hiroyuki', 'Dai, Xiangpeng', 'Wu, Tao', 'Liu, Jia', 'Shaik, Shavali', 'Chen, Guoan', 'Deng, Jing', 'Malumbres, Marcos', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Kirschner, Marc W', 'Sun, Yi', 'Wei, Wenyi']","['Wan L', 'Tan M', 'Yang J', 'Inuzuka H', 'Dai X', 'Wu T', 'Liu J', 'Shaik S', 'Chen G', 'Deng J', 'Malumbres M', 'Letai A', 'Kirschner MW', 'Sun Y', 'Wei W']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory for Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Chongqing Road, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Institute of Mitochondrial Biology and Medicine, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, China."", 'Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Thoracic Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Cell Division and Cancer Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

With the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) method we analyzed the protein expression between B-cells of healthy people and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cells. CLL is the most common lymphoid cancer of the blood and is characterized by a variable clinical course. By comparing samples of patients with an aggressive vs. indolent disease, we identified a limited list of differentially regulated proteins. The enhanced sensitivity attributed to the iTRAQ labels led to the discovery of a previously reported but still not clarified proteolytic product of histone H2A (cH2A) which we further investigated in light of the suggested functional properties of this modification. In the exploratory proteome study the Histone H2A peptide was up-regulated in CLL samples but a more specific and sensitive screening of a larger patient cohort indicated that cH2A is of myeloid origin. Our subsequent quantitative analysis led to a more profound characterization of the clipping in acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells subjected to induced differentiation.","['Glibert, Pieter', 'Vossaert, Liesbeth', 'Van Steendam, Katleen', 'Lambrecht, Stijn', 'Van Nieuwerburgh, Filip', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Kipps, Thomas', 'Dhaenens, Maarten', 'Deforce, Dieter']","['Glibert P', 'Vossaert L', 'Van Steendam K', 'Lambrecht S', 'Van Nieuwerburgh F', 'Offner F', 'Kipps T', 'Dhaenens M', 'Deforce D']","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 72 Harelbekestraat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. pieter.glibert@ugent.be.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 72 Harelbekestraat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. liesbeth.vossaert@ugent.be.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 72 Harelbekestraat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. katleen.vansteendam@ugent.be.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Ghent University Hospital, 185 1P7 De Pintelaan, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. stijn.lambrecht@hotmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 72 Harelbekestraat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. filip.vannieuwerburgh@ugent.be.', 'Department of Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, 185 1P7 De Pintelaan, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. fritz.offner@ugent.be.', 'Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego (UCSD), 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. tkipps@ucsd.edu.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 72 Harelbekestraat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. maarten.dhaenens@ugent.be.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University, 72 Harelbekestraat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium. dieter.deforce@ugent.be.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (Histones)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones/*analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proteolysis', 'Proteomics/methods']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms15069407 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms15069407 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2014 May 27;15(6):9407-21. doi: 10.3390/ijms15069407.,['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20140527,,PMC4100102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we have demonstrated that tigecycline also has in vitro and in vivo activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to its ability to inhibit mitochondrial translation. Tigecycline is relatively unstable after reconstitution, and this instability may limit the use of the drug in ambulatory infusions for the treatment of infection and may prevent the development of optimal dosing schedules for the treatment of AML. This study sought to identify a formulation that improved the stability of the drug after reconstitution and maintained its antimicrobial and antileukemic activity. A panel of chemical additives was tested to identify excipients that enhanced the stability of tigecycline in solution at room temperature for up to one week. We identified a novel formulation containing the oxygen-reducing agents ascorbic acid (3 mg/mL) and pyruvate (60 mg/mL), in saline solution, pH 7.0, in which tigecycline (1 mg/mL) remained intact when protected from light for at least 7 days. This formulation also preserved the drug's antibacterial and antileukemic activity in vitro. Moreover, the novel formulation retained tigecycline's antileukemic activity in vivo. Thus, we identified and characterized a novel formulation for tigecycline that preserves its stability and efficacy after reconstitution.","['Jitkova, Yulia', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Goard, Carolyn A', 'Jhas, Bozhena', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Jitkova Y', 'Gronda M', 'Hurren R', 'Wang X', 'Goard CA', 'Jhas B', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '70JE2N95KR (Tigecycline)', '8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Minocycline/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyruvic Acid/chemistry', 'Tigecycline']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2013/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0095281 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-41688 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 28;9(5):e95281. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0095281. eCollection 2014.,"['R01 CA157456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA157456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20140528,,PMC4037176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The malignant cell in HCL has immunophenotypic features of a mature B cell, but no normal counterpart along the continuum of developing B lymphocytes has been delineated as the cell of origin. We find that the BRAFV600E mutation is present in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in HCL patients, and that these patients exhibit marked alterations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) frequencies. Quantitative sequencing analysis revealed a mean BRAFV600E-mutant allele frequency of 4.97% in HSCs from HCL patients. Moreover, transplantation of BRAFV600E-mutant HSCs from an HCL patient into immunodeficient mice resulted in stable engraftment of BRAFV600E-mutant human hematopoietic cells, revealing the functional self-renewal capacity of HCL HSCs. Consistent with the human genetic data, expression of BRafV600E in murine HSPCs resulted in a lethal hematopoietic disorder characterized by splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, increased circulating soluble CD25, and increased clonogenic capacity of B lineage cells-all classic features of human HCL. In contrast, restricting expression of BRafV600E to the mature B cell compartment did not result in disease. Treatment of HCL patients with vemurafenib, an inhibitor of mutated BRAF, resulted in normalization of HSPC frequencies and increased myeloid and erythroid output from HSPCs. These findings link the pathogenesis of HCL to somatic mutations that arise in HSPCs and further suggest that chronic lymphoid malignancies may be initiated by aberrant HSCs.","['Chung, Stephen S',

METHODS: Outcomes of children (</=18 y) with chronic phase CML (CML-CP) treated with imatinib over a 5 y (2003-2008) period were retrospectively analyzed to quantify responses, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (age range: 6-18 y) received therapy with imatinib 260-300 mg/m(2). Thirty (97 %) achieved complete hematological response at a median of 2 mo from start of treatment. Major and complete cytogenetic response rates at 2 y were 82 % and 70 % respectively. After a median follow up of 49.2 mo the 5 year PFS and OS were 68 % and 76 % respectively. Out of the 16 patients with documented Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCR) at 2 y, none progressed during subsequent follow up. There were no serious toxicities. Most patients who progressed, died of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib is a reasonable first line therapy in pediatric CML-CP, which is effective and well tolerated. Outcomes are comparable to those reported from the West.

However, after As2O3 biotransformation, the role of arsenic metabolites in the clinical efficacy against leukemia still needs to be elucidated. Therefore, to explore the contribution of trivalent methylated arsenicals in the therapeutic effects, we investigated and compared the effects of arsenite (iAs(III)), monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)) and dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)) on HL-60 cells. Methylated arsenic species MMA(III) and DMA(III) showed potentially reduced cell survival with IC50 values of 3 and 2 muM, respectively. We found that methylated metabolites caused apoptosis through oxidative stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, we found that the caspase-9 and -3 were markedly activated by exposure to methylated metabolites, with cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Conversely, cellular apoptosis, generation of ROS, activation of caspase-3, -9 as well as PARP cleavage were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). DNA damage was also markedly observed in HL-60 cells exposed to either MMA(III) or DMA(III), while iAs(III) did not show any relevant effects in HL-60 cells. Likewise, phosphorylation of the histone H2A variant (gamma-H2AX), a biomarker of DNA damage, significantly occurred in cellular nuclei following exposure to two methylated species, which was reduced in the presence of NAC, suggesting that the induction of DNA damage was predominantly caused by the two metabolites via oxidative stress. In conclusion, we suggest that arsenic intermediate metabolites; MMA(III) and DMA(III) might prove to be of clinical relevance in future as such approaches may help in the treatment of leukemia and other types of cancers.","['Rehman, Kanwal', 'Fu, Yu Jie', 'Zhang, Yan Fang', 'Wang, Qian Qian', 'Wu, Bin', 'Wu, Yuan', 'Zhou, Xin Yi', 'Sun, Wu Hui', 'Sun, Tian Fu', 'Naranmandura, Hua']","['Rehman K', 'Fu YJ', 'Zhang YF', 'Wang QQ', 'Wu B', 'Wu Y', 'Zhou XY', 'Sun WH', 'Sun TF', 'Naranmandura H']","['Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (dimethylarsinous acid)', 'AJ2HL7EU8K (Cacodylic Acid)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Arsenites/pharmacology', 'Cacodylic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4mt00119b [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2014 Aug;6(8):1502-12. doi: 10.1039/c4mt00119b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: New roles for miRNAs in biological and disease processes are constantly being discovered. Although great effort has been put into identifying and cataloguing aberrantly expressed miRNAs in leukaemia, very little is known about the functional consequences of their deregulation in myeloid malignancies. This review will discuss the significance of powerful oncogenic miRNAs such as miR-22 in self-renewal and transformation of haematopoietic stem cells, as well as their ability to induce epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of the stem cell disorder myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloid leukaemia. SUMMARY: Improved understanding of biological roles of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of haematological malignancies will allow rational stratification of patients and provide new therapeutic entries for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and leukaemia.","['Song, Su Jung', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Song SJ', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/therapy']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000054 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Jul;21(4):276-82. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000054.,"['R01 CA102142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142874/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA141457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA141457-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4113208,,,,,['NIHMS603840'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation is associated with a good prognosis and rarely shows chemotherapeutic resistance to 3-drug based remission induction phase of treatment as well as overall treatment. Thus, the higher the frequency of this fusion oncogene, the easier to manage childhood ALL in a given region with less intensive chemotherapy. Although global frequency of TEL-AML1 has been reported to be 20-30%, a very low frequency has been found in some geographical regions, including one study from Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan and others from India. The objective of present study was to investigate if this low frequency of TEL- AML1 in pediatric ALL is only in Lahore region or similar situation exists at other representative oncology centers of Pakistan. A total of 167 pediatric ALL patients were recruited from major pediatric oncology centers situated in Lahore, Faisalabad, Peshawar and Islamabad. Patients were tested for TEL-AML1 using nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Only 17 out of 167 (10.2%) patients were found to be TEL-AML1 positive. TEL-AML1+ALL patients had favorable prognosis, most of them (82.4%, 14/17) showing early remission and good overall survival. Thus, our findings indicate an overall low frequency of TEL-AML1 in Pakistan pediatric ALL patients, in accordance with lower representation of this prognostically important genetic abnormality in other less developed countries, specifically in south Asia, thus associating it with poor living standards in these ethnic groups. It also indicates ethnic and geographical differences in the distribution of this prognostically important genetic abnormality among childhood ALL patients, which may have a significant bearing on ALL management strategies in different parts of the world.","['Iqbal, Zafar']",['Iqbal Z'],"['CAMS, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia E-mail : drzafar.medgen@yahoo.com, iqbalz@ksau-hs.edu.sa, iqbalza@ngha.med.sa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Pakistan', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/01/07 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.8.3541 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(8):3541-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.8.3541.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As transport carriers, tumor-derived exosomes are released into the extracellular space and regulate multiple functions of target cells. Thus, we assessed the possibility that exosomes could transport microRNA- 29c as a carrier and correlations between microRNA-29c and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 28 cancer and adjacent tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry to detect BCL-2 and MCL-1 expression. Disease was Ta-T1 in 12 patients, T2-T4 in 16, grade 1 in 8, 2 in 8 and 3 in 12. The expression of microRNA-29c in cancer tissues was detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (QRT- PCR). An adenovirus containing microRNA-29c was used to infect the BIU-87 human bladder cancer cell line. MicroRNA-29c in exosomes was measured by QRT-PCR. After BIU-87 cells were induced by exosomes-derived microRNA-29c, QRT-PCR was used to detect the level of microRNA-29c. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry and BCL-2 and MCL-1 mRNA expressions were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expression of BCL-2 and MCL-1. RESULTS: The expressions of BCL-2 and MCL-1 protein were remarkably increased in bladder carcinoma (p<0.05), but was found mainly in the basal and suprabasal layers in adjacent tissues. The expression of microRNA-29c in cancer tissues was negatively correlated with the BCL-2 and MCL-1. The expression level of microRNA-29c in exosomes and BIU-87 cells from the experiment group was higher than that in control groups (p<0.05). Exosome-derived microRNA-29c induced apoptosis (p<0.01). Although only BCL-2 was reduced at the mRNA level, both BCL-2 and MCL-1 were reduced at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: Human bladder cancer cells infected by microRNA- 29c adenovirus can transport microRNA-29c via exosomes. Moreover, exosome-derived microRNA29c induces apoptosis in bladder cancer cells by down-regulating BCL-2 and MCL-1.","['Xu, Xiang-Dong', 'Wu, Xiao-Hou', 'Fan, Yan-Ru', 'Tan, Bing', 'Quan, Zhen', 'Luo, Chun-Li']","['Xu XD', 'Wu XH', 'Fan YR', 'Tan B', 'Quan Z', 'Luo CL']","['Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China E-mail : 414939334@qq.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Exosomes', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/01/07 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.8.3471 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(8):3471-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.8.3471.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like all proteins, certain asparagine (Asn) residues of ErA are susceptible to deamidation to aspartic acid (Asp), which may be a concern with respect to enzyme activity and potentially to pharmaceutical efficacy. Recombinant ErA mutants containing Asn to Asp changes were expressed, purified and characterised. Two mutants with single deamidation sites (N41D and N281D) were found to have approximately the same specific activity (1,062 and 924 U/mg, respectively) as the wild-type (908 U/mg). However, a double mutant (N41D N281D) had an increased specific activity (1261 U/mg). The N41D mutation conferred a slight increase in the catalytic constant (k cat 657 s(-1)) when compared to the WT (k cat 565 s(-1)), which was further increased in the double mutant, with a k cat of 798 s(-1). Structural analyses showed that the slight changes caused by point mutation of Asn41 to Asp may have reduced the number of hydrogen bonds in this alpha-helical part of the protein structure, resulting in subtle changes in enzyme turnover, both structurally and catalytically. The increased alpha-helical content observed with the N41D mutation by circular dichroism spectroscopy correlates with the difference in k cat, but not K m. The N281D mutation resulted in a lower glutaminase activity compared with WT and the N41D mutant, however the N281D mutation also imparted less stability to the enzyme at elevated temperatures. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that ErA deamidation at the Asn41 and Asn281 sites does not affect enzyme activity and should not be a concern during processing, storage or clinical use. The production of recombinant deamidated variants has proven an effective and powerful means of studying the effect of these changes and may be a useful strategy for other biopharmaceutical products.","['Gervais, David', 'Foote, Nicholas']","['Gervais D', 'Foote N']","['Microbiology Services, Development & Production, Public Health England, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP4 0JG, UK, dave.gervais@phe.gov.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Biotechnol,Molecular biotechnology,9423533,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amides', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Asparaginase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Asparagine/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/*enzymology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects', 'Hydrogen Bonding/drug effects', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/05/16 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12033-014-9766-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biotechnol. 2014 Oct;56(10):865-77. doi: 10.1007/s12033-014-9766-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antiproliferative or proapoptotic effects of capsaicin have been reported in several cancers. We aimed to study miRNAs involved in the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia cell model and the effects of the capsaicin treatment on cell proliferation and miRNA regulation. miR-520a-5p expression was extremely downregulated in capsaicin-treated cells. Repressing the level of miR-520a-5p by transient transfection with specific miRNA inhibitor oligonucleotides resulted in induced inhibition of proliferation in leukemic cells. According to bioinformatics analysis, STAT3 messenger RNA was predicted as a putative miR-520a-5p target; which was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Cell proliferation inhibition was enhanced upon knockdown of STAT3 by RNA interference applications, but when miR-520a-5p inhibitor was additionally transfected onto STAT3 silenced cells, cell viability was dramatically decreased in leukemia cells. Finally, we observed the effects of capsaicin following miR-520a-5p inhibitor transfection upon cell proliferation, apoptosis, and STAT3 expression levels. We determined that, downregulation of miR-520a-5p affected the proliferation inhibition enhanced by capsaicin and reduced STAT3 mRNA and protein expression levels and increased apoptotic cell number. In summary, miR-520a-5p displays a therapeutic effect by targeting STAT3 and impacting the anticancer effects of capsaicin; whereas capsaicin, potentially through the miR-520a-5p/STAT3 interaction, induces apoptosis and inhibits K562 leukemic cell proliferation with need of further investigation.","['Kaymaz, Burcin Tezcanli', 'Cetintas, Vildan Bozok', 'Aktan, Cagdas', 'Kosova, Buket']","['Kaymaz BT', 'Cetintas VB', 'Aktan C', 'Kosova B']","['Medical Biology Department, Ege University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey, bt1980@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (MIRN520 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Capsaicin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2014/05/30 06:00,2014/12/30 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2138-z [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Sep;35(9):8733-42. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2138-z.

Because CCR9 chemokine receptor expression is very restricted in healthy tissue, whereas it is present in tumors of distinct origins including leukemias, melanomas, prostate and ovary carcinomas, it can be considered a suitable candidate for target-directed therapy. Here, we report the generation and characterization of 91R, a mouse anti-human CCR9 IgG2b monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope within the CCR9 N-terminal domain. This antibody inhibits the growth of subcutaneous xenografts from human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells in immunodeficient Rag2(-/-) mice. Tumor size in 91R-treated mice was reduced by 85% compared with isotype-matched antibody-treated controls. Tumor reduction in 91R-treated mice was concomitant with an increase in the apoptotic cell fraction and tumor necrotic areas, as well as a decrease in the fraction of proliferating cells and in tumor vascularization. In the presence of complement or murine natural killer cells, 91R promoted in vitro lysis of MOLT-4 leukemia cells, indicating that this antibody might eliminate tumor cells via complement- and cell-dependent cytotoxicity. The results show the potential of the 91R monoclonal antibody as a therapeutic agent for treatment of CCR9-expressing tumors.","['Chamorro, Sonia', 'Vela, Maria', 'Franco-Villanueva, Ana', 'Carramolino, Laura', 'Gutierrez, Julio', 'Gomez, Lucio', 'Lozano, Maria', 'Salvador, Beatriz', 'Garcia-Gallo, Monica', 'Martinez-A, Carlos', 'Kremer, Leonor']","['Chamorro S', 'Vela M', 'Franco-Villanueva A', 'Carramolino L', 'Gutierrez J', 'Gomez L', 'Lozano M', 'Salvador B', 'Garcia-Gallo M', 'Martinez-A C', 'Kremer L']","['Department of Immunology and Oncology; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain; Current Affiliation: Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares; Instituto de Salud Carlos III (CNIC/ISCIII); Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain; Protein Tools Unit; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain; Protein Tools Unit; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Plant Molecular Genetics; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.', 'Protein Tools Unit; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain; Protein Tools Unit; Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CNB/CSIC); Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CC chemokine receptor 9)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, CCR)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, CCR/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/02/13 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['29063 [pii]', '10.4161/mabs.29063 [doi]']",ppublish,MAbs. 2014 Jul-Aug;6(4):1000-12. doi: 10.4161/mabs.29063.

Although several features can be useful in the diagnosis of CLL, the most important is the immunophenotype.Two staging systems--the Binet system and the Rai classification--are used to assess risk. After diagnosis, the first major therapeutic decision is when to initiate therapy, as a watchful waiting approach is often appropriate for patients with asymptomatic disease. Once a patient has met the criteria for treatment, the choice of therapy is the next major decision. Younger patients (<65 years) often receive more aggressive treatment that typically consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy. There is a great unmet need concerning treatment of older patients with CLL, who often present with more comorbid conditions that can decrease their ability to tolerate particular regimens. The current standard of care for older patients with CLL is rituximab plus chlorambucil. The concept of targeted agents is currently an area of intense interest in CLL. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib is the targeted agent that is furthest along in clinical development. It is associated with an overall survival rate of 83%. Idelalisib targets the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase and is under evaluation in pivotal trials. Targeted agents offer much promise in terms of efficacy, toxicity, and oral availability. They will change the management of patients with CLL.","[""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Furman, Richard R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Smith, Ashbel']","[""O'Brien SM"", 'Furman RR', 'Byrd JC', 'Smith A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/trends']",2014/05/30 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2014 Jan;12(1 Suppl 3):1-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responses of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients to cytarabine (Ara-C)-based therapies are often short lived with a median overall survival of months. Therapies are under development to improve outcomes and include targeting the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E) with its inhibitor ribavirin. In a Phase II clinical trial in poor prognosis AML, ribavirin monotherapy yielded promising responses including remissions; however, all patients relapsed. Here we identify a novel form of drug resistance to ribavirin and Ara-C. We observe that the sonic hedgehog transcription factor glioma-associated protein 1 (GLI1) and the UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A) family of enzymes are elevated in resistant cells. UGT1As add glucuronic acid to many drugs, modifying their activity in diverse tissues. GLI1 alone is sufficient to drive UGT1A-dependent glucuronidation of ribavirin and Ara-C, and thus drug resistance. Resistance is overcome by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of GLI1, revealing a potential strategy to overcome drug resistance in some patients.","['Zahreddine, Hiba Ahmad', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic, Biljana', 'Assouline, Sarit', 'Gendron, Patrick', 'Romeo, Andrea A', 'Morris, Stephen J', 'Cormack, Gregory', 'Jaquith, James B', 'Cerchietti, Leandro', 'Cocolakis, Eftihia', 'Amri, Abdellatif', 'Bergeron, Julie', 'Leber, Brian', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Pei, Shanshan', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Miller, Wilson H', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Zahreddine HA', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic B', 'Assouline S', 'Gendron P', 'Romeo AA', 'Morris SJ', 'Cormack G', 'Jaquith JB', 'Cerchietti L', 'Cocolakis E', 'Amri A', 'Bergeron J', 'Leber B', 'Becker MW', 'Pei S', 'Jordan CT', 'Miller WH', 'Borden KL']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, P.O.

Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. RESULTS: We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLCgamma2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLCgamma2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLCgamma2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell-receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

It is unclear why cardiac myxomas develop. We describe a case of comorbid myxoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to offer insights into the tumor's pathophysiology. Case. A 56-year-old female with recurrent venous thromboembolism developed embolic stroke. Transesophageal echocardiogram showed a 1.7 x 1 cm sessile left atrial mass at the interatrial septum. Histopathology revealed myxoma with a B cell lymphocytic infiltrate suggestive of a low grade lymphoproliferative disorder. Bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry of blood and the cardiac infiltrate supported the diagnosis of atypical CLL. She was followed clinically in the absence of symptoms, organ infiltration, or cytopenia. After eighteen months, she developed cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Biopsy confirmed B cell CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma. She elected to undergo chemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, with clinical remission. Conclusions. The coexistence of two neoplastic processes may be coincidental, but the cumulative likelihood is estimated at 0.002 per billion people per year. A shared pathogenic mechanism is more likely. Possibilities include chronic inflammation, vascular endothelial growth factor A, shared genetic mutations, changes in posttranslational regulation, or alterations in other cellular signaling pathways. Additional studies could expand our current understanding of the molecular biology of both myxomas and CLL.","['Laird-Fick, Heather', 'Tiwari, Ashish', 'Narayanan, Santhosshi', 'Qin, Ying', 'Vodnala, Deepthi', 'Bhutani, Manisha']","['Laird-Fick H', 'Tiwari A', 'Narayanan S', 'Qin Y', 'Vodnala D', 'Bhutani M']","['Department of Medicine, Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, 788 Service Road Suite B301, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, 788 Service Road Suite B301, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'Good Shepherd Medical Center, 700 East Marshall Avenue, Longview, TX 75601, USA.', 'Pathology Department, EW Sparrow Hospital, 1215 East Michigan Avenue, Lansing, MI 48909-7980, USA.', 'St. John Hospital and Medical Center, VEP, 2nd Floor, Cath Lab, Internal Mailbox 110, 22101 Moross Road, Detroit, MI 48236, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, 10 Center Drive 10/12N226, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Case Rep Oncol Med,Case reports in oncological medicine,101581035,,,,2014/05/29 06:00,2014/05/29 06:01,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/142746 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Oncol Med. 2014;2014:142746. doi: 10.1155/2014/142746.

AIM: To analyze the hematological parameters and bone marrow findings in a group of patients diagnosed with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLD) and hepatitis viruses B, C, D infections, which were included in the research grant (acronym LIMFO-VIR) between December 2007 and May 2010 in the Hematology Department of the Emergency University Hospital of Bucharest. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were diagnosed by using immunopathology according to the WHO criteria. The analyzed group included 42 patients (both sexes), with the mean age of 60,35 years. The most frequent hematologic disease was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 30/42 (71,42%), followed by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (16,66%) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (7,14%). Hepatitis viruses were distributed: 17/42 (40,47%) patients with HBV, 22/42 (52,38%) with HCV and 3/42 (7,14%) had a double/triple association of viruses. Most of the patients had an indolent type of disease - 27/42 (64,28%), whereas 15/42 (35,71%) had an aggressive one, pattern found both in the HBV and HCV infected groups. An abnormal bone marrow result was revealed in 32/42 (76,19%) patients, 19 (59,37%) of them being HCV infected. Myelodysplasia was found in 6/42(14,28%) patients, the majority being HCV infected, all having an indolent form of CLD. The antiviral therapy did not influence the hematological parameters (no significant differences were found between the groups with/without an antiviral therapy). DISCUSSIONS: Patients with hepatitis virus infections may associate neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; the mechanisms are thought to involve hypersplenism, autoimmune processes and antiviral therapy. We excluded the influence of chemotherapy, as the study was performed before the treatment. In our group, patients whether HBV or HCV infected, presented an isolated cytopenia. The abnormal bone marrow cellularity (increased or decreased) and dysplasia were found especially in the HCV group. There are studies showing no association between myelodysplasia and hepatitis viruses; others found a strong relation of these. One of the mechanisms of myelodysplasia could be a dysregulation of the immune system. Conclusions. Bone marrow/peripheral blood features correlate with the type of viral infection and HCV is more prone to develop additional hematological changes than HBV. The degree of bone marrow involvement by CLDs influences these features. We considered mandatory to perform a bone marrow analysis at the diagnosis of CLDs to stage and to establish if other bone marrow changes were present, a crucial aspect for therapy and outcome of the disease. The association between the hepatitis viruses - myelodysplasia- autoimmunity seems to have a role in the lymphoproliferative disorders etiology.

Additionally, standardizing ZAP-70 expression analysis has been unsuccessful. CpG+223 methylation was quantitatively determined in 295 untreated CLL cases using MassARRAY. Impact on clinical outcome vs CD38 and ZAP-70 expression and IGHV status was evaluated. Cases with low methylation (<20%) had significantly shortened time to first treatment (TT) and overall survival (OS) (P < .0001). For TT, low methylation defined a large subset of ZAP-70 protein-negative cases with significantly shortened TT (median, 8.0 vs 3.9 years for high vs low methylation; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.74). Conversely, 16 ZAP-70 protein-positive cases with high methylation had poor outcome (median, 1.1 vs 2.3 years for high vs low methylation; HR = 1.62; 95% CI, 0.87-3.03). For OS, ZAP-70 methylation was the strongest risk factor; CD38 and ZAP-70 expression or IGHV status did not significantly improve OS prediction. A pyrosequencing assay was established that reproduced the MassARRAY data (kappa coefficient > 0.90). Thus, ZAP-70 CpG+223 methylation represents a superior biomarker for TT and OS that can be feasibly measured, supporting its use in risk-stratifying CLL.","['Claus, Rainer', 'Lucas, David M', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Williams, Katie E', 'Weng, Daniel', 'Patterson, Kara', 'Zucknick, Manuela', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Greaves, Andrew W', 'Geyer, Susan', 'Wierda, William G', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Gribben, John G', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Shields, Peter', 'Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Byrd, John C']","['Claus R', 'Lucas DM', 'Ruppert AS', 'Williams KE', 'Weng D', 'Patterson K', 'Zucknick M', 'Oakes CC', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Greaves AW', 'Geyer S', 'Wierda WG', 'Brown JR', 'Gribben JG', 'Barrientos JC', 'Rai KR', 'Kay NE', 'Kipps TJ', 'Shields P', 'Zhao W', 'Grever MR', 'Plass C', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany; Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Central Office of CLL Research Consortium, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA;', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Central Office of CLL Research Consortium, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA;', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Institute of Cancer, Centre for Medical Oncology, Barts and The London School of Medicine, University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, New Hyde Park, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, New Hyde Park, NY; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Central Office of CLL Research Consortium, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA;', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Division of Hematology and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/05/29 06:00,2014/08/29 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40022-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-02-555722 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 3;124(1):42-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-02-555722.

In preclinical models, lenalidomide acted synergistically with rituximab. The CLL Research Consortium initiated a phase II study to evaluate this combination in treatment-naive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lenalidomide was initiated at 2.5 mg/day and was escalated based on treatment tolerability to a maximum of 10 mg/day, for 21 days/cycle, for a maximum of seven cycles. Rituximab was administered at the end of cycle 1 and was continued for seven cycles. Patients received allopurinol and aspirin for prophylaxis. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients enrolled onto one of two age-specific strata; patients' median age was 56 and 70 years for arms A and B, respectively. Patients in the older-patient stratum more frequently had elevated serum beta-2 microglobulin levels, high-risk Rai stage, and were less likely to complete the maximum planned therapy. Adverse events were similar in the two arms. Nonhematologic toxicity was predominantly at grade 1/2, and neutropenia was the most common hematologic adverse event. The response rate for arm A was 95%, with 20% complete responses (CRs) and 20% nodular partial responses. Of arm B patients, 78% achieved a response, of which 11% were CRs. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 19 months for the younger cohort and 20 months for the older cohort. CONCLUSION: Intrapatient dose-escalation was safe. The majority of patients reached the maximum lenalidomide dose and experienced a response to a defined seven-cycle course of lenalidomide and rituximab therapy. Despite differences in baseline characteristics and the response rate between the two strata, the PFS did not differ.","['James, Danelle F', 'Werner, Lillian', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Wierda, William G', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', 'Castro, Januario E', 'Greaves, Andrew', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['James DF', 'Werner L', 'Brown JR', 'Wierda WG', 'Barrientos JC', 'Castro JE', 'Greaves A', 'Johnson AJ', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Rai KR', 'Neuberg D', 'Kipps TJ']","['Danelle F.

We describe here the in vivo acquisition of resistance to voriconazole (VRC) by C. krusei isolates recovered from a leukemia patient during a long period of VRC therapy. In order to mimic the in vivo development of VRC resistance, a susceptible C. krusei isolate was exposed daily to 1 mug/ml of VRC in vitro. Interestingly, after 5 days of exposure to VRC, a MIC of 4 mug/ml was achieved; this value remained constant after 25 additional days of treatment with VRC and also after 30 consecutive days of incubation in VRC-free medium. Our objective was to determine the associated molecular resistance mechanisms, such as expression of efflux pump genes and ERG11 gene mutations, among the resistant strains. Synergistic effects between the efflux blocker tacrolimus (FK506) and VRC were found in all of the resistant strains. Moreover, ABC1 gene expression increased over time in both the in vivo- and in vitro-induced resistant strains, in contrast to the ABC2 and ERG11 genes, whose expression was invariably lower and constant. ERG11 gene sequencing showed two different types of mutations, i.e., heterozygosity at T1389T/C, corresponding to synonymous mutations, in C. krusei strains and a missense mutation at position T418C, resulting in a change from Tyr to His, among resistant C. krusei clinical isolates. This study highlights the relevance of ATP-dependent efflux pump (namely, Abc1p) activity in VRC resistance and describes new mutations in the ERG11 gene among resistant C. krusei clinical isolates.","['Ricardo, Elisabete', 'Miranda, Isabel M', 'Faria-Ramos, Isabel', 'Silva, Raquel M', 'Rodrigues, Acacio Goncalves', 'Pina-Vaz, Cidalia']","['Ricardo E', 'Miranda IM', 'Faria-Ramos I', 'Silva RM', 'Rodrigues AG', 'Pina-Vaz C']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal Cardiovascular R&D Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal ericardo@med.up.pt.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal Cardiovascular R&D Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal CINTESIS-Center for Health Technology and Services Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'IPATIMUP-Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal CINTESIS-Center for Health Technology and Services Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal CINTESIS-Center for Health Technology and Services Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal Department of Microbiology, Hospital Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'EC 1.14.14.154 (Sterol 14-Demethylase)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Candida/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Candidiasis/complications/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal/drug effects/*genetics', 'Fluconazole/pharmacology', 'Fungal Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Sterol 14-Demethylase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tacrolimus/pharmacology', 'Voriconazole/pharmacology']",2014/05/29 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.02603-14 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.02603-14 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Aug;58(8):4604-11. doi: 10.1128/AAC.02603-14.

Starting in January 2003, we prospectively assigned patients with AML with high-risk clinical features to preemptive alloHCT (p-alloHCT) as soon as possible after reinduction chemotherapy. High-risk clinical features were associated with poor response to chemotherapy: primary induction failure, second or greater relapse, and first CR interval <6 months. We hypothesized that any residual disease would be maximally reduced at the time of transplant, resulting in the best milieu and most lead time for developing a graft-versus-leukemia effect and in improved long-term overall survival (OS) without excess toxicity. This analysis studied the effect of transplant timing on p-alloHCT in 30 patients with high-risk clinical features of 156 consecutive AML patients referred for alloHCT. We compared early p-alloHCT within 4 weeks of reinduction chemotherapy before count recovery with late p-alloHCT 4 weeks after reinduction chemotherapy with count recovery. OS and progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years were not significantly different for early versus late p-alloHCT (OS 23% versus 33%, respectively, P > .1; PFS 18% versus 22%, respectively, P > .1). Day 100 and 1-year transplant-related mortality were similar (33.3% versus 22.2%, P > .1; 44.4% versus 42.9%, P > .1, respectively). Preemptive alloHCT allowed 30 patients to be transplanted who would normally not receive alloHCT. Clinical outcomes for early p-alloHCT are similar to those for late p-alloHCT without excess toxicity. Early p-alloHCT is a feasible alternative to late p-alloHCT for maximizing therapy of AML that is poorly responsive to induction chemotherapy.","['Chen, George L', 'Liu, Hong', 'Zhang, Yali', 'Thomas, Julie', 'Ross, Maureen', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Block, AnneMarie W', 'Sait, Sheila', 'Deeb, George', 'Wallace, Paul', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Hahn, Theresa', 'McCarthy, Philip L']","['Chen GL', 'Liu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Thomas J', 'Ross M', 'Wang ES', 'Block AW', 'Sait S', 'Deeb G', 'Wallace P', 'Wetzler M', 'Hahn T', 'McCarthy PL']","['Department of Medicine, BMT Program, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, BMT Program, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, BMT Program, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, BMT Program, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, BMT Program, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Division, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Flow Cytometry, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Division, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, BMT Program, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, BMT Program, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.

Although most alloimmunized patients will respond to HLA-matched platelets, 20-50% of patients will remain refractory even to matched platelets. Several measures have been reported to overcome this complication, such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), plasma exchange (PE), protein A column therapy, or rituximab. We report a woman with acute myeloid leukemia secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome who was diagnosed with PR because of HLA alloimmunization. Due to difficulties in finding HLA-compatible platelet donors by cross-reactive groups in our panel of HLA-typed platelet donors, the patient received treatment with rituximab, PEs and IVIG. With this treatment strategy, the presence of HLA antibodies decreased from a panel-reactive antibody (PRA) of 89-0%. This allowed the performance of hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation with random donor platelets. Rituximab, PE, and IVIG may be an option to overcome severe PR due to poly-specific HLA alloimmunization.","['Cid, Joan', 'Magnano, Laura', 'Acosta, Maria', 'Alba, Cristina', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Lozano, Miguel']","['Cid J', 'Magnano L', 'Acosta M', 'Alba C', 'Esteve J', 'Lozano M']","['Apheresis Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, CDB, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona , Spain and.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Platelets,Platelets,9208117,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, Human Platelet)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Human Platelet/*immunology', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/blood/*etiology/*therapy', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulins, Intravenous', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', '*Plasma Exchange', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/05/29 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09537104.2014.895922 [doi]'],ppublish,Platelets. 2015;26(2):190-4. doi: 10.3109/09537104.2014.895922.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a RNA-Seq profiling of an AML patient with complete remission after treatment, to analyze the aberrant splicing of genes during treatment. We sequenced 3.97 and 3.32 Gbp clean data of the AML and remission sample, respectively. Firstly, by analyzing biomarkers associated with AML, to assist normal clinical tests, we confirmed that the patient was anormal karyo type, with NPM1 and IDH2 mutations and deregulation patterns of related genes, such as BAALC, ERG, MN1 and HOX family. Then, we performed alternative splicing detection of the AML and remission sample. RESULTS: We detected 91 differentially splicing events in 68 differentially splicing genes (DSGs) by mixture of isoforms (MISO). Considering Psi values (Psi) and confidence intervals, 25 differentially expressed isoforms were identified as more confident isoforms, which were associated with RNA processing, cellular macromolecule catabolic process and DNA binding according to GO enrichment analysis. An exon2-skipping event in oncogene FOS (FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog) were detected and validated in this study. FOS has a critical function in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and transformation. The exon2-skipping isoform of FOS was increased significantly after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: All the data and information of RNA-Seq provides highly accurate and comprehensive supplements to conventional clinical tests of AML. Moreover, the splicing aberrations would be another source for biomarker and even therapeutic target discovery. More information of splicing may also assist the better understanding of leukemogenesis.","['Li, X-y', 'Yao, X', 'Li, S-n', 'Suo, A-l', 'Ruan, Z-p', 'Liang, X', 'Kong, Y', 'Zhang, W-g', 'Yao, Y']","['Li XY', 'Yao X', 'Li SN', 'Suo AL', 'Ruan ZP', 'Liang X', 'Kong Y', 'Zhang WG', 'Yao Y']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi, China. 13572101611@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'Remission Induction', '*Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/05/29 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2014;18(9):1426-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tweets from cancer patients could offer insight into the needs of cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand cancer patients' social media usage and gain insight into patient needs. METHODS: A search was conducted of every publicly available user profile on Twitter in Japan for references to the following: breast cancer, leukemia, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. We then used an application programming interface and a data mining method to conduct a detailed analysis of the tweets from cancer patients. RESULTS: Twitter user profiles included references to breast cancer (n=313), leukemia (n=158), uterine or cervical cancer (n=134), lung cancer (n=87), colon cancer (n=64), and stomach cancer (n=44). A co-occurrence network is seen for all of these cancers, and each cancer has a unique network conformation. Keywords included words about diagnosis, symptoms, and treatments for almost all cancers. Words related to social activities were extracted for breast cancer. Words related to vaccination and support from public insurance were extracted for uterine or cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that cancer patients share information about their underlying disease, including diagnosis, symptoms, and treatments, via Twitter. This information could prove useful to health care providers.","['Tsuya, Atsushi', 'Sugawara, Yuya', 'Tanaka, Atsushi', 'Narimatsu, Hiroto']","['Tsuya A', 'Sugawara Y', 'Tanaka A', 'Narimatsu H']","['Yamagata University Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamagata University, Yonezawa, Japan .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', '*Neoplasms', 'Patients', 'Social Media/*statistics & numerical data']",2014/05/29 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['v16i5e137 [pii]', '10.2196/jmir.3298 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2014 May 27;16(5):e137. doi: 10.2196/jmir.3298.,,20140527,,PMC4060148,['NOTNLM'],"['Internet', 'Web 2.0', 'co-occurrence', 'communication', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They do so via activating several different downstream substrates such as myosin light chain phosphatase, LIM kinase and ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins. To date, most of the conclusions with regard to the function of ROCKs have involved the use of cell line models, pharmacologic inhibitors and dominant negative approaches. Importantly, the role of ROCK in hematopoiesis or leukemogenesis in the context of whole organism remains poorly understood. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies utilizing mice deficient in the expression of ROCK1 have begun to shed some light into the physiologic role(s) of ROCK in both normal and abnormal hematopoiesis. Findings, thus far, suggest that ROCK plays an essential role in regulating growth and survival in different hematopoietic lineages via distinct mechanisms, in part, by utilizing distinct downstream substrates including maintaining the activation of tumor-suppressor genes. SUMMARY: In blood cells, emerging data suggest that ROCK plays an essential role in negatively regulating inflammatory and erythropoietic stress and positively regulates the growth and survival of leukemic cells.","['Mali, Raghuveer Singh', 'Kapur, Simryn', 'Kapur, Reuben']","['Mali RS', 'Kapur S', 'Kapur R']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/physiology', 'Stress, Physiological', 'rho-Associated Kinases/*genetics/*metabolism']",2014/05/29 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000056 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Jul;21(4):271-5. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000056.,"['R01 CA173852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL077177/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL081111/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4372239,,,,,['NIHMS672733'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Still, CGIs represent only a small fraction of the methylome. We aimed to characterize genome-wide differential methylation of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) cells compared with normal CD34(+) bone marrow cells using the Illumina 450K methylation array. Differential methylation in CN-AML was most prominent in genomic areas far from CGIs, in so called open sea regions. Furthermore, differential methylation was specifically found in genes encoding transcription factors (TFs), with WT1 being the most differentially methylated TF. Among genetic mutations in AML, DNMT3A mutations showed the most prominent association with the DNA methylation pattern, characterized by hypomethylation of CGIs (as compared with DNMT3A wild type cases). The differential methylation in DNMT3A mutant cells vs. wild type cells was predominantly found in HOX genes, which were hypomethylated. These results were confirmed and validated in an independent CN-AML cohort. In conclusion, we show that, in CN-AML, the most pronounced changes in DNA methylation occur in non-CGI regions and that DNMT3A mutations confer a pattern of global hypomethylation that specifically targets HOX genes.","['Qu, Ying', 'Lennartsson, Andreas', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Deneberg, Stefan', 'Karimi, Mohsen', 'Bengtzen, Sofia', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Lehmann, Soren']","['Qu Y', 'Lennartsson A', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Deneberg S', 'Karimi M', 'Bengtzen S', 'Hoglund M', 'Bullinger L', 'Dohner K', 'Lehmann S']","['Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM); Department of Medicine Huddinge; Karolinska Institute; Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition; NOVUM; Karolinska Institutet; Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III; University Hospital of Ulm; Ulm, Germany.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM); Department of Medicine Huddinge; Karolinska Institute; Stockholm, Sweden; Hematology Centre, M54; Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institute; Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM); Department of Medicine Huddinge; Karolinska Institute; Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM); Department of Medicine Huddinge; Karolinska Institute; Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology; Uppsala University Hospital; Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III; University Hospital of Ulm; Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III; University Hospital of Ulm; Ulm, Germany.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM); Department of Medicine Huddinge; Karolinska Institute; Stockholm, Sweden; Hematology Centre, M54; Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institute; Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', '*CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Female', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Transcriptome', 'WT1 Proteins/metabolism']",2014/05/29 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['29315 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.29315 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2014 Aug;9(8):1108-19. doi: 10.4161/epi.29315.

The article provides a brief description of the development, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of APL. METHOD: The article is based on the authors' own experience and reviews of key articles and national and international guidelines. RESULTS: The disease is caused by a single genetic event, namely the translocation t(15;17), which gives rise to the oncoprotein PML-RARA. Clinical and morphological characteristics arouse suspicion of the disease, and the diagnosis is verified by detecting the translocation. At the time of diagnosis most patients have severe coagulopathy and the predominant clinical manifestation is bleeding. Early mortality is due to severe haemorrhage, usually intracranial. Early treatment start with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on suspicion of APL is essential to reduce this early mortality. ATRA is also an important part of continued treatment, in combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and possibly arsenic. After this treatment, the prognosis for disease-free long-term survival is > 90%. There are also safe and effective treatment options for elderly patients with complex comorbidities. INTERPRETATION: With APL it is particularly important to start disease-targeting therapy in the form of ATRA quickly because of the high risk of serious haemorrhages and high early mortality. If serious haemorrhages are avoided, the prognosis is very good.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Hovland R', 'Bruserud O']","[""King's College London School of Medicine Cancer Genetics Lab Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics Guy's Hospital London * Noverande adresse: Medisinsk avdeling, Haukeland universitetssjukehus."", 'Senter for medisinsk genetikk og molekylaermedisin Haukeland universitetssjukehus.', 'Medisinsk avdeling Haukeland universitetssjukehus og Klinisk institutt 2 Det medisinsk-odontologiske fakultet Universitetet i Bergen.']",['nor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2014/05/29 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3177946 [pii]', '10.4045/tidsskr.13.1508 [doi]']",epublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2014 May 27;134(10):1052-5. doi: 10.4045/tidsskr.13.1508. eCollection 2014 May 27.,,20140527,['Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2014 May 27;134(10):1017.

From 2000 to 2010, it was approved by the FDA for treatment of relapsed, older patients with CD33(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). After withdrawal from the market, several trials have provided new evidence on the safety and clinical efficacy of GO. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss pharmacological and clinical aspects of GO. GO was found to show benefit in AML patients as adjunct to intensive chemotherapy when it was given in parallel to induction therapy. The benefit was restricted to patients with a favorable- or an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile. Higher doses of GO above 6 mg/m(2) per administration were associated with increased toxicity without survival benefit, whereas repetitive doses of 3 mg/m(2) resulting in cumulative doses of 9 mg/m(2) were well tolerated. Predictive markers for response to GO other than the cytogenetic profile and P-glycoprotein activity are still missing. EXPERT OPINION: GO as adjunct and in parallel to intensive induction chemotherapy does significantly improve survival end points in AML patients with favorable/intermediate-risk cytogenetics. A dose of 3 mg/m(2) per administration appears safer compared with 6 mg/m(2) and even 9 mg/m(2).","['Thol, Felicitas', 'Schlenk, Richard F']","['Thol F', 'Schlenk RF']","['Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation , Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aminoglycosides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/epidemiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Failure']",2014/05/29 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2014.922534 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2014 Aug;14(8):1185-95. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2014.922534.

Peptides representing BH3 region of pro-apoptotic proteins have been shown to bind the hydrophobic cleft of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and this segment is responsible for modulating the apoptotic pathways in living cells. Understanding the molecular basis of protein-peptide interaction is required to develop potent inhibitors specific for Mcl-1. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for Mcl-1 in complex with three different BH3 peptides derived from Mcl-1, Bax, and Bim. Accordingly, the calculated binding free energies using MM-PBSA method are obtained and comparison with the experimentally determined binding free energies is made. The interactions involving two conserved charged residues (Aspi, and Arg/Lysi-4) and three upstream conserved hydrophobic residues (Leui-5, Ile/Vali-2, and Glyi-1, respectively) of BH3 peptides play the important roles in the structural stability of the complexes. The calculated results exhibit that the interactions of Bim BH3 peptides to Mcl-1 is stronger than the complex with Bax 19BH3 peptides. The hydrophobic residues (position i - 9, i - 8 and i + 2) of BH3 peptides can be involved in their inhibitory specificity. The calculated results can be used for designing more effective MCL-1 inhibitors.","['Zhao, Run-Ning', 'Fan, Song', 'Han, Ju-Guang', 'Liu, Guang']","['Zhao RN', 'Fan S', 'Han JG', 'Liu G']","['a Institute of Applied Mathematics and Physics , Shanghai Dianji University , Shanghai 201306 , P.R.

However, several cancer types display resistance to different antitumoral compounds due to multidrug resistance (MDR). Thus, MDR is a major drawback in anticancer therapy. In that sense, the leukemic cell line K-562 shows resistance to edelfosine. This resistance is overcome by the use of nanotechnology. The present work describes the rate and mechanism of internalization of free and nanoencapsulated edelfosine. The molecular mechanisms underlying cell death are described in the present paper by characterization of several molecules implied in the apoptosic and autophagic pathways (PARP, LC3IIB, caspases-3, -9 and -7), and their pattern of expression is compared with the cell induction in a sensitive cell line HL-60. Results showed different internalization patterns in both cells. Clathrin and lipid raft mediated endocytosis were observable in edelfosine uptake, whereas these mechanism were not visible in the uptake of lipid nanoparticles, which might suffer phagocytosis and macropinocytosis. Both treatments induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells, whereas this cell death mechanism was unnoticeable in K-562 cells. Moreover, an important increase in autophagic vesicles was visible in K-562 cells. Thus, this mechanism might be implicated in overcoming K-562 resistance with the treatment by lipid nanoparticles.","['Aznar, Maria Angela', 'Lasa-Saracibar, Beatriz', 'Blanco-Prieto, Maria J']","['Aznar MA', 'Lasa-Saracibar B', 'Blanco-Prieto MJ']","['Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmacy, University of Navarra , C/Irunlarrea 1, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Endocytosis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Nanomedicine/methods', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*administration & dosage', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2014/05/29 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp5000696 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2014 Aug 4;11(8):2650-8. doi: 10.1021/mp5000696.

The purposes of this study were to evaluate the effects of isoalantolactone on the human erythroleukemia drug-resistant cell line K562/A02 and to provide evidence of its function as a potent therapeutic agent in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia with the Bcr/Abl phenotype. Our results showed that isoalantolactone significantly inhibited K562/A02 cell growth by downregulating Bcr/Abl expression. Isoalantolactone also induced apoptosis via increase generation of reactive oxygen species, modulation of the protein levels of Bcl-2 family members, caspase activation, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and release of cytochrome c.

Taken together, all these findings support that growth inhibition effects of isoalantolactone on K562/A02 cells may be mediated through caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways, S phase arrest, and downregulation of Bcr/Abl.","['Cai, Hong', 'Meng, Xiuxiang', 'Li, Yuzhong', 'Yang, Chuihui', 'Liu, Yong']","['Cai H', 'Meng X', 'Li Y', 'Yang C', 'Liu Y']","['Clinical Laboratory, The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116023, PR China; Clinical Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110004, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'BYH07P620U (isoalantolactone)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology']",2014/05/29 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2013/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.5182 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2014 Nov;28(11):1679-86. doi: 10.1002/ptr.5182.

Blood transfusion is a common transmission pathway for HTLV-1. However, no surveys to determine the overall prevalence of HTLV-1 infection and HTLV-1 genotypes among blood donors on the Chinese mainland have yet been conducted. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on this topic was carried out. Data manipulation and statistical analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta Analysis Version 2.0 program. RESULTS: Forty-four eligible articles involving 458525 blood donors were selected. Analysis revealed the pooled prevalences of HTLV-1 infection among blood donors in Fujian and Guangdong provinces to be 9.9/10000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4/10000-22.2/10000) and 2.9/10000 (95% CI 1.7/10000-4.8/10000), respectively; there were only two cases of HTLV-1 infection among 204763 donors in other areas of the Chinese mainland. In addition, 40 of 42 (95.2%) HTLV-1 isolates belonged to the Transcontinental subgroup A of the HTLV-1 subtype A (Cosmopolitan subtype). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HTLV-1 infection among blood donors is low and restricted mainly to the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Most isolates belong to the Transcontinental subgroup within HTLV-1 subtype A.","['Li, Xin', 'Chen, Yuanzhong', 'Wu, Zhengjun', 'Zhang, Na']","['Li X', 'Chen Y', 'Wu Z', 'Zhang N']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, 350001, P.

It is also a transport substrate of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux transporters ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, P-gp) and ABCG2 (BCRP), which may have an effect on the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of this drug. The goal of this study was to identify pharmacophoric features of nilotinib in order to potentially develop specific inhibitors of BCR-ABL kinase with minimal interactions with ABC drug transporters. Three-dimensional pharmacophore modeling and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies were carried out on a series of nilotinib analogues to identify chemical features that contribute to inhibitory activity of nilotinib against BCR-ABL kinase activity, P-gp, and ABCG2. Twenty-five derivatives of nilotinib were synthesized and were then tested to measure their activity to inhibit BCR-ABL kinase and to inhibit the function of ABC drug transporters. A set of in vitro experiments including kinase activity and cell-based transport assays and photolabeling of P-gp and ABCG2 with a transport substrate, [(125)I]-iodoarylazido-prazosin (IAAP), were carried out in isolated membranes to evaluate the potency of the derivatives to inhibit the function of ABC drug transporters and BCR-ABL kinase. Sixteen, fourteen, and ten compounds were selected as QSAR data sets, respectively, to generate PHASE v3.1 pharmacophore models for BCR-ABL kinase, ABCG2, and P-gp inhibitors. The IC50 values of these derivatives against P-gp, ABCG2, or BCR-ABL kinase were used to generate pharmacophore features required for optimal interactions with these targets. A seven-point pharmacophore (AADDRRR) for BCR-ABL kinase inhibitory activity, a six-point pharmacophore (ADHRRR) for ABCG2 inhibitory activity, and a seven-point pharmacophore (AADDRRR) for P-gp inhibitory activity were generated. The derived models clearly demonstrate high predictive power for test sets of BCR-ABL, ABCG2, and P-gp inhibitors. In aggregate, these results should aid in the development of specific inhibitors of BCR-ABL kinase that exhibit no or minimal interaction with ABC drug transporters.","['Shukla, Suneet', 'Kouanda, Abdul', 'Silverton, Latoya', 'Talele, Tanaji T', 'Ambudkar, Suresh V']","['Shukla S', 'Kouanda A', 'Silverton L', 'Talele TT', 'Ambudkar SV']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH , Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/chemistry', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship']",2014/05/29 06:00,2016/05/05 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp400762h [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2014 Jul 7;11(7):2313-22. doi: 10.1021/mp400762h.

SNS-032 is a potent and selective inhibitor of Cdk2, Cdk7 and Cdk9 and has emerged in clinical trials. Here, we examined the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells in the presence of SNS-032 and observed a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation in both cell lines. SNS-032 had a direct apoptosis-inducing effect through both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in breast cancer cells as shown by a dose-dependent increase in Annexin V-positive cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick?end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, as well as activation of caspase-8, -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). At the molecular level, SNS-032 induced a marked dephosphorylation of serine 2 and 5 of RNA polymerase (RNA Pol) II and blocked RNA synthesis. Consistent with the inherently rapid turnover rates of their transcripts and proteins, the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) were rapidly reduced on exposure to SNS-032. Our results also indicated that SNS-032 suppressed the growth of breast cancer xenografts in mice. These data demonstrate that the use of SNS-032 may be a rational and novel therapeutic strategy for human breast cancer and warrants further clinical investigation.","[""Xie, Gui'e"", 'Tang, Hongping', 'Wu, Shaoqing', 'Chen, Jingsong', 'Liu, Jiangwen', 'Liao, Can']","['Xie G', 'Tang H', 'Wu S', 'Chen J', 'Liu J', 'Liao C']","[""Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510623, P.R.

METHODS: Medical records of all cases of mediastinal masses in children diagnosed and treated between January 2005 and December 2011 were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the mode of presentation, histopathological diagnosis, radiologic findings and management outcomes at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. SPSS 19 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients of mediastinal masses were identified, and malignancy was found in 32 (86%) cases. The median age at diagnosis was 9 years (interquartile range: 4.7 years). Lymphoma 23 (72%) and leukaemia 8 (25%) were the most common causes of mediastinal mass. Nonspecific symptoms such as fever 26 (81%), cough 15 (47%) and dyspnoea 12 (37%) constituted the most commonly presenting complaints. Overall, 22 (68.7%) patients underwent surgical procedures (complete/partial resection of mass); local lymph node biopsy was performed in 5 (15.6%) cases; and computed tomography or ultrasound-guided biopsy was done in 2 (5.4%) patients. Besides, 27 (84.4%) patients were admitted to paediatric intensive care unit for supportive care, and assisted ventilation was required in 20 (62.5%) patients. The mean length of hospital stay was 9.3 +/- 6 days. None of the patients died due to complications related to mediastinal mass or diagnostic procedure.

Network-based analyses have been used in computational disease-related gene prioritisation for several years. The Random Walk Ranking (RWR) algorithm has been successfully applied to prioritising disease-related gene candidates by exploiting global network topology in a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network. Increasing the specificity and sensitivity ofbiomarkers may require consideration of similar or closely-related disease phenotypes and molecular pathological mechanisms shared across different disease phenotypes. In this paper, we propose a method called Seed-Weighted Random Walk Ranking (SW-RWR) for prioritizing cancer biomarker candidates. This method uses the information of cancer phenotype association to assign to each gene a disease-specific, weighted value to guide the RWR algorithm in a global human PPI network. In a case study of prioritizing leukaemia biomarkers, SW-RWR outperformed a typical local network-based analysis in coverage and also showed better accuracy and sensitivity than the original RWR method (global network-based analysis). Our results suggest that the tight correlation among different cancer phenotypes could play an important role in cancer biomarker discovery.","['Huan, Tianxiao', 'Wu, Xiaogang', 'Bai, Zengliang', 'Chen, Jake Y']","['Huan T', 'Wu X', 'Bai Z', 'Chen JY']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Int J Data Min Bioinform,International journal of data mining and bioinformatics,101279469,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Data Mining/*methods', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Proteomics/methods']",2014/05/29 06:00,2014/07/24 06:00,['2014/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1504/ijdmb.2014.059064 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Data Min Bioinform. 2014;9(2):135-48. doi: 10.1504/ijdmb.2014.059064.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Experimental basic science study. SETTING: Reproductive biology laboratory. PATIENT(S): Multiple samples of cryopreserved human testicular cells from two prostate cancer patients with normal spermatogenesis. INTERVENTION(S): Cultured human testicular cells subjected to four sorting strategies based on MACS and xenotransplanted to the testes of mice to determine the enrichment for SSCs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Enrichment for human spermatogonia and SSCs tested by expression analysis of spermatogonial markers ITGA6, GPR125, ZBTB16, UCHL1, and ID4 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and by xenotransplantation into the testes of mice, respectively. RESULT(S): Compared with the nonsorted cultured testicular cells, only the ITGA6+ and HLA-/GPR125+ sorted cells showed enrichment for ID4. No difference in expression of ZBTB16 and UCHL1 was observed. Xenotransplantation of the sorted cell fractions showed a 7.1-fold enrichment of SSCs with ITGA6+. CONCLUSION(S): Magnetic-assisted cell sorting of cultured human testicular cells using ITGA6 allows for enrichment of SSCs, which aids in further molecular characterization of cultured human SSCs and enhances testicular colonization upon transplantation in future clinical settings.","['Nickkholgh, Bita', 'Mizrak, Sefika Canan', 'Korver, Cindy M', 'van Daalen, Saskia K M', 'Meissner, Andreas', 'Repping, Sjoerd', 'van Pelt, Ans M M']","['Nickkholgh B', 'Mizrak SC', 'Korver CM', 'van Daalen SK', 'Meissner A', 'Repping S', 'van Pelt AM']","[""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Women's and Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Women's and Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Women's and Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Women's and Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Women's and Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Women's and Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Women's and Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Previously, we developed a database that annotates sequence data from GenBank and the present study aimed to describe the clinical, molecular and epidemiological scenarios of HTLV-1 infection through the stored sequences in this database. A total of 2,545 registered complete and partial sequences of HTLV-1 were collected and 1,967 (77.3%) of those sequences represented unique isolates. Among these isolates, 93% contained geographic origin information and only 39% were related to any clinical status. A total of 1,091 sequences contained information about the geographic origin and viral subtype and 93% of these sequences were identified as subtype ""a"". Ethnicity data are very scarce. Regarding clinical status data, 29% of the sequences were generated from TSP/HAM and 67.8% from healthy carrier individuals. Although the data mining enabled some inferences about specific aspects of HTLV-1 infection to be made, due to the relative scarcity of data of available sequences, it was not possible to delineate a global scenario of HTLV-1 infection.","['Araujo, Thessika Hialla Almeida', 'Barreto, Fernanda Khouri', 'Alcantara, Luiz Carlos Junior', 'Miranda, Aline Cristina Andrade Mota']","['Araujo TH', 'Barreto FK', 'Alcantara LC', 'Miranda AC']","['Centro de Pesquisa Goncalo Moniz-Fiocru, Salvador, BA, Brasil.', 'Centro de Pesquisa Goncalo Moniz-Fiocru, Salvador, BA, Brasil.', 'Centro de Pesquisa Goncalo Moniz-Fiocru, Salvador, BA, Brasil.', 'Instituto de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, BA, Brasil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,7502619,,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Data Mining', 'Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Female', 'Geography, Medical', 'Global Health', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'User-Computer Interface']",2014/05/28 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0074-02762014005030587 [pii]', '10.1590/0074-0276130587 [doi]']",ppublish,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2014 Jul;109(4):448-51. doi: 10.1590/0074-0276130587.

However, similarly high cure rates have not always been achieved in all centers in developing countries due to limited sources. We evaluated the treatment results of the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 95 protocol as used between 1995 and 2009 in the pediatric hematology departments of two university hospitals. A retrospective analysis of 343 children newly diagnosed with ALL (M/F 200/143, median age 6.8 years) was performed. The overall survival (OS) and EFS according to age, initial leukocyte count, immunophenotype, chemotherapy responses (on days 8, 15, and 33), and risk groups were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Median follow-up time was 6.4 years. Complete remission was achieved in 97 % of children. Five-year EFS and OS were found to be 78.4 and 79.9 %, respectively. Children younger than 6 years old had significantly better EFS and OS (83.7 and 85.2 %) than children aged >/=6 years (71.4 and 72.8 %). Adolescents achieved 63 % EFS and 65 % OS. Patients who had initial leukocyte counts of <20 x 10(9)/L had better EFS and OS (82.2 and 84.6 %) than children with higher initial leukocyte counts (72.6 and 72.6 %). EFS for B-cell precursor and T-cell ALL was 81.5 and 66.7 %, respectively. Children with a good response to prednisolone on day 8 (87 %) achieved significantly better EFS and OS (81.2 and 81.9 % vs. 55.3 and 60.5 %). Children whose bone marrow on day 15 was in complete remission had higher EFS and OS (83.7 and 86.6.1 % vs. 56.4 and 61.5 %). Children in the standard-risk and medium-risk groups obtained statistically significantly higher EFS (95.5 and 82.7 %) and OS (97.7 and 82.3 %) compared to the high-risk group (EFS 56.3 %, OS 63.4 %). The relapse rate was 14.8 %. The median relapse time from diagnosis was 23.2 months. Death occurred in 69 of 343 patients (20.1 %). The major causes of death were infection and relapse. None of the patients died of drug-related toxicity. The ALL-BFM 95 protocol was applied successfully in these two centers. In developing countries in which minimal residual disease cannot be monitored, this protocol can still be used with high survival rates.","['Gunes, Adalet Meral', 'Oren, Hale', 'Baytan, Birol', 'Bengoa, Sebnem Yilmaz', 'Evim, Melike Sezgin', 'Gozmen, Salih', 'Tufekci, Ozlem', 'Karapinar, Tuba Hilkay', 'Irken, Gulersu']","['Gunes AM', 'Oren H', 'Baytan B', 'Bengoa SY', 'Evim MS', 'Gozmen S', 'Tufekci O', 'Karapinar TH', 'Irken G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Uludag University, Bursa, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'ALL-BFM-95 protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cytarabine', 'Daunorubicin', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mercaptopurine', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Prednisolone', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey/epidemiology', 'Vincristine']",2014/05/28 06:00,2015/02/19 06:00,['2014/05/28 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2106-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Oct;93(10):1677-84. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2106-0.

AIMS: To assess the health resource impact of different chemotherapy approaches for AML commonly used in Australia. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken in 63 patients aged 18-55 years with AML given induction with either 7 + 3 (cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) days 1-7 and idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) days 1-3) or HiDAC-3 (high-dose cytarabine 3 g/m(2) twice daily days 1, 3, 5 and 7 and idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) days 1-3) chemotherapy. Average costs of hospitalisation, pathology, radiology, chemotherapy and ancillary drugs were calculated and compared with current Victorian casemix funding. Two consolidation approaches, HiDAC (cytarabine 3 g/m(2) twice daily days 1, 3, 5 and 7) x either three or four cycles (following 7 + 3) and IcE (idarubicin 12,mg/m(2) days 1-2, cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) x 5 days and etoposide 75 mg/m(2) x 5 days) x 2 cycles (following HiDAC-3) were modelled, using a policy of discharge following completion of chemotherapy with outpatient monitoring. RESULTS: The cost (in AUD) of induction was similar between 7 + 3 ($58,037) and HiDAC-3 ($56,902), with bed day costs accounting for 61-62% of the total expense. Blood bank costs ranked second, accounting for 15%. Accumulated costs for HiDAC consolidation were $44,289 for a three-cycle protocol and $59,052 for four cycles ($14,763 per cycle) versus $31,456 for two cycles of IcE consolidation ($15,728 per cycle). Overall, the classical 7 + 3 --> HiDAC approach ($102,326/$117,089 for three or four consolidation cycles) incurs a greater cost than a HiDAC-3 --> IcE x 2 approach ($88,358). For patients requiring complete hospitalisation until neutrophil recovery, the estimated costs of treatment will be even higher, ranging between $122,282 for HiDAC-3 --> IcE x 2, $153,212 for 7 + 3 --> HiDAC x 3 and $184,937 for 7 + 3 --> HiDAC x 4. State-based casemix funding for non-complicated AML therapy is currently $74,013 for 7 + 3 --> HiDAC x 4, $64,177 for 7 + 3 --> HiDAC x 3 and $54,340 for HiDAC-3 --> IcE x 2 based on outpatient recovery after consolidation chemotherapy. These calculations do not take into account additional resource implications associated with complications of consolidation chemotherapy or reinduction for treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Regimens minimising the total number of chemotherapy cycles may represent the most efficient use of limited health resources for the treatment of AML.","['Fedele, P L', 'Avery, S', 'Patil, S', 'Spencer, A', 'Haas, M', 'Wei, A']","['Fedele PL', 'Avery S', 'Patil S', 'Spencer A', 'Haas M', 'Wei A']","['Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/economics', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/economics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Care Costs', 'Health Resources/*economics', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*economics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/economics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Victoria', 'Young Adult']",2014/05/28 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2014/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imj.12478 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2014 Aug;44(8):757-63. doi: 10.1111/imj.12478.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HiDAC', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'cost effectiveness', 'cytarabine']",,"['(c) 2014 The Authors; Internal Medicine Journal (c) 2014 Royal Australasian', 'College of Physicians.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of marrow dysfunction in MDS is multifactorial and consistent with a multistep model and may lead to heterogeneity of MDS. We investigated the proteome profile of circulating neutrophils purified from patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) to identify proteins that have a role in the pathogenesis. Using 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we found that peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), a member of the peroxiredoxin family that regulates reactive oxygen species, was markedly upregulated in neutrophils of RCMD patients compared to healthy donors. Increased PRDX2 expression in the neutrophils of RCMD patients was confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting and immunocytochemical analysis. In addition, white blood cell and neutrophil counts in RCMD patients correlated inversely with the PRDX2 expression of. Oxidative stress is a known factor involved in the pathogenesis of MDS, and PRDX2 is associated with tumourigenesis of several solid tumours. Accordingly, our results suggest that PRDX2 may perform an important function in the pathogeneis of RCMD.","['Kazama, Hiroshi', 'Teramura, Masanao', 'Kurihara, Sachiko', 'Yoshinaga, Kentaro', 'Kato, Tomohiro', 'Motoji, Toshiko']","['Kazama H', 'Teramura M', 'Kurihara S', 'Yoshinaga K', 'Kato T', 'Motoji T']","[""Department of Haematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism/pathology', 'Peroxiredoxins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proteomics']",2014/05/28 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/05/28 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12954 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Sep;166(5):720-8. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12954.

We explored some underlying mechanisms and the potential relevance of the combination quercetin-menadione for clinical applications. In acute treatments, quercetin manifested a strong antioxidant character, but induced a transient loss of Deltapsim, likely mediated by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. After removal of quercetin, persistent mitochondrial hyperpolarization was generated via stimulation of respiratory Complex I. In contrast, menadione-induced Deltapsim dissipation was only partially and transiently reversed after menadione removal. Results indicate that Ca(2+) release is a necessary event in quercetin-induced cell death and that the survival response to quercetin is delineated within 1h from exposure. Depending on dose, the two agents exhibited either antagonistic or synergistic effects in reducing clonogenicity of Jurkat cells. 24-h combinatorial regimens at equimolar concentrations of 10-15 muM, which are compatible with a clinically achievable (and safe) scheme, reduced cell viability at efficient rates. Altogether, these findings support the idea that the combination quercetin-menadione could improve the outcome of conventional leukemia therapies, and warrant the utility of additional studies to investigate the therapeutic effects of this combination in different cellular or animal models for leukemia.","['Baran, Irina', 'Ionescu, Diana', 'Filippi, Alexandru', 'Mocanu, Maria Magdalena', 'Iftime, Adrian', 'Babes, Ramona', 'Tofolean, Ioana Teodora', 'Irimia, Ruxandra', 'Goicea, Alexandru', 'Popescu, Valentin', 'Dimancea, Alexandru', 'Neagu, Andrei', 'Ganea, Constanta']","['Baran I', 'Ionescu D', 'Filippi A', 'Mocanu MM', 'Iftime A', 'Babes R', 'Tofolean IT', 'Irimia R', 'Goicea A', 'Popescu V', 'Dimancea A', 'Neagu A', 'Ganea C']","['""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Department of Biophysics, 8 Eroii Sanitari, 050474 Bucharest, Romania.

Few data on its prevalence in the Asian pediatric population exist. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the prevalence of CMV infections in 33 patients with 37 transplants who received HSCT for leukemia from 1998 to 2008, and who were managed preemptively for infections. RESULTS: In the 37 transplants, 16 patients (43%) had CMV DNAemia. Of the patients who were CMV seropositive before transplant and received stem cells from seropositive donors (R+/D+), 69% had DNAemia; of those who received stem cells from seronegative donors (R+/D-), 36% had CMV DNAemia. Of the patients who were CMV naive before transplant and received stem cells from seropositive donors (R-/D+), 25% had CMV DNAemia. In CMV-seronegative donor-recipient transplants (R-/D-), 20% of patients had CMV DNAemia. The median time to the first episode of CMV DNAemia was 21 (range: 10-107) days after the transplants, and the median duration of CMV DNAemia was 22 (range: 2-315) days. CMV DNAemia recurred in 44% (7 of 16) of these patients. Only 1 patient developed CMV disease (retinitis). No deaths were related to CMV infections. CONCLUSIONS: CMV infection manifesting as DNAemia is a common complication in pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for leukemia. Pre-transplant serostatus predicts reactivation risks; invasive CMV disease is rare using the preemptive approach in our patient population.","['Tan, P L', 'Lim, L M', 'Khanlian, C', 'Villegas, M S']","['Tan PL', 'Lim LM', 'Khanlian C', 'Villegas MS']","['Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,,IM,"['Asians', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore/epidemiology']",2014/05/28 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/05/28 06:00'],"['2013/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12238 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2014 Aug;16(4):556-60. doi: 10.1111/tid.12238.

PV patients exhibit increased haemoglobin levels and red cell mass because of uncontrolled proliferation of the erythroid lineage. Thrombosis and transformation to acute leukaemia are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in this disease. Increased thrombotic risk in PV patients is multifactorial and complex; it is associated with high levels of haemoglobin, impaired rheology and increased viscosity resulting from erythrocytosis. An additional parameter that might contribute to this risk was recently brought to light by work from our group showing abnormal activation of adhesion proteins in PV RBCs. In this review we provide an overview of these recent findings and discuss how the pro-adhesive features of JAK2V617F-positive red blood cells might initiate and contribute to the circulatory complications described in PV.","['El Nemer, Wassim', 'De Grandis, Maria', 'Brusson, Megane']","['El Nemer W', 'De Grandis M', 'Brusson M']","[""INSERM U1134, F-75739 Paris, France; Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR_S 1134, F-75739 Paris, France; Institut National de la Transfusion Sanguine F-75739 Paris, France Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex France.

The involvement of PML in various cell processes, including cell death, senescence or antiviral defense underlines the multiple functions of PML due to its ability to interact with various partners either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The importance of paracrine signaling in the regulation of PML expression is well established. More recently, a growing body of evidence also supports PML as a key regulator of cytokine signaling. These findings shed light on unsuspected biological functions of PML such as immune response, inflammation and cytokine-induced apoptosis. Here we review the current understanding of the pleiotropic activities of PML on cytokine-induced signaling.","['Maarifi, Ghizlane', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K', 'Nisole, Sebastien']","['Maarifi G', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Nisole S']","['INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saint-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saint-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saint-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.

Therefore, there is an increasing need for new drugs to treat high-risk cancer patients with a higher selectivity for cancer cells and lower toxicity to normal cells. Sulforaphane is released upon hydrolysis of glucoraphanin, a constituent of cruciferous vegetables, by myrosinases that are present in the plant or intestinal microbes. Despite a large number of studies describing the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties of sulforaphane in solid tumors, there is little information on the properties of sulforaphane in hematological malignancies. In this review, we discuss the anti-carcinogenic properties of sulforaphane, the need of higher doses than dietary intake, and the challenges related to testing sulforaphane as an adjunctive agent in combination with the current standard of care for frontline blood cancer.","['Suppipat, Koramit', 'Lacorazza, H Daniel']","['Suppipat K', 'Lacorazza HD']","['1102 Bates Street, FC83.20, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. hdl@bcm.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Food', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Sulfoxides']",2014/05/28 06:00,2016/11/08 06:00,['2014/05/28 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CCDT-EPUB-60617 [pii]', '10.2174/1568009614666140521142950 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2014;14(5):434-45. doi: 10.2174/1568009614666140521142950.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies focusing on breakthrough invasive fungal disease (IFD) upon PSC prophylaxis show disparate results. In order to evaluate the incidence of IFD in patients on PSC prophylaxis and identify IFD risk factors, we carried out a retrospective study of all consecutive patients on PP from January 2007 to December 2010 in our hospital. Breakthrough IFDs were identified from the database of the central pharmacy and the French administrative database (PMSI), registering final medical diagnoses of hospitalized patients. Medical data were reviewed to study proven or probable IFD, according to EORTC/MSG definition. PSC plasma concentrations (PPC) were also retrieved. Poisson models were used for statistical analysis. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients received PSC prophylaxis for a median duration of 1.4 months (range 0.2-17.9). Proven (n=6) or probable (n=3) IFDs were diagnosed in nine cases (3.2%). IFD incidence rate per 100 person-month was 1.65 (95% CI, 0.79-2.97). IFDs were candidaemia (Candida glabrata, n=2), pulmonary invasive aspergillosis (n=3), disseminated fusariosis (n=2) and pulmonary mucormycosis (n=2). Seven deaths were reported, directly related to IFD in three patients (33.3%). First dosage of PPC under 0.3 mg/L was the single significant risk factor for IFD (RR, 7.77; 95% CI, 1.30-46.5; p 0.025). Breakthrough IFD in patients receiving PSC prophylaxis is rare but associated with a poor outcome. Low PSC plasma concentrations are associated with an increased risk of IFD.","['Lerolle, N', 'Raffoux, E', 'Socie, G', 'Touratier, S', 'Sauvageon, H', 'Porcher, R', 'Bretagne, S', 'Bergeron, A', 'Azoulay, E', 'Molina, J-M', 'Lafaurie, M']","['Lerolle N', 'Raffoux E', 'Socie G', 'Touratier S', 'Sauvageon H', 'Porcher R', 'Bretagne S', 'Bergeron A', 'Azoulay E', 'Molina JM', 'Lafaurie M']","['Infectious Diseases Intervention Unit, Hopital Saint-Louis, APHP, University of Paris Diderot Paris 7, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chemoprevention/*methods', '*Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2014/05/28 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2014/05/28 06:00'],"['2014/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1111/1469-0691.12688 [doi]', 'S1198-743X(14)65353-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 2014 Nov;20(11):O952-9. doi: 10.1111/1469-0691.12688.

Hypoxia also affects the expansion of progenitor cells and enhances erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. In contrast to the known effects of hypoxia on normal hematopoiesis, the effects of the hypoxic environment of the bone marrow on the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) have not been well studied. In the present study, we investigated the role of the hypoxic environment in the pathophysiology of MPNs, focusing on JAK2V617F, a major driver of mutation in Philadelphia-negative MPNs. We found that the activity of JAK2V617F was suppressed in hypoxic conditions not only in JAK2V617F-positive leukemia cells, but also in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with polycythemia vera. Concomitant with the inhibition of JAK2V617F activity, hypoxia increased the expression of p27/KIP1, the primary negative regulator of the cell cycle, and inhibited cell cycle progression in JAK2V617F-positive leukemia cell lines. The spontaneous erythroid colony formation of primary cells from polycythemia vera patients was also suppressed under hypoxic conditions. We also revealed that the hypoxia-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species played a crucial role in the inhibition of JAK2V617F through the oxidation and inhibition of SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that contains SH-2, which is required for JAK2 activation. In conclusion, a hypoxic environment may modulate JAK2-positive MPN cell fate and disease progression through the suppression of SHP-2 function and the subsequent suppression of JAK2V617F activity.","['Mitsumori, Toru', 'Nozaki, Yumi', 'Kawashima, Ichiro', 'Yamamoto, Takeo', 'Shobu, Yuki', 'Nakajima, Kei', 'Morishita, Soji', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Kirito, Keita']","['Mitsumori T', 'Nozaki Y', 'Kawashima I', 'Yamamoto T', 'Shobu Y', 'Nakajima K', 'Morishita S', 'Komatsu N', 'Kirito K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Stem Cell Regulation, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.

There is no consensus on treatment for patients over 60 years of age who cannot receive first-line high-dose chemotherapy. Options include low-dose cytarabine, other non-intensive chemotherapy regimens, or tailored supportive care. Decitabine, a cytotoxic drug related to cytarabine, has been authorised for patients aged 65 years or older who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. Clinical evaluation of decitabine in this setting is mainly based on an unblinded randomised controlled trial including 485 patients, who received either decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine or symptomatic treatment alone. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two active treatment groups (median about 6 months). Serious adverse events occurred in 80% of patients in the decitabine group, compared to 73% of those in the cytarabine group. They consisted mainly of haematological disorders (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia), infections (pneumonia) and gastrointestinal disorders. In practice, for patients at least 65 years of age with acute myeloid leukaemia who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy, decitabine has no advantages over existing treatments in terms of survival time or adverse effects.

However, over the past several years this view came to be challenged as several studies provided anecdotal as well as global evidence for the contribution of TEs to the regulatory and coding needs of human genes. In this study, we explored the incorporation and epigenetic regulation of coding sequences donated by TEs using gene expression and other ancillary genomics data from two human hematopoietic cell-lines: GM12878 (a lymphoblastoid cell line) and K562 (a Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia cell line). In each cell line, we found several thousand instances of TEs donating coding sequences to human genes. We compared the transcriptome assembly of the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) reads with and without the aid of a reference transcriptome and found that the percentage of genes that incorporate TEs in their coding sequences is significantly greater than that obtained from the reference transcriptome assemblies using Refseq and Gencode gene models. We also used histone modifications chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data, Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data and DNAseI Hypersensitivity Site (DHS) data to demonstrate the epigenetic regulation of the TE derived coding sequences. Our results suggest that TEs form a significantly higher percentage of coding sequences than represented in gene annotation databases and these TE derived sequences are epigenetically regulated in accordance with their expression in the two cell types.","['Huda, Ahsan', 'Bushel, Pierre R']","['Huda A', 'Bushel PR']","['Microarray and Genome Informatics Group, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, USA ; Kelly Government Solutions, Inc., USA.', 'Microarray and Genome Informatics Group, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, USA ; Biostatistics Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transcr Open Access,Transcriptomics: open access,101620306,,,,2014/05/27 06:00,2014/05/27 06:01,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4172/2329-8936.1000101 [doi]'],ppublish,Transcr Open Access. 2013 Jun 19;1(1). doi: 10.4172/2329-8936.1000101.,"['Z01 ES102345/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA ES102345-04/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4028971,['NOTNLM'],"['Alu', 'DNAseI HS', 'Epigenetics', 'Exonization', 'Gene expression', 'LTR Retrotransposons', 'RNA-seq', 'Transcription', 'Transposable elements']",,,['NIHMS524458'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the advent of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib has ushered in a new era of treatments that have the potential to be less toxic to patients. Integrins and tyrosine kinases play important roles in mediating and transducing signals for cell survival and suppressing apoptosis. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor type tyrosine kinase that is constitutively activated in Ph+ ALL. We sought to investigate the specificity of integrin alpha5beta1 (VLA-5) on Ph+ leukemia by its expression and function. We found VLA-5 expression increases after serum starvation. Integrin alpha5 inhibitory antibody inhibited adhesion of Ph+ leukemia to human fibronectin and acted synergistically with imatinib to induce Ph+ leukemia cell apoptosis. We used different strategies to block integrin signaling and knocked down the expression of integrin VLA-5 to observe the effect on proliferation and engraftment of Ph+ leukemia cells in immunodeficient mice. We found that blocking integrin activity by incubating Ph+ leukemia cells with disintegrin, a peptide inhibitor of integrins, or alpha5 inhibitory antibody, or knocking down the alpha5 integrin subunit impaired and delayed the engraftment of Ph+ leukemia in immunodeficient mice. We then treated mice xenografted with Ph+ leukemia cells with the FAK inhibitor TAE226 in combination with a BCR-ABL TKI nilotinib. While 2 weeks of treatment with TAE226 alone did not significantly inhibit leukemia growth in mice, TAE226 in combination with nilotinib provided the most optimum growth inhibition at 4-6 weeks. We conclude that blocking VLA-5 signaling or combining FAK inhibitors with TKI targeting BCL/ABL might be good strategies to improve treatments in patients with Ph+ ALL. By altering Ph+ leukemia cell interactions with the microenvironment, we may increase their susceptibility to therapy targeting BCR/ABL.","['Hu, Zhongbo', 'Slayton, William B']","['Hu Z', 'Slayton WB']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida , Gainesville, FL , USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida , Gainesville, FL , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2014/05/27 06:00,2014/05/27 06:01,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00112 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 May 15;4:112. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00112. eCollection 2014.,,20140515,,PMC4030186,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome', 'TAE226', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone marrow microenvironment', 'focal adhesion kinase', 'integrin alpha5beta1', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PIM proteins have also been associated with metastasis and overall treatment responses and implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, metabolism, the cell cycle, and homing and migration, which makes these proteins interesting targets for anti-cancer drug discovery. The use of retroviral insertional mutagenesis and refined approaches such as complementation tagging has allowed the identification of myc, pim, and a third group of genes (including bmi1 and gfi1) as complementing genes in lymphomagenesis. Moreover, mouse modeling of human cancer has provided an understanding of the molecular pathways that are involved in tumor initiation and progression at the physiological level. In particular, genetically modified mice have allowed researchers to further elucidate the role of each of the Pim isoforms in various tumor types. PIM kinases have been identified as weak oncogenes because experimental overexpression in lymphoid tissue, prostate, and liver induces tumors at a relatively low incidence and with a long latency. However, very strong synergistic tumorigenicity between Pim1/2 and c-Myc and other oncogenes has been observed in lymphoid tissues. Mouse models have also been used to study whether the inhibition of specific PIM isoforms is required to prevent carcinogen-induced sarcomas, indicating that the absence of Pim2 and Pim3 greatly reduces sarcoma growth and bone invasion; the extent of this effect is similar to that observed in the absence of all three isoforms. This review will summarize some of the animal models that have been used to understand the isoform-specific contribution of PIM kinases to tumorigenesis.","['Aguirre, Enara', 'Renner, Oliver', 'Narlik-Grassow, Maja', 'Blanco-Aparicio, Carmen']","['Aguirre E', 'Renner O', 'Narlik-Grassow M', 'Blanco-Aparicio C']","['Biology Section, Experimental Therapeutics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) , Madrid , Spain.', 'Biology Section, Experimental Therapeutics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) , Madrid , Spain.', 'Biology Section, Experimental Therapeutics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) , Madrid , Spain.', 'Biology Section, Experimental Therapeutics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) , Madrid , Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2014/05/27 06:00,2014/05/27 06:01,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00109 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 May 15;4:109. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00109. eCollection 2014.,,20140515,,PMC4030178,['NOTNLM'],"['Pim kinases', 'carcinogens', 'knock-out', 'proviral tagging', 'transgenics', 'tumors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, new approaches are needed to reduce or to avoid off target toxicities, associated with chemotherapy and their long-term residual effects. Recently, nanotechnology has been employed to enhance cancer therapy, via improving the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of anti-cancer agents. While in the last several years, numerous review articles appeared detailing the size, composition, assembly, and performance evaluation of different types of drug carrying nanoparticles, the description and evaluation of lipoprotein-based drug carriers have been conspicuously absent from most of these major reviews.

In this work we introduce a new approach to identify patients with loss of heterozygosity in the HLA region either at first diagnosis or after HLA mismatched allogeneic HSCT. Diagnosis of LOH requires a high purity of recipient target cells. FACS is time consuming and also frequently prevented by rather nonspecific or unknown immune phenotype. The approach for recipient cell enrichment is based on HLA targeted complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Relative fluorescent quantification (RFQ) analysis of HLA intron length polymorphisms then allows analysis of HLA heterozygosity. The approach is exemplified in recent clinical cases illustrating the detection of an acquired allele loss. As illustrated in one case with DPB1, distinct HLA loci in donor and patient were sufficient for both proof of donor cell removal and evaluation of allele loss in the patient's leukemic cells. Results were confirmed using HLA-B RFQ analysis and leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype (LAIP) based cell sort. Both results confirmed suspected loss of HLA heterozygosity. Our approach complements or substitutes for FACS-based cell enrichment; hence it may be further developed as novel routine diagnostic tool. This allows rapid recipient cell purification and testing for loss of HLA heterozygosity before and after allogeneic HSCT in easily accessible peripheral blood samples.","['Witter, Klaus', 'Reibke, Roland', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Zahn, Robert', 'Kauke, Teresa', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Spannagl, Michael', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Dick, Andrea']","['Witter K', 'Reibke R', 'Subklewe M', 'Zahn R', 'Kauke T', 'Spiekermann K', 'Spannagl M', 'Tischer J', 'Hiddemann W', 'Dick A']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutic Agents and Hemostaseology, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutic Agents and Hemostaseology, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutic Agents and Hemostaseology, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutic Agents and Hemostaseology, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutic Agents and Hemostaseology, University Hospital of Munich, Ludwig Maximilians University, Max-Lebsche-Platz 32, 81377 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Bone Marrow Res,Bone marrow research,101566202,,,,2014/05/27 06:00,2014/05/27 06:01,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/541345 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Res. 2014;2014:541345. doi: 10.1155/2014/541345.

METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats (54 male rats, 8-week old) were divided into 3 groups randomly, including two control groups. Rats in the experiment group were subjected to 70% massive small bowel resection. Rats in the resection group underwent simple intestinal resection and anastomosis. Rats in the control group underwent laparotomy alone. A 5 cm intestine approximately 1 cm distal to the anastomosis was harvested a week after operation. Expression of Mcl-1 was assessed by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-125a in intestinal tissue. RESULTS: The positive expression of Mcl-1 in the experiment group was 18.8%(3/16), significantly lower than that in the control group(76.5%, 13/17) and the resection group (83.33%, 15/18)(both P<0.01). The expression of miR-125a in the experiment group was 1.92, significantly higher than that in the control group (1.01) and the resection group (1.05)(both P<0.01).

Its deficiency leads to reduced turnover and increased proliferation and survival of murine B-1a cells. Siglecg(-/-) mice show a premature expansion of polyclonal CD5(+) B cells in the spleen and the peritoneal cavity. Here we studied the fate of B lymphocytes in Siglecg(-/-) mice over time. We demonstrate that in aging animals SIGLEC-G deficiency promotes progressive accumulation of monoclonal B lymphocytes and increases the susceptibility to develop B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Lymphoid tumors arising in aged Siglecg(-/-) mice are monoclonal and histologically heterogeneous as they include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and medium-to-large B-cell monomorphic lymphoma but surprisingly not chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The tumors express high levels of BCL-2 and are transplantable. In keeping with these findings we have also observed a remarkable down-regulation of the human ortholog SIGLEC10 in human B-cell lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Taken together, these observations indicate that the down-regulation of negative B-cell receptor regulators such as SIGLEC-G/SIGLEC10 may represent another mechanism relevant to the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas.","['Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa Sabrina', 'Rodriguez, Tania Veliz', 'Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Dagklis, Antonis', 'Rocchi, Martina', 'Innocenzi, Anna', 'Casola, Stefano', 'Winkler, Thomas H', 'Nitschke, Lars', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Simonetti G', 'Bertilaccio MT', 'Rodriguez TV', 'Apollonio B', 'Dagklis A', 'Rocchi M', 'Innocenzi A', 'Casola S', 'Winkler TH', 'Nitschke L', 'Ponzoni M', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Ghia P']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'The Institute of Molecular Oncology (IFOM) of the Italian Foundation for Cancer Research (FIRC), Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, Nikolaus Fiebiger Center for Molecular Medicine, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Pathology Unit, Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy Clinical Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, Department of Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy Clinical Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, Department of Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy caligaris.federico@hsr.it.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy Clinical Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, Department of Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins)', '0 (Siglecg protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*deficiency/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*deficiency/genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins']",2014/05/27 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.100230 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.100230 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Aug;99(8):1356-64. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.100230.

Forty-nine patients (76%) received first-line fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab-based therapy, 6 (11%) received rituximab-based and 8 (13%) received lenalidomide-based treatment. Overall, the complete plus nodular partial remission rate was 33%; on multivariable model, higher complete plus nodular partial remission rate was observed in patients with less than 50% cells positive for deletion 17p, and a higher probability of achieving at least a partial remission was observed with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab-based treatment.

Gene mutations are increasingly used to assess the prognosis of cn-AML patients and guide risk-adapted treatment. In the present study, we analyzed the molecular genetics characteristics of 373 adult cn-AML patients and explored the relationship between TET2 gene mutations or different genetic mutation patterns and prognosis. We found that 16.1 % of patients had TET2 mutations, 31.6 % had FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs), 6.2 % had FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations, 2.4 % had c-KIT mutations, 37.8 % had NPM1 mutations, 11.3 % had WT1 mutations, 5.9 % had RUNX1 mutations, 11.5 % had ASXL1 mutations, 3.8 % had MLL-PTDs, 7.8 % had IDH1 mutations, 7.8 % had NRAS mutations, 12.3 % had IDH2 mutations, 1.6 % had EZH2 mutations, and 14.7 % had DNMT3A mutations, while none had CBL mutations. Gene mutations were detected in 76.94 % (287/373) of all patients. In the NPM1m(+) patients, those with TET2 mutations were associated with a shorter median overall survival (OS) as compared to TET2 wild-type (wt) patients (9.9 vs. 27.0 months, respectively; P = 0.023); Interestingly, the TET2 mutation was identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor and was closely associated with a shorter median OS as compared to TET2-wt (9.5 vs. 32.2 months, respectively; P = 0.013) in the NPM1m(+)/FLT3-ITDm(-) patient group. Thus, identification of TET2 combined with classic NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations allowed us to stratify cn-AML into distinct subtypes.","['Tian, Xiaopeng', 'Xu, Yang', 'Yin, Jia', 'Tian, Hong', 'Chen, Suning', 'Wu, Depei', 'Sun, Aining']","['Tian X', 'Xu Y', 'Yin J', 'Tian H', 'Chen S', 'Wu D', 'Sun A']","[""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 188 Shizi Street, Suzhou, 215006, Jiangsu province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2014/05/27 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1595-x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Jul;100(1):96-104. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1595-x.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of newly isolated phenylamine derivative N-benzyl-N-methyldecan-1-amine (NBNMA) from garlic cloves on the inhibition of the growth and apoptosis of human leukemia U937 cells and its potential anticancer mechanism. NBNMA exhibited an antiproliferative effect in U937 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptotic cell death. Western blot analyses revealed that NBNMA decreased the expression of the regulator genes of G2/M phase progression, cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) 2 and Cdc2 and elevated the expression of the Cdk inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 in a p53-independent manner. In addition, NBNMA activated caspase-8 and caspase-9, initiator caspases of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis, respectively, which led to activation of executioner caspase-3 along with degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. NBNMA-induced apoptosis was observed in parallel with an increased ratio of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bad/anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and inhibition of inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family members XIAP and cIAP-1. Furthermore, NBNMA-treated cells displayed enhanced release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol concomitant with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and downregulation of Bid, suggesting that NBNMA-induced apoptosis occurred via the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways with a possible link to Bid protein activity between the two pathways. These results indicate that NBNMA has promising potential to become a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of leukemia. We provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the anticancer effect of NBNMA.","['Jeong, Jin-Woo', 'Park, Sejin', 'Park, Cheol', 'Chang, Young-Chae', 'Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Kim, Sung Ok', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Cha, Hee-Jae', 'Kim, Heui-Soo', 'Choi, Young-Whan', 'Kim, Wun-Jae', 'Yoo, Young Hyun', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Jeong JW', 'Park S', 'Park C', 'Chang YC', 'Moon DO', 'Kim SO', 'Kim GY', 'Cha HJ', 'Kim HS', 'Choi YW', 'Kim WJ', 'Yoo YH', 'Choi YH']","['Center for Core Research Facilities, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Daegu 711-873, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Horticultural Bioscience, College of Natural Resource and Life Sciences, Busan National University, Miryang 627-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Dongeui University, Busan 614-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu 705718, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biology Education, Daegu University, Gyeongbuk 712-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Team for Scientification of Korean Medical Intervention (BK21 Plus) and Department of Herbal Pharmacology, College of Oriental Medicine, Daegu Haany University, Daegu 706-828, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju 690756, Republic of Korea.', 'Departments of Parasitology and Genetics, Kosin University College of Medicine, Seo-gu, Busan 602702, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, Busan National University, Busan 609735, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Horticultural Bioscience, College of Natural Resource and Life Sciences, Busan National University, Miryang 627-706, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Urology, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju 361-804, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Dong-A University College of Medicine and Mitochondria Hub Regulation Center, Busan 602714, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, Busan 614052, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '103-67-3 (N-methylbenzylamine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzylamines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Garlic/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",2014/05/27 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2014.3215 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2014 Jul;32(1):373-81. doi: 10.3892/or.2014.3215.

The most common adverse events including fever, chills, hypotension, edema, hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminasemia were transient. Seven of 9 evaluable (78%) BPDCN patients had major responses including 5 complete responses and 2 partial responses after a single course of SL-401.

To study the functions of DOT1L in MLL-rearranged leukemia, SYC-522, a potent inhibitor of DOT1L developed in our laboratory, was used to treat MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines and patient samples. SYC-522 significantly inhibited methylation at H3K79, but not H3K4 or H3K27, and decreased the expression of two important leukemia-relevant genes, HOXA9 and MEIS1, by more than 50%. It also significantly reduced the expression of CCND1 and BCL2L1, which are important regulators of cell cycle and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. Exposure of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells to this compound caused cell cycle arrest and promoted differentiation of those cells, both morphologically and by increased CD14 expression. SYC-522 did not induce apoptosis, even at 10 microM for as long as 6 days. However, treatment with this DOT1L inhibitor decreased the colony formation ability of primary MLL-rearranged AML cells by up to 50%, and promoted monocytic differentiation. Notably, SYC-522 treatment significantly increased the sensitivity of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells to chemotherapeutics, such as mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine. A similar sensitization was seen with primary MLL-rearranged AML cells. SYC-522 did not affect chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells without MLL-rearrangement. Suppression of DOT1L activity inhibited the mitoxantrone-induced increase in the DNA damage response marker, gammaH2AX, and increased the level of cPARP, an intracellular marker of apoptosis. These results demonstrated that SYC-522 selectively inhibited DOT1L, and thereby altered gene expression, promoted differentiation, and increased chemosensitivity by preventing DNA damage response. Therefore, inhibition of DOT1L, in combination with DNA damaging chemotherapy, represents a promising approach to improving outcomes for MLL-rearranged leukemia.","['Liu, Wei', 'Deng, Lisheng', 'Song, Yongcheng', 'Redell, Michele']","['Liu W', 'Deng L', 'Song Y', 'Redell M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', '*Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism']",2014/05/27 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0098270 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-09408 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 23;9(5):e98270. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0098270. eCollection 2014.,['K08 HL085018/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],20140523,,PMC4032273,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that CXCL12 could enhance the resistance of K562 cells to adriamycin (ADM) by increasing the expression of CXCR4, up-regulating the downstream PI3K/Akt pathway, and promoting translocation of NF-kappaB dimers into nucleus and subsequently decreasing the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in K562 cells. And we found that ADM resistance was partially reversed by CXCR4 siRNA transfection. Moreover, the sensitivity enhancement of oroxylin A was demonstrated by decreasing the expression of CXCR4 at both protein and mRNA levels, via PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB pathway and triggering the apoptosis pathway in vitro. In addition, the in vivo study showed that oroxylin A increased apoptosis of leukemic cells with low systemic toxicity, and the mechanism was the same as in vitro study. In conclusion, all these results showed that oroxylin A improved the sensitivity of K562/ADM cells by increasing apoptosis in leukemic cells and decreasing the expression of CXCR4 and PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB pathway, and probably served as a most promising agent for CML treatment.","['Wang, Yu', 'Miao, Hanchi', 'Li, Wei', 'Yao, Jing', 'Sun, Yang', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'Zhao, Li', 'Guo, Qinglong']","['Wang Y', 'Miao H', 'Li W', 'Yao J', 'Sun Y', 'Li Z', 'Zhao L', 'Guo Q']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.

Blood cancer is a stressful and traumatic situation for the child, as well as the parents. To overcome the stress of child's illness parents adopt different coping styles. In overcoming these difficulties, the invaluable role is played by social support they receive from medical staff, family or institution. AIM: To assess the feeling of stress for parents of children diagnosed with blood cancer, to determine how they choose to deal with stress in a difficult situation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 63 parents of children diagnosed with blood cancer. The study used the PSS-10 scale to assess the stress experienced by parents, 40 GP ISEL scale to assess social support, Inventory Ways to Measure Coping and the author's questionnaire. RESULTS: High perception of stress was observed among parents. It was found that the strategy based on active coping (taking action to improve the situation) got the highest scores among the strategies for coping with stress. The study showed that parents can most often count on material support. CONCLUSIONS: The feeling of stress severity among parents is high, particularly among women and people with higher education. The actions of medical team should take into account the needs of parents in raising and maintaining the resources to adapt to the difficult situation of child's disease.","['Cepuch, Grazyna', 'Citko, Joanna', 'Wojtas, Katarzyna']","['Cepuch G', 'Citko J', 'Wojtas K']","['Department of Clinical Nursing, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland. grazyna. cepuch@uj.edu.pl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Folia Med Cracov,Folia medica Cracoviensia,0374617,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Poland', '*Social Support', 'Stress, Psychological/*diagnosis/*psychology/rehabilitation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",2013/01/01 00:00,2014/07/11 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Folia Med Cracov. 2013;53(2):87-97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL & METHODS: The LT12 cells were treated with different doses of curcumin for 1-72 hours followed by application of etoposide. The amount of DNA damage was estimated via a comet assay. Viability, cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by using flow cytometry technique. RESULTS: The combined effect of curcumin and etoposide on viability was synergistic at low micro- molar concentrations. In comparison to treatment with curcumin and etoposide alone, co-treatment with these compounds increased the extent of DNA damage, the percentage of cells arrested in the G2/M phase and the number of annexin-V-positive cells. CONCLUSIONS: The interaction between etoposide and curcumin points to an enhanced antileukemic potential to be derived from the combination of these compounds.","['Papiez, Monika A']",['Papiez MA'],"['Department of Cytobiology, Pharmaceutical Faculty, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland. monika.papiez@uj.edu.pl.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Folia Med Cracov,Folia medica Cracoviensia,0374617,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Rats']",2013/01/01 00:00,2014/07/11 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Folia Med Cracov. 2013;53(2):61-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen patients received 332 to 1561 mCi of (131)I, delivering an average of 27 Gy to bone marrow, 84 Gy to spleen, and 21 Gy to liver. Although a maximum dose of 28 Gy was delivered to the liver, no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Marrow doses were arbitrarily capped at 43 Gy to avoid radiation-induced stromal damage; however, no graft failure or evidence of stromal damage was observed. Twelve patients (80%) developed grade II graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 1 patient developed grade III GVHD, and no patients developed grade IV GVHD during the first 100 days after HCT. Of the 12 patients with chronic GVHD data, 10 developed chronic GVHD, generally involving the skin and mouth. Six patients (40%) are surviving after a median of 5.0 years (range, 4.2 to 8.3 years). The estimated survival at 1 year was 73% among the 15 treated patients. Eight patients relapsed, 7 of whom subsequently died. The median time to relapse among these 8 patients was 54 days (range, 26 to 1364 days). No cases of nonrelapse mortality were observed in the first year after transplantation. However, 2 patients died in remission from complications of chronic GVHD and cardiomyopathy, at 18 months and 14 months after transplantation, respectively.

Moreover, the arbitrary limit of 43 Gy to the marrow may be unnecessarily conservative, and continued escalation of targeted radioimmunotherapy doses may be feasible to further reduce relapse.","['Mawad, Raya', 'Gooley, Ted A', 'Rajendran, Joseph G', 'Fisher, Darrell R', 'Gopal, Ajay K', 'Shields, Andrew T', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Deeg, Hans Joachim', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Green, Damian J', 'Maloney, David G', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Press, Oliver W', 'Pagel, John M']","['Mawad R', 'Gooley TA', 'Rajendran JG', 'Fisher DR', 'Gopal AK', 'Shields AT', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Sorror ML', 'Deeg HJ', 'Storb R', 'Green DJ', 'Maloney DG', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Press OW', 'Pagel JM']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Dade Moeller Health Group, Richland, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.

In this study, reverse phase protein analysis (RPPA) of 230 proteins in 511 AML patient samples revealed a strong correlation of B55alpha with a number of proteins including MYC, PKC alpha, and SRC. B55alpha suppression in OCI-AML3 cells by shRNA demonstrated that the B subunit is a PKCalpha phosphatase. B55alpha does not target SRC, but rather the kinase suppresses protein expression of the B subunit. Finally, the correlation between B55alpha and MYC levels reflected a complex stoichiometric competition between B subunits. Loss of B55alpha in OCI-AML3 cells did not change global PP2A activity and the only isoform that is induced is the one containing B56alpha. In cells containing B55alpha shRNA, MYC was suppressed with concomitant induction of the competing B subunit B56alpha (PPP2R5A). A recent study determined that FTY-720, a drug whose action involves the activation of PP2A, resulted in the induction of B55alpha In AML cells, and a reduction of the B subunit rendered these cells resistant to FTY-720. Finally, reduction of the B subunit resulted in an increase in the expression of miR-191-5p and a suppression of miR-142-3p. B55alpha regulation of these miRs was intriguing as high levels of miR-191 portend poor survival in AML, and miR-142-3p is mutated in 2% of AML patient samples. In summary, the suppression of B55alpha activates signaling pathways that could support leukemia cell survival.","['Ruvolo, Peter P', 'Ruvolo, Vivian R', 'Jacamo, Rodrigo', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'Duvvuri, Seshagiri R', 'Zhou, Liran', 'Qiu, Yihua', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Zhang, Nianxiang', 'Yoo, Suk Y', 'Pan, Rongqing', 'Hail, Numsen Jr', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Calin, George', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Ruvolo PP', 'Ruvolo VR', 'Jacamo R', 'Burks JK', 'Zeng Z', 'Duvvuri SR', 'Zhou L', 'Qiu Y', 'Coombes KR', 'Zhang N', 'Yoo SY', 'Pan R', 'Hail N Jr', 'Konopleva M', 'Calin G', 'Kornblau SM', 'Andreeff M']","['Division of Molecular Hematology, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

The process of aging has also been associated with similar, albeit less dramatic, changes in methylation patterns, leading to the hypothesis that age-related changes in DNA methylation may partially underlie the increased risk of cancer in the elderly. Here we studied 377 participants aged 85 yr from the Newcastle 85+ Study to investigate the extent of, and interindividual variation in, age-related changes in DNA methylation at specific CpG islands. Using highly quantitative pyrosequencing analysis, we found extensive and highly variable methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands with levels ranging from 4% to 35%, even at known tumor suppressor genes such as TWIST2. Furthermore, the interindividual differences in methylation seen across this elderly population phenocopies multiple features of the altered methylation patterns seen in cancer cells. Both aging- and cancer-related methylation can occur at similar sets of genes, both result in the formation of densely methylated, and likely transcriptionally repressed, alleles, and both exhibit coordinate methylation across multiple loci. In addition, high methylation levels were associated with subsequent diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma during a 3-yr follow-up period (P=0.00008). These data suggest that the accumulation of age-related changes in promoter-associated CpG islands may contribute to the increased cancer risk seen during aging.-Gautrey, H. E., van Otterdijk, S.

Among 61 patients, aged 15 to 80 years with median age 25 years, 79% were male and 21% were female. Most of the patients presented with anaemia (67%), fever (66%), lymphadenopathy (64%) and splenomegaly (57%). Other common clinical findings were hepatomegaly (39%), bone tenderness (44%) and bleeding manifestations (34%). Among haemato-pathological findings 67% patients had Hb level </=10gm/dl, 46% patients had WBC count >/=30x10(9)/L, 67% patients had platelet count </=100x10(9)/L, 93% patients had blast in peripheral blood and 61% patients had >/=90 % blasts in the bone marrow at the time of diagnosis. In this study adult ALL patients were analyzed only for their clinical and haemato-pathological characteristics. But their biologic characteristics were not analyzed due to lack of availability of facility.

Despite its routine use for the prevention of tumor lysis-related hyperuricemia prior to chemotherapy, the risk of allopurinol-induced hypersensitivity has not been investigated in patients with hematologic malignancies. This retrospective cohort study was conducted to investigate the incidence and risk factors of allopurinol-induced hypersensitivity in patients at least 18 years of age with hematologic malignancies. We reviewed 463 patients who had ever taken allopurinol for the prevention of hyperuricemia prior to chemotherapy and had undergone serologic HLA typing as a pre-transplant evaluation from January 2000 to May 2010. Thirteen (2.8%) patients experienced maculopapular eruptions (MPE) and none experienced SCARs. Among subtypes of underlying hematologic malignancies, percentage of chronic myeloid leukemia was significantly higher in the allopurinol hypersensitivity group compared with the tolerant group (23.1% (3/13) vs. 5.9% (26/440), P = 0.044). According to HLA subtypes, the incidence of allopurinol-induced MPE was 4.0% in HLA-B58 (+) patients (2/50) and 2.7% in HLA-B58 (-) patients (11/403) but this difference was statistically insignificant. In contrast to HLA-B58, the frequencies of DR9 and DR14 were significantly higher in the allopurinol-induced MPE group compared with the allopurinol tolerant group (38.5% (5/13) vs. 13.6% (53/443), P = 0.019, and 38.5% (5/13) vs. 15.6% (41/440), P = 0.038, respectively).

It induced DNA damage and apoptosis in leukemia HL 60 cells. To fully understand the mechanism behind the 10AB apoptotic induction against HL 60 cells, we extended our previous findings and further explored the precise molecular targets of 10AB. We found that the use of 10AB increased apoptosis by 8.9%-87.6% and caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by 15.2%-95.2% in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by annexin-V/PI and JC-1 staining assays, respectively. Moreover, our findings indicated that the pretreatment of HL 60 cells with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, diminished MMP disruption and apoptosis induced by 10AB, suggesting that ROS overproduction plays a crucial rule in the cytotoxic activity of 10AB. The results of a cell-free system assay indicated that 10AB could act as a topoisomerase catalytic inhibitor through the inhibition of topoisomerase IIalpha. On the protein level, the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, caspase inhibitors XIAP and survivin, as well as hexokinase II were inhibited by the use of 10AB. On the other hand, the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was increased after 10AB treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that 10AB-induced apoptosis is mediated through the overproduction of ROS and the disruption of mitochondrial metabolism.","['Shih, Huei-Chuan', 'El-Shazly, Mohamed', 'Juan, Yung-Shun', 'Chang, Chao-Yuan', 'Su, Jui-Hsin', 'Chen, Yu-Cheng', 'Shih, Shou-Ping', 'Chen, Huei-Mei', 'Wu, Yang-Chang', 'Lu, Mei-Chin']","['Shih HC', 'El-Shazly M', 'Juan YS', 'Chang CY', 'Su JH', 'Chen YC', 'Shih SP', 'Chen HM', 'Wu YC', 'Lu MC']","['Department of Nursing, Meiho University, Pingtung 912, Taiwan. x00002213@meiho.edu.tw.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain-Shams University, Organization of African Unity Street, Abassia, Cairo 11566, Egypt. elshazly444@googlemail.com.', 'Department of Urology, Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-Kang Hospital, Kaohsiung 812, Taiwan. juanuro@gmail.com.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan. chaoyuah@kmu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Marine Biotechnology, National Dong Hwa University, Pingtung 944, Taiwan. x2219@nmmba.gov.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Marine Biotechnology, National Dong Hwa University, Pingtung 944, Taiwan. j520c@hotmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Marine Biotechnology, National Dong Hwa University, Pingtung 944, Taiwan. m6430005@hotmail.com.', 'Pingtung Branch of Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Nutrition Branch, Pingtung 912, Taiwan. amy.chenhm@msa.hinet.net.', 'Department of Nursing, Meiho University, Pingtung 912, Taiwan. yachwu@mail.cmu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Marine Biotechnology, National Dong Hwa University, Pingtung 944, Taiwan. jinx6609@nmmba.gov.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (10-acetylirciformonin B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Porifera/chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/pharmacology']",2014/05/27 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['md12053072 [pii]', '10.3390/md12053072 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2014 May 22;12(5):3072-90. doi: 10.3390/md12053072.,,20140522,,PMC4052332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review is to outline the latest advances in our understanding of how these mutations contribute to the formation of T-ALL. RECENT FINDINGS: Aberrant expression of transcription factors that control hematopoiesis can induce an aberrant stem cell-like program in T-cell progenitors, allowing the emergence of an ancestral or preleukemic stem cell (pre-LSC). In contrast, gain-of-function mutations of genes involved in signaling pathways regulating T-cell development, such as NOTCH1, interleukin-7, KIT and FLT3, are insufficient per se to initiate T-ALL but promote pre-LSC growth independent of the thymic niche. Loss-of-function mutations of epigenetic regulators, such as DNMT3A, have been identified in T-ALL, but their role in leukemogenesis remains to be defined. SUMMARY: Relapse is associated with clonal evolution from a population of pre-LSCs that acquire the whole set of malignant mutations leading to a full-blown T-ALL. Understanding the genetic events that underpin the pre-LSC will be crucial for reducing the risk of relapse.","['Tremblay, Cedric S', 'Curtis, David J']","['Tremblay CS', 'Curtis DJ']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Department of Clinical Haematology, Central Clinical School, Monash University and Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2014/05/27 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000058 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Jul;21(4):320-5. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000058.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moderately decreased KIT signaling is well known to cause anemia and defective HSC self-renewal, whereas gain-of-function mutations are infrequently found in leukemias. Thus, maintaining KIT signal strength is critically important for homeostasis. KIT signaling in HSCs involves effectors such as SHP2 and PTPN11. This review summarizes the recent developments on the novel mechanisms regulating or reinforcing KIT signal strength in HSCs and its perturbation in polycythemia vera. RECENT FINDINGS: Stem cell leukemia (SCL) is a transcription factor that is essential for HSC development. Genetic experiments indicate that Kit, protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (Ptpn11), or Scl control long-term HSC self-renewal, survival, and quiescence in adults. Kit is now shown to be centrally involved in two feedforward loops in HSCs, one with Ptpn11 and the other with Scl. SUMMARY: Knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms that favor self-renewal divisions or a lineage determination process is central to the design of strategies to expand HSCs for the purpose of cell therapy. In addition, transcriptome and phosphoproteome analyses of erythroblasts in polycythemia vera identified lower SCL expression and hypophosphorylated KIT, suggesting that the KIT-SCL loop is relevant to the pathophysiology of human blood disorders as well.","['Rojas-Sutterlin, Shanti', 'Lecuyer, Eric', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Rojas-Sutterlin S', 'Lecuyer E', 'Hoang T']","['aInstitute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal bMolecular Biology Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal cInstitut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal (IRCM) dDepartment of Biochemistry eDepartment of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2014/05/27 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000052 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Jul;21(4):256-64. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000052.,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identify leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a tumor promoter that mediates proinvasive activation of stromal fibroblasts independent of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression. We demonstrate that a pulse of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) establishes stable proinvasive fibroblast activation by inducing LIF production in both fibroblasts and tumor cells. In fibroblasts, LIF mediates TGF-beta-dependent actomyosin contractility and extracellular matrix remodeling, which results in collective carcinoma cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, carcinomas from multiple origins and melanomas display strong LIF upregulation, which correlates with dense collagen fiber organization, cancer cell collective invasion, and poor clinical outcome. Blockade of JAK activity by Ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor) counteracts fibroblast-dependent carcinoma cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. These findings establish LIF as a proinvasive fibroblast producer independent of alpha-SMA and may open novel therapeutic perspectives for patients with aggressive primary tumors.","['Albrengues, Jean', 'Bourget, Isabelle', 'Pons, Catherine', 'Butet, Vincent', 'Hofman, Paul', 'Tartare-Deckert, Sophie', 'Feral, Chloe C', 'Meneguzzi, Guerrino', 'Gaggioli, Cedric']","['Albrengues J', 'Bourget I', 'Pons C', 'Butet V', 'Hofman P', 'Tartare-Deckert S', 'Feral CC', 'Meneguzzi G', 'Gaggioli C']","['INSERM, U1081, CNRS, UMR7284, Institute for Research on Cancer and Aging, Nice (IRCAN), University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, Medical School, 28 Avenue Valombrose, F-06107 Nice, France.', 'INSERM, U1081, CNRS, UMR7284, Institute for Research on Cancer and Aging, Nice (IRCAN), University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, Medical School, 28 Avenue Valombrose, F-06107 Nice, France.', 'INSERM, U1081, CNRS, UMR7284, Institute for Research on Cancer and Aging, Nice (IRCAN), University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, Medical School, 28 Avenue Valombrose, F-06107 Nice, France.', 'Pathological Anatomy and Cytology Laboratory, 270 Avenue Sainte-Marguerite, F-06200 Nice, France.', 'Laboratory of Clinical and Experimental Pathology and Hospital-Integrated Tumor Biobank, Pasteur Hospital, F-06002 Nice, France.', 'INSERM, U1065, Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Medicine (C3M), University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06204 Nice, France.', 'INSERM, U1081, CNRS, UMR7284, Institute for Research on Cancer and Aging, Nice (IRCAN), University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, Medical School, 28 Avenue Valombrose, F-06107 Nice, France.', 'INSERM, U1081, CNRS, UMR7284, Institute for Research on Cancer and Aging, Nice (IRCAN), University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, Medical School, 28 Avenue Valombrose, F-06107 Nice, France.', 'INSERM, U1081, CNRS, UMR7284, Institute for Research on Cancer and Aging, Nice (IRCAN), University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, Medical School, 28 Avenue Valombrose, F-06107 Nice, France.

METHODS: A survey online was conducted by the European Federation of Associations of Patients with Haemochromatosis (EFAPH) and applied to members of nine National Associations. RESULTS: From a total of 1019 validated questionnaires, 895 respondents had performed a genetic testing for HH. From these, 627 self-declared that they were sufficiently informed about the implications of the genetic test to their health. The majority (66%) obtained the information from a specialist doctor, but would like to obtain it from the family doctor. However, the specialist was still the one they trusted more (69%). Regarding the 298 respondents who did not feel sufficiently informed, the majority (78%) also would like to have information from the family doctor although they also trusted the specialist more (75%). A different perspective was reported when patients were asked about the implications of the genetic testing to their family members, where the majority of respondents preferred obtaining information from a specialist (69%). CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the patients' needs for information and identifies the general practitioner (GP) as the preferred source to obtain information about HH. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These results may have important implications in future strategies for HH awareness, giving a special emphasis on GPs as the main players.","['Teixeira, Emerencia', 'Borlido-Santos, Julio', 'Brissot, Pierre', 'Butzeck, Barbara', 'Courtois, Francoise', 'Evans, Robert W', 'Fernau, Janet', 'Nunes, Joao Arriscado', 'Mullett, Margaret', 'Paneque, Milena', 'Pineau, Brigitte', 'Porto, Graca', 'Sorrill, Robert', 'Sanchez, Mayka', 'Swinkels, Dorine W', 'Toska, Ketil', 'Varkonyi, Judit']","['Teixeira E', 'Borlido-Santos J', 'Brissot P', 'Butzeck B', 'Courtois F', 'Evans RW', 'Fernau J', 'Nunes JA', 'Mullett M', 'Paneque M', 'Pineau B', 'Porto G', 'Sorrill R', 'Sanchez M', 'Swinkels DW', 'Toska K', 'Varkonyi J']","['IBMC - Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; FCUP - Faculty of Science, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'IBMC - Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'National Reference Centre for Rare Iron Overload Disorders of Genetic Origin and Inserm U-991, Pontchaillou University Hospital, Rennes, France.', 'Haemochromatose-Vereinigung Deutschland e.V.(HVD), Koeln, Germany; EFAPH - European Federation of Associations of Patients with Haemochromatosis, Croissy-sur-Seine, France.', ""FFAMH - Federation Francaise des Associations de Malades de l'Hemochromatose, Paris, France; EFAPH - European Federation of Associations of Patients with Haemochromatosis, Croissy-sur-Seine, France."", 'Doctor-on-a-Chip Laboratory, Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, School of Engineering and Design, Brunel University, Uxbridge, United Kingdom; The Haemochromatosis Society, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom.', 'The Haemochromatosis Society, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom.', 'CES - Centre for Social Studies, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Irish Haemochromatosis Association, Dublin, Ireland.', 'IBMC - Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; CGPP - Centre for Predictive and Preventive Medicine, Porto, Portugal.', ""FFAMH - Federation Francaise des Associations de Malades de l'Hemochromatose, Paris, France."", 'IBMC - Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; CGPP - Centre for Predictive and Preventive Medicine, Porto, Portugal; CHP-HSA, Porto Hospital Center - Santo Antonio Hospital, Porto, Portugal; Associacao Portuguesa de Hemocromatose, Porto, Portugal.

METHODS: Normal HL-60 cells as control group, the cell proliferation level of HL-60 cells was detected by MTT assay, being treated by different concentration TP (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 nmol/L) for 24 h or 48 h respectively; Choosing the 3.125 nmol/L and the 6.25 nmol/L TP affected HL-60 cells for 48 h, the cell apoptosis rate and cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry, the expressions of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK-1) and methyltransferase DNMT1, DNMT3B mRNA were measured by real time-PCR (RT-PCR), LINE-1, DAPK-1 genes'methylation variations were analyzed by methylation specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS: Compared with control group, the different concentration TP could significantly inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 in a time-dose dependent manner (P<0.05, P<0.01). After being treated by TP for 48 h, the cell early apoptosis rate of control group and 6.250 nmol/L TP group were (2.07 +/- 1.91)%, (9.77 +/- 3.52)%, respectively (P<0.05); When the TP concentration increased, DAPK-1mRNA expression increased (P<0.01), DNMT1, DNMT3B mRNA expression significantly dampened (P<0.01); the promoter of LINE-1, DAPK-1 genes were hypermethylation state in the control group, after being treated by TP for 48 h, the brightness of LINE-1, DAPK-1 genes'methylation strips weakened, and the non-methylation strips enhanced all in a dose-dependent manner.

METHODS: A total of 231 patients with leukemia, who underwent allo-HSCT in Changhai Hospital from Jan 1st, 2001 to Dec 31th, 2011, were retrospectively analyzed. The overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), transplantation-related mortality (TRM) and relapse rate (RR) were estimated according to the degree of acute and chronic GVHD. RESULTS: (1) Among the 224 assessable patients, aGVHD was observed in 85 patients, in which 46 developed grade I, 25 grade II and 14 grade III-IV. A total of 213 patients who survived beyond 100 days, cGVHD was observed in 109 patients, in which 84 developed limited cGVHD and 25 extensive cGVHD. (2)The incidence of 3-year OS and EFS of patients with aGVHD grade 0-I was significantly higher than that of grade II-IV (69.5% vs 33.6%, P<0.01; 60.7% vs 33.7%, P<0.01). The 3-year TRM of patients with 0-I grade aGVHD was significantly lower than that of the grade II-IV group (15.0% vs 56.7%, P<0.01). (3)The 5-year OS of patients with limited cGVHD was higher than patients without or with extensive cGVHD (79.8% vs 55.6% and 56.4%, P<0.01 and P=0.038, respectively). The 5-year TRM in patients with extensive cGVHD was higher than patients with limited cGVHD (14.1% vs 41.1%, P=0.018). However, the 5-year RR in patients without cGVHD was higher than patients with limited cGVHD or extensive cGVHD (47.2% vs 10.9% and 12.4%, P<0.01 and P=0.007, respectively). (4) The COX analysis showed that unrelated donor and myeloablative conditioning regimen were main factors affecting aGVHD; Meanwhile, aGVHD was the only factor affecting the cGVHD. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the patients with acute GVHD tended to have poor outcomes, especially with grade III-IV.

Clinically, these lesions can be used to stratify patients into categories of risk, which directs further clinical management and prognostication. Patient risk categories were first described based on recurrent karyotypic abnormalities; most patients with AML, however, fall into intermediate cytogenetic risk, the majority harboring a normal karyotype. Subsequently, identification of recurrently mutated genes, including FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA, allowed further stratification of patients with a normal karyotype. More extensive genomic and epigenomic analysis of AML samples has expanded the number of known molecular alterations present in this disease. The further understanding of this mutational landscape has shed light into the pathogenesis of AML. AML arises in a founding clone that often gives rise to subclones. Clonal evolution is a feature of the natural history of the disease but may also be influenced by the selective pressure of chemotherapy. The complex network of genetic and epigenetic alterations in this disease has yielded numerous new targets for intervention. In the future, further understanding of this mutational framework, along with the development of novel therapeutic targets, may lead to improved outcomes for patients with AML.","['Graubert, Timothy A', 'Brunner, Andrew M', 'Fathi, Amir T']","['Graubert TA', 'Brunner AM', 'Fathi AT']","['From the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'From the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'From the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Recent advances provide more information to inform the decision, including molecular studies of leukemia that predict tumor responsiveness, assays of minimal residual disease that measure early treatment outcome, and comorbidity indices that predict nonrelapse mortality. Although large prospective studies incorporating all of these factors are lacking, literature reviews and consensus statements exist that can help the clinician in this difficult choice. Allogeneic HCT should be considered for all patients younger than age 65, with an available donor, an acceptable comorbidity index, and whose had initial induction therapy has failed. Similarly, allogeneic HCT is appropriate therapy for all patients with AML in second remission younger than age 75, with an appropriate donor, and a comorbidity index of 5 or less. For patients younger than age 60 with AML in first complete remission (CR), there is little evidence that HCT benefits those with favorable-risk disease who achieve CR with one cycle of induction and have no evidence of minimal residual disease. Allogeneic HCT is indicated for essentially all other categories of patients. For those age 60 and older, few prospective studies are available on which to base recommendations, but, as in younger patients, the benefit of allogeneic HCT is questionable for patients with favorable-risk AML. For patients with higher-risk disease, allogeneic HCT is a reasonable option with the caution that the risk of HCT increases dramatically in those with a comorbidity index of 3 or higher.","['Appelbaum, Frederick R']",['Appelbaum FR'],"['From the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

These include the antibody obintutuzumab (GA-101), as well as small-molecule inhibitors of key pathways involved in the pathogenesis of CLL, specifically the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway (especially Bruton's tyrosine kinase [BTK] and P13K), and the antiapoptotic pathway (especially BCL-2). We will consider each in turn, focusing on the molecules most advanced in clinical development. There has also been extensive development in rewiring the patient's own immune system to treat CLL. This has been done through modifying autologous T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Thus far all CAR-T preparations have targeted the CD19 antigen. This is a good rational for B-cell malignancies as CD19 expression is limited to B-cell malignancies and normal B cells. The in vivo amplification of the transduced T cells relies on signaling and co-signaling domains and provides significant killing of CLL cells. As exciting as these novel agents and approaches are, they obviously beg the question, will chemotherapy as a treatment for CLL soon be obsolete? Although chemotherapy is associated with known short-term toxicities, it has the advantage of being completed in a short period of time and being relatively inexpensive in comparison to novel therapies. In addition, long-term follow-up of results with chemoimmunotherapy have now identified a group of patients whose remissions are maintained for more than 10 years. An important question that will arise going forward is how to incorporate novel agents without eliminating the long term benefits possible with chemoimmunotherapy in a subset of patients with CLL.","['Brown, Jennifer R', 'Porter, David L', ""O'Brien, Susan M""]","['Brown JR', 'Porter DL', ""O'Brien SM""]","['From the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'From the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'From the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

No major differences in the biology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CCL) are seen across the age spectrum.

Long-term follow-up of the ALSYMPCA safety population showed that the incidence of myelosuppression remained low among patients treated with radium-223, with no additional safety issues of acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, or primary bone cancer within approximately 1.5 years after treatment. The radium-223 overall survival benefit and low toxicity make it an effective, well-tolerated, and novel treatment option for CRPC and symptomatic bone metastases and opens the possibility of exploring radium-223 in the treatment of bone metastases from other cancers. A phase I clinical trial of patients with breast and prostate cancer with skeletal metastases demonstrated that radium-223 was safe and well tolerated at all therapeutically relevant dosages. Moreover, a phase IIa trial of patients with advanced breast cancer and progressive bone-dominant disease demonstrated that radium-223 targeted areas of increased bone metabolism and showed biologic activity.","['Nilsson, Sten']",['Nilsson S'],"['From the Karolinska Institute and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

To date, clinical studies of alpha-particle immunotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have focused on the myeloid cell surface antigen CD33 as a target using the humanized monoclonal antibody lintuzumab. An initial phase I study demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and antileukemic effects of bismuth-213 ((213)Bi)-labeled lintuzumab. In a subsequent study, (213)Bi-lintuzumab produced remissions in some patients with AML after partial cytoreduction with cytarabine, suggesting the utility of targeted alpha-particle therapy for small-volume disease. The widespread use of (213)Bi, however, is limited by its short half-life. Therefore, a second-generation construct containing actinium-225 ((225)Ac), a radiometal that generates four alpha-particle emissions, was developed. A phase I trial demonstrated that (225)Ac-lintuzumab is safe at doses of 3 muCi/kg or less and has antileukemic activity across all dose levels studied. Fractionated-dose (225)Ac-lintuzumab in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) is now under investigation for the management of older patients with untreated AML in a multicenter trial. Preclinical studies using (213)Bi- and astatine-211 ((211)At)-labeled anti-CD45 antibodies have shown that alpha-particle immunotherapy may be useful as part conditioning before hematopoietic cell transplantation. The use of novel pretargeting strategies may further improve target-to-normal organ dose ratios.","['Jurcic, Joseph G', 'Rosenblat, Todd L']","['Jurcic JG', 'Rosenblat TL']","['From the Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center; the New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'From the Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center; the New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Both tests are technically demanding and require a high level of specialization and standardization. RQ-PCR, when performed on a regular basis, allows for the defining of molecular response (MR) levels as log reduction from a standardized baseline: major molecular response (MMR or MR(3)) that is the best predictor of survival; and the deeper molecular response (MR(4), MR(4.5), and MR(5)) that is necessary to enroll a patient in a trial aiming at treatment-free remission (TFR). Mutational analysis, to be performed in case of failure or warning by Sanger sequencing, allows for screening of the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain for mutations conferring resistance to TKIs. Since different mutations have different degrees of sensitivity to each of the currently available TKI, the knowledge of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain-mutation status is necessary for subsequent treatment choice. Optimal patient management requires that MR and mutational information be rationally interpreted at both the technical and at the biologic level, and put into context-therapeutic decisions also take into account other factors, such as age, comorbidities, side effects, compliance, and treatment-related complications.","['Baccarani, Michele', 'Soverini, Simona', 'De Benedittis, Caterina']","['Baccarani M', 'Soverini S', 'De Benedittis C']","[""From the Department of Hematology-Oncology 'L. and A.

The former is a DNA repair protein associated with genomic stability and apoptosis, whereas the latter is an antiapoptotic protein having a DNA repair function through inhibition of PARP-1. Because genomic stability is critical for prognosis in B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL), we studied the expression of PARP-1 and Bcl-2 proteins in patients with B-ALL of different ages and compared the results with cytogenetic data. The PARP-1 protein was overexpressed in about two-thirds (61%) of patients with B-ALL. It had a nuclear location, whereas Bcl-2 protein was cytosolic. Expression of the 2 proteins showed a highly positive correlation (rho = 0.367; P < .001). Overexpression of PARP-1 correlated with a complex karyotype (P = .030), and this correlation remained significant for coexpression of PARP-1 and Bcl-2 proteins (chi(2) = 7.498; P = .024) as well as after exclusion of pediatric patients (n = 9, P = .042). Overexpression of PARP-1 was not significantly more common in diploid versus aneuploid karyotypes (50% versus 59%, P = .610). The PARP-1 protein showed no correlation with specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with prognosis in B-ALL, as defined by the World Health Organization. In conclusion, high expression of the PARP-1 protein among patients with B-ALL is related to a complex karyotype and Bcl-2 positivity. Although these findings require validation in a larger population, the observations will be valuable in planning therapeutic trials (such as of PARP inhibitors and BH3 mimetics).","['Pournazari, Payam', 'Padmore, Ruth F', 'Kosari, Farid', 'Scalia, Peter', 'Shahbani-Rad, Meer-Taher', 'Shariff, Sami', 'Demetrick, Douglas J', 'Bosch, Mark', 'Mansoor, Adnan']","['Pournazari P', 'Padmore RF', 'Kosari F', 'Scalia P', 'Shahbani-Rad MT', 'Shariff S', 'Demetrick DJ', 'Bosch M', 'Mansoor A']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS), Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 2T9.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada T2N 2T9.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS), Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 2T9.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada T2N 2T9.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS), Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 2T9.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS), Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 2T9.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS), Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 2T9.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS), Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 2T9.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary and Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS), Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 2T9.

Targeted therapy against CD20 with the mAb rituximab led to significant improvements in survival for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and is the current mainstay of treatment for CD20(+) malignancies. Despite this, many patients relapse or become refractory after rituximab-containing therapies, so efforts have been made to develop better anti-CD20 mAbs. Obinutuzumab recently demonstrated superiority over rituximab in the only published Phase III study comparing the two antibodies. AREAS COVERED: Obinutuzumab is a humanised, anti-CD20 mAb being compared to rituximab in several Phase III studies. An overview of obinutuzumab, its mechanisms of action and results of Phase I-III studies are presented. EXPERT OPINION: The demonstration of superiority of obinutuzumab over rituximab in the CLL11 Phase III study is potentially practice-changing. Obinutuzumab has also proven safe and efficacious in CD20(+) NHL in Phase I/II studies and results of Phase III studies in NHL are eagerly awaited. The potential implications of improved outcomes for CLL and NHL with the introduction of this more potent anti-CD20 antibody are tremendous given the impressive results obtained after the introduction of rituximab over a decade ago.","['Owen, Carolyn J', 'Stewart, Douglas A']","['Owen CJ', 'Stewart DA']","['University of Calgary, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies , 603 South Tower, Foothills Medical Centre, 1403-29th St NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 2T9 , Canada carolyn.owen@albertahealthservices.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Rituximab']",2014/05/27 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2014.922535 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2014 Aug;14(8):1197-205. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2014.922535.

The activating NKG2D receptor expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, when engaged by its corresponding ligands (MIC A/B), activates NK cells to become cytotoxic against malignant cells. METHODS: We incubated acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells for 24 h with 10 ng/mL of romidepsin. Flow cytometry was performed to demonstrate changes in surface expression of NKG2D ligands MIC A/B. In vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity was measured by means of modified Europium assay, and non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice were xenografted with RS 4:11 cells. RESULTS: We demonstrated an approximately 50, 200, 1300 and 180-fold increase in the number of cells positive for the surface expression of MIC A/B in RS 4:11 (P < 0.001), REH (P < 0.001), Ramos (P < 0.001) and Jurkat cells (P < 0.001), respectively. We further demonstrated a significant increase in NK cell-mediated in vitro cytotoxicity against RS 4:11 (P < 0.004), Ramos (P < 0.05), Jurkat (P < 0.001) and REH cells (P < 0.01), respectively. Romidepsin-mediated NK cytotoxicity was blocked by pre-incubating NK cells with anti-NKG2D-Fc in RS 4:11 (P < 0.03) and Ramos cells (P < 0.01), respectively. Finally, non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice xenografted with RS 4:11 cells had a significant increase in survival (P < 0.02) in mice treated with romidepsin and interleukin-2-activated NK cells compared with each of these other treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Romidepsin significantly enhanced in vitro and in vivo NK cell cytotoxicity mediated in part by increased MIC A/B expression on malignant cells. This translational approach of the use of romidepsin and interleukin-2-activated NK cells should be considered in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia or lymphoma.","['Satwani, Prakash', 'Bavishi, Sejal', 'Saha, Aniket', 'Zhao, Frances', 'Ayello, Janet', 'van de Ven, Carmella', 'Chu, Yaya', 'Cairo, Mitchell S']","['Satwani P', 'Bavishi S', 'Saha A', 'Zhao F', 'Ayello J', 'van de Ven C', 'Chu Y', 'Cairo MS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

The ability of NK cells to kill target cells or produce cytokines depends on the balance between signals from activating and inhibitory cell-surface receptors. The selection of NK cells with a predominant activating profile is critical for delivering successful anti-tumor activity. This can be achieved through selection of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-mismatched NK donors and by use of blocking molecules against inhibitory pathways. Optimum NK cytotoxicity may require licensing or priming with tumor cells. Recent discoveries in the molecular and cellular biology of NK cells inform in the design of new strategies, including adjuvant therapies, to maximize the cytotoxic potential of NK cells for adoptive transfer to treat human malignancies.","['Davies, James O J', 'Stringaris, Kate', 'Barrett, A John', 'Rezvani, Katayoun']","['Davies JOJ', 'Stringaris K', 'Barrett AJ', 'Rezvani K']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.

However, recent high-resolution sequencing studies have uncovered mounting evidence for the complementary role of epigenetic deregulation as a hallmark of haematological malignancies. The reversibility of epigenetic changes makes them suitable candidates for pharmacological manipulation and therapeutic targeting. AREAS COVERED: This review summarises the mechanisms of normal epigenetic regulation and how these are perturbed in haematological malignancies as a result of genetic alterations. The article concludes with how these can be reversed and appraises the investigational epigenetically targeted therapies in preclinical and clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: The identification of recurring alterations in components of the epigenome of leukaemia and lymphoma has driven the rapid development of highly potent epigenetically targeted therapies. This rapid development has alluded to the possibility of a personalised therapeutic approach in selected patient populations. An enhanced understanding of the biological effects of these epigenetic alterations in initiation and progression of haematological malignancies, together with a clear mechanistic insight into how the drugs reverse the phenotypes, will define their translation into routine clinical use.","['Okosun, Jessica', 'Packham, Graham', 'Fitzgibbon, Jude']","['Okosun J', 'Packham G', 'Fitzgibbon J']","['Queen Mary University of London, Barts Cancer Institute - a Cancer Research UK Centre of Excellence, Centre for Haemato-Oncology, John Vane Science Centre , Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ , UK +44 20 7882 8780 ; +44 20 7882 3891 ; j.e.okosun@qmul.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Design', 'Drugs, Investigational/pharmacology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy']",2014/05/27 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2014.923402 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2014 Oct;23(10):1321-32. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2014.923402.

Unfortunately, once a patient with a hematological malignancy has complications, the prognosis is poor and the in hospital and ICU mortality rates are high. Debates concerning the reluctance to admit patients into ICUs with poor prognoses often emerge. The aim of the present study is to identify the patients who are more likely to benefit from ICU admissions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the outcomes and to identify early mortality risk factors in patients with lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Songklanagarind Hospital in the south of Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia admitted to the ICU during the period of January 2004 through May 2008. Demographic factors, acute physiology, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores and variables noted in the first 24-hours were collected. The risk factors for deaths in the ICU were studied by univariate and multivariate analysis. The risk factors taken from the best multivariate analysis model were calculated to predict the probability of lCU mortality. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients were studied. The ICU mortality rate was 55.2%. The major cause of death was septic shock. Using univariate analysis, the significant mortality risk factors were neutropenia, mechanical ventilation, the use of vasopressors, abnormal serum creatinine (Cr) and APACHE II scores (p < 0.05). Using multivariate analysis, ICU mortality was best predicted on admission by mechanical ventilation, the use of vasopressors and the APACHE II scores. The presence of neutropenia, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors and an APACHE II score of greater than 27 predicts 80% sensitivity and a 75% specificity for an 82% ICU mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia admitted into the ICU referral center in the south of Thailand who had mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors and APACHE II scores greater than 27 were associated with a higher ICU mortality rate. The authors suggest that early identification of the subgroup of patients whose probability of survival is so low that advanced ICU support should not be continued would be a more reasonable goal. This will allow more efficient care to potential survivors not in this group.","['Khwankeaw, Jirateep', 'Bhurayanontachai, Rungsun']","['Khwankeaw J', 'Bhurayanontachai R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Critical Care', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Referral and Consultation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thailand', 'Young Adult']",2014/05/27 06:00,2014/06/27 06:00,['2014/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2014 Jan;97 Suppl 1:S77-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is the standard treatment for CML. However, the development of imatinib resistance has become a new challenge for CML treatment. Here, we investigated the expression levels of the signaling pathways to explore the cause of imatinib resistance and seek new reversing drugs. Our results showed that abnormal activation of the BCR-ABL-independent Lyn/ERK signaling pathway was involved in imatinib-resistance of K562R cells. Furthermore, p-Lyn and p-ERK were up-regulated after treatment with imatinib alone. However, U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, could counteract the up-regulation induced by imatinib, and the combination of imatinib and U0126 could overcome the resistance to imatinib in K562R cells.

The RH domains interact specifically with the alpha subunits of G12 heterotrimeric GTPases. Activated Galpha13 modestly stimulates the exchange activity of both p115RhoGEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF but not PDZ-RhoGEF. Because all three RH-RhoGEFs can localize to the plasma membrane upon expression of activated Galpha13, cellular localization of these RhoGEFs has been proposed as a mechanism for controlling their activity. We use a small molecule-regulated heterodimerization system to rapidly control the localization of RH-RhoGEFs. Acute localization of the proteins to the plasma membrane activates RhoA within minutes and to levels that are comparable with activation of RhoA by hormonal stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. The catalytic activity of membrane-localized RhoGEFs is not dependent on activated Galpha13. We further show that the conserved RH domains can rewire two different RacGEFs to activate Rac1 in response to a traditional activator of RhoA. Thus, RH domains act as independent detectors for activated Galpha13 and are sufficient to modulate the activity of RhoGEFs by hormones via mediating their localization to substrate, membrane-associated RhoA.","['Carter, Angela M', 'Gutowski, Stephen', 'Sternweis, Paul C']","['Carter AM', 'Gutowski S', 'Sternweis PC']","['From the Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas 75390.', 'From the Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas 75390.', 'From the Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas 75390 Paul.Sternweis@UTsouthwestern.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ARHGEF11 protein, human)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '124671-05-2 (RHOA protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Catalysis', '*Cell Membrane/chemistry/enzymology/genetics', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', '*Hormones/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Multimerization/*physiology', '*Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2014/05/24 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47736-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.564930 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 11;289(28):19737-46. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.564930.

In addition, several of these molecules are being tested in clinical trials or already in use in the clinic. Antimetabolites, such as the DNA-hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC), have been shown to lower malignant progression to acute myeloid leukemia and to prolong survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Here we examined the effects of DNA methylation inhibitors on the expression of lipid biosynthetic and uptake genes. Our data demonstrate that, independently of DNA methylation, 5-AzaC selectively and very potently reduces expression of key genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism (e.g. PCSK9, HMGCR, and FASN) in all tested cell lines and in vivo in mouse liver. Treatment with 5-AzaC disturbed subcellular cholesterol homeostasis, thereby impeding activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (key regulators of lipid metabolism). Through inhibition of UMP synthase, 5-AzaC also strongly induced expression of 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 9 (AGPAT9) and promoted triacylglycerol synthesis and cytosolic lipid droplet formation. Remarkably, complete reversal was obtained by the co-addition of either UMP or cytidine. Therefore, this study provides the first evidence that inhibition of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis by 5-AzaC disturbs cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, probably through the glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway, which may contribute mechanistically to its beneficial cytostatic properties.","['Poirier, Steve', 'Samami, Samaneh', 'Mamarbachi, Maya', 'Demers, Annie', 'Chang, Ta Yuan', 'Vance, Dennis E', 'Hatch, Grant M', 'Mayer, Gaetan']","['Poirier S', 'Samami S', 'Mamarbachi M', 'Demers A', 'Chang TY', 'Vance DE', 'Hatch GM', 'Mayer G']","['From the Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal, Quebec H1T 1C8, Canada, the Departement de Pharmacologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'From the Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal, Quebec H1T 1C8, Canada, the Departement de Pharmacologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'From the Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal, Quebec H1T 1C8, Canada.', 'From the Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal, Quebec H1T 1C8, Canada.', 'the Department of Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-1404.', 'the Department of Biochemistry and Group on the Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2S2, Canada.', 'the DREAM Theme, Manitoba Institute of Child Health, Departments of Pharmacology and Therapeutics and Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3E 0T6, Canada, and.', 'From the Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal, Quebec H1T 1C8, Canada, the Departement de Pharmacologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3C 3J7, Canada, the Departement de Medecine, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3C 3J7, Canada gaetan.mayer@icm-mhi.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SREBF2 protein, human)', '0 (Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'K8CXK5Q32L (pyrimidine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidines/biosynthesis', 'Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2/genetics']",2014/05/24 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)40466-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.563650 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 4;289(27):18736-51. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.563650.

Antineuroinflammatory strategies have identified the dietary-derived epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as an efficient agent to prevent neuroinflammation-associated neurodegenerative diseases by targeting proinflammatory mediator signaling. METHODS: Given that high levels of sphingosine kinase and its product, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), are present in brain tumors, we used quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting to test whether EGCG may impact on S1P receptor gene expression and prevent S1P response in undifferentiated and in terminally differentiated macrophages. RESULTS: Promyelomonocytic human leukemia (HL)-60 cells were differentiated into macrophages, and S1P triggered phosphorylation in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular signaling, as shown by Western blot analysis. Pretreatment of cells with EGCG prior to differentiation inhibited the response to S1P in all three pathways, while EGCG abrogated P38 MAPK phosphorylation when present only during differentiation. Terminally-differentiated macrophages were, however, insensitive to EGCG treatment. Using qRT-PCR, gene expression of the S1P receptors S1P1, S1P2, and S1P5 was predominantly induced in terminally-differentiated macrophages, while the S1P2 was decreased by EGCG treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that diet-derived EGCG achieves efficient effects as a preventive agent, targeting signaling pathways prior to cell terminal differentiation. Such properties could impact on cell chemotaxis through the blood-brain barrier and prevent cancer-related neuroinflammation.","['Chokor, Rima', 'Lamy, Sylvie', 'Annabi, Borhane']","['Chokor R', 'Lamy S', 'Annabi B']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de recherche BIOMED, Departement de Chimie, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de recherche BIOMED, Departement de Chimie, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de recherche BIOMED, Departement de Chimie, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2014/05/24 06:00,2014/05/24 06:01,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S62717 [doi]', 'ott-7-667 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2014 May 7;7:667-77. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S62717. eCollection 2014.,,20140507,,PMC4019616,['NOTNLM'],"['S1P', 'blood-brain barrier', 'chemoprevention', 'green tea EGCG', 'neuroinflammation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To eliminate relapse-causing leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LPCs), patient-specific immune therapies may be required. In vitro cellular engineering may require increasing the ""stemness"" or immunogenicity of tumor cells and activating or restoring cancer-impaired immune-effector and antigen-presenting cells. Leukapheresis samples provide the cells needed to engineer therapies: LPCs to be targeted, normal hematopoietic stem cells to be spared, and cancer-impaired immune cells to be repaired and activated. This study sought to advance development of LPC-targeted therapies by exploring nongenetic ways to slow the decay and to increase the immunogenicity of primary CD34(+) AML cells. CD34(+) AML cells generally displayed more colony-forming and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity than CD34(-) AML cells. Along with exposure to bone marrow stromal cells and low (1%-5%) oxygen, culture with RepSox (a reprogramming tool and inhibitor of transforming growth factor-beta receptor 1) consistently slowed decline of CD34(+) AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cells. RepSox-treated AML cells displayed higher CD34, CXCL12, and MYC mRNA levels than dimethyl sulfoxide-treated controls. RepSox also accelerated loss of T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), an immune checkpoint receptor that impairs antitumor immunity, from the surface of AML and MDS cells. Our results suggest RepSox may reduce Tim-3 expression by inhibiting transforming growth factor-beta signaling and slow decay of CD34(+) AML cells by increasing CXCL12 and MYC, two factors that inhibit AML cell differentiation. By prolonging survival of CD34(+) AML cells and reducing Tim-3, RepSox may promote in vitro immune cell activation and advance development of LPC-targeted therapies.","['Jajosky, Audrey N', 'Coad, James E', 'Vos, Jeffrey A', 'Martin, Karen H', 'Senft, Jamie R', 'Wenger, Sharon L', 'Gibson, Laura F']","['Jajosky AN', 'Coad JE', 'Vos JA', 'Martin KH', 'Senft JR', 'Wenger SL', 'Gibson LF']","['Alexander B.

To clarify this therapeutically important issue, we have analyzed FLT3(ITD) and NPM1(MUT) levels in 1609 younger adult cases of cytogenetically intermediate-risk AML. The cumulative incidence of relapse was increased in NPM1(MUT) cases by the presence of a FLT3(ITD), but did not differ markedly according to FLT3(ITD) level. This remained true when allowance was made for poor leukemic cell purity by adjustment of the FLT3(ITD) level to the measured NPM1(MUT) level.

Here we have investigated longitudinally the effects of induction chemotherapy, conditioning radiochemotherapy, and allogeneic HSCT on composition, phenotype, and recovery of circulating innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in 51 acute leukemia patients. We found that reconstitution of ILC1, ILC2, and NCR(-)ILC3 was slow compared with that of neutrophils and monocytes. NCR(+) ILC3 cells, which are not present in the circulation of healthy persons, appeared both after induction chemotherapy and after allogeneic HSCT. Circulating patient ILCs before transplantation, as well as donor ILCs after transplantation, expressed activation (CD69), proliferation (Ki-67), and tissue homing markers for gut (alpha4beta7, CCR6) and skin (CCR10 and CLA). The proportion of ILCs expressing these markers was associated with a decreased susceptibility to therapy-induced mucositis and acute GVHD. Taken together, these data suggest that ILC recovery and treatment-related tissue damage are interrelated and affect the development of GVHD.","['Munneke, J Marius', 'Bjorklund, Andreas T', 'Mjosberg, Jenny M', 'Garming-Legert, Karin', 'Bernink, Jochem H', 'Blom, Bianca', 'Huisman, Cynthia', 'van Oers, Marinus H J', 'Spits, Hergen', 'Malmberg, Karl-Johan', 'Hazenberg, Mette D']","['Munneke JM', 'Bjorklund AT', 'Mjosberg JM', 'Garming-Legert K', 'Bernink JH', 'Blom B', 'Huisman C', 'van Oers MH', 'Spits H', 'Malmberg KJ', 'Hazenberg MD']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine and.', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Dental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden;', 'Tytgat Institute for Liver and Intestinal Research and Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine and Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; and Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Ki-67 Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mucositis/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Neutrophils/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2014/05/24 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39915-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-11-536888 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 31;124(5):812-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-11-536888.

Its role in tumorigenesis is controversial. Whereas sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) can act as a tumor suppressor in some solid tumors, increased expression has been demonstrated in many cancers, including hematologic malignancies. In chronic myeloid leukemia, SIRT1 promoted leukemia development, and targeting SIRT1 sensitized chronic myeloid leukemia progenitors to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. In this study, we investigated the role of SIRT1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that SIRT1 protein, but not RNA levels, is overexpressed in AML samples harboring activating mutations in signaling pathways. In FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)(+)-cells protein, expression of SIRT1 is regulated by FLT3 kinase activity. In addition, SIRT1 function is modulated via the ATM-DBC1-SIRT1 axis in a FLT3-ITD-dependent manner. In murine leukemia models driven by MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO coexpressing FLT3-ITD, SIRT1 acts as a safeguard to counteract oncogene-induced stress, and leukemic blasts become dependent on SIRT1 activity. Pharmacologic targeting or RNAi-mediated knockdown of SIRT1 inhibited cell growth and sensitized AML cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment and chemotherapy. This effect was a result of the restoration of p53 activity. Our data suggest that targeting SIRT1 represents an attractive therapeutic strategy to overcome primary resistance in defined subsets of patients with AML.","['Sasca, Daniel', 'Hahnel, Patricia S', 'Szybinski, Jakub', 'Khawaja, Kaml', 'Kriege, Oliver', 'Pante, Saskia V', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Strand, Susanne', 'Strand, Dennis', 'Theobald, Matthias', 'Kindler, Thomas']","['Sasca D', 'Hahnel PS', 'Szybinski J', 'Khawaja K', 'Kriege O', 'Pante SV', 'Bullinger L', 'Strand S', 'Strand D', 'Theobald M', 'Kindler T']","['Third Department of Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany;', 'Third Department of Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany;', 'Third Department of Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany;', 'Third Department of Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany;', 'Third Department of Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany;', 'Third Department of Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany; and.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Third Department of Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany;', 'Third Department of Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Damage/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Sirtuin 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2014/05/24 06:00,2014/08/29 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40031-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-11-538819 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 3;124(1):121-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-11-538819.

Here, we identify a novel synergistic combination of Smac mimetic BV6 and glucocorticoids (GCs) (ie, dexamethasone, prednisolone) to trigger apoptosis in ALL cells. BV6 and GCs similarly cooperate to induce apoptosis in patient-derived leukemia samples, underlining the clinical relevance. Importantly, BV6/dexamethasone cotreatment is significantly more effective than monotherapy to delay leukemia growth in a patient-derived xenograft model of pediatric ALL without causing additional side effects. In contrast, BV6 does not increase cytotoxicity of dexamethasone against nonmalignant peripheral blood lymphocytes, mesenchymal stromal cells, and CD34-positive hematopoietic cells. We identify a novel mechanism by showing that BV6 and dexamethasone cooperate to deplete cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, thereby promoting assembly of the ripoptosome, a RIP1/FADD/caspase-8-containing complex. This complex is critical and is required for BV6/dexamethasone-induced cell death, because RIP1 knockdown reduces caspase activation, reactive oxygen species production, and cell death. Ripoptosome formation occurs independently of autocrine/paracrine loops of death receptor ligands, because blocking antibodies for TNFalpha, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, or CD95 ligand or knockdown of death receptors fail to rescue BV6/dexamethasone-induced cell death. This is the first report showing that BV6 sensitizes for GC-triggered cell death by promoting ripoptosome formation with important implications for apoptosis-targeted therapies of ALL.","['Belz, Katharina', 'Schoeneberger, Hannah', 'Wehner, Sibylle', 'Weigert, Andreas', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Fichtner, Iduna', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Belz K', 'Schoeneberger H', 'Wehner S', 'Weigert A', 'Bonig H', 'Klingebiel T', 'Fichtner I', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics.', ""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital."", 'Institute of Biochemistry I, and.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany; and.', ""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital."", 'Experimental Pharmacology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin-Buch, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BV6 peptide)', '0 (Fadd protein, mouse)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Ralbp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein Multimerization/*drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2014/05/24 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40001-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-05-500918 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 10;124(2):240-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-05-500918.

Because the success of today's virostatic treatment is limited by side effects and resistance development, adoptive transfer of virus-specific memory T cells derived from the stem cell donor has been proposed as an alternative therapeutic strategy. In this context, dose minimization of adoptively transferred T cells might be warranted for the avoidance of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in particular in prophylactic settings after T-cell-depleting allo-HSCT protocols. To establish a lower limit for successful adoptive T-cell therapy, we conducted low-dose CD8(+) T-cell transfers in the well-established murine Listeria monocytogenes (L.m.) infection model. Major histocompatibility complex-Streptamer-enriched antigen-specific CD62L(hi) but not CD62L(lo) CD8(+) memory T cells proliferated, differentiated, and protected against L.m. infections after prophylactic application. Even progenies derived from a single CD62L(hi) L.m.-specific CD8(+) T cell could be protective against bacterial challenge. In analogy, low-dose transfers of Streptamer-enriched human CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells into allo-HSCT recipients led to strong pathogen-specific T-cell expansion in a compassionate-use setting. In summary, low-dose adoptive T-cell transfer (ACT) could be a promising strategy, particularly for prophylactic treatment of infectious complications after allo-HSCT.","['Stemberger, Christian', 'Graef, Patricia', 'Odendahl, Marcus', 'Albrecht, Julia', 'Dossinger, Georg', 'Anderl, Florian', 'Buchholz, Veit R', 'Gasteiger, Georg', 'Schiemann, Matthias', 'Grigoleit, Gotz U', 'Schuster, Friedhelm R', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Versluys, Birgitta', 'Tonn, Torsten', 'Seifried, Erhard', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Germeroth, Lothar', 'Busch, Dirk H', 'Neuenhahn, Michael']","['Stemberger C', 'Graef P', 'Odendahl M', 'Albrecht J', 'Dossinger G', 'Anderl F', 'Buchholz VR', 'Gasteiger G', 'Schiemann M', 'Grigoleit GU', 'Schuster FR', 'Borkhardt A', 'Versluys B', 'Tonn T', 'Seifried E', 'Einsele H', 'Germeroth L', 'Busch DH', 'Neuenhahn M']","['Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany;

Our objective was to determine whether the administration of meropenem in a 4 h extended infusion (EI) leads to a better clinical outcome in patients with febrile neutropenia than the conventional short infusion (SI). METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. The subjects were neutropenic patients who presented with fever after receiving haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia. The primary endpoint was the success of treatment after 5 days of meropenem therapy, defined as follows: the disappearance of fever leading to a maintained (>/= 24 h) feverless state; the resolution or improvement of the clinical signs and symptoms of infection; the absence of persistent or breakthrough bacteraemia; and no additional antibiotics prescribed because of an unsatisfactory clinical evolution. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients received meropenem (1 g/8 h) in SI and 76 received the same dose in EI. Treatment success on day 5 was superior in the EI group [52/76 (68.4%) versus 36/88 (40.9%); P<0.001]. Meropenem administered in EI was independently associated with success (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.61-6.10). Fewer additional antibiotics were prescribed in the EI group during the first 5 days of treatment [20/76 (26.3%) versus 44/88 (50.0%); P=0.002]. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis a more prompt defervescence and a faster decrease in C-reactive protein concentration were observed in the EI group (P=0.021 and P=0.037, respectively). There were no significant differences in the length of hospital stay and in the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Meropenem administration in EI results in a better clinical outcome for febrile neutropenia episodes, with fewer additional antibiotics needed.","['Feher, Csaba', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Soriano, Alex', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Martinez, Jose Antonio', 'Marco, Francesc', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Martinez, Carmen', 'Fernandez-Aviles, Francesc', 'Suarez-Lledo, Maria', 'Mensa, Josep']","['Feher C', 'Rovira M', 'Soriano A', 'Esteve J', 'Martinez JA', 'Marco F', 'Carreras E', 'Martinez C', 'Fernandez-Aviles F', 'Suarez-Lledo M', 'Mensa J']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain cfeher@clinic.ub.es.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Microbiology Service, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain Barcelona Centre for International Health Research (CRESIB), Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Thienamycins)', 'FV9J3JU8B1 (Meropenem)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Meropenem', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thienamycins/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/05/24 06:00,2015/04/11 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['dku150 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dku150 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2014 Sep;69(9):2556-62. doi: 10.1093/jac/dku150.

In this study, we have evaluated the impact of expression of the gene BAALC in conjunction with MDR1 in AML with intermediate cytogenetic risk group to more precisely define risk assessment. Low MDR1/high BAALC, high MDR1/low BAALC, and high MDR1/high BAALC expressers demonstrated a similar clinical outcome with CR rate being 68.75-75% and relapse rate being 40-50% and therefore could be considered as a ""combined group"". In contrast, low expression of both BAALC and MDR1 identifies an intermediate cytogenetic risk group a distinctly favorable outcome, with higher CR rate being 93.3%, lower relapse rate being 7.1%, and longer OS being 50.3% than that of the ""combined group"". Moreover, low MDR1/low BAALC expressers in the intermediate cytogenetic risk group also demonstrated a comparable clinical outcome with patients in the favorable-risk group. Thus low MDR1/low BAALC expression identifies a subgroup of intermediate cytogenetic risk AML patients with a remarkably good long-term outcome achieved by chemotherapy alone.","['Guo, Xutao', 'Shi, Pengcheng', 'Chen, Feili', 'Zha, Jie', 'Liu, Bingshan', 'Li, Rongwei', 'Dong, Huijuan', 'Zheng, Haiqing', 'Xu, Bing']","['Guo X', 'Shi P', 'Chen F', 'Zha J', 'Liu B', 'Li R', 'Dong H', 'Zheng H', 'Xu B']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.

An evolutionarily conserved, but poorly understood, histone methylation mark occurs on lysine 79 on histone H3 (H3K79). The H3K79 methyltransferase, DOT1L, is involved in a number of key processes ranging from gene expression to DNA-damage response and cell cycle progression. Recently, DOT1L has also been implicated in the development of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia, where mistargeting of DOT1L causes aberrant H3K79 methylation at homeobox genes. As DOT1L is essential for leukemic transformation, small-molecule inhibitors of DOT1L function are an attractive therapeutic target for this type of leukemia. However, in order to develop safe treatments, it is necessary to also understand the biological functions of DOT1L. Here we review the various functions of DOT1L in normal mammalian development. Dot1L knockout is embryonic lethal in mice and is important for processes as diverse as proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells, induced and natural reprogramming, cardiac development and chondrogenesis. Additionally, while an important role for DOT1L in embryonic hematopoiesis is clear, its role in postnatal hematopoiesis is less so. Establishing the precise function of DOT1L in normal adult hematopoiesis and understanding its mode of action will aid in our understanding of the use of DOT1L as a therapeutic target in MLL-rearranged leukemia.","['McLean, C M', 'Karemaker, I D', 'van Leeuwen, F']","['McLean CM', 'Karemaker ID', 'van Leeuwen F']","['Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['DNA Methylation/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics']",2014/05/24 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014169 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.169 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Nov;28(11):2131-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.169.

Abnormal sideroblasts with accumulation of iron in the mitochondria are named ring sideroblasts (RS). RS is a cardinal feature of refractory anemia with RS (RARS) and RARS with marked thrombocytosis (RARS/-T). Mutations in SF3B1, a member of the RNA splicing machinery are frequent in RARS/-T and defects of this gene were linked to RS formation. Here we showcase the differences in iron architecture of SF3B1-mutant and wild-type (WT) RARS/-T and provide new mechanistic insights by which SF3B1 mutations lead to differences in iron. We found higher iron levels in SF3B1 mutant vs WT RARS/-T by transmission electron microscopy/spectroscopy/flow cytometry. SF3B1 mutations led to increased iron without changing the valence as shown by the presence of Fe(2+) in mutant and WT.

Considered to carry a uniformly dismal prognosis so far, during the last years it has been rediscovered as a heterogeneous clinical and biological entity. Such a complexity has been highlighted by molecular genetics, unraveling different pathways of cell survival and progression. Concurrently, the application of new therapeutic paradigms including rituximab, high-dose cytarabine and stem cell transplantation dramatically improved treatment activity and the introduction of innovative targeted molecules has already led to new patient perspectives. In this completely new and continually evolving landscape, the clinical hemato-oncologist might feel disoriented on what are the best current strategies to handle such a critical disease and the gold standard therapeutic options for MCL. Here we address some burning questions on how to manage MCL patients, spacing from prognostic issues to the dilemma of personalized treatment in different scenarios of the disease: how to diagnose an MCL? Which are the fundamental staging procedures? What are the most reliable prognosticators? Is there a place for watch and wait? Which are the best treatment options for younger, elderly and frail patients? Which patients are addressable to high-dose therapy? What is the role of allogeneic transplantation? What is the most appropriate approach for relapsing disease in different categories of patients? What novelties are going to be introduced in the near future? The practical algorithms here discussed represent an evidence-based approach derived from results of multicenter and randomized trials.","['Dreyling, M', 'Ferrero, S', 'Hermine, O']","['Dreyling M', 'Ferrero S', 'Hermine O']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern/LMU Munchen, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik III, Klinikum der Universitat, Munchen, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Molecular Biotechnologies and Health Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', '1] Department of Adult Hematology, Necker Hospital, Assistance Publique, Paris, France [2] Imagine Institute, Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab', 'Watchful Waiting']",2014/05/24 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014171 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.171 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Nov;28(11):2117-30. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.171.

A total of 206 AML cases and 231 controls were collected for our study. The genotyping of GSTs (GSTM1, GSTTI, and GSTP1) was based upon the duplex polymerase chain reaction with the confronting two-pair primer (PCR-CTPP) method. Individuals carrying null GSTTI and GSTM1 genotypes had a 1.52- and 1.78-fold increased risk of developing acute leukemia, respectively, compared to non-null genotype carriers (P < 0.05). A high risk was observed in those carrying a combination of null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTTI with GSTP1-Val allele genotypes when compared with those carrying wild-type genotypes, with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 3.62 (1.53-8.82) (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that genetic variants of GSTTI and GSTM1 significantly increase the risk of developing AML.

The objective of the present study was to determine the mutational status of SETBP1 and CSF3R in these diseases. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The mutational status of SETBP1 and CSF3R was studied in 7 patients with aCML (n = 3), CNL (n = 1) and unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN-u) (n = 3). Additionally, mutations in ASXL1, SRSF2, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, and RUNX1 were also analyzed. RESULTS: SETBP1 mutations (G870S and G872R) were detected in 2 patients with MPN-u, and one of them also presented mutations in SRSF2 (P95H) and ASXL1 (E635fs). The CNL case showed mutations in CSFR3 (T618I), SETBP1 (G870S) and SRSF2 (P95H). No patient classified as aCML had mutations in SETBP1 or CSF3R. One of the patients with mutations evolved to acute myeloid leukemia, while the other 2 had disease progression without transformation to overt leukemia. CONCLUSION: The knowledge of the molecular alterations involved in these rare diseases is useful in the diagnosis and may have an impact on both prognosis and therapy.","['Senin, Alicia', 'Arenillas, Leonor', 'Martinez-Aviles, Luz', 'Fernandez-Rodriguez, Concepcion', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Florensa, Lourdes', 'Besses, Carles', 'Alvarez-Larran, Alberto']","['Senin A', 'Arenillas L', 'Martinez-Aviles L', 'Fernandez-Rodriguez C', 'Bellosillo B', 'Florensa L', 'Besses C', 'Alvarez-Larran A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Parc de Salut Mar, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Espana.', 'Laboratorio de Citologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital del Mar, Parc de Salut Mar, Barcelona, Espana.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital del Mar, Parc de Salut Mar, Barcelona, Espana.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital del Mar, Parc de Salut Mar, Barcelona, Espana.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital del Mar, Parc de Salut Mar, Barcelona, Espana.', 'Laboratorio de Citologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital del Mar, Parc de Salut Mar, Barcelona, Espana.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Parc de Salut Mar, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Espana.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Parc de Salut Mar, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Espana.

METHODS: Age-adjusted US mortality trends from 1975 to 2010 were estimated using joinpoint regression analysis. Analyses of annual percentage change (APC) were performed on the same diagnostic groupings for the period restricted to 2000 through 2010 for groupings ages <20 years, <15 years, and 15 to 19 years. RESULTS: After a plateau in mortality rates during 1998 to 2002 (APC, 0.3%), the annual decline in childhood cancer mortality from 2002 to 2010 (APC, -2.4%) was similar to that observed from 1975 to 1998 (APC, -2.7%). Statistically significant declines in mortality rates from 2000 to 2010 were noted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, central nervous system cancers, and gonadal cancers. From 2000 to 2010, the rates of decline in mortality for the group ages 15 to 19 years generally were equal to or greater than the rates of decline for the group ages birth to 14 years. Improvements in treatment since 1975 resulted >45,000 cancer deaths averted through 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer mortality for both children and adolescents declined from 2000 to 2010, with significant declines observed for multiple cancer types. However, greater than 1900 cancer deaths still occur each year among children and adolescents in the United States, and many survivors experience long-term effects that limit their quality of life. Continued research directed toward identifying more effective treatments that produce fewer long-term sequelae is critical to address these remaining challenges.","['Smith, Malcolm A', 'Altekruse, Sean F', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Seibel, Nita L']","['Smith MA', 'Altekruse SF', 'Adamson PC', 'Reaman GH', 'Seibel NL']","['Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'SEER Program', 'Survivors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2014/05/24 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2013/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28748 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Aug 15;120(16):2497-506. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28748.

To date, iPSCs of many species have been generated, whereas generation of bat iPSCs (biPSCs) has not been reported. To facilitate in-depth study of bats at the molecular and cellular levels, we describe the successful derivation of biPSCs with a piggyBac (PB) vector that contains eight reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Nanog, cMyc, Lin28, Nr5a2, and miR302/367. These biPSCs were cultured in media containing leukemia inhibitory factor and three small molecule inhibitors (CHIR99021, PD0325901, and A8301). They retained normal karyotype, displayed alkaline phosphatase activity, and expressed pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, TBX3, and TRA-1-60. They could differentiate in vitro to form embryoid bodies and in vivo to form teratomas that contained tissue cells of all three germ layers.

Azacitidine, first-line treatment for the majority of patients with higher-risk MDS, is associated with aggravated thrombocytopenia during the first cycles. Eltrombopag is a novel thrombopoietin receptor agonist, which also has been shown to inhibit proliferation of leukaemia cell lines in vitro. This phase I clinical trial was designed to explore the safety and tolerability of combining eltrombopag with azacitidine in patients with MDS. In addition, we assessed the potential effects of eltrombopag on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from included patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated patients with MDS eligible for treatment with azacitidine and with a platelet count <75 x 10(9) /L were included. Patients received eltrombopag in dose escalation cohorts during three cycles of azacitidine. RESULTS: Twelve patients, with a median age of 74 yr, were included. Severe adverse events included infectious complications, deep vein thrombosis and transient ischaemic attack. The maximal tolerated eltrombopag dose was 200 mg qd. Complete remission or bone marrow remission was achieved in 4 of 12 patients. Platelet counts improved or remained stable in 9 of 12 patients despite azacitidine treatment. No increase in blast count, disease progression, or bone marrow fibrosis related to study medication was reported. Eltrombopag did not induce cycling of HSPCs. CONCLUSION: The combination of eltrombopag with azacitidine in high-risk MDS patients is feasible and well tolerated. Improvements in platelet counts and the potential antileukaemic effect of eltrombopag should be explored in a randomised study.","['Svensson, Tobias', 'Chowdhury, Onima', 'Garelius, Hege', 'Lorenz, Fryderyk', 'Saft, Leonie', 'Jacobsen, Sten-Eirik', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Cherif, Honar']","['Svensson T', 'Chowdhury O', 'Garelius H', 'Lorenz F', 'Saft L', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Cherif H']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzoates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Ischemic Attack, Transient/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Platelet Count', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/agonists/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Venous Thrombosis/etiology/pathology']",2014/05/24 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12383 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2014 Nov;93(5):439-45. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12383.

We expanded by 11 years and more outcomes our previous study of mortality risks and work history, a proxy for radiation exposure. METHODS: Using Cox proportional hazards models, we estimated mortality risks according to questionnaire work history responses from 1983 to 1989 through 2008 by 90,268 US radiological technologists. We controlled for potential confounding by age, birth year, smoking history, body mass index, race and gender. RESULTS: There were 9566 deaths (3329 cancer and 3020 circulatory system diseases). Mortality risks increased significantly with earlier year began working for female breast (p trend=0.01) and stomach cancers (p trend=0.01), ischaemic heart (p trend=0.03) and cerebrovascular diseases (p trend=0.02). The significant trend with earlier year first worked was strongly apparent for breast cancer during baseline through 1997, but not 1998-2008. Risks were similar in the two periods for circulatory diseases. Radiological technologists working >/=5 years before 1950 had elevated mortality from breast cancer (HR=2.05, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.32), leukaemia (HR=2.57, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.68), ischaemic heart disease (HR=1.13, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.33) and cerebrovascular disease (HR=1.28, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.69). No other work history factors were consistently associated with mortality risks from specific cancers or circulatory diseases, or other conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Radiological technologists who began working in early periods and for more years before 1950 had increased mortality from a few cancers and some circulatory system diseases, likely reflecting higher occupational radiation exposures in the earlier years.","['Liu, Jason J', 'Freedman, D Michal', 'Little, Mark P', 'Doody, Michele M', 'Alexander, Bruce H', 'Kitahara, Cari M', 'Lee, Terrence', 'Rajaraman, Preetha', 'Miller, Jeremy S', 'Kampa, Diane M', 'Simon, Steven L', 'Preston, Dale L', 'Linet, Martha S']","['Liu JJ', 'Freedman DM', 'Little MP', 'Doody MM', 'Alexander BH', 'Kitahara CM', 'Lee T', 'Rajaraman P', 'Miller JS', 'Kampa DM', 'Simon SL', 'Preston DL', 'Linet MS']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Information Management Services, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Hirosoft International, Eureka, California, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Allied Health Personnel', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*mortality', '*Employment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Technology, Radiologic', 'Work']",2014/05/24 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2013-101859 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2013-101859 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2014 Dec;71(12):819-35. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2013-101859.

We had recently reported that regulatory variants of MCL1 contribute to enhanced promoter activity but reduced risk of lung cancer. We hypothesized that MCL1 expression may manifest antiproliferative phenotype and its functional variations may have etiological relevance for breast cancer. We manipulated MCL1 expression in MCF-7 cells and MDA231 with overexpression and knockdown, analyzed the effects on cell viability and cell cycling phase, and characterized the correlation with expression profiles of key regulators of cell cycle. We further genotyped the -190 insertion polymorphism and the neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 745 breast cancer patients and 537 controls and analyzed their association with cancer risk. We confirmed that heightened expression of MCL1 resulted in decreased proliferation ability of breast cancer cells. We further observed that MCL1 overexpression in breast cancer cells resulted in cell cycle progression arresting in S phase and concomitant enhanced expression of p27, which could be rescued by p27 knockdown with co-transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Furthermore, we found a significant reduction in breast cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.74; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.59-0.93] associated with -190 insertion genotype; the expression-enhancing regulatory haplotype (OR 0.79; 95 % CI 0.66-0.95) and diplotype (OR 0.71; 95 % CI 0.57-0.89) were consistently associated with decreased cancer susceptibility. The study demonstrates that the expression-enhancing regulatory variants of MCL1 are protective modifiers of breast cancer risk, and reduced cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle progression partly mediated by p27 might be the underlying mechanism.","['Wang, Sheng', 'Jiang, Yan', 'Liu, Jin', 'Zhao, Yuanyuan', 'Xiang, Chan', 'Ma, Rong', 'Gao, Haidong', 'Jin, Li', 'He, Fuchu', 'Wang, Haijian']","['Wang S', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu J', 'Zhao Y', 'Xiang C', 'Ma R', 'Gao H', 'Jin L', 'He F', 'Wang H']","['State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, School of Life Sciences and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, 138 Yixueyuan Rd., 200433, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*physiology']",2014/05/24 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2108-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Aug;35(8):8289-99. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2108-5.

We aimed at characterizing the spectrum of pediatric cancers (0-14 years) diagnosed in Mozambique in two different calendar periods. Data were obtained from the Pathology Department of the Maputo Central Hospital (DP-HCM) (1999-2000 and 2009-2010), which receives virtually all samples for histopathological diagnosis in Maputo, with the exception of leukemia, and from the population-based Cancer Registry of Beira (2009-2010). In 1999-2000, the DP-HCM diagnosed 61 cancers. Burkitt lymphoma, malignant bone tumors, and rhabdomyosarcomas accounted for 24.6%, 11.5%, and 9.8% of all cases, respectively. In 2009-2010, the number of cancers increased to 150, reflecting a two- to threefold increase in the proportion of Kaposi sarcomas, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, nephroblastomas, and neuroblastomas. In 2009-2010, the Cancer Registry of Beira registered 34 cases, corresponding to an incidence rate of 9.7/100,000 inhabitants in this age group; Kaposi sarcomas, lymphomas, retinoblastomas, and nephroblastomas accounted for 29.4%, 23.5%, 8.8%, and 8.8% of all cases, respectively. These data show that pediatric cancers account for an appreciable burden in Mozambique, probably reflecting a high frequency of HIV-associated cancers and improved access to diagnosis, and highlight the potential for improving surveillance in this low resource setting.","['Carreira, Helena', 'Lorenzoni, Cesaltina', 'Carrilho, Carla', 'Ferro, Josefo', 'Sultane, Thebora', 'Garcia, Carlos', 'Amod, Faizana', 'Augusto, Orvalho', 'Silva-Matos, Carla', 'La Vecchia, Carlo', 'Lunet, Nuno']","['Carreira H', 'Lorenzoni C', 'Carrilho C', 'Ferro J', 'Sultane T', 'Garcia C', 'Amod F', 'Augusto O', 'Silva-Matos C', 'La Vecchia C', 'Lunet N']","['Institute of Public Health, University of Porto , Porto , Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mozambique/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Pediatrics/statistics & numerical data', 'Public Health Surveillance/methods', 'Registries', 'Statistics as Topic/methods']",2014/05/24 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2014.909547 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2014 Sep;31(6):498-508. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2014.909547.

Primate genomes encode seven A3 genes, and while A3F and 3G are widely recognized as important in the restriction of HIV, the role of the other genes, particularly A3A, is not as clear. Indeed, since human cells can express multiple A3 genes, and because of the lack of an experimentally tractable model, it is difficult to dissect the individual contribution of each gene to virus restriction in vivo. To overcome this problem, we generated human A3A and A3G transgenic mice on a mouse A3 knockout background. Using these mice, we demonstrate that both A3A and A3G restrict infection by murine retroviruses but by different mechanisms: A3G was packaged into virions and caused extensive deamination of the retrovirus genomes while A3A was not packaged and instead restricted infection when expressed in target cells. Additionally, we show that a murine leukemia virus engineered to express HIV Vif overcame the A3G-mediated restriction, thereby creating a novel model for studying the interaction between these proteins. We have thus developed an in vivo system for understanding how human A3 proteins use different modes of restriction, as well as a means for testing therapies that disrupt HIV Vif-A3G interactions.","['Stavrou, Spyridon', 'Crawford, Daniel', 'Blouch, Kristin', 'Browne, Edward P', 'Kohli, Rahul M', 'Ross, Susan R']","['Stavrou S', 'Crawford D', 'Blouch K', 'Browne EP', 'Kohli RM', 'Ross SR']","['Department of Microbiology, Institute for Immunology and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology, Institute for Immunology and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology, Institute for Immunology and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (vif protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3A protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*physiology', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/*virology', 'Viral Load/*genetics', 'Virus Assembly/genetics', 'Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication/genetics', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics']",2014/05/24 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2014/05/24 06:00'],"['2014/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004145 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-14-00283 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2014 May 22;10(5):e1004145. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004145. eCollection 2014 May.,"['R01 AI085015/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-AI100512/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA115299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA115299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 AI100512/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI-085015/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",20140522,,PMC4031197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting these leukemic stem cells within the bone marrow is critical for preventing relapse. We recently demonstrated that SDF-1, a chemokine abundant in the bone marrow, induces apoptosis in AML cell lines and in patient samples expressing high levels of its receptor, CXCR4. Here we show that a subset of osteoblast lineage cells within the bone marrow can protect AML cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to the SDF-1 naturally present in that location. In co-culture systems, osteoblasts at various stages of differentiation protected AML cell lines and patient isolates from SDF-1-induced apoptosis. The differentiation of the osteoblast cell lines, MC3T3 and W-20-17, mediated this protection via a cell contact-independent mechanism. In contrast, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, the precursors of osteoblasts, induced apoptosis in AML cells via a CXCR4-dependent mechanism and failed to protect AML cells from exogenously added SDF-1. These results indicate that osteoblasts in the process of differentiation potently inhibit the SDF-1-driven apoptotic pathway of CXCR4-expressing AML cells residing in the bone marrow. Drugs targeting this protective mechanism could potentially provide a new approach to treating AML by enhancing the SDF-1-induced apoptosis of AML cells residing within the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Kremer, Kimberly N', 'Dudakovic, Amel', 'McGee-Lawrence, Meghan E', 'Philips, Rachael L', 'Hess, Allan D', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Westendorf, Jennifer J', 'Hedin, Karen E']","['Kremer KN', 'Dudakovic A', 'McGee-Lawrence ME', 'Philips RL', 'Hess AD', 'Smith BD', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Karp JE', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Westendorf JJ', 'Hedin KE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'Osteocalcin/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24755 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2014 Jun;115(6):1128-37. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24755.,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA70095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA070095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4161028,,,,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NIHMS617264'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assesses predictive factors for very long-term testicular recovery after allogeneic HSCT in childhood and adolescence. PROCEDURE: Testicular volume, sperm production and long-term need of testosterone substitution were evaluated among 106 male survivors transplanted at Huddinge and Helsinki University Hospitals from 1978 through 2000, at a mean age of 8 +/- 4.6 years (range 1-17). A mean +/- SD of 13 +/- 4.8 years (range 4-28) had elapsed since their HSCT and the mean age of the participants was 22 +/- 6.0 years (range 12-42). An adult testicular volume was recorded in 74 patients at a mean age of 19 +/- 3.3 years (range 14-36). RESULTS: Recipients conditioned with busulfan-based regimens or regimens containing only cyclophosphamide had significantly larger adult testicular volumes (mean volume 18 ml and 16 ml vs. 9 ml, P < 0.00001, respectively) and lower serum levels of FSH (mean 9 IU and 5 IU vs. 19 IU, P < 0.01 and 0.001, respectively) compared to those conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a non-leukemia diagnosis (P < 0.01) and adult testicular volume >/= 15 ml (P < 0.03) positively impacted spermatogenetic recovery. CONCLUSIONS: A larger adult testicular volume, normal serum levels of FSH and spermatozoa detected in a majority of seminal fluids after busulfan-based or cyclophosphamide conditionings suggest very long-term recovery of spermatogenesis after chemotherapy-based regimens. A simple measurement of adult testicular volume may help predict spermatogenetic potential among pediatric HSCT survivors.","['Wilhelmsson, Mari', 'Vatanen, Anu', 'Borgstrom, Birgit', 'Gustafsson, Britt', 'Taskinen, Mervi', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M', 'Winiarski, Jacek', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi']","['Wilhelmsson M', 'Vatanen A', 'Borgstrom B', 'Gustafsson B', 'Taskinen M', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Winiarski J', 'Jahnukainen K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infertility, Male/blood/*etiology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Organ Size', 'Postoperative Complications/blood/etiology/pathology', 'Puberty', 'Radiation Injuries/blood/etiology/pathology', 'Semen Analysis', '*Spermatogenesis', '*Survivors', 'Testis/drug effects/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Testosterone/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24970 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jun;61(6):1094-100. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24970.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This nanoscale formulation of C61 exhibited a uniquely favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profile in mice, induced apoptosis in radiation-resistant primary leukemic cells taken directly from BPL patients as well as in vivo clonogenic BPL xenograft cells, destroyed the leukemic stem cell fraction of BPL blasts, and exhibited potent in vivo anti-leukemic activity in xenograft models of aggressive BPL.

The differential diagnosis is large and includes both primary pituitary abscesses and cystic components on pre-existing lesions, such as adenoma, craniopharyngioma, Rathke's cleft cyst, leukemia, granulomatous disease and lymphocytic hypophysitis. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, treatment can be challenging. We report a case of a 15-year-old female, who presented with headaches, altered consciousness and diplopia after a molar extraction, for which she had received oral antibiotics. Broad-spectrum i.v. antibiotics were given for presumed meningitis. Blood cultures failed to identify pathogens. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed a pituitary cystic lesion. Endocrine studies revealed abnormal pituitary function. In the absence of a therapeutic response, the patient underwent a transsphenoidal biopsy of the pituitary gland, which yielded a purulent liquid, but cultures were negative. Histopathology showed lymphocytic infiltrates but no neutrophils, compatible with an inflammation of autoimmune or infectious origin. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy was started and pursued, along with i.v. antibiotics, for 6 weeks, leading to clinical and radiological improvement but with persistence of endocrine deficits. In conclusion, this is a case of secondary panhypopituitarism due to a cystic pituitary lesion, with a differential diagnosis of lymphocytic hypophysitis vs abscess in a context of decapitated meningitis. Combination therapy with antibiotics and glucocorticoids is a legitimate approach in the face of diagnostic uncertainty, given the morbidity, and even mortality, associated with these lesions. LEARNING POINTS: It is not always easy to differentiate primary cystic sellar lesions (such as a primary infectious pituitary abscess) from cystic components on pre-existing lesions (such as adenoma, craniopharyngioma, Rathke's cleft cyst, leukemia or lymphocytic hypophysitis).Because of the absence of specific symptoms and of immunohistochemical and serum markers, response to glucocorticoids can be the only way to differentiate lymphocytic hypophysitis from pituitary lesions of another origin. In addition, microbiological cultures are negative in 50% of cases of primary infectious sellar abscesses, thus the response to antibiotic treatment is often the key element to this diagnosis.A short course of high-dose glucocorticoids combined with antibiotics is not harmful in cases where there is no diagnostic certainty as to the origin of a cystic sellar mass, given the morbidity and mortality associated with these lesions.This approach may also diminish inflammation of either infectious or autoimmune origin while ensuring that the most likely pathogens are being targeted.","['Manousaki, Despoina', 'Deal, Cheri', 'De Bruycker, Jean Jacques', 'Ovetchkine, Philippe', 'Mercier, Claude', 'Alos, Nathalie']","['Manousaki D', 'Deal C', 'De Bruycker JJ', 'Ovetchkine P', 'Mercier C', 'Alos N']","['Department of Pediatrics, Endocrine Service, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte Justine and Universite de Montreal Montreal, Quebec Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Endocrine Service, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte Justine and Universite de Montreal Montreal, Quebec Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Immunology Service, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte Justine and Universite de Montreal Montreal, Quebec Canada.', 'Infectious Disease Division, Department of Pediatrics, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte Justine and Universite de Montreal Montreal, Quebec Canada.', 'Surgery Department and Chief of Neurosurgery Service, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte Justine and Universite de Montreal Montreal, Quebec Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Endocrine Service, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte Justine and Universite de Montreal Montreal, Quebec Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep,"Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism case reports",101618943,,,,2014/05/23 06:00,2014/05/23 06:01,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1530/EDM-14-0010 [doi]', 'EDM140010 [pii]']",ppublish,Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep. 2014;2014:140010. doi: 10.1530/EDM-14-0010.

AML occurs at all ages but the incidence increases with age with the median age at diagnosis being 67 years. Advances in the treatment of AML over the past decades have led to improved survival, albeit mostly in younger patients. The prognosis of older patients with this disease over the same time span has not changed much and remains dismal. This review focuses on the epidemiology and characteristics of AML in elderly patients, the rationale for treating elderly AML patients, and the currently available and potential future treatment options such as sapacitabine. Elderly AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy have a higher mortality rate, and a lower rate of complete remission and overall survival when compared to the younger population. This is due to both the different biology of the disease and the number of patient-specific factors. However, elderly AML patients treated with aggressive chemotherapy can achieve durable remissions, which offer prolonged survival and improved quality of life. Recent data also indicates that elderly AML patients deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy benefit from leukemia-specific attenuated dose chemotherapy compared to supportive care alone. This has led to renewed interest to look for anti-leukemic therapies designed specifically for older patients. Sapacitabine, a novel oral nucleoside analog, promises good efficacy, favorable toxicity profile, and ease of administration; all of which makes it very appealing. Results from pre-clinical and clinical studies have been very encouraging and sapacitabine is currently being evaluated in a Phase III study, of which the results are eagerly awaited.","['Lim, Ming Y', 'Jamieson, Katarzyna']","['Lim MY', 'Jamieson K']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Clin Interv Aging,Clinical interventions in aging,101273480,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'W335P73C3L (sapacitabine)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/CIA.S39558 [doi]', 'cia-9-753 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Interv Aging. 2014 May 6;9:753-62. doi: 10.2147/CIA.S39558. eCollection 2014.,,20140506,,PMC4018315,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'elderly', 'management', 'sapacitabine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whole-genome sequencing was performed in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from eight cases of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), the high-risk subtype of MDS. The nucleotide substitution patterns were found similar to those reported in AML, and mutations of 96 protein-coding genes were identified. Clonal architecture analysis revealed the presence of subclones in six of eight cases, whereas mutation detection of CD34(+) versus CD34(-) cells revealed heterogeneity of HSPC expansion status. With 39 marker genes belonging to eight functional categories, mutations were analyzed in 196 MDS cases including mostly RAEB (n = 89) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) (n = 95). At least one gene mutation was detected in 91.0% of RAEB, contrary to that in RCMD (55.8%), suggesting a higher mutational burden in the former group. Gene abnormality patterns differed between MDS and AML, with mutations of activated signaling molecules and NPM1 being rare, whereas those of spliceosome more common, in MDS. Finally, gene mutation profiles also bore prognostic value in terms of overall survival and progression free survival.","['Xu, Lan', 'Gu, Zhao-Hui', 'Li, Yang', 'Zhang, Jin-Li', 'Chang, Chun-Kang', 'Pan, Chun-Ming', 'Shi, Jing-Yi', 'Shen, Yang', 'Chen, Bing', 'Wang, Yue-Ying', 'Jiang, Lu', 'Lu, Jing', 'Xu, Xin', 'Tan, Jue-Ling', 'Chen, Yu', 'Wang, Sheng-Yue', 'Li, Xiao', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan']","['Xu L', 'Gu ZH', 'Li Y', 'Zhang JL', 'Chang CK', 'Pan CM', 'Shi JY', 'Shen Y', 'Chen B', 'Wang YY', 'Jiang L', 'Lu J', 'Xu X', 'Tan JL', 'Chen Y', 'Wang SY', 'Li X', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine of Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200025, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine of Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200025, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine of Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200025, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine of Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200025, China;', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai No. 6 People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200233, China;

However, the intrinsic epigenetic factors that regulate spermatogonial stem cell quiescence are largely unknown. Here, we investigate in mice how DNA methyltransferase 3-like (DNMT3L), an epigenetic regulator important for interpreting chromatin context and facilitating de novo DNA methylation, sustains the long-term male germ cell pool. We demonstrated that stem cell-enriched THY1(+) spermatogonial stem/progenitor cells (SPCs) constituted a DNMT3L-expressing population in postnatal testes. DNMT3L influenced the stability of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), potentially by downregulating Cdk2/CDK2 expression, which sequestered CDK2-mediated PLZF degradation. Reduced PLZF in Dnmt3l KO THY1(+) cells released its antagonist, Sal-like protein 4A (SALL4A), which is associated with overactivated ERK and AKT signaling cascades. Furthermore, DNMT3L was required to suppress the cell proliferation-promoting factor SALL4B in THY1(+) SPCs and to prevent premature stem cell exhaustion. Our results indicate that DNMT3L is required to delicately balance the cycling and quiescence of SPCs. These findings reveal a novel role for DNMT3L in modulating postnatal SPC cell fate decisions.","['Liao, Hung-Fu', 'Chen, Wendy S C', 'Chen, Yu-Hsiang', 'Kao, Tzu-Hao', 'Tseng, Yen-Tzu', 'Lee, Chien-Yueh', 'Chiu, Yu-Chiao', 'Lee, Pei-Lung', 'Lin, Qian-Jia', 'Ching, Yung-Hao', 'Hata, Kenichiro', 'Cheng, Winston T K', 'Tsai, Mong-Hsun', 'Sasaki, Hiroyuki', 'Ho, Hong-Nerng', 'Wu, Shinn-Chih', 'Huang, Yen-Hua', 'Yen, Pauline', 'Lin, Shau-Ping']","['Liao HF', 'Chen WS', 'Chen YH', 'Kao TH', 'Tseng YT', 'Lee CY', 'Chiu YC', 'Lee PL', 'Lin QJ', 'Ching YH', 'Hata K', 'Cheng WT', 'Tsai MH', 'Sasaki H', 'Ho HN', 'Wu SC', 'Huang YH', 'Yen P', 'Lin SP']","['Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan Department of Animal Science and Technology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan Center for Reproductive Medicine, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan.', 'Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Okura, Setagaya, Tokyo 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology, Tunghai University, Taichung 40704, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine and the Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.', 'Department of Animal Science and Technology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan Center for Reproductive Medicine, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan Center for Systems Biology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan Research Center for Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan shaupinglin@ntu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Sall4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Dnmt3l protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Heterozygote', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/*metabolism', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.105130 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.105130 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2014 Jun;141(12):2402-13. doi: 10.1242/dev.105130.

We previously reported ESK1, a high avidity (Kd < 0.2 nmol/L), fully-human monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the WT1 RMF peptide/HLA-A*02:01 complex, which selectively bound and killed WT1(+) and HLA-A*02:01(+) leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We engineered a second-generation mAb, ESKM, to have enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) function due to altered Fc glycosylation. ESKM was compared with native ESK1 in binding assays, in vitro ADCC assays, and mesothelioma and leukemia therapeutic models and pharmacokinetic studies in mice. ESKM toxicity was assessed in HLA-A*02:01(+) transgenic mice. RESULTS: ESK antibodies mediated ADCC against hematopoietic and solid tumor cells at concentrations below 1 mug/mL, but ESKM was about 5- to 10-fold more potent in vitro against multiple cancer cell lines. ESKM was more potent in vivo against JMN mesothelioma, and effective against SET2 AML and fresh ALL xenografts. ESKM had a shortened half-life (4.9 days vs. 6.5 days), but an identical biodistribution pattern in C57BL/6J mice. At therapeutic doses of ESKM, there was no difference in half-life or biodistribution in HLA-A*02:01(+) transgenic mice compared with the parent strain. Importantly, therapeutic doses of ESKM in these mice caused no depletion of total WBCs or hematopoetic stem cells, or pathologic tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS: The data provide proof of concept that an Fc-enhanced mAb can improve efficacy against a low-density, tumor-specific, peptide/MHC target, and support further development of this mAb against an important intracellular oncogenic protein.","['Veomett, Nicholas', 'Dao, Tao', 'Liu, Hong', 'Xiang, Jingyi', 'Pankov, Dmitry', 'Dubrovsky, Leonid', 'Whitten, Joseph A', 'Park, Sun-Mi', 'Korontsvit, Tatyana', 'Zakhaleva, Victoria', 'Casey, Emily', 'Curcio, Michael', 'Kharas, Michael G', ""O'Reilly, Richard J"", 'Liu, Cheng', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['Veomett N', 'Dao T', 'Liu H', 'Xiang J', 'Pankov D', 'Dubrovsky L', 'Whitten JA', 'Park SM', 'Korontsvit T', 'Zakhaleva V', 'Casey E', 'Curcio M', 'Kharas MG', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Liu C', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Sloan Kettering Institute; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York;', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Eureka Therapeutics Inc., Emeryville, California; and.', 'Eureka Therapeutics Inc., Emeryville, California; and.', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Sloan Kettering Institute;', 'Eureka Therapeutics Inc., Emeryville, California; and.', 'Sloan Kettering Institute; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York; d-scheinberg@ski.mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-2756 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2756 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Aug 1;20(15):4036-46. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2756.

MDSCs have been predominantly studied in malignant diseases and findings suggest involvement in tumor-associated immune suppression. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the leukemia with the highest incidence among adults. Immune defects occur already at early disease stages and impact the clinical course. We assessed presence, frequency, association to other immune parameters, and functional properties of circulating CD14(+) cells lacking HLA-DR expression (HLA-DR(lo)) in patients with untreated CLL. These monocytic cells represent one of the best-defined human MDSC subsets. Frequency of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo) cells was significantly increased in CLL patients. Furthermore, MDSCs suppressed in vitro T-cell activation and induced suppressive regulatory T cells (TRegs). The MDSC-mediated modulation of T cells could be attributed to their increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity. CLL cells induced IDO(hi) MDSCs from healthy donor monocytes suggesting bidirectional crosstalk between CLL-cells, MDSCs, and TRegs. Overall, we identified a MDSC population that expands in CLL. The exact mechanisms responsible for such accumulation remain to be elucidated and it will be of interest to test whether antagonizing suppressive functions of CLL MDSCs could represent a mean for enhancing immune responses.","['Jitschin, Regina', 'Braun, Martina', 'Buttner, Maike', 'Dettmer-Wilde, Katja', 'Bricks, Juliane', 'Berger, Jana', 'Eckart, Michael J', 'Krause, Stefan W', 'Oefner, Peter J', 'Le Blanc, Katarina', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios']","['Jitschin R', 'Braun M', 'Buttner M', 'Dettmer-Wilde K', 'Bricks J', 'Berger J', 'Eckart MJ', 'Krause SW', 'Oefner PJ', 'Le Blanc K', 'Mackensen A', 'Mougiakakos D']","['Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Institute of Pathology, Department of Nephropathology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany;', 'Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Onkologische Schwerpunktpraxis, Erlangen, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany;', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology Centre, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, and.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (IDO1 protein, human)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/pathology']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39909-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-12-546416 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 31;124(5):750-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-12-546416.

Recent findings suggest that ECD is a clonal disorder, marked by recurrent BRAFV600E mutations in >50% of patients, in which chronic uncontrolled inflammation is an important mediator of disease pathogenesis. Although approximately 500 to 550 cases have been described in the literature to date, increased physician awareness has driven a dramatic increase in ECD diagnoses over the last decade. ECD frequently involves multiple organ systems and has historically lacked effective therapies. Given the protean clinical manifestations and the lack of a consensus-derived approach for the management of ECD, we provide here the first multidisciplinary consensus guidelines for the clinical management of ECD. These recommendations were outlined at the First International Medical Symposium for ECD, comprised of a comprehensive group of international academicians with expertise in the pathophysiology and therapy of ECD. Detailed recommendations on the initial clinical, laboratory, and radiographic assessment of ECD patients are presented in addition to treatment recommendations based on critical appraisal of the literature and clinical experience. These formalized consensus descriptions will hopefully facilitate ongoing and future research efforts in this disorder.","['Diamond, Eli L', 'Dagna, Lorenzo', 'Hyman, David M', 'Cavalli, Giulio', 'Janku, Filip', 'Estrada-Veras, Juvianee', 'Ferrarini, Marina', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Heaney, Mark L', 'Scheel, Paul J', 'Feeley, Nancy K', 'Ferrero, Elisabetta', 'McClain, Kenneth L', 'Vaglio, Augusto', 'Colby, Thomas', 'Arnaud, Laurent', 'Haroche, Julien']","['Diamond EL', 'Dagna L', 'Hyman DM', 'Cavalli G', 'Janku F', 'Estrada-Veras J', 'Ferrarini M', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Heaney ML', 'Scheel PJ', 'Feeley NK', 'Ferrero E', 'McClain KL', 'Vaglio A', 'Colby T', 'Arnaud L', 'Haroche J']","['Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Unit of Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy;', 'Developmental Therapeutics Unit, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Unit of Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy;', 'Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics (Phase I Clinical Trials Program), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Medical Genetics Branch, Office of the Clinical Director, National Human Genome Research Institute, and Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy;', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY;', 'Division of Nephrology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Division of Nephrology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy;', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX;"", 'University Hospital of Parma, Parma, Italy;', 'Mayo Clinic-Arizona, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Scottsdale, AZ; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, French Reference Center for Auto-Immune Diseases, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, French Reference Center for Auto-Immune Diseases, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['*Consensus', 'Erdheim-Chester Disease/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Humans']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39929-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-03-561381 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 24;124(4):483-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-561381.

Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, which occurs commonly in acute myelogenous leukemia, enhances rRNA synthesis through TIF-IA stabilization and phosphorylation. We have discovered that TIF-IA coexists with a splicing isoform, TIF-90, which is expressed preferentially in the nucleolus and at higher levels in proliferating and transformed hematopoietic cells. TIF-90 interacts directly with Pol I to increase rRNA synthesis as a consequence of Akt activation. Furthermore, TIF-90 binds preferentially to a 90-kDa cleavage product of the actin binding protein filamin A (FLNA) that inhibits rRNA synthesis. Increased expression of TIF-90 overcomes the inhibitory effect of this cleavage product and stimulates rRNA synthesis. Because activated Akt also reduces FLNA cleavage, these results indicate that activated Akt and TIF-90 function in parallel to increase rRNA synthesis and, as a consequence, cell proliferation in leukemic cells. These results provide evidence that the direct targeting of Akt would be an effective therapy in acute leukemias in which Akt is activated.","['Nguyen, Le Xuan Truong', 'Chan, Steven M', 'Ngo, Tri Duc', 'Raval, Aparna', 'Kim, Kyeong Kyu', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Mitchell, Beverly S']","['Nguyen le XT', 'Chan SM', 'Ngo TD', 'Raval A', 'Kim KK', 'Majeti R', 'Mitchell BS']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute, and Department of Medicine, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; and.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute, and Department of Medicine, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Institute, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (FLNA protein, human)', '0 (Filamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (TIAF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Filamins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39939-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-12-544726 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 24;124(4):579-89. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-12-544726.

The mutation frequencies for the purified enzyme in vitro vary widely but are typically in the 10(-4) range (per nucleotide addition), making the enzyme severalfold less accurate than most polymerases, including other RTs. This has often been cited as a factor in HIV's accelerated generation of genetic diversity. However, cellular experiments suggest that HIV does not have significantly lower fidelity than other retroviruses and shows a mutation frequency in the 10(-5) range. In this report, we reconcile, at least in part, these discrepancies by showing that HIV RT fidelity in vitro is in the same range as cellular results from experiments conducted with physiological (for lymphocytes) concentrations of free Mg(2+) (~0.25 mM) and is comparable to Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) RT fidelity. The physiological conditions produced mutation rates that were 5 to 10 times lower than those obtained under typically employed in vitro conditions optimized for RT activity (5 to 10 mM Mg(2+)). These results were consistent in both commonly used lacZalpha complementation and steady-state fidelity assays. Interestingly, although HIV RT showed severalfold-lower fidelity under high-Mg(2+) (6 mM) conditions, MuLV RT fidelity was insensitive to Mg(2+). Overall, the results indicate that the fidelity of HIV replication in cells is compatible with findings of experiments carried out in vitro with purified HIV RT, providing more physiological conditions are used. IMPORTANCE: Human immunodeficiency virus rapidly evolves through the generation and subsequent selection of mutants that can circumvent the immune response and escape drug therapy. This process is fueled, in part, by the presumably highly error-prone HIV polymerase reverse transcriptase (RT). Paradoxically, results of studies examining HIV replication in cells indicate an error frequency that is ~10 times lower than the rate for RT in the test tube, which invokes the possibility of factors that make RT more accurate in cells. This study brings the cellular and test tube results in closer agreement by showing that HIV RT is not more error prone than other RTs and, when assayed under physiological magnesium conditions, has a much lower error rate than in typical assays conducted using conditions optimized for enzyme activity.","['Achuthan, Vasudevan', 'Keith, Brian J', 'Connolly, Bernard A', 'DeStefano, Jeffrey J']","['Achuthan V', 'Keith BJ', 'Connolly BA', 'DeStefano JJ']","['Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA.', 'Institute of Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA jdestefa@umd.edu.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Coenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Cations, Divalent/*metabolism', 'Coenzymes/*metabolism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*enzymology', 'Magnesium/*metabolism', '*Reverse Transcription']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/10/02 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00752-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00752-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Aug;88(15):8514-27. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00752-14.

Some adhesion molecules have been reported to play an important role in cell differentiation. CD44 is an important adhesion molecule that mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction, and participates in a wide variety of cellular functions. As CD44 has been reported to show different activated states between monocytes and macrophages, we propose that CD44 may be involved in monocyte differentiation. In this study, we explored the role of CD44 in monocyte differentiation and further studied the mechanisms that were involved in. THP-1 cells (human monocytic leukemia cell line) were induced with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to establish the model of monocyte differentiation in vitro. It was found that CD44 expression and binding capacity to hyaluronic acid were increased significantly, and the distribution of CD44 was converted into clusters during differentiation. The PMA-induced CD44 clustering and CD44 high expression were suppressed by blocking CD44, which resulted in the inhibition of CD14 expression. PMA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 signal was also suppressed by blocking CD44. Our results suggested that CD44 was involved in monocyte differentiation.

Very few cases of BPDCN have been described with lack of skin manifestations at the time of diagnosis. Here we report two rare non-cutaneous presentations of BPDCN without obvious skin lesions at our institution and also the literature review. Our first patient had a unique presentation of BPDCN confined to the sinonasal region with central nervous system involvement. The second patient we report is also atypical with regard to widespread disease that uncharacteristically spared the skin and bone marrow. BPDCN is a rare hematological malignancy involving immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells. It poses a diagnostic challenge requiring multidisciplinary approach to manage this disease. It is important to identify effective therapies for both cutaneous and non-cutaneous presentations of BPDCN, since most cases are uniformly fatal with conventional chemotherapy alone. High-dose induction therapy based on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regimens, to achieve complete remission followed by allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from related or unrelated donors is recommended to improve long-term survival in these patients.

In vitro cultures of human THP-1 cells (a human monocytic leukemia cell line) were differentiated into macrophage-like cells treated by PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and be exposed crotonaldehyde. Using RNA-seq technology such as digital gene expression, the global changes in transcriptional level were analyzed. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to validate RNA-seq data. The differential regulated genes in many biological processes were dysregulated, including in antigen processing and presentation, oxidative stress, in fl ammation, cytokine signaling, and apoptosis. Collectively, our study demonstrated that crotonaldehyde altered gene expression pro fi le in the genome-wide transcriptional level in human macrophage-like cells, and many of them may represent potential mechanisms of crotonaldehyde causing cytotoxicity and tissue injury in the human lung.","['Yang, Bi-Cheng', 'Yang, Zhi-Hua', 'Pan, Xiu-Jie', 'Wang, Li-Meng', 'Liu, Xing-Yu', 'Zhu, Mao-Xiang', 'Xie, Jian-Ping']","['Yang BC', 'Yang ZH', 'Pan XJ', 'Wang LM', 'Liu XY', 'Zhu MX', 'Xie JP']","['Department of Radiation Toxicology and Oncology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Toxicol Sci,The Journal of toxicological sciences,7805798,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Aldehydes)', '9G72074TUW (2-butenal)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants', 'Aldehydes/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*drug effects', 'Smoking', 'Transcriptome/*drug effects/*genetics']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jts/39.487 [pii]', '10.2131/jts.39.487 [doi]']",ppublish,J Toxicol Sci. 2014 Jun;39(3):487-97. doi: 10.2131/jts.39.487.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxta-membrane region constitute the majority of activating FLT3 mutations. Several FLT3 kinase inhibitors were developed and tested in the clinic with significant success. However, recent studies have reported the development of secondary drug resistance in patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors. Since FLT3-ITD is an HSP90 client kinase, we here explored if targeting the stability of drug-resistant FLT3 mutant protein could be a potential therapeutic option. We observed that HSP90 inhibitor treatment resulted in the degradation of inhibitor-resistant FLT3-ITD mutants and selectively induced toxicity in cells expressing FLT3-ITD mutants. Thus, HSP90 inhibitors provide a potential therapeutic choice to overcome secondary drug resistance following TKI treatment in FLT3-ITD positive AML.","['Yu, Chuanjiang', 'Kancha, Rama Krishna', 'Duyster, Justus']","['Yu C', 'Kancha RK', 'Duyster J']","['Department Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine I, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteolysis', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/06/02 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0097116 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-06491 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 21;9(5):e97116. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0097116. eCollection 2014.,,20140521,,PMC4029991,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During spermiogenesis, round spermatid undergoes dramatic morphogenesis to give rise to mature spermatozoon, including the condensation and elongation of nucleus, development of acrosome, formation of flagellum, and removal of excessive cytoplasm. Although these transformations are well defined at the morphological level, the mechanisms underlying these intricate processes are largely unknown. Here, we report that Iqcg, which was previously characterized to be involved in a chromosome translocation of human leukemia, is highly expressed in the spermatogenesis of mice and localized to the manchette in developing spermatids. Iqcg knockout causes male infertility, due to severe defects of spermiogenesis and resultant total immobility of spermatozoa. The axoneme in the Iqcg knockout sperm flagellum is disorganized and hardly any typical (""9+2"") pattern of microtubule arrangement could be found in Iqcg knockout spermatids. Iqcg interacts with calmodulin in a calcium dependent manner in the testis, suggesting that Iqcg may play a role through calcium signaling. Furthermore, cilia structures in the trachea and oviduct, as well as histological appearances of other major tissues, remain unchanged in the Iqcg knockout mice, suggesting that Iqcg is specifically required for spermiogenesis in mammals.

Recent genomic studies have lead to the identification of 'Philadelphia like' or 'BCR-ABL1 like' ALLs lacking BCR-ABL1 fusion. RECENT FINDINGS: About 10% of childhood ALL and a higher percentage of adolescents and adults with ALLs are characterized by activation of cytokine receptors and signaling kinases. Aberrant expression, point mutations or fusion translocations cause activation of either the ABL1 or JAK signaling pathways. In general, these leukemias are associated with worse prognosis. Preclinical studies and limited clinical experience suggest that these leukemias respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, their identification is important. However, as most of these fusion translocations are rare, their diagnosis is challenging. SUMMARY: The diagnosis of 'Philadelphia like' poor prognosis ALLs is technically challenging but of paramount importance as they are likely to respond to targeted therapy with currently available ABL or JAK inhibitors.","['Izraeli, Shai']",['Izraeli S'],"['aChildhood Leukemia Research Center, Department of Pediatric Hematology Onclology, Edmond and Lily Safra Children Hospital bSheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan cDepartment of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000050 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2014 Jul;21(4):289-96. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review details gene therapy trials for X-linked and adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). X-linked SCID was chosen for gene therapy because of previous 'natural' genetic correction through a reversion event in a single lymphoid precursor, demonstrating limited thymopoiesis and restricted T-lymphocyte receptor repertoire, showing selective advantage of progenitors possessing the wild-type gene. In early studies, patients were treated with long terminal repeats-intact gamma-retroviral vectors, without additional chemotherapy. Early results demonstrated gene-transduced cells, sustained thymopoiesis, and a diverse T-lymphocyte repertoire with normal function. Serious adverse effects were subsequently reported in 5 of 20 patients, with T-lymphocyte leukaemia developing, secondary to the viral vector integrating adjacent to a known oncogene. New trials using self-inactivating gamma-retroviral vectors are progressing. Trials for ADA-SCID using gamma-retroviral vectors have been successful, with no similar serious adverse effects reported; trials using lentiviral vectors are in progress. Patients with WAS and CGD treated with early gamma-retroviral vectors have developed similar lymphoproliferative adverse effects to those seen in X-SCID--current trials are using new-generation vectors. Targeted gene insertion using homologous recombination of corrected gene sequences by cellular DNA repair pathways following targeted DNA breakage will improve efficacy and safety of gene therapy. A number of new techniques are discussed.","['Qasim, Waseem', 'Gennery, Andrew R']","['Qasim W', 'Gennery AR']","['Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,,IM,"['Genetic Therapy/*methods/*trends', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40265-014-0223-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 2014 Jun;74(9):963-9. doi: 10.1007/s40265-014-0223-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic nucleoside analogues are important chemotherapeutic agents, which are used in many cancers, including leukemias. In this study, we investigated the effects of the synthetic nucleoside analogue 1-(5,5,5-trichloro-2-methoxy-4-oxopenten-2-yl)-4-trichloromethyl-pyrimidin-2(1H)- one, named compound 3 or C3, on leukemia cell lines. The compound stimulated cell death by apoptosis, evidenced by DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, and caspase-3 activation. Compound 3 seemed to trigger several cell death pathways. The mitochondrial pathway was evidenced through a disturbance of mitochondrial membrane potential, strong cytochrome c liberation, decrease of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression, and caspase-9 activation. The C3 also induced caspase-8 and -12 activation, an increase in the intracellular calcium level, and an overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Increased caspase 8 activity suggests that the extrinsic pathway was activated and that the ROS production and enzyme activity alteration (glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione reductase) might be related to oxidative stress. Finally, the increase in calcium release, CHOP expression, and caspase-12 activity might characterize endoplasmic reticulum stress. Compound 3 was likewise cytotoxic to leukemic and melanoma human cell lines. Taken together, the results contribute to further understanding the new pyrimidine analogue as a potential chemotherapeutic drug or lead molecule.","['Winter, Evelyn', 'Dal Pizzol, Carine', 'Filippin-Monteiro, Fabiola B', 'Brondani, Patricia', 'Silva, Andreia M P W', 'Silva, Adny H', 'Bonacorso, Helio G', 'Martins, Marcos A P', 'Zanatta, Nilo', 'Creczynski-Pasa, Tania B']","['Winter E', 'Dal Pizzol C', 'Filippin-Monteiro FB', 'Brondani P', 'Silva AM', 'Silva AH', 'Bonacorso HG', 'Martins MA', 'Zanatta N', 'Creczynski-Pasa TB']","['Departamento de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Programa de Pos-graduacao em Farmacia, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina , 88040-900 Florianopolis SC, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0', '(1-(5,5,5-trichloro-2-methoxy-4-oxopenten-2-yl)-4-trichloromethylpyrimidin-2(1H)-', 'one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Pyrimidinones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/tx500094x [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2014 Jun 16;27(6):1040-9. doi: 10.1021/tx500094x.

METHODS: In the Danish Cancer Registry, we identified 43153 1-year survivors of cancer diagnosed at ages 15 to 39 years (1943-2009) and alive in 1977; from the Danish Civil Registration System, we randomly selected a comparison cohort of the same age and sex. Subjects were linked to the Danish Patient Register, and observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes I10-I79) were compared with the expected numbers derived from the comparison cohort. We calculated the absolute excess risks attributable to status as a survivor of cancer and standardized hospitalization rate ratios (RRs). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: During follow-up, 10591 survivors (24.5%) were discharged from the hospital with cardiovascular disease, whereas 8124 were expected (RR = 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI)] = 1.28 to 1.33; P < .001). The absolute excess risks were 400 and 350 extra cases of cardiovascular disease per 100000 person-years for people aged 20 to 59 and 60 to 79 years at discharge, respectively. Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma experienced high risks for being hospitalized with valvular disease (RR = 12.2; 95% CI = 9.9 to 15.0; P < .001). Survivors of leukemia had high risks for cerebral hemorrhage (RR = 10.3; 95% CI = 5.5 to 19.1; P < .001) and cardiomyopathy (RR = 8.6; 95% CI = 4.3 to 17.3; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of adolescent and young adult cancer are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease throughout life, although each main type of adolescent and young adult cancer had its own risk profile.","['Rugbjerg, Kathrine', 'Mellemkjaer, Lene', 'Boice, John D', 'Kober, Lars', 'Ewertz, Marianne', 'Olsen, Jorgen H']","['Rugbjerg K', 'Mellemkjaer L', 'Boice JD', 'Kober L', 'Ewertz M', 'Olsen JH']","['Affiliations of authors: Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark (KR, LM, JHO); Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN (JDB); National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD (JDB); Department of Cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark (LK); Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Institute of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark (ME). rugbjerg@cancer.dk.', 'Affiliations of authors: Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark (KR, LM, JHO); Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN (JDB); National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD (JDB); Department of Cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark (LK); Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Institute of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark (ME).', 'Affiliations of authors: Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark (KR, LM, JHO); Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN (JDB); National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD (JDB); Department of Cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark (LK); Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Institute of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark (ME).', 'Affiliations of authors: Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark (KR, LM, JHO); Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN (JDB); National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD (JDB); Department of Cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark (LK); Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Institute of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark (ME).', 'Affiliations of authors: Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark (KR, LM, JHO); Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN (JDB); National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD (JDB); Department of Cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark (LK); Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Institute of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark (ME).', 'Affiliations of authors: Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark (KR, LM, JHO); Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN (JDB); National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, Bethesda, MD (JDB); Department of Cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark (LK); Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Institute of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark (ME).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Heart Valve Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/radiotherapy', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/07/08 06:00,['2014/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['dju110 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/dju110 [doi]']",epublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2014 May 21;106(6):dju110. doi: 10.1093/jnci/dju110.

Much of the initial improvement in outcomes for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was due to identification of cytotoxic agents that are active against leukemia followed by the recognition that combination of these cytotoxic agents and prolonged therapy are essential for cure. Recent data demonstrating lack of progress in patients for whom standard chemotherapy fails suggests that the ability to improve outcome for these children will not be dramatically impacted through more intensive or newer cytotoxic agents. Thus, much of the recent research focus has been in the area of improving our understanding of the genetics and the biology of leukemia. Although in vitro studies remain critical, given the complexity of a living system and the increasing recognition of the contribution of leukemia extrinsic factors such as the bone marrow microenvironment, in vivo models have provided important insights. The murine systems that are used can be broadly categorized into syngeneic models in which a murine leukemia can be studied in immunologically intact hosts and xenograft models where human leukemias are studied in highly immunocompromised murine hosts. Both of these systems have limitations such that neither can be used exclusively to study all aspects of leukemia biology and therapeutics for humans. This review will describe the various ALL model systems that have been developed as well as discuss the advantages and disadvantages inherent to these systems that make each particularly suitable for specific types of studies.","['Jacoby, Elad', 'Chien, Christopher D', 'Fry, Terry J']","['Jacoby E', 'Chien CD', 'Fry TJ']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda, MD , USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda, MD , USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda, MD , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2014/05/23 06:00,2014/05/23 06:01,['2014/05/22 06:00'],"['2014/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00095 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 May 7;4:95. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00095. eCollection 2014.,,20140507,,PMC4019869,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adoptive', 'immunotherapy', 'murine model', 'syngeneic', 'xenografts']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We report two cases of VRE CNS infection and review 36 cases reported in the literature. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent (31/38) of cases were due to Enterococcus faecium. The median length of stay prior to diagnosis was 14 days (interquartile range 9-33). Fifty-eight percent (22/38) of cases had significant underlying non-malignant CNS disease processes and 63% (24/38) had CNS devices in situ. Forty percent (15/38) of patients had other positive culture sites. Ninety-two percent (35/38) of patients experienced microbiological cure and 74% (28/38) experienced clinical and microbiological cure following a variety of antimicrobial therapies. Seventy-four percent (14/19) of patients who experienced clinical/microbiological cure with CNS devices had them either removed or replaced. Eighteen percent (7/38) died from VRE CNS infections. CONCLUSIONS: VRE CNS infections are uncommon nosocomial infections that most commonly affect patients with underlying CNS disease processes. The vast majority of cases are due to E. faecium, and many cases involve multiple positive culture sites. Optimal antimicrobial therapy remains undefined, but should be coupled with removal or replacement of indwelling CNS devices.","['Wang, Jeffrey S', 'Muzevich, Katie', 'Edmond, Michael B', 'Bearman, Gonzalo', 'Stevens, Michael P']","['Wang JS', 'Muzevich K', 'Edmond MB', 'Bearman G', 'Stevens MP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, Box 980509, Richmond, VA 23298-0019, USA.

We previously found that CD123 was also highly expressed on CD34(+)CD38(-) cells in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, but it is unclear whether the level and the characteristics of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells in MDS are similar to those in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on previous research by our team, we further enlarged the specimens and found that the mean proportion and the mean MFI of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells in low-grade MDS were lower than that in AML, and those in high-grade MDS were similar to those in AML. CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells expressed lower granulocyte stimulating factor receptor, CD11b, and apoptosis molecule (Annexin V), meanwhile, these cells showed upregulation of transcription factors (GATA-1, GATA-2) and transferrin receptor (CD71) in MDS and AML. Furthermore, an increase in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells was closely related to the number of cytopenias involving hematopoietic lineages, anemia, blast count in bone marrow smear, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and WHO prognostic scoring system score. Thus, increases in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells may reflect malignant clonal cells with aberrant differentiation, overproliferation, and decreased apoptosis in MDS, which were similar to AML. CD123 may thus be a promising indicator for identifying malignant clonal cells in MDS and a candidate for targeted therapy.","['Li, Li Juan', 'Tao, Jing Lian', 'Fu, Rong', 'Wang, Hua Quan', 'Jiang, Hui Juan', 'Yue, Lan Zhu', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Liu, Hui', 'Shao, Zong Hong']","['Li LJ', 'Tao JL', 'Fu R', 'Wang HQ', 'Jiang HJ', 'Yue LZ', 'Zhang W', 'Liu H', 'Shao ZH']","[""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, No. 154 Anshan Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China, lilijuan20@qq.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1590-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Jul;100(1):60-9. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1590-2.

In particular, this miR has been described, together with other miRs, to allow the discrimination between AML (acute myeloid leukemia) and ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia). In addition, miR-128 is included in miR signatures which not only allow characterizing a particular subtype of AML but are also associated with worse clinical outcome in a subgroup of patients with high-risk molecular features of AML. Nevertheless, all the published studies are based on data from expression arrays and no functional studies have been performed. Therefore, in order to further understand the role of miR-128 in AML cells and in their response to some chemotherapy, overexpression of miR-128 was achieved with miR-mimics in an AML cell line (HL-60). This resulted in decreased cellular viability and increased sensitization to both etoposide and doxorubicin. Overexpression of miR-128 increased programmed cell death but had no effect on cell cycle profile, 1 apoptosis or autophagy, as no alterations were observed in the protein levels of PARP, pro-caspase-3, Vps34, Beclin-1 or LC3-II. In addition, miR-128 overexpression increased the levels of DNA damage, as could be concluded by an increase in the comet's tail intensity in the comet assay, an increase in the number of DNA repair foci stained with either gamma-H2AX or 53BP1 proteins, and an increase in the levels of these two proteins (observed by Western blot). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first association of miR-128 with DNA damage in a leukemia context.","['Seca, Hugo', 'Lima, Raquel T', 'Almeida, Gabriela M', 'Sobrinho-Simoes, Manuel', 'Bergantim, Rui', 'Guimaraes, Jose E', 'Vasconcelos, M Helena']","['Seca H', 'Lima RT', 'Almeida GM', 'Sobrinho-Simoes M', 'Bergantim R', 'Guimaraes JE', 'Vasconcelos MH']","['Cancer Drug Resistance Group, IPATIMUP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, s/n 4200-465 Porto, Portugal. hvasconcelos@ipatimup.pt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MIRN128 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/05/16 06:00,['2014/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CPB-EPUB-60567 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201015666140519122524 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2014;15(5):492-502. doi: 10.2174/1389201015666140519122524.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no functional analysis of bovine PD-L2 in cattle has been reported. Thus, in this study, the molecular function of bovine PD-L2 was analyzed in vitro. Recombinant PD-L2 (PD-L2-Ig), which comprises an extracellular domain of bovine PD-L2 fused to the Fc portion of rabbit IgG1, was prepared based on the cloned cDNA sequence for bovine PD-L2. Bovine PD-L2-Ig bound to bovine PD-1-expressing cells and addition of soluble bovine PD-1-Ig clearly inhibited the binding of PD-L2-Ig to membrane PD-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production were significantly enhanced in the presence of PD-L2-Ig in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cattle. Moreover, PD-L2-Ig significantly enhanced IFN-gamma production from virus envelope peptides-stimulated PBMCs derived from bovine leukemia virus-infected cattle. Interestingly, PD-L2-Ig-induced IFN-gamma production was further enhanced by treatment with anti-bovine PD-1 antibody. These data suggest potential applications of bovine PD-L2-Ig as a therapy for bovine diseases.","['Nishimori, Asami', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Ikebuchi, Ryoyo', 'Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Nakajima, Chie', 'Suzuki, Yasuhiko', 'Mingala, Claro N', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Nishimori A', 'Konnai S', 'Ikebuchi R', 'Okagawa T', 'Nakajima C', 'Suzuki Y', 'Mingala CN', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0818.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein/chemistry/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/05/22 06:00'],"['2014/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/1348-0421.12160 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2014 Jul;58(7):388-97. doi: 10.1111/1348-0421.12160.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['bovine leukemia virus', 'gamma-interferon', 'programmed death-1', 'programmed death-ligand 2']",,['(c) 2014 The Societies and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.'],,,,['GENBANK/AB898679'],,,,,,,,,

In B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), the malignant counterpart of hematogones, the leukemic blasts share common phenotypic features. The aim of the study was to enumerate the actual differences between the leukemic blasts in the CD10+ and CD10- subgroups of BCP-ALL and hematogones by assessing the expression of the antigens: TdT, CD34, CD45, CD10, CD38, CD20 and CD22. METHODS: To enable quantitative assessment of antigen expression on the different cell types, an objective scale of antigen expression was developed, the basis of which was direct fluorescence measurement using multicolor flow cytometry. RESULTS: All cases of CD10+ BCP-ALL clustered with type 1 hematogones. Among CD10-- BCP-ALL subgroup, 54.5%, 27.3% and 18.2% of cases clustered with type 1, 2 and 3 hematogones, respectively. In contrast to the CD10- blasts, the CD10+ blasts exhibited significantly higher levels of TdT, CD22, CD34 and CD20 expression. Conversely, CD10- blasts showed significantly higher expression of CD45 than CD10+ blasts, and a higher rate of CD45 antigen overexpression than CD10+ blasts (54.5% vs. 14.9% of cases, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Multiparameter flow cytometry combined with the use of absolute antigen expression scale based on direct fluorescence measurement, has enabled a clear distinction between blasts in BCP-ALL cases and their normal counterparts. This novel and previously undescribed method has allowed the comparative analysis of antigen expression between leukemic blasts and different types of their normal counterparts.","['Sedek, L', 'Bulsa, J', 'Sonsala, A', 'Twardoch, M', 'Wieczorek, M', 'Malinowska, I', 'Derwich, K', 'Niedzwiecki, M', 'Sobol-Milejska, G', 'Kowalczyk, J R', 'Mazur, B', 'Szczepanski, T']","['Sedek L', 'Bulsa J', 'Sonsala A', 'Twardoch M', 'Wieczorek M', 'Malinowska I', 'Derwich K', 'Niedzwiecki M', 'Sobol-Milejska G', 'Kowalczyk JR', 'Mazur B', 'Szczepanski T']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of this new risk model on 555 MDS patients in Taiwan. Generally, the IPSS-R could discriminate MDS patients regarding risk of leukemia evolution and overall survival in our cohort and it further refined prognostic stratification in all IPSS risk categories. However, we could not find the inter-group difference between IPSS-R very low and low risk subgroups in both leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). IPSS-R couldn't distinguish the prognosis between very good and good and between good and intermediate risk cytogenetic categories in OS, and between very good and good and between intermediate and poor cytogenetic-risk categories in LFS, either. On the other hand, incorporation of monosomal karyotype (MK) into IPSS-R could further stratify MDS patients with higher-risk IPSS-R (intermediate, high and very high risk) into four groups, rather than three groups, with different OS (P < 0.001). Intriguingly, patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had longer survival than those without in the IPSS-R high and very high, but not other risk groups. Similarly, patients treated with hypomethylating agents had better survival than those not in the IPSS-R very high risk group. In conclusion, IPSS-R can risk-stratify MDS patients in Taiwan but with some limitations, especially in very low risk category, and MK has additional prognostic value in discriminating MDS patients with higher-risk IPSS-R.","['Yang, Yi-Tsung', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Liu, Chieh-Yu', 'Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Lee, Fen-Yu', 'Liu, Ming-Chih', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yao, Ming', 'Li, Chi-Cheng', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Lin, Chien-Ting', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Yang YT', 'Hou HA', 'Liu CY', 'Lin CC', 'Chou WC', 'Lee FY', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Li CC', 'Kuo YY', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Chen CY', 'Hsu SC', 'Lin CT', 'Wu SJ', 'Tsay W', 'Chen YC', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Karyotype', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Risk', 'Taiwan', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/10/04 06:00,['2014/05/22 06:00'],"['2014/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23765 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Sep;89(9):E142-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23765.

In this type of study, information on novel factors is collected only in a convenient subcohort (phase II) drawn from the cohort (phase I) according to a given (optimal) sampling strategy. Estimation of survival in the subcohort needs to account for the design. The Kaplan-Meier method, based on counts of events and of subjects at risk in time, must be applied accounting, with suitable weights, for the sampling probabilities of the subjects in phase II, in order to recover the representativeness of the subcohort for the entire cohort. The authors derived a proper variance estimator of survival by linearization. The proposed method is applied in the context of a two-phase study on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which was planned in order to evaluate the role of genetic polymorphisms on treatment failure due to relapse.

Although prior assessment of ZAP70 by standard procedures did not reveal any prognostic information, we found by using the trough in the distribution as a cutpoint that ZAP70 expression levels were significantly correlated with both progression-free survival and overall survival. Additionally, the cells expressing high versus low levels of ZAP70 demonstrated distinct molecular organization as indicated by the other analytes assessed.

Montelukast, an antagonist of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, can suppress airway remodeling in asthma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether montelukast can ameliorate airway remodeling by blocking EMT induced by eosinophils. EMT induced was assessed using a co-culture system of human bronchial epithelial cells and human eosinophils or the eosinophilic leukemia cell lines, Eol-1. Montelukast inhibited co-culture associated morphological changes of BEAS-2b cells, decreased the expression of vimentin and collagen I, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Montelukast mitigated the rise of TGF-beta1 production and Smad3 phosphorylation. Co-culture of human eosinophils with BEAS-2B cells significantly enhanced the production of CysLTs compared with BEAS-2B cells or eosinophils alone. The increase of CysLTs was abolished by montelukast pre-treatment. Montelukast had similar effects when co-culture system of Eol-1 and BEAS-2B was used.

DIAGNOSIS: Key diagnostic criteria include leukocytosis of >25 x 10(9) /l (of which >80% are neutrophils) with <10% and <1% circulating immature granulocytes and myeloblasts, respectively. There should be no dysplasia, monocytosis, molecular evidence of BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGRF1 rearrangements and no identifiable cause for physiologic neutrophilia or, if present, demonstration of myeloid clonality. DEVELOPMENTS IN MOLECULAR GENETICS: Recently, CNL has been shown to be specifically driven by somatic activating mutations of CSF3R, most commonly CSF3R T618I. As such, the diagnosis of CNL will no longer be one of exclusion only, and revision of the current WHO classification is anticipated to include the molecular criterion of mutated CSF3R.","['Elliott, Michelle A', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Elliott MA', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Molecular Biology', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/05/23 06:00,2014/09/19 06:00,['2014/05/22 06:00'],"['2013/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23667 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Jun;89(6):651-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23667.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic mechanisms underlying disease progression in MPN and MDS/MPN patients remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate sequential genomic aberrations identified by single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping that can detect cryptic aberrations or copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in the chronic phase and during disease progression of MPN and MDS/MPN patients. METHODS: The study group included 13 MPN and four MDS/MPN patients (seven polycythemia vera (PV); four essential thrombocythemia (ET); two MPN-unclassifiable (MPN-U); one chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML); one atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1 negative (aCML); and two MDS/MPN-unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U)). Among them, five patients (two PV, two MPN-U, and one MDS/MPN-U) progressed to MF and three patients (one CMML, one aCML, and one MDS/MPN-U) transformed to AML. The median follow-up period was 70 months (range, 7-152). Whole-genome SNP-A (SNP 6.0; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA)-based karyotyping and JAK2 mutation analysis were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: SNP-A showed 19 kinds of genomic aberrations, including seven gains, eight deletions, and four CN-LOH. CN-LOH of 9p involving JAK2 was the most common aberration, followed by 5q deletion and 9p gain. The incidence of genomic changes identified by SNP was not different in patients with disease progression (75%), compared with those without disease progression (56%) (P = 0.4). However, when excluding 9p CN-LOH, the incidence of genomic changes was significantly higher in patients with disease progression than in patients without disease progression (63% and 0%, respectively, P = 0.01). Among eight patients with disease progression, two patients (two MPN-U) showed abnormal SNP-A results, whereas metaphase cytogenetics (MC) analysis showed normal results at diagnosis and during follow-up. In nine patients without disease progression, SNP-A did not show any genomic aberrations except for 9p CN-LOH. In three patients (one PV, one aCML, and one MDS/MPN-U), clonal evolutions were identified by both MC and SNP-A according to disease progression. One PV patient who progressed to MF at 45 months after diagnosis showed sequential genomic changes from 9p CN-LOH to 9p gain by SNP-A. Results of JAK2 mutation analysis were variable depending on the patient. Most of the patients with 9p CN-LOH or 9p gain showed more than 50% of the JAK2 mutant alleles. In one patient (MDS/MPN-U) evolving to AML, the number of JAK2 mutant alleles decreased according to disease progression. CONCLUSION: This study suggests sequential genomic changes identified by SNP-A may be associated with disease progression.","['Hahm, C', 'Huh, H J', 'Mun, Y C', 'Seong, C M', 'Chung, W S', 'Huh, J']","['Hahm C', 'Huh HJ', 'Mun YC', 'Seong CM', 'Chung WS', 'Huh J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Eone Laboratories, Incheon, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Retrospective Studies']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/05/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12257 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2015 Apr;37(2):181-9. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12257.

METHODS: By flow cytometry, the percentage of NK cell (CD3(-)CD56(+)CD16(+)) in peripheral blood lymphocytes was detected in 20 MDS patients, 15 acute myelogenous leukemic (AML) and 15 normal controls from March 2013 to November 2013 at our hospital.NK cell activation receptors (NKG2D, NKp44), inhibitory receptors (CD158a, CD158b), perforin and granzyme-beta of patients and normal controls were also detected. The correlation between these changes and hematopoietic functions, including the percentages of neutrophil granulocyte (ANC%), lymphocyte (Lym%), reticulocyte (RET%) and hemoglobin, thrombocyte in peripheral blood and the hematopoietic function in bone marrow (CD34(+)%) were evaluated. RESULTS: (1) The percentage of NK cell (3.87% +/- 0.97%) in MDS patients was significantly lower than that of normal controls (6.08% +/- 1.37%, P < 0.05) and higher than that of AML patients (2.58% +/- 0.78%, P < 0.05).(2) The expression of NKG2D in MDS patients (52.83%) was significantly lower than that of normal controls (86.36%, P < 0.05) and higher than that of AML patients (42.00%, P < 0.05). The expression of NKp44 in MDS patients (2.41%) was significantly higher than that of normal controls (0.62%) and AML patients (0.92%) (both P < 0.05). (3) The expression of CD158a in MDS and AML patients (5.46% +/- 2.40%, 4.05% +/- 1.89%) were significantly both lower than those of normal controls (7.97% +/- 2.85%, both P < 0.05). The expression of CD158b had no significant difference among the 3 groups. (4) The expression of perforin in MDS patients (17.83%) was significantly lower than that of normal controls (59.79%, P < 0.05) and higher than that of AML patients (13.06%, P < 0.05). The expressions of granzyme-beta in MDS and AML patients (21.54%, 30.65%) were significantly both lower than those of normal controls (83.42%, both P < 0.05). (5) The percentage of NK cell and the expression of NKG2D and NKp44 in MDS patients with low-risk group were in turn higher than those of high-risk group (4.06% +/- 0.56% vs 3.59% +/- 1.37%, 53.42% +/- 6.85% vs 47.29% +/- 8.08%, 2.46% vs 2.07%, all P < 0.05) , the expression of CD158a and CD158b were in turn lower than those of high-risk group, but both P > 0.05.(6) The percentage of NK was positively correlated with ANC% (r = 0.780, P < 0.05), but negatively with Lym% and the CD34(+)% in bone marrow (r = -0.543, -0.610, both P < 0.05). The expression of CD158a was positively correlated with CD34(+)% in bone marrow (r = 0.612, P < 0.05). The expressions of NKp44, CD158a, perforin and granzyme-beta of NK cells had no correlation with hematopoiesis (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The lowered percentage and function of NK may cause the immunological dysfunction and lead to underkill of pathological hematopoietic cells in MDS.","['Mi, Huijing', 'Fu, Rong', 'Wang, Huaquan', 'Qu, Wen', 'Ruan, Erbao', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Wang, Guojin', 'Liu, Hong', 'Wu, Yuhong', 'Song, Jia', 'Xing, Limin', 'Guan, Jing', 'Li, Lijuan', 'Jiang, Huijuan', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Yue, Lanzhu', 'Shao, Zonghong']","['Mi H', 'Fu R', 'Wang H', 'Qu W', 'Ruan E', 'Wang X', 'Wang G', 'Liu H', 'Wu Y', 'Song J', 'Xing L', 'Guan J', 'Li L', 'Jiang H', 'Zhang W', 'Yue L', 'Shao Z']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.

Although the phenotype of these cells remains unclear in most patients, they are enriched within the CD34(+)CD38(-) population. In core-binding factor (CBF) AML, the cytogenetic abnormalities also exist in LIC. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic power of minimal residual disease (MRD) measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells sorted by flow cytometry at different periods during therapy. Thirty-six patients under 65 years of age with de novo CBF-AML treated with intensive chemotherapy were retrospectively included in this study. Correlations with relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses. FISH efficiently identified LICs in the CD34(+)CD38(-) population. The presence of FISH(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells before consolidation was negatively associated with cumulative incidence of relapse (64 vs 18 %, P = .012), which showed prognostic value for RFS (12 vs 68 %, P = .008) and OS (11 vs 75 %, P = .0005), and retained prognostic significance for RFS in multivariate analysis. The detection of FISH(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells before consolidation therapy significantly correlated with long-term survival.

Response rate was significantly associated with subgroup (p = 0.0104). Good performance status (PS) was associated with better response rate (p = 0.0227). Median time-to-treatment-failure (TTF) (months) was 7.8 months, significantly (p < 0.0001) longer for responders (13.4) Major infections occurred in 36 %. Median overall survival was 22.5 months (range 0.4-74.3). Positive predictive factors were good PS (p < 0.0001) and fewer previous therapies (p = 0.0038). Twenty percent were retreated with alemtuzumab with an ORR of 54.5 %, and a TTF of 7.1 months. A high cumulative dose/longer duration of therapy and a relatively high response rate was observed compared to previous reports. Optimal patient identification and management may result in avoidance of early discontinuation and possibly better outcomes.","['Eketorp Sylvan, S', 'Lundin, J', 'Ipek, M', 'Palma, M', 'Karlsson, C', 'Hansson, L']","['Eketorp Sylvan S', 'Lundin J', 'Ipek M', 'Palma M', 'Karlsson C', 'Hansson L']","['Departments of Hematology and Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, sandra.eketorp-sylvan@karolinska.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Activation']",2014/05/23 06:00,2015/02/19 06:00,['2014/05/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2105-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Oct;93(10):1725-33. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2105-1.

The triterpenoids betulin and betulinic acid are very abundant in nature and now are commercially available. In our study, starting from betulin and betulinic acid, we obtained allobetulone and betulonic acid in a few synthetic steps. The ketone function at the A-ring was used as the starting point for the synthesis of a series of 1,2,4-triazine-fused triterpenoids. The alkylation and Liebeskind-Srogl coupling were used for further substitution of 1,2,4-triazines, and the intramolecular hetero Diels-Alder reaction leads to interesting fused thienopyridine derivatives. All new compounds were tested for their cytostatic activities against murine leukemia L1210, human cervix carcinoma HeLa and human lymphoblast CEM tumor cells. The results show that some triterpenoid triazine betulonic acid derivatives have a promising cytostatic activity in vitro and could be used as potential leads for the development of new type of anti-cancer agents. Several compounds were also endowed with anti-HCMV activity in the low micromolar range.","['Dinh Ngoc, Thuc', 'Moons, Nico', 'Kim, Youngju', 'De Borggraeve, Wim', 'Mashentseva, Anastassiya', 'Andrei, Graciela', 'Snoeck, Robert', 'Balzarini, Jan', 'Dehaen, Wim']","['Dinh Ngoc T', 'Moons N', 'Kim Y', 'De Borggraeve W', 'Mashentseva A', 'Andrei G', 'Snoeck R', 'Balzarini J', 'Dehaen W']","['Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Minderbroedersstraat 10, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Minderbroedersstraat 10, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Minderbroedersstraat 10, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.

Data were obtained through centralized therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) at median treatment duration of >/= 2 years. First, individual initial trough concentrations under 400mg/day imatinib starting dose were estimated. Second, their correlation (Cmin(400mg)) with reported treatment response was verified. Low imatinib levels were predicted in young male patients and those receiving P-gp/CYP3A4 inducers. These patients had also lower response rates (7% lower 18-months MMR in male, 17% lower 1-year CCyR in young patients, Kaplan-Meier estimates). Time-point independent multivariate regression confirmed a correlation of individual Cmin(400mg) with response and adverse events. Possibly due to confounding factors (e.g. dose modifications, patient selection bias), the relationship seemed however flatter than previously reported from prospective controlled studies. Nonetheless, these observational results strongly suggest that a subgroup of patients could benefit from early dosage optimization assisted by TDM, because of lower imatinib concentrations and lower response rates.","['Gotta, Verena', 'Bouchet, Stephane', 'Widmer, Nicolas', 'Schuld, Peter', 'Decosterd, Laurent A', 'Buclin, Thierry', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Csajka, Chantal', 'Molimard, Mathieu']","['Gotta V', 'Bouchet S', 'Widmer N', 'Schuld P', 'Decosterd LA', 'Buclin T', 'Mahon FX', 'Csajka C', 'Molimard M']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Service of Biomedicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Service of Biomedicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Oncology Region Europe, Milan, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Innovation & Development Unit, Service of Biomedicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Service of Biomedicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Laboratoire Hematopoiese Leucemique et Cible Therapeutique, Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, France.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Service of Biomedicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland.

In the LOUCY cell line we identified conspicuous expression of CHRDL1 encoding a BMP inhibitor which mediated activation of MSX1. Promoter analyses demonstrated activation of CHRDL1 by oncogenic PITX1. Furthermore, knockdown and overexpression studies of hematopoietic transcription factors demonstrated that GATA2 and FOXC1 mediate activation and GATA3, LEF1, TAL1 and TOX repression of MSX1 transcription. Collectively, our findings suggest that MSX1 is physiologically restricted to lymphoid progenitors. The identification of deregulated BMP signaling may provide novel therapeutic options for the treatment of T-ALL.","['Nagel, Stefan', 'Ehrentraut, Stefan', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F']","['Nagel S', 'Ehrentraut S', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Drexler HG', 'MacLeod RA']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures , Braunschweig , Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (CHRDL1 protein, human)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (FOXC1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (MSX1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (MSX1 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (homeobox protein PITX1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Eye Proteins/genetics', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics', 'MSX1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology']",2014/05/23 06:00,2016/04/06 06:00,['2014/05/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.924119 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015 Feb;56(2):480-91. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.924119.

Imaging rates are unknown for patients with cancer, whether under or over age 65 years, in health maintenance organizations (HMOs), where incentives may differ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Incident cases of breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cancers diagnosed in 2003 and 2006 from four HMOs in the Cancer Research Network were used to determine 2-year overall mean imaging counts and average total imaging costs per HMO enrollee by cancer type for those under and over age 65. RESULTS: There were 44,446 incident cancer patient cases, with a median age of 75 (interquartile range, 71-81), and 454,029 imaging procedures were performed. The mean number of images per patient increased from 7.4 in 2003 to 12.9 in 2006. Rates of imaging were similar across age groups, with the exception of greater use of echocardiograms and NM studies in younger patients with breast cancer and greater use of PET among younger patients with lung cancer. Advanced imaging accounted for approximately 41% of all imaging, or approximately 85% of the $8.7 million in imaging expenditures. Costs were nearly $2,000 per HMO enrollee; costs for younger patients with NHL, leukemia, and lung cancer were nearly $1,000 more in 2003. CONCLUSION: Rates of advanced imaging appear comparable among FFS and HMO participants of any age with these six cancers.","['Loggers, Elizabeth T', 'Fishman, Paul A', 'Peterson, Do', ""O'Keeffe-Rosetti, Maureen"", 'Greenberg, Caprice', 'Hornbrook, Mark C', 'Kushi, Lawrence H', 'Lowry, Sarah', 'Ramaprasan, Arvind', 'Wagner, Edward H', 'Weeks, Jane C', 'Ritzwoller, Debra P']","['Loggers ET', 'Fishman PA', 'Peterson D', ""O'Keeffe-Rosetti M"", 'Greenberg C', 'Hornbrook MC', 'Kushi LH', 'Lowry S', 'Ramaprasan A', 'Wagner EH', 'Weeks JC', 'Ritzwoller DP']","['Group Health Research Institute;

The long survival of patients with this common cancer raises questions about the risk of a second primary cancer and the need for continued surveillance. METHODS: A population-based cohort of 441,504 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1992 and 2010 was identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) data (SEER13). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated as an estimate of the risk of a second primary malignancy based on the incidence in the general population. RESULTS: Prostate cancer survivors had a lower risk of being diagnosed with another cancer overall compared with the US population (SIR = 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.61). The risks of leukemia and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, lung and bronchus, and larynx were significantly lower. Conversely, these patients had a greater risk of bladder, kidney, and endocrine and soft tissue cancers. Men who received treatment with radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy) had long-term increases in their risk of bladder cancer (SIR = 1.42) and rectal cancer (SIR = 1.70) risk compared with who did not receive radiation (SIRbladder = 0.76; SIRrectal = 0.74). There were significant racial differences in the risk of being diagnosed with a second primary cancer, and the magnitude and direction of these risks depended on tumor type. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer survivors remain at risk of subsequent malignancies, and race and treatment choice important determinants of long-term risk.","['Davis, Elizabeth J', 'Beebe-Dimmer, Jennifer L', 'Yee, Cecilia L', 'Cooney, Kathleen A']","['Davis EJ', 'Beebe-Dimmer JL', 'Yee CL', 'Cooney KA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2014/05/21 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2014/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28769 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Sep 1;120(17):2735-41. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28769.

However, relapse after CR remains a significant problem. The presence of leukemic cells at levels too low to be detected by conventional microscopy, termed minimal residual disease (MRD), has been associated with an increased risk of relapse and shortened survival. Detection of MRD requires the use of highly sensitive ancillary techniques. Multi-color flow cytometric immunophenotyping is a sensitive method for quick and accurate detection of MRD. Use of this method in patient management may result in lower rates of relapse and improved survival, and is an effective means of assessing novel therapeutic agents. This method can be used in the vast majority of patients with AML, regardless of the immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular genetic abnormalities present. Unfortunately, conflicting data regarding optimum methods of measurement and reporting, as well as the expertize required to interpret results have limited broad application of this technique. We provide a broad overview of this technique, including its advantages and limitations, and discuss the methods employed at our institution.

New developments in mTOR pathway inhibition in lymphoid malignancies.,336-51,10.1111/bjh.12945 [doi],"Since the discovery of rapamycin in Easter Island soil in 1975, more has been learnt about the relevance and importance of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in cell signalling, proliferation and ultimately tumourigenesis. Rapamycin targets the mTORC1 complex alone. Despite initial excitement, rapamycin and its analogues, everolimus and temsirolimus, have displayed limited efficacy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. This review highlights the important and well-described aspects of the critical phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway and discusses the mechanisms of action of rapamycin, its clinical efficacy in lymphoid malignancies, and the mechanisms of resistance. Renewed interest in targeting the pathway has evolved through the discovery of mTORC2, a protein complex associated with a key mechanism of resistance to first generation mTOR inhibitors. As such, novel dual inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2 have been developed, along with other dual inhibitors of the mTOR pathway. The evolution in the development of dual inhibitors is described herein, along with the burgeoning in vitro, pre-clinical data and the early phase clinical data available. Although historically mTOR inhibitors have been used extensively in haematopoietic and solid organ transplant prophylaxis, this review will focus on developments of their use in lymphoid malignancies.","['Eyre, Toby A', 'Collins, Graham P', 'Goldstone, Anthony H', 'Cwynarski, Kate']","['Eyre TA', 'Collins GP', 'Goldstone AH', 'Cwynarski K']","['Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",2014/05/21 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2014/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12945 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Aug;166(3):336-51. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12945.

CAV-1 is the main structural protein component of caveolae, playing important roles in tumorigenesis and tumor development. It has been shown that cav-1 expression is lower in leukemia cancer cell lines SUP-B15, HL-60, THP-1 and K562 and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia primary (CLP) cells when compared with normal white blood cells, with the lowest cav-1 expression level found in HL-60 cells. To study the effects of cav-1 in HL-60 cells and the effects of cav-1 overexpression on OA drug efficacy, cav-1 was overexpressed in HL-60 cells using lentiviral-mediated transfection combined with OA treatment. The results showed that cav-1 overexpression inhibited HL-60 cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, arrested the cell cycle in the G1 phase and inhibited activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Overexpression of CAV-1 also increased HL-60 cell sensitivity to OA. To further verify whether OA affects HL-60 cells via the activation of downstream signaling pathways by CAV-1, cav-1 gene expression was silenced using RNAi, and the cells were treated with OA to examine its efficacy.

However, inadequate anti-leukemic activity of NF-kappaB inhibition in vivo suggests the presence of additional survival/proliferative signals that can compensate for NF-kappaB inhibition. AML subtypes M3, M4, and M5 cells produce endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF). Although stimulating HSPC with TNF promotes necroptosis and apoptosis, similar treatment with AML cells (leukemic cells, LCs) results in an increase in survival and proliferation. We determined that TNF stimulation drives the JNK-AP1 pathway in a manner parallel to NF-kappaB, leading to the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes in LC. We found that we can significantly sensitize LC to NF-kappaB inhibitor treatment by blocking the TNF-JNK-AP1 signaling pathway. Our data suggest that co-inhibition of both TNF-JNK-AP1 and NF-kappaB signals may provide a more comprehensive treatment paradigm for AML patients with TNF-expressing LC.","['Volk, Andrew', 'Li, Jing', 'Xin, Junping', 'You, Dewen', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Liu, Xinli', 'Xiao, Yechen', 'Breslin, Peter', 'Li, Zejuan', 'Wei, Wei', 'Schmidt, Rachel', 'Li, Xingyu', 'Zhang, Zhou', 'Kuo, Paul C', 'Nand, Sucha', 'Zhang, Jianke', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Zhang, Jiwang']","['Volk A', 'Li J', 'Xin J', 'You D', 'Zhang J', 'Liu X', 'Xiao Y', 'Breslin P', 'Li Z', 'Wei W', 'Schmidt R', 'Li X', 'Zhang Z', 'Kuo PC', 'Nand S', 'Zhang J', 'Chen J', 'Zhang J']","['Molecular Biology Program, Department of Biology, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL 60660.', ""Department of Biology, College of Life and Environment Science, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, People's Republic of China."", 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Department of Pathology;

The interval between exposure to multidrug chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide and AML diagnosis was 2 years and 9 months. No cytogenetic abnormality was detected at the time of relapse. The patient died 2 weeks after starting AML chemotherapy.

Multiple drug resistance mechanisms mediate poor drug response and relapse in patients, and a selective Mcl-1 inhibitor has been speculated to be a promising agent in the treatment of AML. Here, we describe that maritoclax, a small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitor, induces Mcl-1 proteasomal degradation without transcriptional downregulation. Maritoclax killed AML cell lines and primary cells with elevated Mcl-1 levels through selective Mcl-1 downregulation, and synergized with ABT-737 to overcome Mcl-1-mediated ABT-737 resistance. Maritoclax was more effective than daunorubicin at inducing leukemic cell death when co-cultured with HS-5 bone marrow stroma cells, while being less toxic than daunorubicin against HS-5 stroma cells, primary mouse bone marrow cells, and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Moreover, maritoclax administration at 20 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally caused significant U937 tumor shrinkage, as well as 36% tumors remission rate in athymic nude mice, without apparent toxicity to healthy tissue or circulating blood cells. In summary, our studies suggest that maritoclax belongs to a novel class of Mcl-1 inhibitors that has the potential to be developed for the treatment of AML.","['Doi, Kenichiro', 'Liu, Qiang', 'Gowda, Krishne', 'Barth, Brian M', 'Claxton, David', 'Amin, Shantu', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Wang, Hong-Gang']","['Doi K', 'Liu Q', 'Gowda K', 'Barth BM', 'Claxton D', 'Amin S', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Wang HG']","['Department of Pediatrics; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA; Department of Pharmacology; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA; Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine; Hershey, PA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (marinopyrrole A)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2014/05/21 06:00,2015/06/04 06:00,['2014/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['29186 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.29186 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2014 Aug;15(8):1077-86. doi: 10.4161/cbt.29186.

This system was further upgraded to obtain a real-time ARMS RT-PCR (ARMS qRT-PCR) with a high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) platform. The genotyping of various strains of FeLV was determined by comparing the HRMA curves with the defined wild-type FeLV (strain TW1), and the results were expressed as a percentage confidence. The detection limits of ARMS RT-PCR and ARMS qRT-PCR combined with HRMA were 100 and 1 copies of transcribed FeLV RNA per 0.5 ml of sample, respectively. No false-positive results were obtained with 6 unrelated pathogens and 1 feline cell line. Twelve FeLV Taiwan strains were correctly identified using ARMS qRT-PCR combined with HRMA. The genotypes of the strains matched the defined FeLV wild-type strain genotype with at least 91.17% confidence. A higher degree of sequence polymorphism was found throughout the p27 gene compared with the long terminal repeat region. In conclusion, the current study describes the phylogenetic relationship of the FeLV Taiwan strains and demonstrates that the developed ARMS RT-PCR assay is able to be used to detect the replication of a vaccine strain that has not been properly inactivated, thus acting as a safety check for the quality of FeLV vaccines.","['Ho, Chia-Fang', 'Chan, Kun-Wei', 'Yang, Wei-Cheng', 'Chiang, Yu-Chung', 'Chung, Yang-Tsung', 'Kuo, James', 'Wang, Chi-Young']","['Ho CF', 'Chan KW', 'Yang WC', 'Chiang YC', 'Chung YT', 'Kuo J', 'Wang CY']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan (Ho, Chung, Kuo, Wang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agriculture, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan (Chan, Yang).', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaoshiung, Taiwan (Chiang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan (Ho, Chung, Kuo, Wang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agriculture, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan (Chan, Yang).', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaoshiung, Taiwan (Chiang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan (Ho, Chung, Kuo, Wang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agriculture, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan (Chan, Yang).', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaoshiung, Taiwan (Chiang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan (Ho, Chung, Kuo, Wang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agriculture, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan (Chan, Yang).', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaoshiung, Taiwan (Chiang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan (Ho, Chung, Kuo, Wang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agriculture, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan (Chan, Yang).', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaoshiung, Taiwan (Chiang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan (Ho, Chung, Kuo, Wang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agriculture, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan (Chan, Yang).', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaoshiung, Taiwan (Chiang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan (Ho, Chung, Kuo, Wang).', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agriculture, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan (Chan, Yang).', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaoshiung, Taiwan (Chiang).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",9011490,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (feline leukemia virus vaccine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*classification/genetics', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*veterinary', 'Point Mutation', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*veterinary', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Vaccines/genetics']",2014/05/21 06:00,2014/05/21 06:01,['2014/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/21 06:01 [medline]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['1040638714534850 [pii]', '10.1177/1040638714534850 [doi]']",ppublish,J Vet Diagn Invest. 2014 Jul;26(4):496-506. doi: 10.1177/1040638714534850.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Feline leukemia virus', 'multiplex amplification refractory mutation system', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'vaccine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this large, international, randomized clinical trial was to investigate the efficacy of elacytarabine, a novel elaidic acid ester of cytarabine, versus the investigator's choice of one of seven commonly used AML salvage regimens, including high-dose cytarabine, multiagent chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents, hydroxyurea, and supportive care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 381 patients with relapsed/refractory AML were treated in North America, Europe, and Australia. Investigators selected a control treatment for individual patients before random assignment. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in OS (3.5 v 3.3 months), response rate (23% v 21%), or relapse-free survival (5.1 v 3.7 months) between the elacytarabine and control arms, respectively. There was no significant difference in OS among any of the investigator's choice regimens. Prolonged survival was only achieved in a few patients in both study arms whose disease responded and who underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: Neither elacytarabine nor any of the seven alternative treatment regimens provided clinically meaningful benefit to these patients. OS in both study arms and for all treatments was extremely poor. Novel agents, novel clinical trial designs, and novel strategies of drug development are all desperately needed for this patient population.","['Roboz, Gail J', 'Rosenblat, Todd', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Montesinos, Pau', ""O'Connell, Casey"", 'Solomon, Scott R', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Hills, Robert', 'Jacobsen, Tove Flem', 'Gianella-Borradori, Athos', 'Foss, Oivind', 'Vetrhusand, Sylvia', 'Giles, Francis J']","['Roboz GJ', 'Rosenblat T', 'Arellano M', 'Gobbi M', 'Altman JK', 'Montesinos P', ""O'Connell C"", 'Solomon SR', 'Pigneux A', 'Vey N', 'Hills R', 'Jacobsen TF', 'Gianella-Borradori A', 'Foss O', 'Vetrhusand S', 'Giles FJ']","[""Gail J.

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved regulator of the cellular response to the presence of low energy in all eukaryotic cells. It is considered a key sensor of the balance of cellular ATP and AMP concentrations. LKB1 serine/threonine kinase is a divergent yet evolutionarily well-conserved kinase, biochemically sufficient to activate AMPK in vitro and genetically required for AMPK activation. Because of this potent connection to AMPK, LKB1 may act as a central regulator of metabolism in vivo. Once activated, AMP kinase phosphorylates the transcriptional activator TorC2, thereby blocking its nuclear translocation and inhibiting the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis. Data suggest that LKB1/AMPK signaling plays a role in protection from apoptosis, specifically in response to agents that increase the cellular AMP/ATP ratio. Active AMPK signaling offers a protective effect by providing the cell with time to reverse the aberrantly high ratio of AMP/ATP. If unable to reverse this ratio, the cell will eventually undergo cell death. These observations offer the provocative suggestion of a potential therapeutic window in which LKB1-deficient tumor cells may be acutely sensitive to AMP analogues or sensitized to cell death by other stimuli when treated in combination with agents that increase the AMP/ATP ratio. LKB1 therefore is a classical tumor suppressor. AMPK is a direct LKB1 substrate. A consequence of AMPK activation by LKB1 is the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 pathway. Metformin's anti-cancerous properties have been demonstrated in various cancer cells in vitro, such as lung, pancreatic, colon, ovarian, breast, prostate, renal cancer cells, melanoma, and even in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To test metformin's action in vivo, mice were implanted with transformed mammary epithelial cells and treated with three cycles of metformin and with the anthracycline doxorubicin. When combined with doxorubicin, metformin wiped out tumors and prevented recurrence. Metformin alone had no effect, and doxorubicin as a single agent initially shrank tumors, but they regrew later. Virtually no cancer stem cells were recovered immediately after treatment and the complete response was sustained for nearly two months. Further studies are needed to assess the anti-cancerous potentials of metformin in vivo. This article reviews the current knowledge on the actions of LKB1/AMPK and the effectiveness of metformin in cancer, specifically in diabetes patients.","['Vallianou, Natalia G', 'Evangelopoulos, Angelos', 'Kazazis, Christos']","['Vallianou NG', 'Evangelopoulos A', 'Kazazis C']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Evangelismos General Hospital, 10676 Athens, Greece.', 'Roche Diagnostics Hellas, 15125, Maroussi, Athens, Greece.', 'Honorary Lecturer, School of Medicine, University of Leicester, University Rd, Leicester, LE1 9HN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Rev Diabet Stud,The review of diabetic studies : RDS,101227575,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Metformin/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2013/01/01 00:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1900/RDS.2013.10.228 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Diabet Stud. 2013 Winter;10(4):228-35. doi: 10.1900/RDS.2013.10.228.

Increased DNA methylation of individual genes' promoter regions and decreases in overall DNA methylation level are both generally observed in cancer. In solid tumors, this global DNA hypomethylation is related to reduced methylation of repeated DNA elements (REs) and contributes to genome instability. The aim of the present study was to assess methylation level of LINE-1 and ALU REs and total 5-methylcytosine (5metC) content in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 58), childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 32), as the most frequent acute leukemias in two age categories and in normal adult bone marrow and children's blood samples. DNA pyrosequencing and ELISA assays were used, respectively. Global DNA hypomethylation was not observed in leukemia patients. Results revealed higher DNA methylation of LINE-1 in AML and ALL samples compared to corresponding normal controls. Elevated methylation of ALU and overall 5metC level were also observed in B-cell ALL patients. Differences of REs and global DNA methylation between AML cytogenetic-risk groups were observed, with the lowest methylation levels in intermediate-risk/cytogenetically normal patients. B-cell ALL is characterized by the highest DNA methylation level compared to AML and controls and overall DNA methylation is correlated with leukocyte count.","['Bujko, Mateusz', 'Musialik, Ewa', 'Olbromski, Rafal', 'Przestrzelska, Marta', 'Libura, Marta', 'Pastwinska, Anna', 'Juszczynski, Przemyslaw', 'Zwierzchowski, Lech', 'Baranowski, Pawel', 'Siedlecki, Janusz Aleksander']","['Bujko M', 'Musialik E', 'Olbromski R', 'Przestrzelska M', 'Libura M', 'Pastwinska A', 'Juszczynski P', 'Zwierzchowski L', 'Baranowski P', 'Siedlecki JA']","['Department of Molecular and Translational Oncology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, W.K.

Correlations between polymorphisms in the genes encoding human Siglecs and various diseases have been reported. Leading examples, such as the CD33 polymorphism associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, are well supported by genetic replication and mechanistic studies, while some others (such as SIGLEC8 polymorphism associated with bronchial asthma and SIGLEC14 polymorphism associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may benefit reinforcement by independent genetic replication or mechanistic studies. In a few cases, such as MAG polymorphism associated with psychological disorder and CD22 polymorphism associated with autoimmune disease, the phenotype associated with a genetic polymorphism of a Siglec gene and that of an enzyme gene involved in the biosynthesis of Siglec ligand show some overlap, providing indirect support for the observed genotype-phenotype association. Although studies using engineered mutant mice have provided invaluable insights into the biological functions and mechanisms of diseases, it is not always possible to develop appropriate mouse model to replicate human situations because of significant species-to-species differences, which can be a major obstacle in understanding the biology of some of human CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglecs. Further studies in genetic polymorphisms of human Siglecs, combined with appropriate functional studies, may reveal unexpected biological roles of human Siglecs, and identify possible targets for prevention and/or treatment of certain diseases.","['Angata, Takashi']",['Angata T'],"['Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Road, Section 2, Nankang District, Taipei 11529, Taiwan angata@gate.sinica.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,['0 (Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins)'],IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Asthma/*genetics', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins/*genetics/metabolism']",2014/05/21 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['cwu043 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/cwu043 [doi]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 2014 Sep;24(9):785-93. doi: 10.1093/glycob/cwu043.

Because epratuzumab reduces on average only 35% of circulating B cells in patients, and has minimal antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and negligible complement-dependent cytotoxicity when evaluated in vitro, its therapeutic activity may not result completely from B-cell depletion. We reported recently that epratuzumab mediates Fc/FcR-dependent membrane transfer from B cells to effector cells via trogocytosis, resulting in a substantial reduction of multiple BCR modulators, including CD22, CD19, CD21, and CD79b, as well as key cell adhesion molecules, including CD44, CD62L, and beta7 integrin, on the surface of B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from normal donors or SLE patients. Rituximab has clinical activity in lupus, but failed to achieve primary endpoints in a Phase III trial. This is the first study of trogocytosis mediated by bispecific antibodies targeting neighboring cell-surface proteins, CD22, CD20, and CD19, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. We show that, compared to epratuzumab, a bispecific hexavalent antibody comprising epratuzumab and veltuzumab (humanized anti-CD20 mAb) exhibits enhanced trogocytosis resulting in major reductions in B-cell surface levels of CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD79b, CD44, CD62L and beta7-integrin, and with considerably less immunocompromising B-cell depletion that would result with anti-CD20 mAbs such as veltuzumab or rituximab, given either alone or in combination with epratuzumab. A CD22/CD19 bispecific hexavalent antibody, which exhibited enhanced trogocytosis of some antigens and minimal B-cell depletion, may also be therapeutically useful. The bispecific antibody is a candidate for improved treatment of lupus and other autoimmune diseases, offering advantages over administration of the two parental antibodies in combination.","['Rossi, Edmund A', 'Chang, Chien-Hsing', 'Goldenberg, David M']","['Rossi EA', 'Chang CH', 'Goldenberg DM']","['Immunomedics, Inc., Morris Plains, New Jersey, United States of America; IBC Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Morris Plains, New Jersey, United States of America.', 'Immunomedics, Inc., Morris Plains, New Jersey, United States of America; IBC Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Morris Plains, New Jersey, United States of America.', 'Immunomedics, Inc., Morris Plains, New Jersey, United States of America; IBC Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Morris Plains, New Jersey, United States of America; Center for Molecular Medicine and Immunology, Morris Plains, New Jersey, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '3062P60MH9 (epratuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'BPD4DGQ314 (veltuzumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/immunology/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunological Synapses/*metabolism', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Rituximab']",2014/05/21 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0098315 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-09450 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 19;9(5):e98315. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0098315. eCollection 2014.,,20140519,,PMC4026529,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rigorous selection checkpoints ensure that the mature B-cell compartment in the periphery is largely purged of self-reactive B cells. However, autoreactive B cells escape selection and persist in the periphery as anergic or clonally ignorant B cells. Under the influence of genetic or environmental factors, which are not completely understood, autoreactive B cells may be activated. Similar activation can also occur at different stages of B-cell maturation in the bone marrow or in peripheral lymphoid organs and give rise to malignant B cells. The pathology that typifies neoplastic lymphocytes and autoreactive B cells differs: malignant B cells proliferate and occupy niches otherwise taken up by healthy leukocytes or erythrocytes, while autoreactive B cells produce pathogenic antibodies or present self-antigen to T cells. However, both malignant and autoreactive B cells share the commonality of deregulated BCR pathways as principal contributors to pathogenicity. We first summarize current views of BCR activation. We then explore how anomalous BCR pathways correlate with malignancies and autoimmunity. We also elaborate on the activation of TLR pathways in abnormal B cells and how they contribute to maintenance of pathology. Finally, we outline the benefits and emergence of mouse models generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer to study B-cell function in manners for which current transgenic models may be less well suited.","['Avalos, Ana M', 'Meyer-Wentrup, Friederike', 'Ploegh, Hidde L']","['Avalos AM', 'Meyer-Wentrup F', 'Ploegh HL']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."", 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.

It has been under investigation as a potential treatment for a variety of solid tumors although with much poorer efficacy than for APL. The toxicity of As(III) and its derivatives is a common concern that has limited its use. The objective of the current study was to develop a polymeric micelle drug delivery system for efficient and controlled delivery of trivalent arsenicals to solid tumor cells. A polymeric micelle-based drug delivery system can potentially extend the duration of drug circulation in blood, restrict access of encapsulated drug to normal tissues, achieve tumor targeted drug delivery, enhance drug accumulation in the tumor area, and trigger drug release at tumor sites if designed properly. These, in turn, can lead to an improved therapeutic index for the polymeric micellar formulation of arsenic species compared to their free form. Towards this goal, a biodegradable block copolymer with pendent thiol groups on the hydrophobic block, i.e., methoxy poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly[alpha-(6-mecaptohexyl amino)carboxylate-epsilon-caprolactone] [PEO-b-P(CCLC6-SH)], was synthesized and used for conjugation of a trivalent arsenical, phenylarsine oxide (PAO), to free thiol groups on the polymer backbone. PAO-loaded micelles had refined size distribution with an average diameter of 150 nm as evidenced by dynamic light scattering (DLS) in water. Prepared polymeric micelles were characterized for the level of PAO conjugation using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed 65% of total free thiols were conjugated to PAO providing an arsenic/polymer loading content of ~2.5 wt%. In vitro release study suggests prolonged release of PAO from its polymeric micellar carrier, which was accelerated in the presence of glutathione (GSH). Cytotoxicity studies against MDA-MB-435 cells show that the IC50 of PEO-b-P(CCLC6-S-PAO) is not significantly different from that of free PAO. The results indicate that PEO-b-P(CCLC6-SH) is a promising carrier for successful arsenic delivery for cancer therapy.","['Zhang, Qi', 'Vakili, Mohammad Reza', 'Li, Xing-Fang', 'Lavasanifar, Afsaneh', 'Le, X Chris']","['Zhang Q', 'Vakili MR', 'Li XF', 'Lavasanifar A', 'Le XC']","['Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada.', 'Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada.

METHODS: Altogether, this study comprises 15 332 incident cases of AML diagnosed in Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland from 1961-2005 and 76 660 controls matched by year of birth, sex, and country. Occupational records were linked with Nordic Occupational Cancer Study job exposure matrix (JEM) to estimate quantitative values for 26 occupational exposure factors. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: We did not observe statistically significantly increased risk for exposure to any of the solvents. HR estimates for high levels of toluene (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.74-2.46), aromatic hydrocarbon solvents (ARHC) (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.76-1.86), and moderate-to-high levels of trichloroethylene were slightly but non-significantly elevated.

In many cell types, detection of intracellular pathogens is mostly dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic sensors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). However, the possible interplay between these two systems has not yet been elucidated. Here we aimed to study the collaboration of endosomal TLRs and RIG-I in primary human pDCs. We found that under steady-state conditions, pDCs express RIG-I at very low level, but the expression of this receptor is rapidly and dramatically upregulated upon stimulation by the TLR7 ligand imiquimod or the TLR9 ligand type A CpG. We also demonstrated that pDCs are able to sense and respond to 5'-triphosphate double-stranded RNA (5'-ppp-dsRNA) only following activation by endosomal TLRs. Experiments on primary pDCs with functionally blocked IFN-alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and those on human pDC leukemia (pDC-L) cells defective in type I IFN secretion indicated that the upregulation of RIG-I expression in pDCs upon stimulation by endosomal TLR occurs in a type I IFN-independent manner. Selective phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) on tyrosine 701 could be identified as an early signaling event in this process. Our results show that in contrast to many other cell types, where RIG-I expression is induced by type I IFN, in pDCs a disparate mechanism is responsible for the upregulation of RIG-I. Our findings also indicate that along with autophagy, an additional mechanism is operating in pDCs to promote the detection of replicating viruses.","['Szabo, Attila', 'Magyarics, Zoltan', 'Pazmandi, Kitti', 'Gopcsa, Laszlo', 'Rajnavolgyi, Eva', 'Bacsi, Attila']","['Szabo A', 'Magyarics Z', 'Pazmandi K', 'Gopcsa L', 'Rajnavolgyi E', 'Bacsi A']","['Department of Immunology, Medical and Health Sciences Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical and Health Sciences Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical and Health Sciences Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Szent Istvan and Szent Laszlo Hospital of Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical and Health Sciences Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical and Health Sciences Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX58 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD Box Protein 58)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)', 'P1QW714R7M (Imiquimod)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DEAD Box Protein 58', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imiquimod', 'Interferon Type I/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Double-Stranded', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2014/05/21 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/05/21 06:00'],"['2013/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['icb201438 [pii]', '10.1038/icb.2014.38 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2014 Sep;92(8):671-8. doi: 10.1038/icb.2014.38.

We find high levels of MLLT11 transcript and protein expression in the developing marginal zone of the cortex and spinal cord. MLLT11 co-localized with Tbr2 in the developing subplate region of the cortex and expanded to encompass the cortical plate at late fetal stages. Expression in the peripheral nervous system initiated at E9.5 in the facio-acoustic cranial ganglia and elaborated to identify all the cranio-facial and dorsal root ganglia by E10.5. We also observed expression in the eye and gastrointestinal tract, where MLLT11 transcripts localized to Tuj1-positive inner retinal layer and autonomic neurons, respectively.

Previous studies suggest a relationship between its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of C677T and A1298C with a variety of tumor susceptibility including hematological malignancy. SNP frequency distribution in different ethnic populations might lead to differences in disease susceptibility. There has been little research in Chinese people on the MTHFR SNP with the susceptibility of the hematological malignancy. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between MTHFR SNPs and hematological malignancy in Jiangsu province in China. METHODS: Gene microarray was used to detect MTHFR C677T and A1298C single nucleotide polymorphism loci on 157 healthy controls and 127 patients from Jiangsu province with hematological malignancies (30 with multiple myeloma, 28 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 22 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 40 with acute myeloid leukemia, and seven with chronic myeloid leukemia). RESULTS: The allele frequency of 677T was 41.3% in patients and 33.1% in controls, showed significant difference (chi2 = 4.08, p = 0.043); 677TT genotype with a high susceptibility to hematological malignancy (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.01 - 4.45, p = 0.041). In subgroup analyses, the genotypes 677TT and 1298CC were associated with significantly increased multiple myeloma risk (TT vs. CC: OR 8.92, 95% CI 1.06 - 75.24, p = 0.006; CC vs. AA: OR = 4.80, 95% CI 1.56 - 14.73, p = 0.044). No associations were found between polymorphisms and susceptibilities to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to define immunological profile of CLL cells. METHODS: Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry was performed on peripheral blood specimens at diagnosis in the group of 211 patients with de novo MBCN. RESULTS: Absolute count of B-cells was significantly increased in all MBCN patients comparing to healthy control group (p < 0.05). B-cell monoclonality was detected in 96% of all MBCN patients, by using surface immunoglobulin (sIg) light chain restriction. B-cell antigens, CD19, CD20, CD22, were expressed with very high frequency in CLL and other MBCN. In comparison with other MBCN, in CLL group, the frequency of expression was higher for CD5 and CD23 (p < 0.0001), though lower for FMC7 antigen (p < 0.0001). CLL patients were characterized by lower expression patterns of CD20, CD22, CD79b, and sIg (p < 0.0001) as well as higher expression pattern of CD5 antigen (p < 0.05). Correlation between the final diagnosis of MBCN and values of CLL scoring system showed that the majority of CLL patients (97%) had higher values (5 or 4) whereas the majority of other MBCN patients (96%) had lower score values (0-3). CONCLUSION: Our results have shown that characteristic immunophenotype which differentiates CLL from other MBCN is defined by following marker combination--CD19+ CD20(+Iow) CD22(+low) CD5(+high) CD23+ FMC7-CD79b(+Iow) sIg(+Iow).

Detection of the V617F JAK 2 mutation in such scenario can provide a useful diagnostic test to establish the neoplastic nature of the neutrophilia.","['Gajendra, Smeeta', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Chandgothia, Meenal', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Gupta, Richa', 'Chavan, Snehal Motilal']","['Gajendra S', 'Gupta R', 'Chandgothia M', 'Kumar L', 'Gupta R', 'Chavan SM']","['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, DR.

Residual LSC are believed to be responsible for relapse in AML after chemotherapy. Leukemic progenitor cell compartments were defined by CD34 and CD38 expression by flow cytometry in 61 new cases of AML. In each of four compartments thus defined, CD34+CD38-, CD34+CD38+, CD34-CD38- and CD34-CD38+, the pattern and intensity of expression of CD33 were studied in comparison to similar progenitor cell compartments in normal bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell harvests. Post induction bone marrow samples from 10/61 cases were studied for aberrant CD33 expression. The intensity and pattern of expression of CD33 in AML progenitor cells were significantly different compared to normal progenitor cells. In two cases who were in morphological remission post induction, aberrant CD33 expressing progenitor cells were detectable at a frequency of 1.6 and 0.5 % respectively in the bone marrow. Aberrant CD33 expression in bone marrow LSC identified as CD34+CD38- cells in the CD45 dim/low side scatter region on flow cytometry may be useful as minimal residual disease marker after AML therapy. The method involves the use of a limited number of reagents and can be applied to all cases of AML.","['Dutta, Shyamali', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Dutta S', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, NRS Medical College & Hospital, 138, AJC Bose Road, Kolkata, 700014 India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,2014/05/20 06:00,2014/05/20 06:01,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-013-0317-5 [doi]', '317 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2014 Jun;30(2):130-4. doi: 10.1007/s12288-013-0317-5.

One important challenge is the lack of a universal feature selection technique which produces similar outcomes with all types of classifiers. This is because all feature selection techniques have individual statistical biases while classifiers exploit different statistical properties of data for evaluation. In numerous situations this can put researchers into dilemma as to which feature selection method and a classifiers to choose from a vast range of choices. In this paper, we propose a technique that aggregates the consensus properties of various feature selection methods to develop a more optimal solution. The ensemble nature of our technique makes it more robust across various classifiers. In other words, it is stable towards achieving similar and ideally higher classification accuracy across a wide variety of classifiers. We quantify this concept of robustness with a measure known as the Robustness Index (RI). We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of our technique on eight data sets with different dimensions including Arrythmia, Lung Cancer, Madelon, mfeat-fourier, internet-ads, Leukemia-3c and Embryonal Tumor and a real world data set namely Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). We demonstrate not only that our algorithm is more robust, but also that compared to other techniques our algorithm improves the classification accuracy by approximately 3-4% (in data set with less than 500 features) and by more than 5% (in data set with more than 500 features), across a wide range of classifiers.","['Sarkar, Chandrima', 'Cooley, Sarah', 'Srivastava, Jaideep']","['Sarkar C', 'Cooley S', 'Srivastava J']","['College of Science and Engineering University of Minnesota at Twin Cities.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota at Twin Cities.', 'College of Science and Engineering University of Minnesota at Twin Cities.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Artif Intell,Applied artificial intelligence : AAI,9882296,,,,2014/05/20 06:00,2014/05/20 06:01,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/08839514.2014.883903 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Artif Intell. 2014 Jan 1;28(3):243-257. doi: 10.1080/08839514.2014.883903.,"['P01 CA111412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC4019401,,,,,['NIHMS571273'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies have been done on the role of RLIP76 in leukemia. In this study, human leukemia cell line U937 was transiently transfected with a RLIP76-targeted short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to investigate the effects of RLIP76 on cellular functions. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis revealed that the expression levels of RLIP76 mRNA and protein in U937 cells were significantly suppressed after transfection with shRNA-containing vector. Knockdown of RLIP76 significantly inhibited cell growth and decreased the colony formation rate, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion and colony formation assay. Flow cytometry analysis showed that reduced RLIP76 expression resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, western blot analysis demonstrated that RLIP76 knockdown increased expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3/-9, and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) but reduced the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Bcl-2 in U937 cells. Finally, knockdown of RLIP76 in U937 cells also enhanced their chemosensitivity to daunorubicin. Taken together, this study suggests that RLIP76 is a potential target for developing novel therapeutic strategies for leukemia.","['Yao, Kun', 'Xing, Hongchang', 'Yang, Wei', 'Liao, Aijun', 'Wu, Bin', 'Li, Yingchun', 'Zhang, Rong', 'Liu, Zhuogang']","['Yao K', 'Xing H', 'Yang W', 'Liao A', 'Wu B', 'Li Y', 'Zhang R', 'Liu Z']","[""Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, 36 Sanhao Street, Shenyang, 110004, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (RALBP1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2014/05/20 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2014/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2073-z [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Aug;35(8):8023-31. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2073-z.

In contrast to younger patients, there remains uncertainty about disease biology and molecular prognostic factors in elderly AML. While almost all patients may benefit from treatment, with the exception of reduced intensity allogeneic transplantation, there is little evidence that further intensifying therapy will improve outcomes. In fact, recent studies suggest that de-intensified treatment may in fact be superior and allow access to therapy for more patients.

It lacks the EF hand motif characteristic of classical calpains but retains catalytic and Ca(2+) binding domains, and it contains a unique C-terminal domain. TRA-3, an ortholog of CAPN5, has been shown to be involved in necrotic cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans. CAPN5 is expressed throughout the CNS, but its expression relative to other calpains and subcellular distribution has not been investigated previously. Based on relative mRNA levels, Capn5 is the second most highly expressed calpain in the rat CNS, with Capn2 mRNA being the most abundant. Unlike classical calpains, CAPN5 is a non-cytosolic protein localized to the nucleus and extra-nuclear locations. CAPN5 possesses two nuclear localization signals (NLS): an N-terminal monopartite NLS and a unique bipartite NLS closer to the C terminus. The C-terminal NLS contains a SUMO-interacting motif that contributes to nuclear localization, and mutation or deletion of both NLS renders CAPN5 exclusively cytosolic. Dual NLS motifs are common among transcription factors. Interestingly, CAPN5 is found in punctate domains associated with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein within the nucleus. PML nuclear bodies are implicated in transcriptional regulation, cell differentiation, cellular response to stress, viral defense, apoptosis, and cell senescence as well as protein sequestration, modification, and degradation. The roles of nuclear CAPN5 remain to be determined.","['Singh, Ranjana', 'Brewer, M Kathryn', 'Mashburn, Charles B', 'Lou, Dingyuan', 'Bondada, Vimala', 'Graham, Brantley', 'Geddes, James W']","['Singh R', 'Brewer MK', 'Mashburn CB', 'Lou D', 'Bondada V', 'Graham B', 'Geddes JW']","['From the Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Center and the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536.', 'From the Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Center and.', 'From the Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Center and.', 'From the Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Center and.', 'From the Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Center and.', 'From the Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Center and.', 'From the Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Center and the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536 jgeddes@uky.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Capn5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (calpain 5, rat)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/enzymology/genetics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Calpain/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology/genetics', 'Central Nervous System/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2014/05/20 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47703-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.575159 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 11;289(28):19383-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.575159.

The single-crystal X-ray structures of complexes 1 and 2 exhibit the symmetrical ligands coordinated to the nickel(II) ion in a tetradentate fashion via ONNO donor atoms, while the unsymmetrical ligand L(2) presented a ONO tridentate coordination mode in complex 3. The nickel(II) ions lie in the six-coordinated octahedral environment for the mononuclear complexes 1 and 3, along with dinuclear complex 2. The interaction of the complexes with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods, which revealed that complexes 1-3 could interact with CT-DNA through intercalation. The interactions of the complexes with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were also investigated using UV-Vis, fluorescence and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopic methods. The results indicated that all of the complexes could quench the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA in a static quenching process. Further, the in vitro cytotoxic effect of the complexes examined on cancerous cell lines such as human lung carcinoma cell line (A549), human colon carcinoma cell lines (HCT-116), human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) and colonic cancer cell line Caco-2 showed that all three complexes exhibited substantial cytotoxic activity.","['Li, Peng', 'Niu, MeiJu', 'Hong, Min', 'Cheng, Shuang', 'Dou, JianMin']","['Li P', 'Niu M', 'Hong M', 'Cheng S', 'Dou J']","['Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Energy Storage and Novel Cell Technology, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252059, PR China.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Energy Storage and Novel Cell Technology, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252059, PR China.

Total body irradiation (TBI) remains an important part of the conditioning regimen for HCST. For those patients unable to tolerate myeloablative TBI (mTBI), reduced intensity TBI (riTBI) is commonly used. In this study we compared outcomes of patients undergoing mTBI with those of patients undergoing riTBI in our institution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with acute leukemia who underwent TBI-based conditioning, using a prospectively acquired database of HSCT patients treated at our institution. Patient data including details of the transplantation procedure, disease status, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), response rates, toxicity, survival time, and time to progression were extracted. Patient outcomes for various radiation therapy regimens were examined. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between June 1985 and July 2012, 226 patients with acute leukemia underwent TBI as conditioning for HSCT. Of those patients, 180 had full radiation therapy data available; 83 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 94 had acute myelogenous leukemia; 45 patients received riTBI, and 135 received mTBI. Median overall survival (OS) was 13.7 months. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) for all patients was 10.2 months. Controlling for age, sex, KPS, disease status, and diagnosis, there were no significant differences in OS or RFS between patients who underwent riTBI and those who underwent mTBI (P=.402, P=.499, respectively). Median length of hospital stay was shorter for patients who received riTBI than for those who received mTBI (16 days vs 23 days, respectively; P<.001), and intensive care unit admissions were less frequent following riTBI than mTBI (2.22% vs 12.69%, respectively, P=.043). Nonrelapse survival rates were also similar (P=.186). CONCLUSIONS: No differences in OS or RFS were seen between all patients undergoing riTBI and those undergoing mTBI, despite older age and potential increased comorbidity of riTBI patients. riTBI regimens were associated with shorter length of hospital stay, fewer intensive care unit admissions, and similar rates of nonrelapse survival, which may reflect reduced toxicity. Prospective trials comparing riTBI and mTBI are warranted.","['Mikell, John L', 'Waller, Edmund K', 'Switchenko, Jeffrey M', 'Rangaraju, Sravanti', 'Ali, Zahir', 'Graiser, Michael', 'Hall, William A', 'Langston, Amelia A', 'Esiashvili, Natia', 'Khoury, H Jean', 'Khan, Mohammad K']","['Mikell JL', 'Waller EK', 'Switchenko JM', 'Rangaraju S', 'Ali Z', 'Graiser M', 'Hall WA', 'Langston AA', 'Esiashvili N', 'Khoury HJ', 'Khan MK']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.

These patients have a relatively poor prognosis, with a probability of long-term survival from relapse of about 35%. This can only be achieved with very intensive chemotherapy and, usually, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, leading to very significant toxicity and even treatment-related mortality. Major improvements in the treatment of paediatric relapsed AML thus are required still, and several possibilities are discussed. In case of a suspected relapse, a comprehensive diagnostic work-up has to be undertaken, because significant changes in the biological features of the AML cells may have occurred between initial diagnosis and relapse. This review discusses many practical issues that one encounters in the treatment of children with relapsed AML.

The relatively high mortality of FIP, especially for younger cats from catteries and shelters, should be reason enough to stimulate such intense interest. However, it is the complexity of the disease and the grudging manner in which it yields its secrets that most fascinate researchers. Feline leukemia virus infection was conquered in less than two decades and the mysteries of feline immunodeficiency virus were largely unraveled in several years. After a half century, FIP remains one of the last important infections of cats for which we have no single diagnostic test, no vaccine and no definitive explanations for how virus and host interact to cause disease. How can a ubiquitous and largely non-pathogenic enteric coronavirus transform into a highly lethal pathogen? What are the interactions between host and virus that determine both disease form (wet or dry) and outcome (death or resistance)? Why is it so difficult, and perhaps impossible, to develop a vaccine for FIP? What role do genetics play in disease susceptibility? This review will explore research conducted over the last 5 years that attempts to answer these and other questions. Although much has been learned about FIP in the last 5 years, the ultimate answers remain for yet more studies.","['Pedersen, Niels C']",['Pedersen NC'],"['Center for Companion Animal Health, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA.

A possible differential impact of the corresponding BCR-ABL1 transcript variants e13a2 (""b2a2"") and e14a2 (""b3a2"") on disease phenotype and outcome is still a subject of debate. A total of 1105 newly diagnosed imatinib-treated patients were analyzed according to transcript type at diagnosis (e13a2, n=451; e14a2, n=496; e13a2+e14a2, n=158). No differences regarding age, sex, or Euro risk score were observed. A significant difference was found between e13a2 and e14a2 when comparing white blood cells (88 vs. 65 x 10(9)/L, respectively; P<0.001) and platelets (296 vs. 430 x 10(9)/L, respectively; P<0.001) at diagnosis, indicating a distinct disease phenotype. No significant difference was observed regarding other hematologic features, including spleen size and hematologic adverse events, during imatinib-based therapies. Cumulative molecular response was inferior in e13a2 patients (P=0.002 for major molecular response; P<0.001 for MR4). No difference was observed with regard to cytogenetic response and overall survival. In conclusion, e13a2 and e14a2 chronic myeloid leukemia seem to represent distinct biological entities. However, clinical outcome under imatinib treatment was comparable and no risk prediction can be made according to e13a2 versus e14a2 BCR-ABL1 transcript type at diagnosis.

However, the role of lncRNAs in Bcr-Abl-mediated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in human CML cells using an lncRNA cDNA microarray and identified an lncRNA termed lncRNA-BGL3 that acted as a key regulator of Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation. Notably, we observed that lncRNA-BGL3 was highly induced in response to disruption of Bcr-Abl expression or by inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase activity in K562 cells and leukemic cells derived from CML patients. Ectopic expression of lncRNA-BGL3 sensitized leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis and inhibited Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis. Furthermore, transgenic (TG) mice expressing lncRNA-BGL3 were generated. We found that TG expression of lncRNA-BGL3 alone in mice was sufficient to impair primary bone marrow transformation by Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, we identified that lncRNA-BGL3 was a target of miR-17, miR-93, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a and miR-106b, microRNAs that repress mRNA of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Further experiments demonstrated that lncRNA-BGL3 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA for binding these microRNAs to cross-regulate PTEN expression. Additionally, our experiments have begun to address the mechanism of how lncRNA-BGL3 is regulated in the leukemic cells and showed that Bcr-Abl repressed lncRNA-BGL3 expression through c-Myc-dependent DNA methylation. Taken together, these results reveal that Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation critically requires silence of tumor-suppressor lncRNA-BGL3 and suggest a potential strategy for the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia.","['Guo, G', 'Kang, Q', 'Zhu, X', 'Chen, Q', 'Wang, X', 'Chen, Y', 'Ouyang, J', 'Zhang, L', 'Tan, H', 'Chen, R', 'Huang, S', 'Chen, J-L']","['Guo G', 'Kang Q', 'Zhu X', 'Chen Q', 'Wang X', 'Chen Y', 'Ouyang J', 'Zhang L', 'Tan H', 'Chen R', 'Huang S', 'Chen JL']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.', '1] CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China [2] School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, China.', 'College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Comparative Medical Center, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Center of Oncology and Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, USA.', '1] CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China [2] College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2014/05/20 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2013/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014131 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.131 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Apr 2;34(14):1768-79. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.131.

METHODS: Patients treated with systemic CT alone (Group A), CT plus drainage (Group B), or CT plus pericardial window (Group C) were included. Treatment response was defined as complete response (ie, no more pericardial effusion or masses), partial response (ie, reduced total score, without requiring further treatments), stable disease (ie, unchanged total score), or progressive disease (ie, increased total score). Patients with partial or complete response were considered responders. RESULTS: This preliminary report included 175 patients (56.6% male) with a mean age of 54.21+/-14.26 years. Gender distribution, age, and follow-up duration was similar for all groups (P>.05). Prevalent cancer types were lung cancer (50.9%), breast cancer (14.9%), and lymphoma/leukemia (14.9%). Overall, 22.3%, 42.9%, and 34.9% of patients were in treatment group A, B, and C, respectively. There were 132 responders (75.3%). The rate of responders significantly differed between groups (P<.001); it was significantly higher in Group B than in Group A (P<.05) and in Group C than in Group B (P=.006). The significant factors affecting response were therapy (P=.002) and extent of effusion (P=.037). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients in Group C had a significantly better survival rate than patients in the other groups (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic CT plus pericardial window is a more effective treatment option compared with systemic CT alone and systemic CT plus drainage in patients with malignant effusions.","['Celik, Sezai', 'Lestuzzi, Chiara', 'Cervesato, Eugenio', 'Dequanter, Didier', 'Piotti, Patrizia', 'De Biasio, Marzia', 'Imazio, Massimo']","['Celik S', 'Lestuzzi C', 'Cervesato E', 'Dequanter D', 'Piotti P', 'De Biasio M', 'Imazio M']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Siyami Ersek Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

GM-CSFRalpha was detected on the surface, in the cytosol, and in the nucleus of CLL cells via confocal microscopy, cell fractionation, and GM-CSFRalpha antibody epitope mapping. Because STAT3 is frequently activated in CLL and the GM-CSFRalpha promoter harbors putative STAT3 consensus binding sites, MM1 cells were transfected with truncated forms of the GM-CSFRalpha promoter, then stimulated with IL6 to activate STAT3 and to identify STAT3-binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and an electoromobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed STAT3 occupancy to those promoter regions in both IL6-stimulated MM1 and CLL cells. Transfection of MM1 cells with STAT3-siRNA or CLL cells with STAT3-shRNA significantly downregulated GM-CSFRalpha mRNA and protein levels. RNA transcripts, involved in regulating cell survival pathways, and the proteins KAP1 (TRIM28) and ISG15 coimmunoprecipitated with GM-CSFRalpha. GM-CSFRalpha-bound KAP1 enhanced the transcriptional activity of STAT3, whereas GM-CSFRalpha-bound ISG15 inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway. Nevertheless, overexpression of GM-CSFRalpha protected MM1 cells from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, and GM-CSFRalpha knockdown induced apoptosis in CLL cells, suggesting that GM-CSFRalpha provides a ligand-independent survival advantage. IMPLICATIONS: Constitutively, activation of STAT3 induces the expression of GM-CSFRalpha that protects CLL cells from apoptosis, suggesting that inhibition of STAT3 or GM-CSFRalpha may benefit patients with CLL.","['Li, Ping', 'Harris, David', 'Liu, Zhiming', 'Rozovski, Uri', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wang, Yongtao', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Hazan-Halevy, Inbal', 'Grgurevic, Srdana', 'Wierda, William', 'Burger, Jan', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Keating, Michael', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Li P', 'Harris D', 'Liu Z', 'Rozovski U', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wang Y', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Hazan-Halevy I', 'Grgurevic S', 'Wierda W', 'Burger J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Keating M', 'Estrov Z']","['Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and.', 'Departments of Leukemia and zestrov@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (CSF2RA protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2014/05/20 06:00,2015/06/06 06:00,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-13-0652-T [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0652-T [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2014 Sep;12(9):1267-82. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0652-T.

However, the impact of TP53 mutations in MDS treated with azacitidine (AZA) remains unclear. We analyzed TP53 mutations in 62 patients with high risk MDS or AML treated with AZA. A TP53 mutation was found in 23 patients (37.1%), associated with complex karyotype in 18 (78.3%) of them. TP53 mutations had no significant impact on response or complete response to AZA (p=0.60 and p=0.26, respectively). By univariate analysis, OS was negatively influenced by the presence of TP53 mutation (median OS 12.4 months versus 23.7 months, p<10(-4)), abnormal cytogenetics (median OS 14.4 months vs 33 months, p=0.02) complex cytogenetics (median OS 12.7 months versus 23.7 months, p=0.0005), and a diagnosis of AML (median 14.5 months vs 21.2 months for MDS or CMML, p=0.02). By multivariate analysis, only TP53 mutational status (HR 2.89 (95% confidence interval 1.38-6.04; p=0.005) retained statistical significance for OS. Results were similar when the analysis was restricted to MDS and CMML patients, excluding AML (HR=2.46 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-6.4); p=0.04)). Thus, TP53 mutations strongly correlated with poorer survival in higher risk MDS and AML treated with AZA.","['Bally, Cecile', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Sebert, Marie', 'Eclache, Virginie', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'de The, Hugues', 'Lehmann-Che, Jacqueline', 'Fenaux, Pierre']","['Bally C', 'Ades L', 'Renneville A', 'Sebert M', 'Eclache V', 'Preudhomme C', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'de The H', 'Lehmann-Che J', 'Fenaux P']","['Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Universite Paris 7, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Universite Paris 7, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre de Biologie-Pathologie, CHRU de Lille, France."", 'Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Universite Paris 7, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre de Biologie-Pathologie, CHRU de Lille, France."", 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Cytogenetics, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CNRS UMR7212/INSERM U944, Paris, France; AP-HP, Hopital Saint Louis, 1 avenue Claude Vellfefaux, 75475 Paris, France.', 'Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CNRS UMR7212/INSERM U944, Paris, France; AP-HP, Hopital Saint Louis, 1 avenue Claude Vellfefaux, 75475 Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, Universite Paris 7, France.

The wide application of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) opens the door to study DNA methylation at single CpG site resolution. One challenging question is how best to test for significant methylation differences between groups of biological samples in order to minimize false positive findings. RESULTS: We present a statistical analysis package, methylSig, to analyse genome-wide methylation differences between samples from different treatments or disease groups. MethylSig takes into account both read coverage and biological variation by utilizing a beta-binomial approach across biological samples for a CpG site or region, and identifies relevant differences in CpG methylation. It can also incorporate local information to improve group methylation level and/or variance estimation for experiments with small sample size. A permutation study based on data from enhanced RRBS samples shows that methylSig maintains a well-calibrated type-I error when the number of samples is three or more per group. Our simulations show that methylSig has higher sensitivity compared with several alternative methods. The use of methylSig is illustrated with a comparison of different subtypes of acute leukemia and normal bone marrow samples. AVAILABILITY: methylSig is available as an R package at http://sartorlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/software.

Hematopoietic cells express two highly conserved STAT5-isoforms (STAT5A/STAT5B), and STAT5 is directly activated by JAK2 downstream of several cytokine receptors and the oncogenic BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Using an IL-3-dependent cell line with inducible BCR-ABL-expression we compared STAT5-activation by IL-3 and BCR-ABL in a STAT5-isoform specific manner. RNAi targeting of STAT5B strongly inhibits BCR-ABL-dependent cell proliferation, and STAT5B but not STAT5A is essential for BCL-XL-expression in the presence of BCR-ABL. Although BCR-ABL induces STAT5-tyrosine phosphorylation independent of JAK2-kinase activity, BCR-ABL is less efficient in inducing active STAT5A:STAT5B-heterodimerization than IL-3, leaving constitutive STAT5A and STAT5B-homodimerization unaffected. In comparison to IL-3, nuclear accumulation of a STAT5A-eGFP fusion protein is reduced by BCR-ABL, and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity induces STAT5A-eGFP translocation to the cell membrane and co-localization with the IL-3 receptor. Furthermore, BCR-ABL-dependent phosphorylation of Y682 in STAT5A was detected by mass-spectrometry. Finally, RNAi targeting STAT5B but not STAT5A sensitizes human BCR-ABL-positive cell lines to imatinib-treatment. These data demonstrate differences between IL-3 and BCR-ABL-mediated STAT5-activation and isoform-specific effects, indicating therapeutic options for isoform-specific STAT5-inhibition in BCR-ABL-positive leukemia.","['Schaller-Schonitz, Michael', 'Barzan, David', 'Williamson, Andrew J K', 'Griffiths, John R', 'Dallmann, Iris', 'Battmer, Karin', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Scherr, Michaela', 'Eder, Matthias']","['Schaller-Schonitz M', 'Barzan D', 'Williamson AJ', 'Griffiths JR', 'Dallmann I', 'Battmer K', 'Ganser A', 'Whetton AD', 'Scherr M', 'Eder M']","['Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Lentivirus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines', 'Pyrimidines', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2014/05/20 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0097243 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-49252 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 16;9(5):e97243. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0097243. eCollection 2014.,,20140516,,PMC4023949,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
