But little is known about their direct biological activity. In the present study, we synthesized NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs coated with poly-(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) or poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and investigated their effects in human myeloma and leukemia cells. When these cells were incubated with both types of UCNPs, we found that PAH-UCNPs but not PAA-UCNPs increased the expression of LC3-II, a hallmark of autophagy. This effect was confirmed by the accumulation of LC3 puncta as analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Induction of LC3-II could be blocked by 3-methyl adenosine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor. Consistent with this observation, PAH-UCNPs also inhibited both AKT and mTOR activation, the key step in autophagy activation. Further studies demonstrated that PAH-UCNPs also decreased Bcl-2 but increased Beclin1 and Atg14 expression, suggesting that PAH-UCNPs-induced autophagy was associated with increased PI3KC3-Beclin1 activity. Moreover, PAH-UCNPs induced apoptosis in myeloma cells and enhanced apoptosis induced by bortezomib and doxorubicin, two major anti-myeloma drugs. Therefore, our study suggested that PAH-UCNPs alone can induce both apoptosis and autophagy in human blood cancer cells by modulating the AKT-mTOR and PI3KC3-Beclin1-Atg14 signaling pathways. This study implies the potential application of PAH-UCNPs in blood cancer-cell killing.","['Juan, Jiaxiang', 'Cheng, Liang', 'Shi, Min', 'Liu, Zhuang', 'Mao, Xinliang']","['Juan J', 'Cheng L', 'Shi M', 'Liu Z', 'Mao X']","['Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Translational Research and Therapy for Neuro-psycho-diseases, Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, 215123, China. xinliangmao@suda.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150619,England,J Mater Chem B,Journal of materials chemistry.

Because of the appropriate size, pH sensitivity, and surface targeted modification, this smart nanosized drug system can deliver arsenic trioxide into cancer cells efficiently and exhibits much higher cytotoxicity to a variety of cancer cells than free arsenic trioxide. Moreover, this nanomedicine can further promote the differentiation and inhibit the migration of cancer cells.

In this study, DNA/PEI polyplexes were cross-linked by a reduction-sensitive disulfide bond and then further complexed with electrostatic competitive heparin (HP) and hyaluronidase (HAase)-sensitive hyaluronate (HA) to obtain DNA/PEIS/HA-HP (DPSHA-HP). DPSHA-HP was stable in an extracellular environment (pH = 7.4) and degraded by HAase after targeted HA receptor CD44-mediated cell endocytosis, causing the outer shielding of the nanocomplex to loosen. The resulting partially exposed disulfide-linked DNA/PEI nanocomplexes efficiently ruptured the endosome, facilitating the cleavage of disulfide bonds and the release of DNA/PEI polyplexes into the cytoplasm, where DNA release from the polyplexes was remarkably enhanced due to strong electrostatic competition of HP with PEI. Consequently, DPSHA-HP exhibited excellent DNA transfection of the target cells, better than disulfide cross-linked DNA/PEI (25 kDa) and DNA/PEIS/HA. Moreover, these novel layered nanocomplexes have high efficiency in down-regulating B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1) and exhibit significant inhibition of tumor formation with minimal toxicity in a mouse tumor model.","['Chen, Zhenzhen', 'He, Yuling', 'Zhang, Lifen', 'Li, Yanfeng']","['Chen Z', 'He Y', 'Zhang L', 'Li Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Nonferrous Metals Chemistry and Resources Utilization of Gansu Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China. lfzhang@lzu.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141110,England,J Mater Chem B,Journal of materials chemistry.

Three therapeutic enzymes were selected for this study: acid phosphatase (AcP) which is used for treatment of bone dysplasia; a peroxidase (HRP), used for release of toxic drugs in vivo from their pro-drugs; and asparaginase (ASP) used for starving cancerous leukemia cells. The thermal stability of enzyme@alumina is so high that by heating, for instance, AcP@alumina to 60 degrees C, the enzymatic activity is not only kept, but actually increases, whereas is solution at that temperature there is total denaturation; and cycles of heating-cooling AcP@alumina at that temperature leave it unaffected. An unprecedented increase of six-orders of magnitude in the Arrhenius pre-factor was observed! This indicates the beneficial role of the microporosity in this type of entrapment. This exceedingly high stability is seen also with the other two enzymes: thus, when HRP or ASP are heated in solution to 75 degrees C the activity drops by 65% and 72%, respectively, but when entrapped it drops only by 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively. The thermal stability was studied in detail, by the follow-up of kinetics, by differential scanning calorimetry and by circular dichroism. These techniques indicate that the entrapment shifts the temperatures of denaturation higher by 30-50 degrees C. A special protein-friendly synthetic procedure using ultrasound was developed for the synthesis of these biomaterials. As alumina is already approved for injections (as an adjuvant in vaccinations), these findings highlight the possibility of overcoming the hurdle of the use of sol-gel materials as injectable carriers of therapeutic components.","['Vinogradov, Vladimir V', 'Avnir, David']","['Vinogradov VV', 'Avnir D']","['Institute of Chemistry and the Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91904, Israel. david.avnir@mail.huji.ac.il.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140328,England,J Mater Chem B,Journal of materials chemistry.

For SAR study, five analogues of RT were synthesized and tested for their anti-cancer and Mcl-1- and Bcl-2-targeting effects. Only two of them (TM-(-)-18 and TM-(-)-4a) exerted anti-cancer activities with the loss of Mcl-1 and partly reduced Bcl-2, while the other analogues had no such effects. Specific cyanide and benzene ring parts of RT's structure were identified to be critical for its Mcl-1-targeting activity. Computational molecular docking indicated that RT, TM-(-)-18, and TM-(-)-4a bound to Mcl-1 with high affinity, whereas TM-(-)-45, a compound with a benzene ring but no cyanide for comparison, showed the lowest binding affinity. As Mcl-1 helps cancer cells evading apoptosis, these data encourage further development of RT compounds as well as the design of novel drugs for treating Mcl-1-driven cancers.","['Petsri, Korrakod', 'Yokoya, Masashi', 'Tungsukruthai, Sucharat', 'Rungrotmongkol, Thanyada', 'Nutho, Bodee', 'Vinayanuwattikun, Chanida', 'Saito, Naoki', 'Takehiro, Matsubara', 'Sato, Ryo', 'Chanvorachote, Pithi']","['Petsri K', 'Yokoya M', 'Tungsukruthai S', 'Rungrotmongkol T', 'Nutho B', 'Vinayanuwattikun C', 'Saito N', 'Takehiro M', 'Sato R', 'Chanvorachote P']","['Cell-based Drug and Health Products Development Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Doctor of Philosophy Program in Interdisciplinary Pharmacology, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan.', 'Cell-based Drug and Health Products Development Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Doctor of Philosophy Program in Interdisciplinary Pharmacology, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Structural and Computational Biology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Center of Excellence in Computational Chemistry (CECC), Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan.', 'Cell-based Drug and Health Products Development Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3843-706X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2641-9550', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3103-3249']",['eng'],"['RSA6180036/Thailand Research Fund', '90th Anniversary/Chulalongkorn University', '100th Anniversary/Chulalongkorn University']",['Journal Article'],20200403,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7226000,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'Molecular Docking Analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'apoptosis', 'lung cancer', 'patient-derived primary lung cancer cells', 'renieramycin T']",2020/04/09 06:00,2020/04/09 06:01,['2020/04/09 06:00'],"['2020/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12040875 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12040875 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Apr 3;12(4). pii: cancers12040875. doi: 10.3390/cancers12040875.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nobiletin (NOB), a polymethoxyflavone phytochemical, is present abundantly in citrus peels and has been reported to possess anti-cancer activity. In this study, we investigated the anti-leukemic effects of NOB on cell differentiation and its underlying mechanisms in human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cells. NOB (100 muM) treatment for 24 and 48 h significantly decreased viability of K562 cells to 54.4 +/- 5.3% and 46.2 +/- 9.9%, respectively. NOB (10-100 muM) significantly inhibited cell growth in K562 cells. Flow cytometry analysis and immunoblotting data showed that NOB (40 and 80 muM) could modulate the cell cycle regulators including p21, p27, and cyclin D2, and induce G1 phase arrest. NOB also increased the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of megakaryocytic differentiation markers, such as CD61, CD41, and CD42 as well as the formation of large cells with multi-lobulated nuclei in K562 cells. These results suggested that NOB facilitated K562 cells toward megakaryocytic differentiation. Furthermore, microarray analysis showed that expression of EGR1, a gene associated with promotion of megakaryocytic differentiation, was markedly elevated in NOB-treated K562 cells. The knockdown of EGR1 expression by small interference RNA (siRNA) could significantly attenuate NOB-mediated cell differentiation. We further elucidated that NOB induced EGR1 expression and CD61 expression through increases in MAPK/ERK phosphorylation in K562 cells. These results indicate that NOB promotes megakaryocytic differentiation through the MAPK/ERK pathway-dependent EGR1 expression in human CML cells. In addition, NOB when combined with imatinib could synergistically reduce the viability of K562 cells. Our findings suggest that NOB may serve as a beneficial anti-leukemic agent for differentiation therapy.","['Yen, Jui-Hung', 'Lin, Ching-Yen', 'Chuang, Chin-Hsien', 'Chin, Hsien-Kuo', 'Wu, Ming-Jiuan', 'Chen, Pei-Yi']","['Yen JH', 'Lin CY', 'Chuang CH', 'Chin HK', 'Wu MJ', 'Chen PY']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien 97004, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular, Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, Kaohsiung 80284, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan 71710, Taiwan.', 'Center of Medical Genetics, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien 97004, Taiwan.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2551-350X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3327-828X']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200403,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'D65ILJ7WLY (nobiletin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/*metabolism', 'Flavones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Ontology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",PMC7226785,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*EGR1', '*NOB', '*differentiation therapy', '*megakaryocytic differentiation']",2020/04/09 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/04/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9040877 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9040877 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Apr 3;9(4). pii: cells9040877. doi: 10.3390/cells9040877.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to deliver supportive cytokines, we took advantage of the inherent ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to actively migrate to tumor sites and engineered MSCs to release both IL7 and IL12 to promote homeostatic expansion and Th1 polarization. There is a mutual interaction between engineered MSCs and CAR T cells; in presence of CAR T cell released IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, chronic inflammatory Th2 MSCs shifted towards a Th17/Th1 pattern with IL2 and IL15 release that mutually activated CAR T cells with extended persistence, amplification, killing and protection from activation induced cell death. MSCs releasing IL7 and IL12 were superior over non-modified MSCs in supporting the CAR T cell response and improved the anti-tumor attack in a transplant tumor model.

In vitro drug release kinetics for constructed nanomicelles were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Characterization of the produced nanomicelles was completed using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Uptake of the nanomicelles in K562 cells was investigated using both confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Apoptosis levels as well as the expression of glycoprotein (P-gp) were analyzing by western blotting and flow cytometry. Cellular cytotoxicity resulting from the exposure of nanomicelles was evaluated using MTT assays. The nanomicelles all showed mild release of DOX in PBS solution. In K562/DOX cells, Tf-M-Dox/PSO exhibited higher uptake compared to the other nanomicelles observed. Furthermore, cellular cytotoxicity when exposed to Tf-M-Dox/PSO was 2.8 and 1.6-fold greater than observed in the unmodified DOX and Tf-nanomicelles loaded with DOX alone, respectively. Tf-M-Dox/PSO strongly increased apoptosis of K562/DOX cells. Finally, the reversal of the drug resistance when cells are exposed to Tf-M-DOX/PSO was associated with P-gp expression inhibition.

The regenerated CTLs antigen-specifically suppressed tumor growth in a patient-derived xenograft model of RCC, demonstrating the feasibility of our strategy against solid tumors.","['Kashima, Soki', 'Maeda, Takuya', 'Masuda, Kyoko', 'Nagano, Seiji', 'Inoue, Takamitsu', 'Takeda, Masashi', 'Kono, Yuka', 'Kobayashi, Takashi', 'Saito, Shigeyoshi', 'Higuchi, Takahiro', 'Ichise, Hiroshi', 'Kobayashi, Yuka', 'Iwaisako, Keiko', 'Terada, Koji', 'Agata, Yasutoshi', 'Numakura, Kazuyuki', 'Saito, Mitsuru', 'Narita, Shintaro', 'Yasukawa, Masaki', 'Ogawa, Osamu', 'Habuchi, Tomonori', 'Kawamoto, Hiroshi']","['Kashima S', 'Maeda T', 'Masuda K', 'Nagano S', 'Inoue T', 'Takeda M', 'Kono Y', 'Kobayashi T', 'Saito S', 'Higuchi T', 'Ichise H', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Iwaisako K', 'Terada K', 'Agata Y', 'Numakura K', 'Saito M', 'Narita S', 'Yasukawa M', 'Ogawa O', 'Habuchi T', 'Kawamoto H']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan; Department of Urology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan; Department of Urology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan; Department of Urology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Physics and Engineering, Division of Health Sciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Life Systems, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shiga University of Medical School, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shiga University of Medical School, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinical Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.

Observations: An 11-year old boy with history of B-cell ALL undergoing maintenance therapy presented with a three-month history of intermittent blurry vision and pain in the right eye when a routine lumbar puncture indicated an elevated lymphoblast-predominant white blood cell count. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 42% lymphoblasts, confirming ALL relapse. Ophthalmic imaging demonstrated a hyperemic optic disc, retinal whitening, perivascular sheathing, retinal hemorrhages, and retinal detachment in the right eye. Vitreous fluid biopsy revealed presence of rare atypical lymphoblasts. Chemotherapy, orbital radiation, and systemic prednisone resulted in improvement of visual acuity and retinal hemorrhages, and resolution of retinal detachment. Conclusions and importance: We have described the clinical features, treatment, and response in a case of B-cell ALL relapse with presenting signs of acute retinal necrosis. The uncommon finding in B-cell ALL highlights the possibility of intraocular involvement and the importance of routine ophthalmologic evaluation in leukemia remission.","['Carter, Kaylene L', 'Hassan, Muhammad', 'Do, Diana V', 'Nguyen, Quan Dong']","['Carter KL', 'Hassan M', 'Do DV', 'Nguyen QD']","['Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, 2370 Watson Court Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA, 94303, United States.', 'Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, 2370 Watson Court Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA, 94303, United States.', 'Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, 2370 Watson Court Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA, 94303, United States.', 'Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, 2370 Watson Court Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA, 94303, United States.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200224,United States,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,American journal of ophthalmology case reports,101679941,,,,PMC7125310,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'Retinal necrosis']",2020/04/08 06:00,2020/04/08 06:01,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100629 [doi]', 'S2451-9936(20)30025-6 [pii]', '100629 [pii]']",epublish,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep. 2020 Feb 24;18:100629. doi: 10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100629. eCollection 2020 Jun.,,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some patients have steroid-refractory (SR) GVHD. AIM: To evaluate the effect and safety of ruxolitinib add-on in the treatment of patients with SR acute (a) and chronic (c) GVHD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 38 patients administered ruxolitinib add-on to standard immunosuppressive therapy for SR-aGVHD or SR-cGVHD following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Ruxolitinib was administered 5-10 mg/d depending on disease severity, patient status, and the use of anti-fungal drugs. Overall response rate, time to best response, malignancy relapse rate, infection rate, and treatment-related adverse events were assessed. RESULTS: The analysis included 10 patients with SR-aGVHD (grade III/IV, n = 9) and 28 patients with SR-cGVHD (moderate/severe, n = 24). For the SR-aGVHD and SR-cGVHD groups, respectively: Median number of previous GVHD therapies was 2 (range: 1-3) and 2 (1-4); median follow-up was 2.5 (1.5-4) and 5 (1.5-10) mo; median time to best response was 1 (0.5-2.5) and 3 (1-9.5) mo; and overall response rate was 100% (complete response: 80%) and 82.1% (complete response: 10.7%) with a response observed in all GVHD-affected organs.

Methods: A retrospective study (n = 202) was performed. MRD was detected by RT-PCR and multiparameter flow cytometry. Results: In the total patient group, patients with positive pre-MRD had a higher 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) than that in patients with negative pre-MRD (26.1% vs. 12.1%, P = 0.009); however, the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) (7.4% vs. 15.9%, P = 0.148), probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) (66.3% vs. 71.4%, P = 0.480), and overall survival (OS) (68.8% vs. 76.5%, P = 0.322) were comparable. In the MSDT group, patients with positive pre-MRD had increased 4-year CIR (56.4% vs. 13.8%, P < 0.001) and decreased 4-year LFS (35.9% vs. 71.0%, P = 0.024) and OS (35.9% vs. 77.6%, P = 0.011) compared with those with negative pre-MRD. In haplo-SCT settings, the 4-year CIR (14.8% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.297), NRM (7.3% vs. 16.3%, P = 0.187) and the 4-year probability of OS (77.7% vs. 72.3%, P = 0.804) and LFS (80.5% vs. 75.7%, P = 0.660) were comparable between pre-MRD positive and negative groups. In subgroup patients with positive pre-MRD, haplo-SCT had a lower 4-year CIR (14.8% vs. 56.4%, P = 0.021) and a higher 4-year LFS (77.7% vs. 35.9%, P = 0.036) and OS (80.5% vs. 35.9%, P = 0.027) than those of MSDT. Multivariate analysis showed that haplo-SCT was associated with lower CIR (HR, 0.288; P = 0.031), superior LFS (HR, 0.283; P = 0.019) and OS (HR, 0.252; P = 0.013) in cases with a positive pre-MRD subgroup. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the effects of positive pre-MRD on the outcomes of patients with Ph-positive ALL are different according to transplant modality. For Ph-positive cases with positive pre-MRD, haplo-SCT might have strong graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effects.","['Li, Si-Qi', 'Fan, Qiao-Zhen', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Chen,

However, the in vivo anti-cancer effect of TW-37 in human oral cancer has not been properly studied yet. Here, we attempted to confirm antitumor activity of TW37 in human oral cancer. TW-37 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and increased the number of dead cells in MC-3 and HSC-3 human oral cancer cell lines. TW-37 enhanced apoptosis of both cell lines evidenced by annexin V/propidium iodide double staining, sub-G1 population analysis and the detection of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3. In addition, TW-37 markedly downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 protein, while not affecting Bcl-xL or myeloid cell leukemia-1. In vivo, TW-37 inhibited tumor growth in a nude mice xenograft model without any significant liver and kidney toxicities. Collectively, these data reveal that TW-37 may be a promising small molecule to inhibit human oral cancer.","['Ahn, Chi-Hyun', 'Lee, Won Woo', 'Jung, Yun Chan', 'Shin, Ji-Ae', 'Hong, Kyoung-Ok', 'Choi, Sujung', 'Swarup, Neeti', 'Kim, Jihoon', 'Ahn, Min-Hye', 'Jung, Minjung', 'Cho, Sung-Dae', 'Jin, Bohwan']","['Ahn CH', 'Lee WW', 'Jung YC', 'Shin JA', 'Hong KO', 'Choi S', 'Swarup N', 'Kim J', 'Ahn MH', 'Jung M', 'Cho SD', 'Jin B']","['1Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 03080 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', '2Laboratory Animal Center, CHA University, CHA Biocomplex, Sampyeong-dong, Seongnam, 13488 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0647 3511grid.410886.3', 'Chaon, 301-3, 240, Pangyoyeok-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam, 13493 Republic of Korea.', '1Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 03080 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', '1Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 03080 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', '1Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 03080 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', '1Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 03080 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', '1Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 03080 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', '1Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 03080 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', '1Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 03080 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', '1Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 03080 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0470 5905grid.31501.36', '2Laboratory Animal Center, CHA University, CHA Biocomplex, Sampyeong-dong, Seongnam, 13488 Republic of Korea.0000 0004 0647 3511grid.410886.3']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8670-9579'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191204,England,Lab Anim Res,Laboratory animal research,101560684,,,,PMC7081630,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bcl-2', 'Oral cancer', 'TW-37']",2020/04/08 06:00,2020/04/08 06:01,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2019/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s42826-019-0028-7 [doi]', '28 [pii]']",epublish,Lab Anim Res. 2019 Dec 4;35:27. doi: 10.1186/s42826-019-0028-7. eCollection 2019.,,['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We discontinued nilotinib and started afatinib. Although partial response of lung adenocarcinoma was achieved, cytogenetic relapse of CML was observed following nilotinib discontinuation. We applied the previously described framework of cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated oral drug-drug interactions and selected gefitinib and nilotinib to treat both malignancies. We effectively and safely administered this combination for seven months. The present report is the first to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of dual EGFR and ABL TKI treatment in a patient with concomitant EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma and CML.","['Watanabe, Kousuke', 'Kage, Hidenori', 'Nagoshi, Saki', 'Toyama, Kazuhiro', 'Ohno, Yoshiyuki', 'Shinozaki-Ushiku, Aya', 'Nakazaki, Kumi', 'Suzuki, Hiroshi', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Nagase, Takahide']","['Watanabe K', 'Kage H', 'Nagoshi S', 'Toyama K', 'Ohno Y', 'Shinozaki-Ushiku A', 'Nakazaki K', 'Suzuki H', 'Kurokawa M', 'Nagase T']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4670-3679', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3658-4442']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200319,United States,Case Rep Oncol Med,Case reports in oncological medicine,101581035,,,,PMC7106872,,,,2020/04/08 06:00,2020/04/08 06:01,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/4201727 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Oncol Med. 2020 Mar 19;2020:4201727. doi: 10.1155/2020/4201727. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Kousuke Watanabe et al.'],,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, there is a lack of therapeutic gene targets and diagnostic biomarkers for the effective treatment of AML. The present study aimed to identify candidate biomarkers correlated with the clinical prognosis of patients with AML. Leukemic cells from 5 patients with AML exhibiting a normal karyotype, and hematopoietic cells from 5 healthy donors were processed for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and the obtained RNA expression profiles were subjected to weighted gene correlation network analysis. A novel group of genes (the red module) were identified to be significantly associated with AML, and this module contained a closely connected network with 147 nodes, which corresponded to 114 mRNAs. Analysis of the correlation between these mRNAs and blast cell percentage, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) using cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed that CSF3R, ALPL and LMTK2 were negatively associated with the percentage of blast cells, while high expression of these genes was associated with longer OS and DFS in patients with AML. The differential expression of these three genes between patients with AML and healthy control subjects was supported using the Genotype-Tissue Expression and TCGA databases and was further confirmed using reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-qPCR). These genes exhibited significantly lower expression in patients with AML compared with control subjects. The results indicated that CSF3R, ALPL and LMTK2 exhibit the potential to be prognostic biomarkers. However, the biological functions of these three candidate genes need to be assessed in further studies.","['Pan, Yuming', 'Zhang, Qiaoxia', 'Deng, Xiaopeng', 'An, Na', 'Du, Xin', 'Liu, Jiajun']","['Pan Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Deng X', 'An N', 'Du X', 'Liu J']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, P.R.

In particular, MSI has been associated with the active immune checkpoint blockade therapy response in cancer. Most of computational methods for predicting MSI are based on DNA sequencing data and a few are based on mRNA expression data. Using the RNA-Seq pan-cancer datasets for three cancer cohorts (colon, gastric, and endometrial cancers) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, we developed an algorithm (PreMSIm) for predicting MSI from the expression profiling of a 15-gene panel in cancer. We demonstrated that PreMSIm had high prediction performance in predicting MSI in most cases using both RNA-Seq and microarray gene expression datasets. Moreover, PreMSIm displayed superior or comparable performance versus other DNA or mRNA-based methods. We conclude that PreMSIm has the potential to provide an alternative approach for identifying MSI in cancer.","['Li, Lin', 'Feng, Qiushi', 'Wang, Xiaosheng']","['Li L', 'Feng Q', 'Wang X']","['Biomedical Informatics Research Lab, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Center, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Big Data Research Institute, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Biomedical Informatics Research Lab, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Center, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Big Data Research Institute, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Biomedical Informatics Research Lab, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Center, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.', 'Big Data Research Institute, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200319,Netherlands,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369,,,,PMC7113609,,['NOTNLM'],"['ACC, adrenocortical carcinoma', 'AUC, area under the curve', 'Algorithm', 'BLCA, bladder urothelial carcinoma', 'BRCA, breast invasive carcinoma', 'CESC, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma', 'CHOL, cholangiocarcinoma', 'COAD, colon adenocarcinoma', 'CV, cross validation', 'Cancer', 'Classification', 'DLBC, lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'ESCA, esophageal carcinoma', 'GBM, glioblastoma multiforme', 'GEO, Gene Expression Omnibus', 'GO, gene ontology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'HNSC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma', 'KICH, kidney chromophobe', 'KIRC, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma', 'KIRP, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma', 'LAML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'LGG, brain lower grade glioma', 'LIHC, liver hepatocellular carcinoma', 'LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma', 'LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma', 'MESO, mesothelioma', 'MSI, microsatellite instability', 'MSS, microsatellite stability', 'Machine learning', 'Microsatellite instability', 'OV, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma', 'PAAD, pancreatic adenocarcinoma', 'PCPG, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma', 'PPI, protein-protein interaction', 'PRAD, prostate adenocarcinoma', 'READ, rectum adenocarcinoma', 'RF, random forest', 'ROC, receiver operating characteristic', 'SARC, sarcoma', 'SKCM, skin cutaneous melanoma', 'STAD, stomach adenocarcinoma', 'SVM, support vector machine', 'TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'TGCT, testicular germ cell tumors', 'THCA, thyroid carcinoma', 'THYM, thymoma', 'UCEC, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma', 'UCS, uterine carcinosarcoma', 'UVM, uveal melanoma', 'XGBoost, extreme gradient boosting', 'k-NN, k-nearest neighbor']",2020/04/08 06:00,2020/04/08 06:01,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2019/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.007 [doi]', 'S2001-0370(19)30544-6 [pii]']",epublish,Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2020 Mar 19;18:668-675. doi: 10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.007. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Successful treatment requires initial high-intensity chemotherapy, followed by low-intensity oral maintenance therapy with oral 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX) until 2-3 years after disease onset. However, intra- and inter-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 6MP and MTX make it challenging to balance the desired antileukemic effects with undesired excessive myelosuppression during maintenance therapy. A model to simulate the dynamics of different cell types, especially neutrophils, would be a valuable contribution to improving treatment protocols (6MP and MTX dosing regimens) and a further step to understanding the heterogeneity in treatment efficacy and toxicity. We applied and modified a recently developed semi-mechanistic PK/PD model to neutrophils and analyzed their behavior using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach and clinical data obtained from 116 patients. The PK model of 6MP influenced the accuracy of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) predictions, whereas the PD effect of MTX did not. Predictions based on ANC were more accurate than those based on white blood cell counts. Using the new cross-validated mathematical model, simulations of different treatment protocols showed a linear dose-effect relationship and reduced ANC variability for constant dosages. Advanced modeling allows the identification of optimized control criteria and the weighting of specific influencing factors for protocol design and individually adapted therapy to exploit the optimal effect of maintenance therapy on survival.","['Jost, Felix', 'Zierk, Jakob', 'Le, Thuy T T', 'Raupach, Thomas', 'Rauh, Manfred', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Metzler, Markus', 'Sager, Sebastian']","['Jost F', 'Zierk J', 'Le TTT', 'Raupach T', 'Rauh M', 'Suttorp M', 'Stanulla M', 'Metzler M', 'Sager S']","['Department of Mathematics, Institute of Mathematical Optimization, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Mathematics, Institute of Mathematical Optimization, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hanover, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Mathematics, Institute of Mathematical Optimization, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Health Campus ""Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation (GC-I3)"", Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200318,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,,PMC7093595,,['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'maintenance therapy', 'methotrexate', 'neutropenia', 'non-linear mixed-effects modeling', 'population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics']",2020/04/08 06:00,2020/04/08 06:01,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2020.00217 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2020 Mar 18;11:217. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2020.00217. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Jost, Zierk, Le, Raupach, Rauh, Suttorp, Stanulla, Metzler and', 'Sager.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acalabrutinib, a second-generation Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, was recently FDA approved for treatment of treatment naive and relapsed refractory CLL. Acalabrutinib was designed as a more selective BTK inhibitor as compared to ibrutinib in an attempt to mitigate some of the treatment limiting toxicities seen with ibrutinib such as atrial fibrillation and bleeding. In preclinical studies, acalabrutinib was demonstrated to have efficacy in CLL in both patient blood samples and murine models. A multinational phase 1/2 study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib monotherapy in treatment naive, relapsed refractory and ibrutinib-intolerant CLL patients.

This leads to a densely ionizing radiation track over a short path. Localized radiation induces cytotoxic, difficult-to-repair, clustered DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). To date, radium-223 ((223)Ra) is the only TAT approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Thorium-227 ((227)Th), the progenitor nuclide of (223)Ra, offers promise as a wider-ranging alternative due to the availability of efficient chelators, such as octadentate 3,2-hydroxypyridinone (3,2-HOPO). The 3,2-HOPO chelator can be readily conjugated to a range of targeting moieties, enabling the generation of new targeted thorium-227 conjugates (TTCs). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the advances in the preclinical development of TTCs for hematological cancers, including CD22-positive B cell cancers and CD33-positive leukemia, as well as for solid tumors overexpressing renal cell cancer antigen CD70, membrane-anchored glycoprotein mesothelin in mesothelioma, prostate-specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. As the mechanism of action for TTCs is linked to the formation of DSBs, the authors also report data supporting combinations of TTCs with inhibitors of the DNA damage response pathways, including those of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein, and poly-ADP ribose polymerase. Finally, emerging evidence suggests that TTCs induce immunogenic cell death through the release of danger-associated molecular patterns. Based on encouraging preclinical data, clinical studies have been initiated to investigate the safety and tolerability of TTCs in patients with various cancers.","['Hagemann, Urs B', 'Wickstroem, Katrine', 'Hammer, Stefanie', 'Bjerke, Roger M', 'Zitzmann-Kolbe, Sabine', 'Ryan, Olav B', 'Karlsson, Jenny', 'Scholz, Arne', 'Hennekes, Hartwig', 'Mumberg, Dominik', 'Cuthbertson, Alan S']","['Hagemann UB', 'Wickstroem K', 'Hammer S', 'Bjerke RM', 'Zitzmann-Kolbe S', 'Ryan OB', 'Karlsson J', 'Scholz A', 'Hennekes H', 'Mumberg D', 'Cuthbertson AS']","['Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AS, Oslo, Norway.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AS, Oslo, Norway.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AS, Oslo, Norway.', 'Bayer AS, Oslo, Norway.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AS, Oslo, Norway.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200407,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (3,2-hydroxypyridinone)', '0 (Alarmins)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Thorium-227)', '60YU5MIG9W (Thorium)']",IM,"['Alarmins/metabolism', 'Alpha Particles/*therapeutic use', 'Chelating Agents/chemistry', 'DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Immunogenic Cell Death/radiation effects', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'Pyridones/chemistry', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thorium/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7475103,,['NOTNLM'],"['227Th', 'conjugate', 'precision oncology', 'targeted alpha therapy']",2020/04/08 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.2020.3568 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2020 Sep;35(7):497-510. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2020.3568.

The total amount of 122 samples-including 37 air (bioaerosol), 40 surface, and 45 milk samples-were checked for the presence of BLV and BAdV genomes using RT-qPCR/qPCR method. The study showed that the viruses were present in 7 air (among them 71.4% were BLV-positive and 28.6% were BAdV-positive), 14 surface (among them 85.7% were BLV-positive and 14.3% were BAdV-positive), and 34 milk (all were BLV-positive only) samples. Statistical analysis revealed that both the air and surfaces in studied occupational environment were more frequently contaminated with BLV than with BAdV (Chi-square test: p = 0.002, Fisher's Exact test: p = 0.002). Kruskal-Wallis tests showed significant differences in BLV genome concentrations in the air (p = 0.045) as well as in BLV and BAdV genome concentrations on surfaces (p = 0.005 and p = 0.040, respectively) between studied processing areas. In units of genome copies (gc) per area, the highest concentrations of BLV and BAdV genomes in the air (9.8 x 10(1) +/- 1.14 x 10(2) gc/m(3) and 5.4 x 10(1) +/- 9.1 x 10(1) gc/m(3), respectively) and on surfaces (9.83 x 10(2) +/- 7.41 x 10(2) gc/100cm(2) and 2.30 x 10(2) +/- 3.8 x 10(2) gc/100cm(2), respectively) were observed in milk reception area. The air and surfaces of pre-production zones were also significantly more contaminated with BAdV genomes compared to production areas (Mann-Whitney test: p = 0.039 and p = 0.029, respectively). This study showed that dairy workers may be exposed to bovine viruses through the inhalation of bioaerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces. To reduce the probability of virus transmission from the raw milk to humans, efficient surface cleaning procedures degrading viral particles should be introduced and the use of personal protection equipment, especially within pre-production zones, should be required. As the raw milk may be a source of bovine viruses, the development of strategies for both the control and eradication of BLV and BAdV among cattle seems to be also urgently needed.","['Stobnicka-Kupiec, Agata', 'Golofit-Szymczak, Malgorzata', 'Gorny, Rafal L', 'Cyprowski, Marcin']","['Stobnicka-Kupiec A', 'Golofit-Szymczak M', 'Gorny RL', 'Cyprowski M']","['Central Institute for Labour Protection - National Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Central Institute for Labour Protection - National Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Central Institute for Labour Protection - National Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Central Institute for Labour Protection - National Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200407,England,J Occup Environ Hyg,Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,101189458,"['0 (Aerosols)', '0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Aerosols', 'Air Microbiology', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/analysis', 'Animals', 'Cattle', '*Dairying', 'Female', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Milk/*virology', 'Occupational Exposure/analysis', 'Prevalence']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bioaerosol', '*PCR', '*bovine adenovirus', '*bovine leukemia virus', '*dairy', '*surface']",2020/04/08 06:00,2021/03/17 06:00,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15459624.2020.1742914 [doi]'],ppublish,J Occup Environ Hyg. 2020 Jun;17(6):312-323. doi: 10.1080/15459624.2020.1742914.

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 68 AML patients, including 48 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 20 patients with complete response (CR), and 30 patients with iron deficiency anemia (control group). LncRNA BLACAT1 was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of BLACAT1 and its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of lncRNA BLACAT1 in AML patients was significantly higher than that in complete remission patients and iron deficiency anemia patients, but the expression of lncRNA BLACAT1 in AML-CR group and control group had no significant difference. Further study showed that the expression of lncRNA BLACAT1 was correlated with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk classification, the amount of platelet and bone marrow primordial cells (%), and survival status of patients. The median overall survival time of patients with high expression of lncRNA BLACAT1 was significantly shorter than those with low expression of lncRNA BLACAT1 (p < 0.05).

Though effective in the treatment of leukaemia, arsenic trioxide has not been able to be introduced into the treatment of solid tumour entities yet due to its dose-limiting toxicity. However, different in vitro and in vivo studies revealed arsenic trioxide to be a potent agent against different solid tumour entities, including atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours (ATRT), a paediatric brain tumour entity with a very poor prognosis. To improve the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of arsenic trioxide and to reduce its toxic side effects, we propose to use a metal-organic framework (MOF) as a drug carrier material. Herein we report on using a MOF called MFU-4l (Metal-Organic Framework Ulm University), consisting of Zn(ii) ions and bis(1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b],[4',5'-i])dibenzo[1,4]dioxin ligands, to deliver arsenic trioxide in a form of dihydrogen arsenite anions. The H2AsO3 (-) anions were introduced to the MOF in a nanoparticle formulation via a postsynthetic side ligand exchange. The prepared material was characterised by IR, TGA, XRPD, SEM-EDX, TEM, DLS, ICP-OES and adsorption analysis. The drug release studies at different pH values were carried out as well as cytotoxicity tests with different ATRT cell lines and non-tumorous-control cell lines. The MOF-based material was shown to be a promising candidate for arsenic trioxide drug delivery.","['Ettlinger, Romy', 'Sonksen, Marthe', 'Graf, Monika', 'Moreno, Natalia', 'Denysenko, Dmytro', 'Volkmer, Dirk', 'Kerl, Kornelius', 'Bunzen, Hana']","['Ettlinger R', 'Sonksen M', 'Graf M', 'Moreno N', 'Denysenko D', 'Volkmer D', 'Kerl K', 'Bunzen H']","['Chair of Solid State and Materials Chemistry, Institute of Physics, University of Augsburg, Universitatsstrasse 1, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany. hana.bunzen@physik.uni-augsburg.de.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180924,England,J Mater Chem B,Journal of materials chemistry.

In this study, rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell membrane coated silica particles (RBL-2H3/CMCSPs) were fabricated by irreversible adsorption between the cell membrane and silica and self-fusion of the cell membrane, which could simulate drug-receptor interactions in vitro. Also, benefiting from the use of paraformaldehyde, the average recoveries of the six batches of RBL/CMCSPs were 90.2% with a relative standard deviation of less than 7.8%, showing that the stability of the materials was remarkably improved compared to materials without fixation. After the successful characterization by spectroscopic and imaging instruments, the prepared RBL-2H3/CMCSPs exhibited desirable adsorption capacity and selectivity. The RBL-2H3/CMCSPs combined with high performance liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry were then successfully applied to screen and identify two potential allergenic components from huangqi injection, the allergenic activities of which were further investigated by beta-hexosaminidase release assay and histamine release assay in vitro. Overall, this work provides a good platform for the fabrication of bioaffinity sample pretreatment materials with high stability and a long lifespan, which can be a time-saving and energy-saving bioaffinity method to rapidly screen and preconcentrate target compounds from complex samples.","['Bu, Yusi', 'Hu, Qi', 'Xu, Ke', 'Xie, Xiaoyu', 'Wang, Sicen']","['Bu Y', 'Hu Q', 'Xu K', 'Xie X', 'Wang S']","[""School of Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, China. xiexiaoyu@xjtu.edu.cn wangsc@mail.xjtu.edu.cn.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180110,England,J Mater Chem B,Journal of materials chemistry.

In previous studies which compared outcomes associated with nilotinib or imatinib treatment, nilotinib achieved a higher rate of deep molecular response (MR). We conducted a phase II, open-label, multicenter study to investigate an intrapatient nilotinib dose-escalation strategy for patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase (CP) CML based on early MR(4.5) achievement. The primary study endpoint was achievement of MR(4.5) by 24 months following the initiation of nilotinib 300 mg BID. Fifty-three patients were enrolled, 51 received nilotinib, and 37 completed the treatment. An increase in the nilotinib dose (to 400 mg BID) was allowed when patients satisfied our criteria for no optimal response at any time point. The median (range) dose intensity was 600 (207-736) mg/day. Of 46 evaluable patients, 18 achieved an optimal response and 28 did not. Of the latter, nine patients underwent dose escalation to 400 mg BID, and none achieved MR(4.5) .

Therapeutic approaches for previously untreated CLL/SLL patients are changing from chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) to molecularly targeted drugs. The aim of therapy for CLL patients has been to control the disease; however, FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) has improved outcomes and reduced the high incidence of undetectable minimum/measurable residual disease (MRD) in previously untreated CLL patients with no 17p deletion/TP53 disruption and mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGHV). Patients achieving undetectable MRD in the bone marrow are expected to be cured. BTK inhibitors and BCL-2 inhibitors are effective for CLL/SLL patients. However, atrial fibrillation and bleeding are associated with the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, while tumor lysis syndrome is an adverse event (AE) of the BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. Although these novel targeted drugs are very useful, they are also expensive. Emergence of resistant clones of CLL cells must also be addressed. Therefore, treatments of indefinite duration until progression have been replaced by fixed-duration treatments. This review introduces advances in the treatment of previously untreated CLL/SLL patients in Europe and the United States.","['Suzumiya, Junji', 'Takizawa, Jun']","['Suzumiya J', 'Takizawa J']","['Innovative Cancer Center/Oncology-Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, 89-1 Enya, Izumo, Shimane, 693-8501, Japan. suzumiya@med.shimane-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Koga community hospital, 2-30-1 Daikakuji, Yaizu, Shizuoka, 425-0088, Japan. suzumiya@med.shimane-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Grant/Kyowa Hakko Kirin', 'Grant/Chugai Pharmaceutical', 'Grant/Astellas Pharma', 'Grant/Eisai', 'Grant/Takeda Pharmaceutical Company', 'Grant/Celgene', 'Grant/AstraZeneca', 'Grant/Shin-Nihon Kagaku', 'Grant/Sanofi', 'Grant/Ono Pharmaceutical', 'Grant/Nippon Shinyaku', 'Grant/Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma', 'Grant/Mochida Pharmaceutical Company', 'Grant/Daiichi-Sankyo', 'Grant/MSD K.K.']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200406,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Atrial Fibrillation/chemically induced', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Japan', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*prevention & control', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2 inhibitors', 'BTK inhibitors', 'CLL', 'MRD']",2020/04/08 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02867-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02867-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 May;111(5):642-656. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02867-0.

The clinical impact of TdT expression on AML outcomes remains unclear. Here, we conducted a retrospective analysis to identify prognostic implications of TdT expression in AML with an intermediate-risk karyotype. Forty-eight cases of intermediate-risk AML were enrolled. TdT positivity was defined as expression on >/= 10% of the gated cells. Of 48 cases, 12 (25%) were positive for TdT [median expression rate of TdT 0.9% (range 0-86.9%)]. No significant differences in patient characteristics or complete remission rate were observed between TdT-positive and TdT-negative cases. The probability of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 1 year was not significantly different between TdT-positive and TdT-negative cases (OS: 58.3% vs. 65.2%, p = 0.32; EFS: 33.3% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.06). Relapse-free survival (RFS) probability at 1 year was significantly lower for TdT-positive than TdT-negative cases (10% vs. 71.3%, p = 0.002). Multivariate analyses revealed that TdT positivity was an independent significant adverse factor for RFS [hazard ratio: 3.309, 95% confidence interval: 1.334-8.209, p = 0.009]. Our results suggest that TdT expression is associated with increased risk of relapse in patients with intermediate-risk AML.","['Saburi, Masuho', 'Ogata, Masao', 'Satou, Takako', 'Soga, Yasuhiro', 'Itani, Kazuhito', 'Kohno, Kazuhiro', 'Kondo, Yoshiyuki', 'Nakayama, Toshiyuki']","['Saburi M', 'Ogata M', 'Satou T', 'Soga Y', 'Itani K', 'Kohno K', 'Kondo Y', 'Nakayama T']","['Department of Hematology, Oita Kouseiren Tsurumi Hospital, Oita, Japan. masuho-saburi@oita-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, 1-1 Hasama Idaigaoka, Yuhu City, Oita, 879-5593, Japan. masuho-saburi@oita-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Oita University Hospital, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Oita Kouseiren Tsurumi Hospital, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Oita Kouseiren Tsurumi Hospital, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oita Kouseiren Tsurumi Hospital, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oita Kouseiren Tsurumi Hospital, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Oita Kouseiren Tsurumi Hospital, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oita Kouseiren Tsurumi Hospital, Oita, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200406,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', '*Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Intermediate-risk karyotype', 'Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase']",2020/04/08 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2019/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02871-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02871-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Jul;112(1):17-23. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02871-4.

Aberrant expression and/or altered separase proteolytic activity are associated with aneuploidy, tumorigenesis, and disease progression. Since genomic instability and clonal evolution are hallmarks of progressing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we have comparatively examined separase proteolytic activity in TKI-treated chronic phase CML. Separase proteolytic activity was analyzed on single cell level in 88 clinical samples and in 14 healthy controls by a flow cytometric assay. In parallel, BCR-ABL1 gene expression and replication fork velocity were measured by qRT-PCR and DNA fiber assays, respectively. The separase activity distribution (SAD) value indicating the occurrence of MNCs with elevated separase proteolytic activity within samples was found to positively correlate with BCR-ABL1 gene expression levels and loss of MMR (relapse) throughout routine BCR-ABL1 monitoring. Analyses of CD34(+) cells and MNCs fractionized by flow cytometric cell sorting according to their separase activity levels (H- and L-fractions) revealed that CD34(+) cells with elevated separase activity levels (H-fractions) displayed enhanced proliferation/viability when compared with cells with regular (L-fraction) separase activity (mean 3.3-fold, p = 0.0011). BCR-ABL1 gene expression positivity prevailed in MNC H-fractions over L-fractions (42% vs. 8%, respectively). Moreover, expanding CD34(+) cells of H-fractions showed decreased replication fork velocity compared with cells of L-fractions (p < 0.0001). Our data suggests an association between high separase activity, residual BCR-ABL1 gene expression, and enhanced proliferative capacity in hematopoietic cells within the leukemic niche of TKI-treated chronic phase CML.","['Spiess, Birgit', 'Kleiner, Helga', 'Flach, Johanna', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Seifarth, Wolfgang']","['Spiess B', 'Kleiner H', 'Flach J', 'Fabarius A', 'Saussele S', 'Hofmann WK', 'Seifarth W']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany. birgit.spiess@medma.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'Hamatologie und Onkologie, III.

Prognosis of MDS patients can be assessed by various scoring systems, the most common being the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) now refined by the revised version (IPSS-R). Genomic information at baseline, that is currently not included in clinical prognostic scores, will, in the future, help us to stratify patients with various prognoses. Therapy of MDS is based on risk stratification. The aim of therapy in low-risk MDS is to improve anemia or thrombocytopenia, decrease transfusion needs, improve quality of life, attempt to prolong overall survival, and reduce the risk of progression. In higher-risk MDS, the goal of therapy is to prolong survival and reduce the risk of transformation into acute leukemia. Only a few drugs are currently available for treatment, but more drugs are now under clinical investigation, in line with new, recently discovered molecular and immunological pathways. This review describes potential new drugs for low and high-risk MDS. The increasing knowledge of immunological and signalling pathways in MDS will assist us in identifying targeted patient-oriented treatments. In the near future, initial molecular stratification will lead the way to a personalized approach and targeted therapy.","['Scalzulli, Emilia', 'Pepe, Sara', 'Colafigli, Gioia', 'Breccia, Massimo']","['Scalzulli E', 'Pepe S', 'Colafigli G', 'Breccia M']","['Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Az.

We design the turn-off sensor by using the different electrochemical patterns of liposomes to the detection of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Our design is first sandwiched by lectin liposome which increases the electrochemical exchange on the electrode. With the addition of Molt-4 cells, the bonding connection between the n-glycan and lectin can also increase the electrochemical exchange with the high detection cells. Subsequently, the addition of boronic acid liposomes decreases the resistance due to covering glycosylation bond and the sensor is turn-off.

Studies regarding the detection of LSCs and the development of novel therapies for targeting them are extensive. The identification of LSCs and targeting therapies for them has been continuously under investigation. METHODS: We examined the levels of CD45(dim)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD133(+) cells in bone marrow samples from patients with hematological malignancies and healthy controls, using four-color flow cytometry. RESULTS: Interestingly, the CD45(dim)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD133(+) cells were highly expressed in the bone marrow of patients with AML compared to that in healthy controls (HC). Moreover, the proportions of CD45(dim)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD133(+) cells were also examined in diverse hematological malignancies, including AML, CML, DLBCL, MM, MDS, HL, ALL, and CLL. LSCs were prominently detected in the BMCs isolated from patients with AML and CML, but rarely in BMCs isolated from patients with DLBCL, MM, MDS, ALL, CLL, and HL. Additionally, the high CD45(dim)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD133(+) cell counts in AML patients served as a significantly poor risk factor for overall and event free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our results suggest that CD45(dim)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD133(+) cells in AML might potentially serve as LSCs. In addition, this cell population might represent a novel therapeutic target in AML.","['Heo, Sook-Kyoung', 'Noh, Eui-Kyu', 'Ju, Lan Jeong', 'Sung, Jun Young', 'Jeong, Yoo Kyung', 'Cheon, Jaekyung', 'Koh, Su Jin', 'Min, Young Joo', 'Choi, Yunsuk', 'Jo, Jae-Cheol']","['Heo SK', 'Noh EK', 'Ju LJ', 'Sung JY', 'Jeong YK', 'Cheon J', 'Koh SJ', 'Min YJ', 'Choi Y', 'Jo JC']","['Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea. choiysmd@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea. choiysmd@gmail.com.', 'Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea. jcjo97@hanmail.net.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 877 Bangeojinsunhwan-doro, Dong-gu, Ulsan, 44033, Republic of Korea. jcjo97@hanmail.net.']",,['eng'],"['NRF-2017R1A1A3A04069314/National Research Foundation of Korea', 'HI17C0904/Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea', 'UUH-2019-06/Ulsan University Hospital Research Grant', 'UUHBRC-2016-001/Ulsan University Hospital']",['Journal Article'],20200406,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen/*metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7137473,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CD45dimCD34+CD38-CD133+ cells', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemic stem cells', 'Prognosis']",2020/04/08 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2019/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-06760-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-06760-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Apr 6;20(1):285. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-06760-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPS8 stood out among the derivatives, showing cytotoxic selectivity between leukemic cell lines and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (about ten times). DAPI nuclear staining and H&E staining revealed DNA fragmentation under the action of SPS8. SPS8 induced an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels and mitochondrial stress in HL-60 cells identified by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination, and altered expressions of Bcl-2 family proteins. SPS8 also induced autophagy through the detection of Atg5, beclin-1, and LC3 II protein expression, as well as TEM examination. Chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, promoted SPS8-induced apoptosis, suggesting the cytoprotective role of autophagy in hindering SPS8 from apoptosis. Furthermore, SPS8 was shown to alter the expressions of a variety of genes using a microarray analysis and volcano plot filtering. A further cellular signaling pathways analysis suggested that SPS8 induced several cellular processes in HL-60, including the sterol biosynthesis process and cholesterol biosynthesis process, and inhibited some cellular pathways, in which STAT3 was the most critical nuclear factor. Further identification revealed that SPS8 inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3, representing the loss of cytoprotective activity. In conclusion, the data suggest that SPS8 induces both apoptosis and autophagy in leukemic cells, in which autophagy plays a cytoprotective role in impeding apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation may support SPS8-induced anti-leukemic activity.","['Chan, She-Hung', 'Leu, Wohn-Jenn', 'Swain, Sharada Prasanna', 'Hsu, Jui-Ling', 'Hou, Duen-Ren', 'Guh, Jih-Hwa']","['Chan SH', 'Leu WJ', 'Swain SP', 'Hsu JL', 'Hou DR', 'Guh JH']","['Department of Cosmetic Science, Providence University, 200, Sec. 7, Taiwan Boulevard, Shalu Dist., Taichung 43301, Taiwan.', 'School of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, No.33, Linsen S.

Endocrine disorders are highly prevalent in children with ALL, and skeletal morbidity is a major issue induced by multiple factors associated with ALL. Leukemia itself is a predominant risk factor for decreased bone formation, and major bone destruction occurs secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. Glucocorticoids are cornerstone drugs used throughout the course of ALL treatment that exert significant effects on demineralization and osteoclastogenesis. After completion of treatment, ALL survivors are prone to multiple hormone deficiencies that eventually affect bone mineral accrual. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, the most widely used method of measuring bone mineral density, is used to determine the presence of childhood osteoporosis and vertebral fracture. Supplementation with calcium and vitamin D, administration of pyrophosphate analogues, and promotion of mobility and exercise are effective options to prevent further bone resorption and fracture incidence. This review focuses on addressing bone morbidity after pediatric ALL treatment and provides an overview of bone pathology based on skeletal outcomes to increase awareness among pediatric hemato-oncologists and endocrinologists.","['Ahn, Moon Bae', 'Suh, Byung-Kyu']","['Ahn MB', 'Suh BK']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200331,Korea (South),Ann Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Annals of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism,101588279,,,,PMC7136509,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone mineral density', 'Osteoporosis', 'Vertebral fracture', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/04/08 06:00,2020/04/08 06:01,['2020/04/08 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/08 06:01 [medline]']","['apem.2020.25.1.1 [pii]', '10.6065/apem.2020.25.1.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2020 Mar;25(1):1-9. doi: 10.6065/apem.2020.25.1.1.

Similar to 2,4-dinitrophenol, the weight-loss effect of UA is assumed to be associated with its protonophoric uncoupling activity. Recently, we have shown that the ability of UA to shuttle protons across both mitochondrial and artificial membranes is strongly modulated by the presence of calcium ions in the medium. Here, by using fluorescent probes, we studied the calcium-transporting capacity of usnic acid in a variety of membrane systems comprising liposomes, isolated rat liver mitochondria, erythrocytes and rat basophilic leukemia cell culture (RBL-2H3). At concentrations of tens of micromoles, UA appeared to be able to carry calcium ions across membranes in all the systems studied. Similar to the calcium ionophore A23187, UA caused degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells. Therefore, UA, being a protonophoric uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, at higher concentrations manifests itself as a calcium ionophore, which could be relevant to its overdose toxicity in humans and also its phytotoxicity.","['Chelombitko, Maria A', 'Firsov, Alexander M', 'Kotova, Elena A', 'Rokitskaya, Tatyana I', 'Khailova, Ljudmila S', 'Popova, Lyudmila B', 'Chernyak, Boris V', 'Antonenko, Yuri N']","['Chelombitko MA', 'Firsov AM', 'Kotova EA', 'Rokitskaya TI', 'Khailova LS', 'Popova LB', 'Chernyak BV', 'Antonenko YN']","['Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119991 Moscow, Russia.

One of the approaches to detect MRD by flow cytometry (FC) is the use of dry antibody reagents such as DuraClone(R) RE CLB (Beckman Coulter-BC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the DuraClone(R) RE CLB in detecting MRD in CLL compared to liquid reagents. METHODS: DuraClone(R) RE CLB is composed by CD81FITC, ROR1PE, CD79bPC5.5, CD19PC7, CD5APC, CD43APCA750, CD20PB, and CD45KrO. For the liquid reagent assay, we used CD43FITC, ROR1PE, CD3ECD, CD5PC5.5, CD20PC7, CD79bAPC, CD19APC750, CD81 APCH7, and CD45KrO. The liquid and dry tubes were used to detect 20 MRD-positive CLL samples. The samples were analyzed using Radar Plots Kaluza Software (BC). RESULTS: The statistical correlation between the liquid and dry reagents was acceptable (R(2) = .9583) and no discrepancy was observed in MRD percentages. The average of the total number of acquired events in DuraClone(R) RE CLB was 758.583 (362.632-2.290.387), which allowed accurate sensitivity for the FC assay. The lowest MRD frequency detected by DuraClone(R) RE CLB was 0.01%, corresponding to a cluster with 106 events in a total of 737.030.

Although typically associated with favorable prognosis, the beneficial impact of NPM1+ decreases with increasing age in patients treated with standard intensive chemotherapy (IC) or hypomethylating agents (HMAs). This retrospective analysis compared outcomes of NPM1+ AML patients treated with 1 of 3 induction approaches: HMA plus BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN), HMA, or IC therapy. Composite complete response (CRc: CR + CR with incomplete count recovery) was seen in 96% (27/28), 36% (17/47), and 89% (204/228) of HMA + VEN, HMA, and IC patients, respectively (HMA + VEN vs HMA, P < .001; HMA + VEN vs IC, P = .10). Older patients (age >65 years) treated with HMA + VEN, HMA, or IC had CR rates of 88%, 28%, and 56%, respectively (HMA + VEN vs HMA, P < .001; HMA + VEN vs IC, P = .01). Significant improvement in overall survival (OS) was seen in patients age >65 years treated with HMA + VEN vs HMA (not reached [NR] vs 0.4 years; P < .001) or IC (NR vs 0.93 years; P = .001). Older patients treated with HMA + VEN had OS of 80% after median 1-year follow-up, with estimated 2-year OS of 70%.

Cardio-metabolic dysfunction is a challenge during and after childhood ALL therapy. In a single center study, we measured triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) levels at diagnosis and assessed the association with BMI, early therapy response, on-therapy hyperlipidemia and the toxicities; thromboembolism, osteonecrosis and pancreatitis. We included 127 children (1.0-17.9 years) all treated according to the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. Dyslipidemia was identified at ALL-diagnosis in 99% of the patients, dominated by reduced HDL levels (98%) and mild hypertriglyceridemia (61%). Hypertriglyceridemia was not associated with body mass index (P = 0.71). Five percent of patients had mild hypercholesterolemia, 14% had mild hypocholesterolemia, 13% had decreased and 1% elevated LDL-levels. Increased TG and TC levels at ALL-diagnosis were not associated with any on-therapy lipid levels. Lipid levels and BMI were not associated to MRD after induction therapy; However, BMI and hypercholesterolemia were associated with worse risk group stratification (P<0.045 for all). The cumulative incidence of thromboembolism was increased both for patients with hypo- (20.0%) and hypercholesterolemia (16.7%) compared to patients with normal TC levels (2.2%) at diagnosis (P = 0.0074). In conclusion, dyslipidemic changes were present prior to ALL-therapy in children with ALL but did not seem to affect dysmetabolic traits during therapy and were not predictive of on-therapy toxicities apart from an association between dyscholesterolemia at time of ALL-diagnosis and risk of thromboembolism. However, the latter should be interpreted with caution due to low number in the groups.","['Mogensen, Pernille Rudebeck', 'Grell, Kathrine', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Overgaard, Ulrik Malthe', 'Wolthers, Benjamin Ole', 'Mogensen, Signe Sloth', 'Vaag, Allan', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth']","['Mogensen PR', 'Grell K', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Overgaard UM', 'Wolthers BO', 'Mogensen SS', 'Vaag A', 'Frandsen TL']","['Department of Diabetes and Bone-metabolic Research Unit, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5583-741X'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200406,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Steroids)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/metabolism', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dyslipidemias/*complications/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercholesterolemia/complications/epidemiology', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/complications/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/complications', 'Pancreatitis/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/complications/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Steroids/metabolism', 'Thromboembolism/complications', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7135240,,,,2020/04/07 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2020/04/07 06:00'],"['2019/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0231209 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-27696 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Apr 6;15(4):e0231209. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0231209. eCollection 2020.,,,,"[""The authors have read the journal's policy and declare the following competing"", 'interests: AV is a paid employee of The Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen and was', 'a paid employee of AstraZeneca.

In this context, depletion of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is known to impair development of PDAC-initiating lesions called acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN). In contrast, the role of v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2), the preferred dimerization partner of EGFR, remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model with inactivation of Erbb2 in pancreatic acinar cells, we found that Erbb2 is dispensable for inflammation- and KRas(G12D)-induced development of ADM and PanIN. A mathematical model of EGFR/ERBB2-KRAS signaling, which was calibrated on mouse and human data, supported the observed roles of EGFR and ERBB2. However, this model also predicted that overexpression of ERBB2 stimulates ERBB/KRAS signaling; this prediction was validated experimentally. We conclude that EGFR and ERBB2 differentially impact ERBB signaling during PDAC tumorigenesis, and that the oncogenic potential of ERBB2 is only manifested when it is overexpressed. Therefore, the level of ERBB2, not only its mere presence, needs to be considered when designing therapies targeting ERBB signaling.","['Meyers, Nora', 'Gerard, Claude', 'Lemaigre, Frederic P', 'Jacquemin, Patrick']","['Meyers N', 'Gerard C', 'Lemaigre FP', 'Jacquemin P']","['Universite catholique de Louvain, de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Universite catholique de Louvain, de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Universite catholique de Louvain, de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium. frederic.lemaigre@uclouvain.be.', 'Universite catholique de Louvain, de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium. patrick.jacquemin@uclouvain.be.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200323,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Erbb2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Acinar Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC7090067,,,,2020/04/07 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/04/07 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-62106-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-62106-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Mar 23;10(1):5241. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-62106-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies have revealed that metadherin (MTDH) is highly expressed in a variety of malignant solid tumours and plays an important role in the occurrence and development of tumours. However, the relationship between the expression of MTDH and T-ALL has not yet been reported, and the regulatory factors of MTDH are still unknown. Our previous studies found that mPGES-1/PGE2 was important for promoting the growth of leukaemia cells. In the present study, we found that MTDH was highly expressed in primary T-ALL cells and in the Jurkat cell line. Our results showed that mPGES-1/PGE2 regulates the expression of MTDH through the EP3/cAMP/PKA-CREB pathway in T-ALL cells. Downregulation of MTDH inhibits the growth of Jurkat cells in vitro and in vivo.

However, its application is limited by the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major complication of BMT. GVHD is evoked when T-cells in the donor grafts recognizealloantigen expressed by recipient cells and mount unwanted immunological attacks against recipient healthy tissues. Thus, traditional therapies are designed to suppress donor T-cell alloreactivity. However, these approaches substantially impair the GVL effect so that the recipient's survival is not improved. Understanding the effects of therapeutic approaches on BMT, GVL, and GVHD, is thus essential. Due to the antigen-presenting and cytokine-secreting capacities to stimulate donor T-cells, recipient dendritic cells (DCs) play a significant role in the induction of GVHD. Therefore, targeting recipient DCs becomes a potential approach for controlling GVHD. This work provides a description of a novel BMT platform to investigate how host DCs regulate GVH and GVL responses after transplantation. Also presented is an effective BMT model to study the biology of GVHD and GVL after transplantation.","['Nguyen, Hung D', 'Huong, Phung Thanh', 'Hossack, Krystal', 'Gurshaney, Sanjeev', 'Ezhakunnel, Kevin', 'Huynh, Thien-Huong', 'Alvarez, Anamaria Morales', 'Le, Nhat-Tu', 'Luu, Hung N']","['Nguyen HD', 'Huong PT', 'Hossack K', 'Gurshaney S', 'Ezhakunnel K', 'Huynh TH', 'Alvarez AM', 'Le NT', 'Luu HN']","['Cancer Division, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida; hung.nguyen@ucf.edu.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Hanoi University of Pharmacy.', 'Cancer Division, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida.', 'Cancer Division, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida.', 'Cancer Division, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida.', 'Cancer Division, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida.', 'Cancer Division, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida.', 'Center for Cardiovascular Regeneration, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Houston Methodist Research Institute.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health; Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Hillman Cancer Center.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20200317,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,,,2020/04/07 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2020/04/07 06:00'],"['2020/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/60083 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2020 Mar 17;(157). doi: 10.3791/60083.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The T-CBF-AML patients were older, had lower WBC counts, and slightly higher hemoglobin than patients with de novo disease. Secondary cytogenetic abnormalities were more frequent in patients with de novo disease than t-CBF-AML (57.1% vs 41.1%, P = .026). Patients with secondary cytogenetic abnormalities had longer overall survival (OS) than those without abnormalities (median 190 vs 87 months, P = .021); trisomy 8, trisomy 22, and loss of the X or Y chromosome were associated with longer OS. In the 165 cases performed of targeted gene sequencing, pathogenic mutations were detected in 75.7% of cases, and were more frequent in de novo than in therapy-related disease (P = .013). Mutations were found in N/KRAS (37.0%), FLT3 (27.8%), KIT (17.2%), TET2 (4.9%), and ASXL1 (3.9%). The TET2 mutations were associated with shorter OS (P = .012) while N/KRAS mutation was associated with longer OS in t(8;21) AML patients (P = .001). The KIT mutation did not show prognostic significance in this cohort. Although they received similar therapy, t-CBF-AML patients had shorter OS than de novo patients (median 69 vs 190 months, P = .038). In multivariate analysis of all patients, older age and absence of any secondary cytogenetic abnormalities were significant predictors of shorter OS. Among the t-CBF-AML subset, age and hemoglobin were significant on multivariate analysis. This study demonstrated that although de novo and t-CBF-AML patients share many features, t-CBF-AML patients have worse clinical outcome than de novo patients.","['Rogers, Heesun J', 'Wang, Xiaoqiong', 'Xie, Yan', 'Davis, Adam R', 'Thakral, Beenu', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Cantu, Miguel D', 'Margolskee, Elizabeth M', 'Philip, John K S', 'Sukhanova, Madina', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Hasserjian, Robert P']","['Rogers HJ', 'Wang X', 'Xie Y', 'Davis AR', 'Thakral B', 'Wang SA', 'Borthakur G', 'Cantu MD', 'Margolskee EM', 'Philip JKS', 'Sukhanova M', 'Bagg A', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Orazi A', 'Arber DA', 'Hsi ED', 'Hasserjian RP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Texas Tech University Health Science Center, El Paso, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8491-224X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5140-3633', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7679-6453', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8597-0636']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200420,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Core Binding Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,2020/04/07 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2020/04/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25814 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Jul;95(7):799-808. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25814.

We previously demonstrated that some strains from North Africa (a-NA clade) originated from a recombinant event between Senegalese and West African strains. A series of 52 new HTLV-1 strains from 13 North and West African countries were sequenced in the LTR region and/or a env gene fragment. Four samples from French Guyanese of African origin were also added. Furthermore, 7 complete sequences from different genotypes were characterized. Phylogenetic analyses showed that most of the new African strains belong to the Cosmopolitan a-genotype. Ten new strains from the a-NA clade were found in Morocco, Western Sahara, Mali, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. A new a-G-Rec clade, which arose from a distinct recombination event between Senegalese and West African strains, was identified in Guinea and Ghana. The complete sequences suggest that recombination occur in the LTR as well as the env/pol region of the genome, thus a-NA and a-G-Rec strains have a mosaic profile with genetic segments from either a-WA or a-Sen strains. Our work demonstrates that recombination in HTLV-1 may not be as rare an event as previously proposed.","['Cassar, Olivier', 'Desrames, Alexandra', 'Marcais, Ambroise', 'Gout, Olivier', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Soriano, Vicente', 'Mendoza, Carmen de', 'Dehan, Oceane', 'Mener, Margot Le', 'Afonso, Philippe V', 'Gessain, Antoine']","['Cassar O', 'Desrames A', 'Marcais A', 'Gout O', 'Taylor GP', 'Hermine O', 'Soriano V', 'Mendoza C', 'Dehan O', 'Mener ML', 'Afonso PV', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, UMR3569 CNRS, Universite de Paris, Paris, France."", ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, UMR3569 CNRS, Universite de Paris, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France."", 'Departement de Neurologie, Fondation Rothschild, Paris, France.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France."", 'UNIR Health Sciences School and Medical Center, Madrid, Spain.', 'Internal Medicine Laboratory Puerta de Hierro Research Institute, University Hospital Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, UMR3569 CNRS, Universite de Paris, Paris, France."", ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, UMR3569 CNRS, Universite de Paris, Paris, France."", ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, UMR3569 CNRS, Universite de Paris, Paris, France."", ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, UMR3569 CNRS, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.""]","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5331-6357', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4828-3797']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Emerg Microbes Infect,Emerging microbes & infections,101594885,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Africa/epidemiology', 'DNA, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeography', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics']",PMC7269087,,['NOTNLM'],"['Africa', 'HTLV-1', 'HTLV-1 complete genome', 'molecular epidemiology', 'recombination', 'reverse transcription']",2020/04/07 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/04/07 06:00'],"['2020/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/22221751.2020.1752117 [doi]'],ppublish,Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020 Dec;9(1):913-923. doi: 10.1080/22221751.2020.1752117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, resistance to these therapies remains a limitation. Novel anticancer therapeutics targeting the MCL1 anti-apoptotic protein have shown impressive responses in haematological cancers but are yet to be evaluated in melanoma. To assess the sensitivity of melanoma to new MCL1 inhibitors, we measured the response of 51 melanoma cell lines to the novel MCL1 inhibitor, S63845. Additionally, we assessed combination of this drug with inhibitors of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family of epigenetic readers, which we postulated would assist MCL1 inhibition by downregulating anti-apoptotic targets regulated by NF-kB such as BCLXL, BCL2A1 and XIAP, and by upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins including BIM and NOXA. Only 14% of melanoma cell lines showed sensitivity to S63845, however, combination of S63845 and I-BET151 induced highly synergistic apoptotic cell death in all melanoma lines tested and in an in vivo xenograft model. Cell death was dependent on caspases and BAX/BAK. Although the combination of drugs increased the BH3-only protein, BIM, and downregulated anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2A1, the importance of these proteins in inducing cell death varied between cell lines. ABT-199 or ABT-263 inhibitors against BCL2 or BCL2 and BCLXL, respectively, induced further cell death when combined with S63845 and I-BET151.

In this article, we describe the differential diagnosis of CLL/SLL from other indolent lymphomas, with special reference to follicular lymphoma, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, although the latter is considered to be aggressive. CLL/SLL often exhibits proliferation centers, similar to follicular lymphoma. Immunohistological examination can easily distinguish these two lymphomas. The most important characteristic of CLL/SLL is CD5 and CD23 positivity. Mantle cell lymphoma is also CD5-positive and there are some CD23-positive cases. Such cases should be carefully distinguished from CLL/SLL. Some marginal zone lymphomas are also positive for CD5 and such cases are often disseminated. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should also be a differential diagnosis for CLL/SLL. It frequently demonstrates MYD88 L265P, which is a key differential finding. By immunohistological examination, the expression of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 is specific for CLL/SLL and can be a good marker in the differential diagnosis.","['Yoshino, Tadashi', 'Tanaka, Takehiro', 'Sato, Yasuharu']","['Yoshino T', 'Tanaka T', 'Sato Y']","['Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School, Okayama, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200403,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism']",PMC7810253,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma', 'differential diagnosis', 'indolent lymphoma']",2020/04/07 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/04/07 06:00'],"['2020/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3960/jslrt.19041 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2020 Dec 15;60(4):124-129. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.19041.

However, the molecular basis of cohesin-mutated leukemogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we show a critical role of an interplay between STAG2 and RUNX1 in the regulation of enhancer-promoter looping and transcription in hematopoiesis. Combined loss of STAG2 and RUNX1, which colocalize at enhancer-rich, CTCF-deficient sites, synergistically attenuates enhancer-promoter loops, particularly at sites enriched for RNA polymerase II and Mediator, and deregulates gene expression, leading to myeloid-skewed expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in mice. Attenuated enhancer-promoter loops in STAG2/RUNX1-deficient cells are associated with downregulation of genes with high basal transcriptional pausing, which are important for regulation of HSPCs. Downregulation of high-pausing genes is also confirmed in STAG2-cohesin-mutated primary leukemia samples. Our results highlight a unique STAG2-RUNX1 interplay in gene regulation and provide insights into cohesin-mutated leukemogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate a critical role of an interplay between STAG2 and a master transcription factor of hematopoiesis, RUNX1, in MDS development, and further reveal their contribution to regulation of high-order chromatin structures, particularly enhancer-promoter looping, and the link between transcriptional pausing and selective gene dysregulation caused by cohesin deficiency.This

Doing so is complicated by the molecular diversity of AML and the older age of many patients, predisposing them to both treatment-related mortality and, more commonly, resistance to treatment. There is no shortage of scoring systems to identify patients at high risk of early death or treatment resistance after conventional AML induction chemotherapy.

Early studies demonstrated feasibility in reducing peripheral WBC and blast counts as well as clinically relevant patient outcomes which prompted its common use for many years. However, more recent data have directly challenged the previously touted reports of reduced TLS and DIC incidence as well as survival benefit, even in patients with clinical leukostasis. The use of leukocytapheresis remains highly controversial with wide practice variations among physicians, institutions, and countries given the lack of high-quality data, risks associated with leukocytapheresis itself, associated high costs, resource utilization, and lack of evidence-based clinical guidelines.","['Shallis, Rory M', 'Stahl, Maximilian', 'Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Hendrickson, Jeanne E', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Shallis RM', 'Stahl M', 'Bewersdorf JP', 'Hendrickson JE', 'Zeidan AM']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8542-2944', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3352-0902']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Video-Audio Media']",20200417,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukocytosis/*therapy', 'Leukostasis/*therapy', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/prevention & control']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*hyperleukocytosis', '*leukapheresis', '*leukocytapheresis']",2020/04/07 06:00,2021/05/06 06:00,['2020/04/07 06:00'],"['2020/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1751609 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 May;13(5):489-499. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1751609.

The purpose of this study is to compare survival in immunosuppressed patients who developed melanoma with that in patients with melanoma who are not immunosuppressed. METHODS: Immunosuppressed patients were defined as having solid organ transplant, lymphoma, leukemia, or human immunodeficiency virus prior to diagnosis of melanoma. Patients with cutaneous melanoma with and without immunosuppression were identified retrospectively from the Ontario Cancer Registry (2007-2015) and linked with administrative databases to identify demographics, treatment, and outcomes. Immunosuppressed patients were matched with non-immunosuppressed patients based on age at diagnosis, sex, birth year, stage at diagnosis, and propensity score. The primary outcome was overall survival. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to identify factors associated with survival. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced in 218 immunosuppressed patients matched to 436 controls. Of the patients, 186 (28.4%) were female, and median age at melanoma diagnosis was 69 (interquartile range, IQR 59-78) years. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 65% for immunosuppressed patients and 79% for non-immunosuppressed patients. Melanoma was the leading cause of death for both groups. On multivariable analysis, immunosuppression was associated with increased mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-2.23]. Adequate treatment (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.22-0.58) and dermatologist visits either before (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.36-0.73) or after (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.90) melanoma diagnosis were associated with improved OS. CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppressed patients who develop melanoma have worse outcomes when matched to non-immunosuppressed patients. This decrease in survival appears related to the underlying condition rather than diagnosis of melanoma.","['Austin, Janice', 'Wright, Frances C', 'Cheng, Stephanie Y', 'Sutradhar, Rinku', 'Baxter, Nancy N', 'Look Hong, Nicole J']","['Austin J', 'Wright FC', 'Cheng SY', 'Sutradhar R', 'Baxter NN', 'Look Hong NJ']","['Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Surgical Oncology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ""Division of General Surgery, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada."", 'Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Although fluid retention is a common adverse event associated with dasatinib, chylothorax is exceptionally rare. The pathological mechanism, clinical manifestation and management of dasatinib-induced chylothorax are completely unclear. A 71-year-old man treated with dasatinib for CML was admitted for progressive dyspnea. Computed tomography (CT) showed a pleural effusion that was more prominent on the right thoracic cavity. Thoracentesis showed thick milky pleural fluid, which was then confirmed as chylothorax by chylum qualitative tests and triglyceride measurements. Radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy yielded an obstruction at the end segment of the thoracic duct, but no leakage points were found. After excluding common causes, drug-induced chylothorax was presumed. Then, dasatinib was withdrawn, and 1 week later, chylothorax resolved. To further elucidate the relationship between the medication and chylothorax, dasatinib was resumed tentatively for 2 days. As expected, pleural effusion recurred soon. Based on these clinical manifestations, the diagnosis of dasatinib-induced chylothorax was identified. The patient was suggested to stop dasatinib and use an alternative drug as recommended by the haematologist. Pleural effusion is the common adverse reaction of dasatinib, but chylothorax is rare. Only six cases of dasatinib-induced chylothorax have been reported, and our patient is the seventh case. Once a patient with dasatinib treatment develops chylothorax, dasatinib should be considered one of the possible causes. If no other definitive aetiological factor is identified, dasatinib discontinuation might be the optimum scheme.","['Chen, Bojiang', 'Wu, Zuohong', 'Wang, Qin', 'Li, Weimin', 'Cheng, Deyun']","['Chen B', 'Wu Z', 'Wang Q', 'Li W', 'Cheng D']","['Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China. weimin003@163.com.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China. cdy1963@qq.com.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200404,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Chylothorax/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Dasatinib/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pleural Effusion/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Thoracic Cavity/diagnostic imaging', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chylothorax', '*Dasatinib', '*Medication withdrawal']",2020/04/06 06:00,2021/09/03 06:00,['2020/04/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10637-020-00932-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-020-00932-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2020 Oct;38(5):1627-1632. doi: 10.1007/s10637-020-00932-3.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of CML patients (</= 18 years old) presenting to our center between January 2005 and December 2018 with respect to baseline demographics, response to imatinib, and real-world management of those with a suboptimal response. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were diagnosed with CML with 99 (80%) in the chronic phase. There was a male preponderance (males:females = 3.1:1) with a median age of 13 years. The common presenting clinical features were splenomegaly (90.9%) and fever (51.5%) with a median leukocyte count of 165 x 10(3)/muL. The proportion of patients attaining a complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 months, a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months, and a major molecular response at 12 months were 79.7%, 54.1%, and 50.9%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 67.4 months, the 5-year overall survival rate and the event-free survival (EFS) rate were 92% +/- 3% and 64% +/- 6%, respectively. Failure to achieve CCyR at 12 months was associated with poor EFS beyond 1 year (hazard ratio = 2.865, P = .044). Among 15 patients not achieving CHR at 3 months, dose escalation of imatinib resulted in the attainment of CHR in 13 (87%) patients. Seven patients in the cohort had a loss of the established response to imatinib because of documented poor compliance. CONCLUSION: Imatinib remains the frontline treatment of choice in CML with a reasonable outcome in children, especially when financial affordability, availability of second-generation TKIs, and poor compliance still remain major challenges in management. Dose escalation of imatinib remains an option in patients with a suboptimal response.","['Ganguly, Shuvadeep', 'Pushpam, Deepam', 'Mian, Agrima', 'Chopra, Anita', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Ganguly S', 'Pushpam D', 'Mian A', 'Chopra A', 'Gupta R', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. BRA Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, AIIMS, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. BRA Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, AIIMS, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, Dr. BRA Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, Dr. BRA Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. BRA Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, AIIMS, New Delhi, India.

We also provide an overview of the direct blocking of protein-protein interactions with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including examples of the most promising regulators of Mcl-1 and selective BH3-mimetics, which at present are under clinical evaluation. Moreover, several approaches for the co-targeting of Mcl-1 and other proteins (e.g., CDKs) are also presented.

Most acute lymphoblastic leukaemia arises in healthy individuals, and predisposing factors such as inherited genetic susceptibility or environmental exposure have been identified in only a few patients. It is characterised by chromosomal abnormalities and genetic alterations involved in differentiation and proliferation of lymphoid precursor cells. Along with response to treatment, these abnormalities are important prognostic factors. Disease-risk stratification and the development of intensified chemotherapy protocols substantially improves the outcome of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, particularly in children (1-14 years), but also in adolescents and young adults (15-39 years). However, the outcome of older adults (>/=40 years) and patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia remains poor.

It entered Phase II clinical trials in China and Phase Ib clinical trials in USA in 2019 for treatment of patients with resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We found that at concentrations below 10 nM, GZD824 significantly suppresses FLT3, FGFR1 and PDGFRalpha kinase activities and inhibits their signal pathways in MV4-11(Flt3-ITD), KG-1(FGFR1OP2-FGFR1) and EOL-1(FIP1L1-PDGFRa) leukemia cells. It selectively inhibits the growth of MV4-11(Flt3-ITD), KG-1(FGFR1OP2-FGFR1) and EOL-1(FIP1L1-PDGFRa) cells, and also effectively suppresses the growth of Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells harboring F691I and other mutations with IC50 values <10 nM. GZD824 induces G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in MV4-11, KG-1 and EOL-1 cells and activates cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. In MV4-11, Ba/F3-ITD-F691I and KG-1 mouse xenograft models, GZD824 at 10 or 20 mg/kg, q2d, p.o. almost completely eradicates tumors. It also inhibits the viability of primary leukemic blasts from a FLT3-ITD positive AML patient but not those expressing native FLT3. Thus GZD824 suppresses leukemia cells of FLT3-ITD-driven AML and other hematologic malignancies driven by FGFR1 or PDGFRa, and it may be considered to be a novel agent for the treatment of leukemia.","['Wang, Yuting', 'Zhang, Lenghe', 'Tang, Xia', 'Luo, Jinfeng', 'Tu, Zhengchao', 'Jiang, Kaili', 'Ren, Xiaomei', 'Xu, Fang', 'Chan, Shingpan', 'Li, Yuhua', 'Zhang, Zhang', 'Ding, Ke']","['Wang Y', 'Zhang L', 'Tang X', 'Luo J', 'Tu Z', 'Jiang K', 'Ren X', 'Xu F', 'Chan S', 'Li Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Ding K']","['International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), Guangzhou City Key Laboratory of Precision Chemical Drug Development, School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253 GongYeDaDaoZhong, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510280, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), Guangzhou City Key Laboratory of Precision Chemical Drug Development, School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 190 Kaiyuan Avenue, Guangzhou Science Park, Guangzhou 510530, China.', 'Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 190 Kaiyuan Avenue, Guangzhou Science Park, Guangzhou 510530, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), Guangzhou City Key Laboratory of Precision Chemical Drug Development, School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), Guangzhou City Key Laboratory of Precision Chemical Drug Development, School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), Guangzhou City Key Laboratory of Precision Chemical Drug Development, School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), Guangzhou City Key Laboratory of Precision Chemical Drug Development, School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253 GongYeDaDaoZhong, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510280, China.

This occurs even when a single causative gene was initially suspected. We report the case of an 8-year-old patient with global developmental delays and dysmorphic features, with a possibly pathogenic variant in three distinct genes. METHODS: Trio-based exome sequencing was performed by IntegraGen SA (Evry, France), on an Illumina HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the variants that were found. RESULTS: WES showed the presence of three possibly deleterious variants: KMT2A: c.9068delA;p.Gln3023Argfs*3 de novo, PAX3: c.530C>G;p.Ala177Gly de novo and DLG3: c.127delG;p.Asp43Metfs*22 hemizygous inherited from the mother. KMT2A pathogenic variants are involved in Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome, and PAX3 is the gene responsible for Waardenburg syndrome. DLG3 variants have been described in a non-syndromic X-related intellectual disability. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the dysmorphic features and intellectual disability presented by this patient, these three variants were imputed as pathogenic and their association was considered responsible for his phenotype. Dual molecular diagnoses have already been found by WES in several cohorts with an average of diagnostic yield of 7%. This case demonstrates and reminds us of the importance of analyzing exomes rigorously and exhaustively because, in some cases (< 10%), it can explain superimposed traits or blended phenotypes.","['Matis, Thibaut', 'Michaud, Vincent', 'Van-Gils, Julien', 'Raclet, Virginie', 'Plaisant, Claudio', 'Fergelot, Patricia', 'Lasseaux, Eulalie', 'Arveiler, Benoit', 'Trimouille, Aurelien']","['Matis T', 'Michaud V', 'Van-Gils J', 'Raclet V', 'Plaisant C', 'Fergelot P', 'Lasseaux E', 'Arveiler B', 'Trimouille A']","['Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Genetique Medicale, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1610-9927'],['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200419,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (DLG3 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome', 'Child', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'PAX3 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Waardenburg Syndrome/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*direct sequencing', '*gene expression', '*molecular genetics', '*neurology']",2020/04/05 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2020/04/05 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.3197 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2020 Aug;22(8):e3197. doi: 10.1002/jgm.3197.

We therefore analyzed the outcome of 101 pediatric patients (<18 years old at the time of HSCT) transplanted for acute leukemia between 1981 and 2015 at Complexo Hospital de Clinicas, Federal University of Parana, Brazil, and who survived at least two years after HSCT. The median follow-up was 5.9 years (2.0-29.0); median age at follow-up was 17.5 years (2.98-39.0). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 27.5% (95% CI 18.6%-36.4%). Two-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 21.8% (95% CI 13.7%-29.8%). Of the 101 patients, 72 patients (71.3%) presented with late effects. Those surviving longer after HSCT experienced more complications. Patients who received TBI-based regimen developed more late effects (P = .013) and more endocrinological complications (P = .024). Endocrinological complications were the most common late sequelae found in this study. For childhood survivors, quality of life was not influenced by age (at HSCT or at last visit), time from HSCT, gender, donor, or GVHD. For survivors that no longer were children, only age at last visit impacted financial domain measures, irrespective of gender, donor, or GVHD. The current study confirms the high burden late complications after pediatric HSCT have on the survivors and underlines the importance of extended follow-up.","['Marinho, Daniela Hespanha', 'Ribeiro, Lisandro Lima', 'Nichele, Samantha', 'Loth, Gisele', 'Koliski, Adriana', 'Mousquer, Rebeca Toassa Gomes', 'Funke, Vaneuza Araujo Moreira', 'Page, Kristin', 'Fasth, Anders', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Boguszewski, Margaret Cristina da Silva', 'Bonfim, Carmem']","['Marinho DH', 'Ribeiro LL', 'Nichele S', 'Loth G', 'Koliski A', 'Mousquer RTG', 'Funke VAM', 'Page K', 'Fasth A', 'Pasquini R', 'Boguszewski MCDS', 'Bonfim C']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Transplant and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Clinical Sciencies at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9699-7241', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2938-5146', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3857-2306', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2378-5026', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7521-8766', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3481-5211', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2122-7277', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9670-8828', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0033-740X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9272-1061', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5306-0715', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0343-2610']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200404,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brazil', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Health Resources', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute leukemia', '*child', '*effects', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*quality of life']",2020/04/05 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2020/04/05 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13691 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2020 Jun;24(4):e13691. doi: 10.1111/petr.13691.

This could be related to the presence of cryptic cytogenetic abnormalities (CCA) not detectable by conventional methods. The study of copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygozity (LOH) in hematological malignancies is possible using a high resolution SNP-array. Recently, in clinical practice the karyotype study has been complemented with the identification of point mutations in an increasing number of genes. We analyzed 252 de novo NK-AML patients from Hospital La Fe (n = 44) and from previously reported cohorts (n = 208) to identify CCA by SNP-array, and to integrate the analysis of CCA with molecular alterations detected by Next-Generation-sequencing. CCA were detected in 58% of patients. In addition, 49% of them harbored CNA or LOH and point mutations, simultaneously. Patients were grouped in 3 sets by their abnormalities: patients carrying several CCA simultaneously, patients with mutations in FLT3, NPM1 and/or DNMT3A and patients with an amalgam of mutations. We found a negative correlation between the number of CCA and the outcome of the patients. This study outlines that CCA are present in up to 50% of NK-AML patients and have a negative impact on the outcome. CCA may contribute to the heterogeneous prognosis.","['Ibanez, Mariam', 'Such, Esperanza', 'Onecha, Esther', 'Gomez-Segui, Ines', 'Liquori, Alessandro', 'Selles, Jorge', 'Hervas-Marin, David', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Ayala, Rosa', 'LLop, Marta', 'Lopez-Pavia, Maria', 'Rapado, Inmaculada', 'Neef, Alex', 'Sanjuan-Pla, Alejandra', 'Sargas, Claudia', 'Gonzalez-Romero, Elisa', 'Boluda-Navarro, Mireia', 'Andreu, Rafa', 'Senent, Leonor', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Angel Sanz, Miguel', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Cervera, Jose']","['Ibanez M', 'Such E', 'Onecha E', 'Gomez-Segui I', 'Liquori A', 'Selles J', 'Hervas-Marin D', 'Barragan E', 'Ayala R', 'LLop M', 'Lopez-Pavia M', 'Rapado I', 'Neef A', 'Sanjuan-Pla A', 'Sargas C', 'Gonzalez-Romero E', 'Boluda-Navarro M', 'Andreu R', 'Senent L', 'Montesinos P', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Angel Sanz M', 'Sanz G', 'Cervera J']","['Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biomedicas.

It was unclear if, besides the direct transforming effect via constant RAS/MEK/ERK signaling, an inflammation-related effect of KRAS contributes to the disease. Here, we identify a functional link between oncogenic Kras(G12D) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine and human cells. Mice expressing active Kras(G12D) in the hematopoietic system developed myeloproliferation and cytopenia, which is reversed in Kras(G12D) mice lacking NLRP3 in the hematopoietic system. Therapeutic IL-1-receptor blockade or NLRP3-inhibition reduces myeloproliferation and improves hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, Kras(G12D)-RAC1 activation induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production causing NLRP3 inflammasome-activation. In agreement with our observations in mice, patient-derived myeloid leukemia cells exhibit KRAS/RAC1/ROS/NLRP3/IL-1beta axis activity. Our findings indicate that oncogenic KRAS not only act via its canonical oncogenic driver function, but also enhances the activation of the pro-inflammatory RAC1/ROS/NLRP3/IL-1beta axis. This paves the way for a therapeutic approach based on immune modulation via NLRP3 blockade in KRAS-mutant myeloid malignancies.","[""Hamarsheh, Shaima'a"", 'Osswald, Lena', 'Saller, Benedikt S', 'Unger, Susanne', 'De Feo, Donatella', 'Vinnakota, Janaki Manoja', 'Konantz, Martina', 'Uhl, Franziska M', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Shoumariyeh, Khalid', 'Schurch, Christoph', 'Andrieux, Geoffroy', 'Venhoff, Nils', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette', 'Duquesne, Sandra', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Cooper, Matthew A', 'Lengerke, Claudia', 'Boerries, Melanie', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Erlacher, Miriam', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Becher, Burkard', 'Gross, Olaf', 'Brummer, Tilman', 'Zeiser, Robert']","['Hamarsheh S', 'Osswald L', 'Saller BS', 'Unger S', 'De Feo D', 'Vinnakota JM', 'Konantz M', 'Uhl FM', 'Becker H', 'Lubbert M', 'Shoumariyeh K', 'Schurch C', 'Andrieux G', 'Venhoff N', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Duquesne S', 'Pfeifer D', 'Cooper MA', 'Lengerke C', 'Boerries M', 'Duyster J', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Erlacher M', 'Blazar BR', 'Becher B', 'Gross O', 'Brummer T', 'Zeiser R']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center -

However, several reports have suggested that the omission of ENI might be appropriate. Current US practice patterns are unknown regarding ENI for patients with LS-SCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed US radiation oncologists via an institutional review board-approved questionnaire. The questions covered demographics, treatment recommendations, and self-assessed knowledge of key clinical trials. chi(2) and Cochran-Armitage tests were used to evaluate for statistically significant correlations between responses. RESULTS: We received 309 responses. Of the respondents, 21% recommended ENI for N0 LS-SCLC, 29% for N1, and 30% for N2; 64% did not recommend ENI for any of these clinical scenarios. The respondents who recommended ENI were more likely to have been practicing for > 10 years (P < .001), more likely to be in private practice (P = .04), and less likely to be familiar with the ongoing Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30610 trial (P = .04). Almost all respondents (93%) prescribed the same radiation dose to the primary disease and involved lymph nodes. When delivering ENI, 36% prescribed the same dose to the involved and elective nodes, and 64% prescribed a lower dose to the elective nodes. CONCLUSION: Nearly two thirds of respondents did not recommend ENI, which represents a shift in practice. A recent large clinical trial that omitted ENI reported greater overall survival than previously reported and lower-than-expected radiation toxicities, lending further evidence that omitting ENI should be considered a standard treatment strategy.","['Farrell, Matthew J', 'Yahya, Jehan B', 'Degnin, Catherine', 'Chen, Yiyi', 'Holland, John M', 'Henderson, Mark A', 'Jaboin, Jerry J', 'Harkenrider, Matthew M', 'Thomas, Charles R Jr', 'Mitin, Timur']","['Farrell MJ', 'Yahya JB', 'Degnin C', 'Chen Y', 'Holland JM', 'Henderson MA', 'Jaboin JJ', 'Harkenrider MM', 'Thomas CR Jr', 'Mitin T']","['Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Biostatistics Shared Resources, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Biostatistics Shared Resources, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Columbus Regional Health Cancer Center, Columbus, IN.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.

IKZF1 alterations are present in approximately 15% of childhood ALL, rise in prevalence among adults with ALL and become highly enriched within kinase-driven ALL. A cumulating body of literature has highlighted the adverse prognostic impact of IKZF1 alterations in both Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative and Ph-driven ALL.

Bispecific CAR-modified T cells targeting both CD19 and CD22 may overcome the limitation of CD19-negative relapse. METHODS: We here report the design of a bispecific CAR simultaneous targeting of CD19 and CD22. We performed a phase 1 trial of bispecific CAR T cell therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory precursor B-ALL at a dose that ranged from 1.7 x 10(6) to 3 x 10(6) CAR T cells per kilogram of body weight. RESULTS: We demonstrate bispecific CD19/CD22 CAR T cells could trigger robust cytolytic activity against target cells. MRD-negative CR was achieved in 6 out of 6 enrolled patients. Autologous CD19/CD22 CAR T cells proliferated in vivo and were detected in the blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid. No neurotoxicity occurred in any of the 6 patients treated. Of note, one patient had a relapse with blast cells that no longer expressed CD19 and exhibited diminished CD22 site density approximately 5 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: In brief, autologous CD19/CD22 CAR T cell therapy is feasible and safe and mediates potent anti-leukemic activity in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. Furthermore, the emergence of target antigen loss and expression downregulation highlights the critical need to anticipate antigen escape. Our study demonstrates the reliability of bispecific CD19/CD22 CAR T cell therapy in inducing remission in adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL.

In response to HH activation, GLI3-FL regulates HH genes by targeting the GLI1 promoter. In the absence of HH signaling, GLI3 is phosphorylated leading to its partial degradation and the generation of GLI3-R which represses HH functions. GLI3 is also involved in tissue development, immune cell development and cancer. The absence of Gli3 in mice impaired brain and lung development and GLI3 mutations in humans are the cause of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly (GCPS) and Pallister Hall syndromes (PHS). In the immune system GLI3 regulates B, T and NK-cells and may be involved in LPS-TLR4 signaling. In addition, GLI3 was found to be upregulated in multiple cancers and was found to positively regulate cancerous behavior such as anchorage-independent growth, angiogenesis, proliferation and migration with the exception in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and medulloblastoma where GLI plays an anti-cancerous role. Finally, GLI3 is a target of microRNA. Here, we will review the biological significance of GLI3 and discuss gaps in our understanding of this molecule.

It contributes to leukemia via accumulation of oncometabolite D-2-HG. Therefore, mutant IDH2 is a promising target for AML. Discovery of IDH2 mutant inhibitors is in urgent need for AML therapy. METHODS: Structure-based in silico screening and enzymatic assays were used to identify IDH2/R140Q inhibitors. Molecular docking, mutant structure building and molecular dynamics simulations were applied to investigate the inhibitory mechanism and selectivity of CP-17 on IDH2/R140Q. TF-1 cells overexpressed IDH2/R140Q mutant were used to study the effects of CP-17 on cellular proliferation and differentiation, the wild-type TF-1 cells were used as control. The intracellular D-2-HG production was measured by LC-MS. The histone methylation was evaluated with specific antibodies by western blot. RESULTS: CP-17, a heterocyclic urea amide compound, was identified as a potent inhibitor of IDH2/R140Q mutant by in silico screening and enzymatic assay. It exhibits excellent inhibitory activity with IC50 of 40.75 nM against IDH2/R140Q. More importantly, it shows poor activity against the wild-type IDH1/2, resulting in a high selectivity of over 55 folds, a dramatic improvement over previously developed inhibitors such as AGI-6780 and Enasidenib. Molecular simulations suggested that CP-17 binds to IDH2/R140Q at the allosteric site within the dimer interface through extensive polar and hydrophobic interactions, locking the enzyme active sites in open conformations with abolished activity to produce D-2-HG. Cellular assay results demonstrated that CP-17 inhibits intracellular D-2-HG production and suppresses the proliferation of TF-1 erythroleukemia cells carrying IDH2/R140Q mutant. Further, CP-17 also restores the EPO-induced differentiation that is blocked by the mutation and decreases hypermethylation of histone in the TF-1(IDH2/R140Q) cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CP-17 can serve as a lead compound for the development of inhibitory drugs against AML with IDH2/R140Q mutant.

This type of therapy is still not available for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). One major issue is the lack of knowledge for the expression patterns of immune checkpoints (IC) in AML. In this study, we first explored the prognostic value of ICs for AML patients by analyzing RNA-seq and mutation data from 176 AML patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We further validated the results of the database analysis by analyzing bone marrow (BM) samples from 62 patients with de novo AML. Both TCGA data and validation results indicated that high expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 was associated with poor overall survival (OS) in AML patients. In addition, increased co-expression of PD-1/CTLA-4 or PD-L2/CTLA-4 correlated with poor OS in AML patients (3-year OS: TGCA data 30% vs 0% and 20% vs 0%, validation group 57% vs 31% and 57% vs 33%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Moreover, co-expression of PD-1/PD-L1, PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2, and PD-1/LAG-3 was found to correlate with poor OS in AML patients with FLT3(mut), RUNX1(mut), and TET2(mut), respectively. In conclusion, high expression of ICs in the BM leukemia cells of AML patients correlated with poor outcome. The co-expression patterns of PD-1/CTLA-4, PD-L2/CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1, PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2, and PD-1/LAG-3 might be potential immune biomarkers for designing novel AML therapy.","['Chen, Cunte', 'Liang, Chaofeng', 'Wang, Shunqing', 'Chio, Chi Leong', 'Zhang, Yuping', 'Zeng, Chengwu', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Wang, Caixia', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Chen C', 'Liang C', 'Wang S', 'Chio CL', 'Zhang Y', 'Zeng C', 'Chen S', 'Wang C', 'Li Y']","[""Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510180, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510180, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, People's Republic of China. jnshaohuachen@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510180, People's Republic of China. wangcx225@163.com."", ""Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, People's Republic of China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3733-9174', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1333-3918', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4945-5914', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0974-4036']",['eng'],,"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200403,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Proteins)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1LG2 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['B7-H1 Antigen/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Proteins/*genetics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein/genetics', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/genetics']",PMC7118887,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Immune checkpoint', '*PD-1', '*PD-L1', '*PD-L2', '*Prognosis']",2020/04/05 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/04/05 06:00'],"['2020/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00853-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00853-x [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Apr 3;13(1):28. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00853-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TCF3-HLF translocation is a very rare rearrangement in ALL that is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. The TCF3-HLF fusion gene in the described case resulted in the fusion of the homeobox-related gene of TCF3 to the leucine zipper domain of HLF. The TCF3-HLF fusion gene product acts as a transcriptional factor leading to the dedifferentiation of mature B lymphocytes into an immature state (lymphoid stem cells). This process initiates the formation of pre-leukaemic cells. Due to the rarity of this chromosomal aberration, only a few cases have been described in the literature. The advantage of this work is the presentation of an interesting case of clonal evolution of cancer cells and the cumulative implications (diagnostic and prognostic) of the patient's genetic alterations. CASE PRESENTATION: This work presents a patient with diagnosed with TCF3-HLF-positive ALL. Moreover, the additional genetic alterations, which play a key role in the pathogenesis of ALL, were detected in this patient: deletion of a fragment from the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q12.2-q21.1) containing the RB1 gene, intragenic deletions within the PAX5 gene and NOTCH1 intragenic duplication. CONCLUSIONS: A patient with coexistence of chromosomal alterations and the TCF3-HLF fusion has not yet been described. Identifying all these chromosomal aberrations at the time of diagnosis could be sufficient to determine the cumulative effects of the described deletions on the activity of other oncogenes or tumour suppressors, as well as on the clinical course of the disease. On the other hand, complex changes in the patient's karyotype and clonal evolution of cancer cells call into question the effectiveness of experimental therapy.","['Lejman, Monika', 'Wlodarczyk, Monika', 'Zawitkowska, Joanna', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy R']","['Lejman M', 'Wlodarczyk M', 'Zawitkowska J', 'Kowalczyk JR']","['Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, ul.

In these malignancies, chemotherapy is the main treatment strategy that fails in many cases and is usually associated with adverse effects on healthy cells. In this regard, the development of new therapies is essential. Monoclonal antibodies directed to the cell surface markers of leukemic blasts may have promising consequences with minimal toxic effects on normal cells. Since cluster of differentiation 45Ra (CD45Ra) and CD123 antigens, two considered surface markers of leukemic blasts in AML and ALL respectively, are overexpressed on AML and ALL blasts, CD34+ leukemic progenitors, and AML-LSCs in comparison with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), they were selected to be targeted; using specific monoclonal antibodies. In this project, CD45Ra+ cells and CD123+ cells were targeted by anti-CD45Ra and/or anti-CD123 monoclonal antibodies. Cytotoxicity effect and cell death induction was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. Changes in the expression profile of MCL1, cMyc, Survivin, Id1, and PIM1 genes were assessed by real-time PCR. Statistical analysis of the results showed effective antibody-mediated cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis in KG1alpha (CD45Ra+) and Nalm6 (CD123+) cell lines.

So that, its expression is associated with poor prognosis and invasiveness. Natural killer (NK) cells are important effector cells against virus-infected and transformed cells. Especially they play a key role in tumor immune surveillance. Whereas it was not well understood whether SDF-1alpha modulates anti-tumor immune response or not, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of SDF-1alpha on the cytotoxic properties of peripheral blood NK cells. Human peripheral blood NK cells were freshly isolated using MACSxpess system and cultured in the presence or absence of recombinant human SDF-1alpha or SDF-1alpha plus CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100. CD107a degranulation assay was conducted through the co-culture of NK cells with K562 cells. The percentage of CD107a positive cells was assessed by flowcytometry. Effect of SDF-1alpha was also examined on the mRNA levels of NKG2A and NKG2D as indicator examples of NK cell inhibitory and activating receptors, respectively. SDF-1alpha significantly decreased the degranulation activity of NK cells (p=0.04). The mRNA content of NKG2D was down-regulated under the influence of SDF-1alpha (p=0.03). Moreover, AMD3100 exhibited a trend in recovering the NKG2D mRNA level to its un-treated state (p=0.05). The present study reveals that SDF-1alpha has a negative impact on NK cell activity and might is involved in tumor immune-suppression. Thus, it can be concluded that microenvironment manipulations targeting SDF-1alpha may reinforce current cancer therapies by disturbing one of the immune-suppressive axes in the cancerous milieu.","['Mardomi, Alireza', 'Hossein-Nataj, Hadi', 'Jafari, Narjes', 'Mohammadi, Nabiallah', 'Abediankenari, Saeid']","['Mardomi A', 'Hossein-Nataj H', 'Jafari N', 'Mohammadi N', 'Abediankenari S']","['Immunogenetics Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran AND Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. alirezamardomi@ymail.com.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. hadi.nataj2000@gmail.com.', 'Immunogenetics Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. sn.jafari@gmail.com.', 'Immunogenetics Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran AND Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran AND Student Research Committee, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. mohammadi.nabi@yahoo.com.', 'Immunogenetics Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran AND Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. abedianlab@yahoo.co.uk.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191023,Iran,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",101146178,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunologic cytotoxicity', 'Killer cells', 'NKG2D', 'Natural', 'SDF-1alpha']",2020/04/05 06:00,2020/05/30 06:00,['2020/04/05 06:00'],"['2019/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.18502/ijaai.v18i5.1917 [doi]'],epublish,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2019 Oct 23;18(5):493-500. doi: 10.18502/ijaai.v18i5.1917.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study identifies the interplay between MSI protein expression, stem cell characteristics, radioresistance, cell invasiveness and migration. MSI-1, MSI-2 and Notch pathway elements were investigated via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 19 triple-negative breast cancer samples. Measurements were repeated in MDA-MB-231 cells after MSI-1 and -2 siRNA-mediated double knockdown, with further experiments performed after MSI silencing. Flow cytometry helped quantify expression of CD44 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), changes in apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Proliferation and irradiation-induced effects were assessed using colony formation assays. Radiation-related proteins were investigated via Western blots. Finally, cell invasion assays and digital holographic microscopy for cell migration were performed. MSI proteins showed strong correlations with Notch pathway elements. MSI knockdown resulted in reduction of stem cell marker expression, cell cycle progression and proliferation, while increasing apoptosis. Cells were radiosensitized as radioresistance-conferring proteins were downregulated. However, MSI-silencing-mediated LIFR downregulation resulted in enhanced cell invasion and migration. We conclude that, while MSI knockdown results in several therapeutically desirable consequences, enhanced invasion and migration need to be counteracted before knockdown advantages can be fully exploited.","['Troschel, Fabian M', 'Minte, Annemarie', 'Ismail, Yahia Mahmoud', 'Kamal, Amr', 'Abdullah, Mahmoud Salah', 'Ahmed, Sarah Hamdy', 'Deffner, Marie', 'Kemper, Bjorn', 'Kiesel, Ludwig', 'Eich, Hans Theodor', 'Ibrahim, Sherif Abdelaziz', 'Gotte, Martin', 'Greve, Burkhard']","['Troschel FM', 'Minte A', 'Ismail YM', 'Kamal A', 'Abdullah MS', 'Ahmed SH', 'Deffner M', 'Kemper B', 'Kiesel L', 'Eich HT', 'Ibrahim SA', 'Gotte M', 'Greve B']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Medical Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, 11796 Cairo, Egypt.', 'Surgical Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, 11796 Cairo, Egypt.', 'Biotechnology/Biomolecular Chemistry program, Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, 12613 Giza, Egypt.', 'Biotechnology/Biomolecular Chemistry program, Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, 12613 Giza, Egypt.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Biomedical Technology Center, Medical Faculty, University of Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, 12613 Giza, Egypt.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5066-6650', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3693-9397', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6403-7345', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2360-2496']",['eng'],"['n/a/University Munster Open Access Fund', 'n/a/SAFIR Munster University Research Grant']",['Journal Article'],20200321,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MSI1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/radiation effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/radiation effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7139790,,['NOTNLM'],"['EGFR', 'LIFR', 'Musashi RNA-binding proteins', 'Notch', 'apoptosis', 'breast cancer stem cells', 'invasiveness', 'migration', 'proliferation', 'radiotherapy']",2020/04/05 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/04/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21062169 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21062169 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Mar 21;21(6). pii: ijms21062169. doi: 10.3390/ijms21062169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, studies on gut microbiota in different animals have suggested that changes in the composition and structure of these microbes may promote gut inflammation by releasing inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides, gut-wall leakage, and may affect systemic inflammatory and immune mechanisms that are important for the normal functioning of the body. There are many factors that aid in the gut's dysbiosis and neuroinflammation, including high stress levels, lack of sleep, fatty and processed foods, and the prolonged use of antibiotics. These neurotoxic mechanisms of dysbiosis may increase susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative conditions. Therefore, studies have recently been conducted to tackle AD-like conditions by specifically targeting gut microbes that need further elucidation. It was suggested that gut dyshomeostasis may be regulated by using available options, including the use of flavonoids such as anthocyanins, and restriction of the use of high-fatty-acid-containing food. In this review, we summarize the gut microbiota, factors promoting it, and possible therapeutic interventions especially focused on the therapeutic potential of natural dietary polyflavonoid anthocyanins. Our study strongly suggests that gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation are critically involved in the development of neurodegenerative disorders, and the natural intake of these flavonoids may provide new therapeutic opportunities for preclinical or clinical studies.","['Khan, Muhammad Sohail', 'Ikram, Muhammad', 'Park, Jun Sung', 'Park, Tae Ju', 'Kim, Myeong Ok']","['Khan MS', 'Ikram M', 'Park JS', 'Park TJ', 'Kim MO']","['Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research, Centre Institute of Cancer, Sciences University of Glasgow, 0747 657 5394 Glasgow, UK."", 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4902-4698', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5226-4081']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200401,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Amyloid)', '0 (Anthocyanins)']",IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*microbiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Amyloid/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anthocyanins/*therapeutic use', 'Dysbiosis/complications', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological']",PMC7226756,,['NOTNLM'],"[""*Alzheimer's disease"", '*gut dysbiosis', '*memory impairment', '*natural polyflavonoids', '*neuroinflammation', '*systemic inflammation']",2020/04/05 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/04/05 06:00'],"['2020/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9040853 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9040853 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Apr 1;9(4). pii: cells9040853. doi: 10.3390/cells9040853.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signals to ensure temporo-spatial regulation of APE1 towards a specific function are still a matter of debate. Several studies have suggested that post-translational modifications (PTMs) act as dynamic molecular mechanisms for controlling APE1 functionality. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of APE1 is a disordered portion functioning as an interface for protein binding, as an acceptor site for PTMs and as a target of proteolytic cleavage. We previously demonstrated a cytoplasmic accumulation of truncated APE1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in association with a mutated form of nucleophosmin having aberrant cytoplasmic localization (NPM1c+). Here, we mapped the proteolytic sites of APE1 in AML cells at Lys31 and Lys32 and showed that substitution of Lys27, 31, 32 and 35 with alanine impairs proteolysis. We found that the loss of the APE1 N-terminal domain in AML cells is dependent on the proteasome, but not on granzyme A/K as described previously. The present work identified the proteasome as a contributing machinery involved in APE1 cleavage in AML cells, suggesting that acetylation can modulate this process.","['Lirussi, Lisa', 'Antoniali, Giulia', 'Scognamiglio, Pasqualina Liana', 'Marasco, Daniela', 'Dalla, Emiliano', ""D'Ambrosio, Chiara"", 'Arena, Simona', 'Scaloni, Andrea', 'Tell, Gianluca']","['Lirussi L', 'Antoniali G', 'Scognamiglio PL', 'Marasco D', 'Dalla E', ""D'Ambrosio C"", 'Arena S', 'Scaloni A', 'Tell G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Udine, 33100 Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Udine, 33100 Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples ""Federico II"", 80134 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples ""Federico II"", 80134 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Udine, 33100 Udine, Italy.', 'Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, ISPAAM, National Research Council, 80147 Naples, Italy.', 'Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, ISPAAM, National Research Council, 80147 Naples, Italy.', 'Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, ISPAAM, National Research Council, 80147 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Udine, 33100 Udine, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2111-5152', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2639-1893', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6618-2949', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4687-6011', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2810-9270', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5326-0645', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8845-6448']",['eng'],"['IG19862/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC)/International', 'POR FESR 2014-2020 - Obiettivo specifico 1.2 - ""Manifestazione di interesse per', ""la realizzazione di Technology Platform nell'ambito della lotta alle patologie"", 'oncologiche"" for the project ""Sviluppo di approcci terapeutici innovativi per', 'patologie neoplast/Regione Campania/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200331,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,"['EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (APEX1 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Domains', '*Proteolysis']",PMC7226146,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox effector factor 1', '*cytoplasmic nucleophosmin 1', '*proteasome', '*proteolysis']",2020/04/05 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/04/05 06:00'],"['2020/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['biom10040531 [pii]', '10.3390/biom10040531 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2020 Mar 31;10(4). pii: biom10040531. doi: 10.3390/biom10040531.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ectopic expression of PML1 promotes the proliferation of ERalpha-positive MCF-7 breast cancer (BC) cells, while a loss of PML by knockdown or overexpression of PML4 does the opposite. PML is an essential constituent of highly dynamic particles called PML nuclear bodies (NBs). PML NBs are heterogenous multiprotein subnuclear structures that are part of cellular stress sensing machinery. The antioxidant sulforaphane (SFN) inhibits the proliferation of BC cells and causes a redistribution of the subcellular localization of PML, a disruption of disulfide-bond linkages in nuclear PML-containing complexes, and a reduction in the number and size of PML NBs. Mechanistically, SFN modifies several cysteine residues, including C204, located in the RBCC domain of PML. PML is sumoylated and contains a Sumo-interacting motif, and a significant fraction of Sumo1 and Sumo2/3 co-localizes with PML NBs. Ectopic expression of the mutant C204A selectively inhibits the biogenesis of endogenous PML NBs but not PML-less Sumo1-, Sumo2/3, or Daxx-containing nuclear speckles. Importantly, PML1 (C204A) functions as a dominant-negative mutant over endogenous PML protein and promotes anti-proliferation activity. Together, we conclude that SFN elicits its cytotoxic activity in part by inactivating PML1's pro-tumorigenic activity.","['Alhazmi, Nada', 'Pai, Chun-Peng', 'Albaqami, Aljawharah', 'Wang, Han', 'Zhao, Xuan', 'Chen, Minyue', 'Hu, Po', 'Guo, Shuang', 'Starost, Kyle', 'Hajihassani, Omid', 'Miyagi, Masaru', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Alhazmi N', 'Pai CP', 'Albaqami A', 'Wang H', 'Zhao X', 'Chen M', 'Hu P', 'Guo S', 'Starost K', 'Hajihassani O', 'Miyagi M', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA; The Comprehensive Cancer Center of CWRU, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.

Why this functional decline occurs and how this information is encoded is unclear. To better understand how this information is stored, we performed RNA sequencing on HSC populations differing only in their divisional history. Comparative analysis revealed that genes upregulated with divisions are enriched for lineage genes and regulated by cell-cycle-associated transcription factors, suggesting that proliferation itself drives lineage priming. Downregulated genes are, however, associated with an HSC signature and targeted by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). The PRC2 catalytic subunits Ezh1 and Ezh2 promote and suppress the HSC state, respectively, and successive divisions cause a switch from Ezh1 to Ezh2 dominance. We propose that cell divisions drive lineage priming and Ezh2 accumulation, which represses HSC signature genes to consolidate information on divisional history into memory.","['Bernitz, Jeffrey M', 'Rapp, Katrina', 'Daniel, Michael G', 'Shcherbinin, Dmitrii', 'Yuan, Ye', 'Gomes, Andreia', 'Waghray, Avinash', 'Brosh, Ran', 'Lachmann, Alexander', ""Ma'ayan, Avi"", 'Papatsenko, Dmitri', 'Moore, Kateri A']","['Bernitz JM', 'Rapp K', 'Daniel MG', 'Shcherbinin D', 'Yuan Y', 'Gomes A', 'Waghray A', 'Brosh R', 'Lachmann A', ""Ma'ayan A"", 'Papatsenko D', 'Moore KA']","['Department of Cell, Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L.

Histone methyltransferase KMT2D (a COMPASS-like enzyme, also called MLL4) is among the most highly inactivated epigenetic modifiers in lung cancer. Here, we show that lung-specific loss of Kmt2d promotes lung tumorigenesis in mice and upregulates pro-tumorigenic programs, including glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis preferentially impedes tumorigenicity of human lung cancer cells bearing KMT2D-inactivating mutations. Mechanistically, Kmt2d loss widely impairs epigenomic signals for super-enhancers/enhancers, including the super-enhancer for the circadian rhythm repressor Per2. Loss of Kmt2d decreases expression of PER2, which regulates multiple glycolytic genes. These findings indicate that KMT2D is a lung tumor suppressor and that KMT2D deficiency confers a therapeutic vulnerability to glycolytic inhibitors.","['Alam, Hunain', 'Tang, Ming', 'Maitituoheti, Mayinuer', 'Dhar, Shilpa S', 'Kumar, Manish', 'Han, Chae Young', 'Ambati, Chandrashekar R', 'Amin, Samir B', 'Gu, Bingnan', 'Chen, Tsai-Yu', 'Lin, Yu-Hsi', 'Chen, Jichao', 'Muller, Florian L', 'Putluri, Nagireddy', 'Flores, Elsa R', 'DeMayo, Francesco J', 'Baseler, Laura', 'Rai, Kunal', 'Lee, Min Gyu']","['Alam H', 'Tang M', 'Maitituoheti M', 'Dhar SS', 'Kumar M', 'Han CY', 'Ambati CR', 'Amin SB', 'Gu B', 'Chen TY', 'Lin YH', 'Chen J', 'Muller FL', 'Putluri N', 'Flores ER', 'DeMayo FJ', 'Baseler L', 'Rai K', 'Lee MG']","['Department of Molecular & Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1901 East Road, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1901 East Road, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Advanced Technology Core and Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1901 East Road, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1881 East Road, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1881 East Road, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Advanced Technology Core and Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Cancer Biology and Evolution Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Reproductive and Developmental Biology Laboratory, The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, 111 T.W.

First one is a 59-year-old renal transplant recipient; the second is a 51-year-old allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient. Both patients were on immunosuppressant therapy and had stable graft function before COVID-19 infection. After the diagnosis of COVID-19, immunosuppressive agents were discontinued and methylprednisolone with prophylactic antibiotics were initiated, however, the lung injury progressed. The T cells were extremely low in both patients after infection. Both patients died despite the maximal mechanical ventilatory support. Therefore, the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia following transplantation is not optimistic and remains guarded. Lower T cell count may be a surrogate for poor outcome.","['Huang, Jiaofeng', 'Lin, Heng', 'Wu, Yinlian', 'Fang, Yingying', 'Kumar, Rahul', 'Chen, Gongping', 'Lin, Su']","['Huang J', 'Lin H', 'Wu Y', 'Fang Y', 'Kumar R', 'Chen G', 'Lin S']","['Department of Liver Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Fuzhou Pulmonary Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Liver Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', ""Department of Tuberculosis, the Third People's Hospital of Yichang City, Yichang, China."", 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Changi General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Respiratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Liver Research Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7517-9859'],['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200417,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bacterial Infections/complications', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'COVID-19', 'China', 'Coronavirus Infections/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Cross Infection/complications', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*complications/surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Pandemics', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prognosis', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', '*Transplant Recipients']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Coronavirus', 'transplantation']",2020/04/04 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajt.15896 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2020 Jul;20(7):1879-1881. doi: 10.1111/ajt.15896.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of a cohort of 61 patients with newly diagnosed AML with inv(3)/t(3;3) treated with homogeneous intensive chemotherapy protocols conducted by the Spanish PETHEMA and CETLAM cooperative groups between 1999 and 2017. METHODS: In this retrospective study the main clinical and biologic parameters were collected. The complete response (CR) rate, the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and the overall survival (OS) were calculated. An analysis of prognostic factors for survival was performed. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients received induction and only 18 (29%) achieved CR (median age, 46 years). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) was performed in 36 patients (59%), 15 with active disease. One- and 4-year CIR were 52% and 56%. One- and 4-year OS probabilities were 41% and 13%. By multivariate analysis monosomal karyotype (MK) was associated with poorer OS (HR 2.0, P = .017). CONCLUSION: Inv(3)/t(3;3) AML is a poor prognosis entity with low response to standard chemotherapy and to alloHSCT because of frequent and early relapse. MK was associated with a poorer prognosis. Improved therapeutic strategies are clearly needed.","['Sitges, Marta', 'Boluda, Blanca', 'Garrido, Ana', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Arnan, Montserrat', 'Serrano, Josefina', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Miguel Bergua, Juan', 'Colorado, Mercedes', 'Salamero, Olga', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Benavente, Celina', 'Perez-Encinas, Manuel', 'Coll, Rosa', 'Marti-Tutusaus, Josep-Maria', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Angel Sanz, Miguel', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Vives, Susana']","['Sitges M', 'Boluda B', 'Garrido A', 'Morgades M', 'Granada I', 'Barragan E', 'Arnan M', 'Serrano J', 'Tormo M', 'Miguel Bergua J', 'Colorado M', 'Salamero O', 'Esteve J', 'Benavente C', 'Perez-Encinas M', 'Coll R', 'Marti-Tutusaus JM', 'Brunet S', 'Sierra J', 'Angel Sanz M', 'Montesinos P', 'Ribera JM', 'Vives S']","['Hematology Departments of ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'ICO-Hospital Universitari Doctor Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Departments of ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Departments of ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', ""ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, IDIBELL, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Llobregat, Spain."", 'Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, Caceres, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', ""Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron/VHIO, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario de Santiago, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'ICO-Hospital Universitari Doctor Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari Mutua de Terrassa, Terrassa, Spain.', 'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Departments of ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Departments of ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1149-8815'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200616,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'molecular cytogenetics']",2020/04/04 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13417 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Aug;105(2):138-147. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13417.

METHODS: Nilotinib was taken fasted (300 mg BID, days 1-4) or with real-life meals (200 mg BID, days 5-11). Rich sampling (days 1, 3, 8, 11) allowed for non-compartmental PK analysis. Nilotinib exposure (AUC0-12 h -Cmin -Cmax ) and its intra- and interpatient variability were compared between the two regimens. Adverse events were recorded by means of a patient diary and ECG monitoring. RESULTS: Fifteen patients aged 40-74 years participated. Nilotinib PK following 200 mg BID taken with a meal strongly resembled that of 300 mg BID taken fasted (Cmin percentile (P)10-P90: 665-1404 ng/mL and 557-1743 ng/mL, respectively). Meals delayed nilotinib absorption. Intra- and interpatient variability were not increased by intake with meals. Nilotinib with food was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: With support of therapeutic drug monitoring, the use of a reduced 200 mg nilotinib dose with real-life meals seems feasible and safe. Future (confirmatory) studies should further explore the usefulness of nilotinib dosing together with food, including the relationship with treatment efficacy as well as long-term effects on quality of life.

Upon aging, hematopoietic clones harboring acquired leukemia-associated mutations expand and become detectable, now referred to as clonal hematopoiesis (CH). To investigate the relationship between CH and anemia of the elderly, we explored the landscape and dynamics of CH in older individuals with anemia. From the prospective, population-based Lifelines cohort (n = 167 729), we selected all individuals at least 60 years old who have anemia according to World Health Organization criteria (n = 676) and 1:1 matched control participants. Peripheral blood of 1298 individuals was analyzed for acquired mutations at a variant allele frequency (VAF) of 1% or higher in 27 driver genes. To track clonal evolution over time, we included all available follow-up samples (n = 943). CH was more frequently detected in individuals with anemia (46.6%) compared with control individuals (39.1%; P = .007). Although no differences were observed regarding commonly detected DTA mutations (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1) in individuals with anemia compared with control individuals, other mutations were enriched in the anemia cohort, including TP53 and SF3B1. Unlike individuals with nutrient deficiency (P = .84), individuals with anemia of chronic inflammation and unexplained anemia revealed a higher prevalence of CH (P = .035 and P = .017, respectively) compared with their matched control individuals. Follow-up analyses revealed that clones may expand and decline, generally showing only a subtle increase in VAF (mean, 0.56%) over the course of 44 months, irrespective of the presence of anemia. Specific mutations were associated with different growth rates and propensities to acquire an additional hit. In contrast to smaller clones (<5% VAF), which did not affect overall survival, larger clones were associated with increased risk for death.","['van Zeventer, Isabelle A', 'de Graaf, Aniek O', 'Wouters, Hanneke J C M', 'van der Reijden, Bert A', 'van der Klauw, Melanie M', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Jonker, Marianne A', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Huls, Gerwin']","['van Zeventer IA', 'de Graaf AO', 'Wouters HJCM', 'van der Reijden BA', 'van der Klauw MM', 'de Witte T', 'Jonker MA', 'Malcovati L', 'Jansen JH', 'Huls G']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Endocrinology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Endocrinology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology and.', 'Department for Health Evidence, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy; and.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aging', 'Anemia/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prospective Studies']",,,,,2020/04/04 06:00,2020/11/03 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)62138-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019004362 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Apr 2;135(14):1161-1170. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019004362.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 Apr 2;135(14):1080-1082.

The clinical outcome and genetic abnormalities of AML may vary; therefore, genetic investigation must be complex, using several techniques, to have an appropriate characterization of the AML genome and its clinical impact. The available molecular markers can predict prognosis only partially. Acute promyelocytic leukemia subtype M3 (AML M3) is a subtype of AML characterized by the presence of promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA) genes fusion. Targeted treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and ATRA combined with arsenic trioxide significantly improved the survival of AML M3 patients. Unknown prognostic factors could contribute to the early death of these patients. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a young female (20 years old) patient, who presented at the emergency department 5 months after giving birth to her first child, complaining of asthenia, fatigue, general musculoskeletal pain, and fever (38 degrees C), symptoms having been present for the previous 6 days. The patient denied any chronic diseases in her medical and family history. DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory analysis revealed severe pancytopenia. Cytogenetic and molecular analyzes revealed chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 8), PML-RARA gene fusion, and fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene mutation. The immunophenotypic analysis was also suggestive for AML M3 according to the FAB classification. INTERVENTIONS: Specific treatment was initiated for AML M3 and for secondary conditions. Molecular and cytogenetic analyzes were performed to have a more detailed characterization of the patient's genome. OUTCOME: Seventy-two hours after admission, she developed psychomotor agitation, confusion, coma, and convulsion. Subsequent deterioration and early death were caused by intracerebral hemorrhage with multiple localization and diffuse cerebral edema. LESSONS: The presence of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation may explain the rapid and progressive degradation of this AML M3 case and it may be used as a prognostic marker even when co-occuring with other markers such as PML-RARA gene fusion and trisomy 8. We consider that FLT3 ITD mutation analysis in young patients with AML should be performed as soon as possible. New strategies for patients' education, AML (or cancers in general) prevention, and treatment are needed.","['Tripon, Florin', 'Crauciuc, George Andrei', 'Boglis, Alina', 'Moldovan, Valeriu', 'Sandor-Keri, Johanna', 'Benedek, Istvan Jr', 'Trifa, Adrian Pavel', 'Banescu, Claudia']","['Tripon F', 'Crauciuc GA', 'Boglis A', 'Moldovan V', 'Sandor-Keri J', 'Benedek IJ', 'Trifa AP', 'Banescu C']","['Department of Medical Genetics.', 'Genetics Laboratory, Center for Advanced Medical and Pharmaceutical Research, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology of TarguMures.', 'Genetics Laboratory, Mures County Emergency Clinical Hospital (SCJU Targu Mures).', 'Department of Medical Genetics.', 'Genetics Laboratory, Center for Advanced Medical and Pharmaceutical Research, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology of TarguMures.', 'Department of Medical Genetics.', 'Genetics Laboratory, Center for Advanced Medical and Pharmaceutical Research, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology of TarguMures.', 'Genetics Laboratory, Mures County Emergency Clinical Hospital (SCJU Targu Mures).', 'Genetics Laboratory, Center for Advanced Medical and Pharmaceutical Research, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology of TarguMures.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology of TarguMures, TarguMures.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology of TarguMures, TarguMures.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Medical Genetics.', 'Genetics Laboratory, Center for Advanced Medical and Pharmaceutical Research, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology of TarguMures.', 'Genetics Laboratory, Mures County Emergency Clinical Hospital (SCJU Targu Mures).']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'Chromosome 8, trisomy']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gene Fusion/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Trisomy/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC7220460,,,,2020/04/04 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000019730 [doi]', '00005792-202004030-00056 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Apr;99(14):e19730. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019730.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most ATL literature is derived from Japan and little is published about Caribbean patients. We describe the clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment outcomes of our Caribbean patients who have ATL at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center and Kings County Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of our patients with ATL who were diagnosed between 2005 and 2017. Medical records were reviewed for clinicopathologic data and treatment outcomes. The final analysis included acute and lymphomatous subtypes only. For the univariable analysis, outcomes were calculated by using a log-rank test, and survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: We identified 63 patients with acute (55%) and lymphomatous (45%) subtypes, 95% of whom had Ann Arbor stage III to IV disease. The median age was 54 years, and the study population was predominantly female (65%). Most patients (82%) received first-line etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone (EPOCH) or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy (10%) with an overall response rate of 46%. The median overall survival was 5.5 months, and the median progression-free survival was 4 months. Incidence of atypical immunophenotype (32%) was higher than previously reported in the Japanese literature and was associated with worse survival (P = .04). Abnormal cytogenetics correlated with shorter progression-free survival (P < .05). CONCLUSION: We describe here the clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment outcomes of our Caribbean patients with aggressive ATL, which is largely chemotherapy resistant, and the challenges of treating a population with unmet medical needs.","['Chiu, Edwin', 'Samra, Bachar', 'Tam, Eric', 'Baseri, Babak', 'Lin, Bo', 'Luhrs, Carol', 'Gonsky, Jason', 'Sawas, Ahmed', 'Taiwo, Evelyn', 'Sidhu, Gurinder']","['Chiu E', 'Samra B', 'Tam E', 'Baseri B', 'Lin B', 'Luhrs C', 'Gonsky J', 'Sawas A', 'Taiwo E', 'Sidhu G']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, New York City Health and Hospitals/Kings County, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, New York City Health and Hospitals/Kings County, Brooklyn, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,,IM,"['Adult', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Caribbean Region', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Urban', 'Humans', 'Japan', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'New York City/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7195818,,,,2020/04/04 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JGO.19.00208 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2020 Apr;6:548-556. doi: 10.1200/JGO.19.00208.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the heterogeneity of the population receiving hypomethylating agents (HMA), it is difficult for clinicians to accurately assess their patients' risk of infection. Literature on the incidence of IFI following HMA is limited to several studies of azacitidine. The primary objective of this retrospective study was to establish the incidence of IFI in HMA treated AML/MDS patients at a large U.S. comprehensive cancer center. Secondary objectives included comparing incidence of IFI among pre-specified subgroups to identify potential risk factors for IFI. Two hundred three patients with AML, intermediate to very high risk MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who received at least two cycles of HMA were included. The incidence of IFI, as defined by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer / Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group criteria, was 9.6%, with 20 IFI diagnosed following HMA (three proven, four probable, 13 possible).

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are one kind of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which were reported to modulate the initiation or progression of diverse cancers. However, the role of LINC00511 in T-ALL was unknown. To figure out the function and mechanism of LINC00511 in T-ALL, a series of experiments were carried out. Based on the experimental results, we discovered that LINC00511 boosted cell proliferation and invasion, but hindered cell apoptosis in T-ALL cells. Besides, based on bio-informatics tool, miR-195-5p was selected for further exploration. Then, miR-195-5p was validated to bind with LINC00511. Hereafter, LRRK1 was testified to serve as a target gene of miR-195-5p. At last, rescue assays suggested that LRRK1 overexpression restored sh-LINC00511#1-mediated effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis. All in all, LINC00511 exacerbated T-ALL progression via miR-195-5p/LRRK1 axis, implying a potential therapeutic clue for the patients with T-ALL.","['Li, Shengli', 'Guo, Wenwen', 'Geng, Huayun', 'Wang, Chao', 'Yang, Shuige', 'Xu, Xinxin']","['Li S', 'Guo W', 'Geng H', 'Wang C', 'Yang S', 'Xu X']","[""Department of Hematology, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, No. 6 Health Road, Rencheng District, Jining 272100, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, No. 6 Health Road, Rencheng District, Jining 272100, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Dongchangfu People's Hospital of Liaocheng, 281 Dongguan Street, Dongchangfu District, Liaocheng 252000, Shandong, China."", 'Department of Emergency, Zi Bo Central Hospital, 54 Communist Youth League West Road, Zhangdian District, Zibo 255000, Shandong, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, No. 6 Health Road, Rencheng District, Jining 272100, Shandong, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Zi Bo Central Hospital, 54 Communist Youth League West Road, Zhangdian District, Zibo, 255000 Shandong, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (MIRN195 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (LRRK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7953487,,['NOTNLM'],"['*LINC00511', '*LRRK1', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*miR-195-5p']",2020/04/04 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['222566 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20193631 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2020 May 29;40(5). pii: 222566. doi: 10.1042/BSR20193631.,,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glucocorticoids used to treat ALL may cause suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether cortisol levels in saliva of the patients with ALL are related to the response to the remission induction therapy. The authors have conducted a clinical, prospective and comparative study. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the variables values by gender or type of evolution. According to the patients' evolution, ROC curves were made for salivary cortisol levels and uric acid. An absolute value of 1000 blasts in peripheral blood count after a week of prednisone regimen was defined as a satisfactory response to the treatment. Review of the data has shown that area under the salivary cortisol levels' curve (AUC) was greater than that under the uric acid levels', as a predictor of a poor response to the remission induction. There were no statistically significant gender-associated differences in any variables except in erythrocytes. High levels of cortisol in saliva at the time of diagnosis of ALL seem to be of bad prognosis of the response to the remission induction therapy.","['Lombera-Mora, S', 'Lopez-Facundo, N', 'Layton Tovar, C', 'Mendieta-Zeron, H']","['Lombera-Mora S', 'Lopez-Facundo N', 'Layton Tovar C', 'Mendieta-Zeron H']","['1ISSEMYM Mother and Child Hospital, Mexico.', '1ISSEMYM Mother and Child Hospital, Mexico.', '2High Specialty Hospitals Coordination Entity (CHAE), Ministry of Health, Mexico.', '3Faculty of Medicine, Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (UAEMex), Cipres Grupo Medico CGM, Toluca, Mexico.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Georgia (Republic),Georgian Med News,Georgian medical news,101218222,['WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)'],IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/analysis/*metabolism', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/metabolism', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Saliva/*chemistry/metabolism']",,,,,2020/04/04 06:00,2020/08/21 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Georgian Med News. 2020 Feb;(299):39-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glucocorticoids form a critical component of chemotherapy regimens and resistance to glucocorticoid therapy is predictive of poor outcome. We have previously shown that glucocorticoid resistance is associated with upregulation of the oncogene C-MYC and failure to induce the proapoptotic gene BIM. METHODS: A high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign was carried out to identify glucocorticoid sensitisers against an ALL xenograft derived from a glucocorticoid-resistant paediatric patient. Gene expression analysis was carried out using Illumina microarrays. Efficacy, messenger RNA and protein analysis were carried out by Resazurin assay, reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. RESULTS: A novel glucocorticoid sensitiser, 2-((4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)thio)-N-isopropyl-N-phenylacetamide (GCS-3), was identified from the HTS campaign. The sensitising effect was specific to glucocorticoids and synergy was observed in a range of dexamethasone-resistant and dexamethasone-sensitive xenografts representative of B-ALL, T-ALL and Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. GCS-3 in combination with dexamethasone downregulated C-MYC and significantly upregulated BIM expression in a glucocorticoid-resistant ALL xenograft. The GCS-3/dexamethasone combination significantly increased binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to a novel BIM enhancer, which is associated with glucocorticoid sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the potential of the novel glucocorticoid sensitiser, GCS-3, as a biological tool to interrogate glucocorticoid action and resistance.","['Toscan, Cara E', 'Jing, Duohui', 'Mayoh, Chelsea', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Toscan CE', 'Jing D', 'Mayoh C', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. rlock@ccia.org.au.""]",,['eng'],['15/ECF/1-02/Cancer Institute NSW (Cancer Institute New South Wales)'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200403,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Discovery/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7283241,,,,2020/04/04 06:00,2021/03/20 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-0824-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-0824-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2020 Jun;122(12):1769-1781. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-0824-8.

Herein, we provide an overview of the current status of bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) therapy, considering the unprecedented new indication for such therapy in combating minimal (or measurable) residual disease in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and the development of novel approaches based on this concept. Key aspects that we discuss include the current clinical data, challenges relating to treatment administration and patient monitoring, toxicities and resistance to treatment, and novel strategies to overcome these hurdles as well as to broaden the indications for BiTE therapy, particularly to common solid cancers. Elucidation of mechanisms of resistance and immune escape and new technologies used in drug development pave the way for new and more-effective therapies and rational combinatorial approaches. In particular, we highlight novel therapeutic agents, such as bifunctional checkpoint-inhibitory T cell engagers (CiTEs), simultaneous multiple interaction T cell engagers (SMITEs), trispecific killer engagers (TriKEs) and BiTE-expressing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (CART.BiTE cells), designed to integrate various immune functions into one molecule or a single cellular vector and thereby enhance efficacy without compromising safety. We also discuss the targeting of intracellular tumour-associated epitopes using bispecific constructs with T cell receptor (TCR)-derived, rather than an antibody-based, antigen-recognition domains, termed immune-mobilizing monoclonal TCRs against cancer (ImmTACs), which might broaden the armamentarium of T cell-engaging therapies.","['Goebeler, Maria-Elisabeth', 'Bargou, Ralf C']","['Goebeler ME', 'Bargou RC']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.

The most common MLLr produces an MLL-AF4 fusion protein. MLL-AF4 promotes leukemogenesis by activating key target genes, mainly through recruitment of DOT1L and increased histone H3 lysine-79 methylation (H3K79me2/3). One key MLL-AF4 target gene is PROM1, which encodes CD133 (Prominin-1). CD133 is a pentaspan transmembrane glycoprotein that represents a potential pan-cancer target as it is found on multiple cancer stem cells. Here we demonstrate that aberrant PROM1/CD133 expression is essential for leukemic cell growth, mediated by direct binding of MLL-AF4. Activation is controlled by an intragenic H3K79me2/3 enhancer element (KEE) leading to increased enhancer-promoter interactions between PROM1 and the nearby gene TAPT1. This dual locus regulation is reflected in a strong correlation of expression in leukemia. We find that in PROM1/CD133 non-expressing cells, the PROM1 locus is repressed by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) binding, associated with reduced expression of TAPT1, partially due to loss of interactions with the PROM1 locus. Together, these results provide the first detailed analysis of PROM1/CD133 regulation that explains CD133 expression in MLLr ALL.","['Godfrey, Laura', 'Crump, Nicholas T', ""O'Byrne, Sorcha"", 'Lau,

Aire, a transcription factor essential for central T cell tolerance, forms large aggregate-like assemblies visualized as nuclear foci. Here we demonstrate that Aire utilizes its caspase activation recruitment domain (CARD) to form filamentous homo-multimers in vitro, and this assembly mediates foci formation and transcriptional activity. However, CARD-mediated multimerization also makes Aire susceptible to interaction with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) bodies, sites of many nuclear processes including protein quality control of nuclear aggregates. Several loss-of-function Aire mutants, including those causing autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type-1, form foci with increased PML body association. Directing Aire to PML bodies impairs the transcriptional activity of Aire, while dispersing PML bodies with a viral antagonist restores this activity. Our study thus reveals a new regulatory role of PML bodies in Aire function, and highlights the interplay between nuclear aggregate-like assemblies and PML-mediated protein quality control.","['Huoh, Yu-San', 'Wu, Bin', 'Park, Sehoon', 'Yang, Darren', 'Bansal, Kushagra', 'Greenwald, Emily', 'Wong, Wesley P', 'Mathis, Diane', 'Hur, Sun']","['Huoh YS', 'Wu B', 'Park S', 'Yang D', 'Bansal K', 'Greenwald E', 'Wong WP', 'Mathis D', 'Hur S']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'NTU Institute of Structural Biology, School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 637551, Singapore.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Department of Immunology Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Molecular Biology & Genetics Unit, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, 560 064, India.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Department of Immunology Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.

Although morphogens initially establish NSC positional identity in the neural tube, it is unclear how such regional differences are maintained as the forebrain grows much larger and more anatomically complex. We found that the maintenance of NSC positional identity in the murine brain requires a mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (Mll1)-dependent epigenetic memory system. After establishment by sonic hedgehog, ventral NSC identity became independent of this morphogen. Even transient MLL1 inhibition caused a durable loss of ventral identity, resulting in the generation of neurons with the characteristics of dorsal NSCs in vivo. Thus, spatial information provided by morphogens can be transitioned to epigenetic mechanisms that maintain regionally distinct developmental programs in the forebrain.","['Delgado, Ryan N', 'Mansky, Benjamin', 'Ahanger, Sajad Hamid', 'Lu, Changqing', 'Andersen, Rebecca E', 'Dou, Yali', 'Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo', 'Lim, Daniel A']","['Delgado RN', 'Mansky B', 'Ahanger SH', 'Lu C', 'Andersen RE', 'Dou Y', 'Alvarez-Buylla A', 'Lim DA']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA.', 'Department of Human Anatomy, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, P.R.

In children, graft manipulation based on the selective removal of abeta T cells and B cells has been shown to reduce the risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, thus allowing the use of haploidentical donors which expands the population of recipients in whom allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be used. Leukemic relapse, however, remains a challenge. T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors can potently eliminate leukemia, including those in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that by engineering the donor abeta T cells that are removed from the graft by genome editing to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor, while simultaneously inactivating the T-cell receptor, we could create a therapy that enhances the anti-leukemic efficacy of the stem cell transplant without increasing the risk of graft-versus-host disease. Using genome editing with Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and adeno-associated virus serotype 6, we integrated a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor inframe into the TRAC locus. More than 90% of cells lost T-cell receptor expression, while >75% expressed the chimeric antigen receptor. The initial product was further purified with less than 0.05% T-cell receptorpositive cells remaining. In vitro, the chimeric antigen receptor T cells efficiently eliminated target cells and produced high cytokine levels when challenged with CD19+ leukemia cells. In vivo, the gene-modified T cells eliminated leukemia without causing graft-versus-host disease in a xenograft model. Gene editing was highly specific with no evidence of off-target effects. These data support the concept that the addition of abeta T-cell-derived, genome-edited T cells expressing CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptors could enhance the anti-leukemic efficacy of abeta T-celldepleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation without increasing the risk of graft-versus-host disease.","['Wiebking, Volker', 'Lee, Ciaran M', 'Mostrel, Nathalie', 'Lahiri, Premanjali', 'Bak, Rasmus', 'Bao, Gang', 'Roncarolo, Maria Grazia', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Porteus, Matthew H']","['Wiebking V', 'Lee CM', 'Mostrel N', 'Lahiri P', 'Bak R', 'Bao G', 'Roncarolo MG', 'Bertaina A', 'Porteus MH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA', 'Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA', 'Laboratory for Cell and Gene Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA', 'Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark', 'Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies (AIAS), Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark', 'Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA', 'Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA', 'Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210301,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/genetics', 'Child', 'Gene Editing', '*Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC7928014,,,,2020/04/04 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.233882 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.233882 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Mar 1;106(3):847-858. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.233882.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the poor prognosis associated with FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutated AML, allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) was commonly performed in first complete remission. Remarkable progress has been made in frontline treatments with the incorporation of FLT3 inhibitors and the development of highly sensitive minimal/measurable residual disease assays. Similarly, recent progress in allogeneic hematopoietic SCT includes improvement of transplant techniques, the use of haploidentical donors in patients lacking an HLA matched donor, and the introduction of FLT3 inhibitors as post-transplant maintenance therapy. Nevertheless, current transplant strategies vary between centers and differ in terms of transplant indications based on the internal tandem duplication allelic ratio and concomitant nucleophos-min-1 mutation, as well as in terms of post-transplant maintenance/consolidation. This review generated by international leukemia or transplant experts, mostly from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, attempts to develop a position statement on best approaches for allogeneic hematopoietic SCT for AML with FLT3-internal tandem duplication including indications for and modalities of such transplants and on the potential optimization of post-transplant maintenance with FLT inhibitors.","['Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Dalle, Iman Abou', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Floisand, Yngvar', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Gilleece, Maria', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Lanza, Francesco', 'Malard, Florent', 'Peric, Zinaida', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Shouval, Roni', 'Spyridonidis, Alexandros', 'Versluis, Jurjen', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Bug G', 'Baron F', 'Brissot E', 'Ciceri F', 'Dalle IA', 'Dohner H', 'Esteve J', 'Floisand Y', 'Giebel S', 'Gilleece M', 'Gorin NC', 'Jabbour E', 'Aljurf M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Kharfan-Dabaja M', 'Labopin M', 'Lanza F', 'Malard F', 'Peric Z', 'Prebet T', 'Ravandi F', 'Ruggeri A', 'Sanz J', 'Schmid C', 'Shouval R', 'Spyridonidis A', 'Versluis J', 'Vey N', 'Savani BN', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon bazarbac@aub.edu.lb.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'GIGA-I3, University and CHU of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC University of Paris 06, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Hematology Department, AP-HP, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University of Milan, Milan, ItalyHematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University Hospital, Ulm, Germany.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcellona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Oslo University Hospital - Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Center for Cancer Cell Reprogramming, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Oncohematology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute - Oncology Center, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Paris Office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematology King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies Program, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party, Paris Study Office, European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC University of Paris 06, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Hematology Department, AP-HP, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Romagna Transplant Network, Ravenna, Italy.', 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC University of Paris 06, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Hematology Department, AP-HP, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'University Hospital Center Zagreb, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Roma, ItalyEurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France."", 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe.

Both compounds were evaluated in vivo as single agents and in combination with sequential (azacitidine, followed by BAY1436032) or simultaneous application in two human IDH1 mutated AML xenograft models. Combination treatment significantly prolonged survival compared to single agent or control treatment (P<.005). The sequential combination treatment depleted leukemia stem cells (LSC) by 470-fold. Interestingly, the simultaneous combination treatment depleted LSCs by 33,150-fold compared to control mice. This strong synergy is mediated through inhibition of MAPK/ERK and RB/E2F signaling.

Translation control is a crucial step in the regulation of gene expression regulation under normal and pathological conditions that ultimately determines cellular fate. In this context, evidence shows that transfer and ribosomal RNA (tRNA and rRNA) modifications affect the efficacy and fidelity of translation. The number of RNA modifications increases with the complexity of organisms, suggesting an evolutionary diversification of the possibilities for fine-tuning the functions of coding and non-coding RNAs. In this review, we focus on alterations of modifications of transfer and ribosomal RNA that affect translation in human cancer. This variation in the RNA modification status can be the result of altered modifier expression (writers, readers or erasers), but also due to components of the machineries (C/D or H/ACA boxes) or alterations of proteins involved in modifier expression. Broadening our understanding of the mechanisms by which site-specific modifications modulate ribosome activity in the context of tumorigenesis will enable us to enrich our knowledge about how ribosomes can influence cell fate and form the basis of new therapeutic opportunities.","['Janin, Maxime', 'Coll-SanMartin, Laia', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Janin M', 'Coll-SanMartin L', 'Esteller M']","['Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200402,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Ribosomal/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7114786,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epitranscriptomics', '*Human cancer', '*Ribosomal RNA', '*Transfer RNA', '*Translation']",2020/04/04 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2020/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-020-01192-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-020-01192-8 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2020 Apr 2;19(1):70. doi: 10.1186/s12943-020-01192-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery of neoantigens is the first key step for tumor-specific antigen (TSA) based immunotherapy. Based on high-throughput tumor genomic analysis, each missense mutation can potentially give rise to multiple neopeptides, resulting in a vast total number, but only a small percentage of these peptides may achieve immune-dominant status with a given major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allele. Specific identification of immunogenic candidate neoantigens is consequently a major challenge. Currently almost all neoantigen prediction tools are based on genomics data. RESULTS: Here we report the construction of proteogenomics prediction of neoantigen (ProGeo-neo) pipeline, which incorporates the following modules: mining tumor specific antigens from next-generation sequencing genomic and mRNA expression data, predicting the binding mutant peptides to class I MHC molecules by latest netMHCpan (v.4.0), verifying MHC-peptides by MaxQuant with mass spectrometry proteomics data searched against customized protein database, and checking potential immunogenicity of T-cell-recognization by additional screening methods. ProGeo-neo pipeline achieves proteogenomics strategy and the neopeptides identified were of much higher quality as compared to those identified using genomic data only. CONCLUSIONS: The pipeline was constructed based on the genomics and proteomics data of Jurkat leukemia cell line but is generally applicable to other solid cancer research. With massively parallel sequencing and proteomics profiling increasing, this proteogenomics workflow should be useful for neoantigen oriented research and immunotherapy.","['Li, Yuyu', 'Wang, Guangzhi', 'Tan, Xiaoxiu', 'Ouyang, Jian', 'Zhang, Menghuan', 'Song, Xiaofeng', 'Liu, Qi', 'Leng, Qibin', 'Chen, Lanming', 'Xie, Lu']","['Li Y', 'Wang G', 'Tan X', 'Ouyang J', 'Zhang M', 'Song X', 'Liu Q', 'Leng Q', 'Chen L', 'Xie L']","['Key Laboratory of Quality and Safety Risk Assessment for Aquatic Products on Storage and Preservation (Shanghai), China Ministry of Agriculture; College of Food Science and Technology, Shanghai Ocean University, 999 Hu Cheng Huan Road, Shanghai, 201306, China.', 'Shanghai Center for Bioinformation Technology, Shanghai Academy of Science and Technology, 1278 Keyuan Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Quality and Safety Risk Assessment for Aquatic Products on Storage and Preservation (Shanghai), China Ministry of Agriculture; College of Food Science and Technology, Shanghai Ocean University, 999 Hu Cheng Huan Road, Shanghai, 201306, China.', 'Shanghai Center for Bioinformation Technology, Shanghai Academy of Science and Technology, 1278 Keyuan Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Shanghai Center for Bioinformation Technology, Shanghai Academy of Science and Technology, 1278 Keyuan Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Shanghai Center for Bioinformation Technology, Shanghai Academy of Science and Technology, 1278 Keyuan Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Shanghai Center for Bioinformation Technology, Shanghai Academy of Science and Technology, 1278 Keyuan Road, Shanghai, 201203, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, 211106, China.', 'Bioinformatics Department, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, 20009, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, 78 Heng Zhi Gang, Lu Hu Road, Guangzhou, 510095, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Quality and Safety Risk Assessment for Aquatic Products on Storage and Preservation (Shanghai), China Ministry of Agriculture; College of Food Science and Technology, Shanghai Ocean University, 999 Hu Cheng Huan Road, Shanghai, 201306, China.

In addition, a considerable number of patients receiving nilotinib developed diabetes. Metformin is a front-line drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and several studies have shown that diabetes patients treated with metformin have reduced incidence of cancer. This study aimed to define the effect of metformin on CML cells to determine whether metformin overcomes nilotinib resistance, and to identify novel targets for the treatment of nilotinib resistance. METHODS: We observed the effects of metformin and nilotinib on K562 and KU812 human CML cell lines. Nilotinib-resistant CML cell lines were generated by exposing cells to gradually increasing doses of nilotinib. Then, we investigated the driving force that makes resistance to nilotinib and the effect of metformin on the driving force. RESULTS: Sub-toxic doses of metformin enhanced nilotinib efficacy by reducing Bcl-xL expression, which induces apoptosis in CML cells. Next, we generated nilotinib-resistant K562 and KU812 cell lines that overexpressed the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) gene. JNK silencing by a JNK inhibitor restored sensitivity to nilotinib. Furthermore, metformin was effective in decreasing phosphorylated JNK levels, restoring nilotinib sensitivity. Combined treatment with nilotinib and metformin was more effective than combined treatment with nilotinib and a JNK inhibitor in terms of cell proliferation inhibition. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that combination therapy with metformin and nilotinib may have clinical benefits of enhancing antileukemia efficacy and overcoming resistance to nilotinib.","['Na, Yoo Jin', 'Yu, Eun Sang', 'Kim, Dae Sik', 'Lee, Dae-Hee', 'Oh, Sang Cheul', 'Choi, Chul Won']","['Na YJ', 'Yu ES', 'Kim DS', 'Lee DH', 'Oh SC', 'Choi CW']","['Brain Korea 21 Plus Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Program for Biomedicine Science, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",,['eng'],['Brain Korea'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200403,Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', '*Metformin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines']",PMC8009173,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-xL', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*JNK', '*Metformin', '*Nilotinib']",2020/04/04 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/04/04 06:00'],"['2019/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['kjim.2019.336 [pii]', '10.3904/kjim.2019.336 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2021 Mar;36(Suppl 1):S196-S206. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2019.336.

Several cooperative groups such as Acute Leukaemia French Association (ALFA), Haematological Oncology Clinical Studies Group (HOCSG) and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) have developed predictive models to select those patients who can benefit from intensive chemotherapy. Our purpose is to validate and compare these three models in a cohort of patients treated in real-life setting. For this, a total of 1724 elderly AML patients and treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens were identified in the PETHEMA registry. Median age was 67.2 years (range, 60-84,9) and median overall survival [OS] 9 months (95 % confidence interval [CI], 8.2-9.7). Taking into account the ALFA group's model, patients likely to benefit from intensive chemotherapy had longer OS (14 months, 95 % CI 12.3-15.7) than those unlikely to benefit (5 months, 95 % CI 4.1-5.9; p < 0.001). Significant differences in OS were observed between patients with favourable risk (17 months, 95 % CI 13.2-20.7), intermediate risk (11 months, 95 % CI 9.3-12.6) and adverse risk (6 months, 95 % CI 5.1-6.4; p < 0.001) according to the HOCSG model. No significant differences in OS were observed between patients with 0, 1, 2 or >/=3 points according to the MDACC model. However, when patients with >/=1 point were compared with those with 0 points, median OS was significantly longer in the latter [15 months (95 % CI 12.1-17.8) vs 7 (95 % CI 5.7-8.5)]. This retrospective study validates predictive models proposed by the ALFA, HOCSG and MDACC groups in this real-life cohort.","['Rodriguez-Medina, Carlos', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Cano, Isabel', 'Gil, Cristina', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Del Pilar Martinez-Sanchez, Maria', 'Del Castillo, Teresa Bernal', 'Serrano-Lopez, Josefina', 'Benavente, Celina', 'Herrera-Puente, Pilar', 'Garcia-Boyero, Raimundo', 'Lavilla-Rubira, Esperanza', 'Amigo, M feminine Luz', 'Sayas-Lloris, M feminineJose', 'Bergua-Burgues, Juan M', 'Perez-Simon, Jose Antonio', 'Rodriguez, Gabriela', 'Espadana, Ana', 'Vidriales-Vicente, Belen', 'Fernandez, Rosa', 'Lopez-Lorenzo, Jose Luis', 'Lopez, Maria', 'Garcia-Fortes, Maria', 'Labrador Gomez, Jorge', 'Colorado-Araujo, Mercedes', 'Sossa-Melo, Claudia Lucia', 'Aguilar, Eliana', 'Montesinos Fernandez, Pau']","['Rodriguez-Medina C', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Cano I', 'Gil C', 'Tormo M', 'Del Pilar Martinez-Sanchez M', 'Del Castillo TB', 'Serrano-Lopez J', 'Benavente C', 'Herrera-Puente P', 'Garcia-Boyero R', 'Lavilla-Rubira E', 'Amigo ML', 'Sayas-Lloris M', 'Bergua-Burgues JM', 'Perez-Simon JA', 'Rodriguez G', 'Espadana A', 'Vidriales-Vicente B', 'Fernandez R', 'Lopez-Lorenzo JL', 'Lopez M', 'Garcia-Fortes M', 'Labrador Gomez J', 'Colorado-Araujo M', 'Sossa-Melo CL', 'Aguilar E', 'Montesinos Fernandez P']","['Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Doctor Negrin, Calle Barranco de la Ballena, s/n, CP 35010 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.

Nevertheless, it is the predominant pediatric liver cancer, with limited therapeutic options for patients with aggressive tumors. Herein, we aimed to uncover the mechanisms of HB pathobiology and to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in a move towards precision medicine for patients with advanced HB. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic characterization of 159 clinically annotated samples from 113 patients with HB, using high-throughput technologies. RESULTS: We discovered a widespread epigenetic footprint of HB that includes hyperediting of the tumor suppressor BLCAP concomitant with a genome-wide dysregulation of RNA editing and the overexpression of mainly non-coding genes of the oncogenic 14q32 DLK1-DIO3 locus. By unsupervised analysis, we identified 2 epigenomic clusters (Epi-CA, Epi-CB) with distinct degrees of DNA hypomethylation and CpG island hypermethylation that are associated with the C1/C2/C2B transcriptomic subtypes. Based on these findings, we defined the first molecular risk stratification of HB (MRS-HB), which encompasses 3 main prognostic categories and improves the current clinical risk stratification approach. The MRS-3 category (28%), defined by strong 14q32 locus expression and Epi-CB methylation features, was characterized by CTNNB1 and NFE2L2 mutations, a progenitor-like phenotype and clinical aggressiveness. Finally, we identified choline kinase alpha as a promising therapeutic target for intermediate and high-risk HBs, as its inhibition in HB cell lines and patient-derived xenografts strongly abrogated tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a detailed insight into the molecular features of HB and could be used to improve current clinical stratification approaches and to develop treatments for patients with HB. LAY SUMMARY: Hepatoblastoma is a rare childhood liver cancer that has been understudied. We have used cutting-edge technologies to expand our molecular knowledge of this cancer.

UBC9 is the only known E2-conjugating enzyme involved in SUMOylation. PML degradation via RNF4, an E3 ubiquitin ligases family member. PML is key organizer of nuclear bodies (NBs) that regulate many biological processes such as senescence, and DNA damage. ATO can activate the TGFbeta/Smad signaling pathway, causing liver fibrosis. However, the roles of PML Sumoylation in ATO-induced liver fibrosis remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of PML Sumoylation in the ATO-induced HSCs activation and to improve the mechanism of ATO-induced liver fibrosis. METHODS: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were treated with 2mumol/L ATO. Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 analysis. Immunoblot analysis and real-time quantitative PCR were used to detect the expression of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, p-Smad2/3, alpha-SMA, Collagen I and PML SUMOylation after silencing PML, UBC9, and RNF4, respectively. The formation of PML-NBs was observed by immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: 2 and 5mumol/L ATO intervention increased HSCs cell viability. ATO was able to significantly trigger PML SUMOylation and the formation of PML-NBs. Inhibition of SUMOylated PML by silencing UBC9, subsequently preventing the downregulation of HSCs activation indicators induced by ATO (P<0.05). Conversely, enhancing SUMOylated PML accumulation by silencing RNF4, activating TGFbeta/Smad signaling pathway, eventually promoting the induction of liver fibrosis. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that PML SUMOylation plays a critical role in the development of liver fibrosis induced by ATO.","['Dai, Jingyuan', 'Hu, Yunhua', 'Niu, Qiang', 'Song, Guanling', 'Wang, Haixia', 'Li, Shugang']","['Dai J', 'Hu Y', 'Niu Q', 'Song G', 'Wang H', 'Li S']","['Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Shihezi University, Shihezi, 832000, Xinjiang, China.', 'Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Shihezi University, Shihezi, 832000, Xinjiang, China.', 'Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Shihezi University, Shihezi, 832000, Xinjiang, China.', 'Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Shihezi University, Shihezi, 832000, Xinjiang, China.', 'Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Shihezi University, Shihezi, 832000, Xinjiang, China.', 'School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, No.10 Xitoutiao, You AnMen Wai, Beijing 100069, China.

Previous studies reported that Rab1A was highly expressed in GC tissues. However, the function and molecular mechanism of Rab1A in gastric cancer (GC) development remain far from being addressed. Rab1A mRNA and protein levels were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 and BrdU incorporation assays. Apoptosis was estimated by flow cytometry analysis and western blot analysis of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), Bcl-2 associated X (Bax), and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) expression. Alteration of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway was detected by western blot. We found that Rab1A expression at both mRNA and protein was upregulated in GC cells. Rab1A knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in GC cells. Rab1A overexpression promoted proliferation, inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and increased xenograft growth. In addition, we found that Rab1A knockdown suppressed the mTOR/p70S6K pathway in GC cells. Moreover, activation of mTOR/p70S6K pathway by MHY1485 abolished the effects of Rab1A knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion, Rab1A knockdown repressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis in GC cells by inhibition of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway.","['Li, Zhong', 'Li, Yuan', 'Jia, Yunhao', 'Ding, Bo', 'Yu, Jinsong']","['Li Z', 'Li Y', 'Jia Y', 'Ding B', 'Yu J']","[""Department of General Surgery, Nanyang First People's Hospital, Nanyang, 473012, China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Nanyang First People's Hospital, Nanyang, 473012, China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Nanyang First People's Hospital, Nanyang, 473012, China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Nanyang First People's Hospital, Nanyang, 473012, China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Nanyang First People's Hospital, Nanyang, 473012, China.

Better understanding of prognostic factors has helped tailor therapy for individual patients, and work continues to identify optimal therapy for each patient. When therapy is required, most patients will be treated with targeted therapies, either the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors ibrutinib or acalabrutinib or the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab. Without head-to-head comparisons showing differential efficacy among these options, considerations regarding safety, patient preference, and ability to sequence therapy currently influence treatment decisions.

The patient was successfully treated with topical emollients and a high-potency corticosteroid. Meanwhile, vemurafenib was temporarily discontinued. Drug-induced GD has increasingly been reported in patients on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy as an immune-related adverse event. The cutaneous side effects seem to arise secondary to a paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling of BRAF inhibitor treatment, leading to keratinocyte proliferation. Although the pathogenesis of GD has not been delineated, there is suggestion of activation of T lymphocytes, particularly helper cells under the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in proliferation of keratinocytes. Combination therapy with a MEK inhibitor appears to prevent BRAF-induced GD. Given that there is a higher prevalence of GD in patients with hematologic malignancy, a direct causal relationship between the initiation of vemurafenib therapy and development of GD in this case may be difficult to establish.","['Singh, Amy Garcia', 'Tchanque-Fossuo, Catherine N', 'Elwood, Hillary', 'Durkin, John R']","['Singh AG', 'Tchanque-Fossuo CN', 'Elwood H', 'Durkin JR']","['Department of Dermatology, University of New Mexico, School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM. durkin@salud.unm.edu.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200215,United States,Dermatol Online J,Dermatology online journal,9610776,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '207SMY3FQT (Vemurafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', ""Grover's disease""]",IM,"['Acantholysis/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Aged', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Humans', 'Ichthyosis/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Remission Induction', 'Skin/pathology', 'Vemurafenib/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,,,2020/04/03 06:00,2020/05/23 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Dermatol Online J. 2020 Feb 15;26(2).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. DIAGNOSIS: CML is characterized by a balanced genetic translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson gene (ABL1) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a BCR-ABL oncoprotein. FRONTLINE THERAPY: Four tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for first-line treatment of newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Clinical trials with second generation TKIs reported significantly deeper and faster responses, but they had no impact on survival prolongation, likely because of the existence of highly effective salvage therapies for patients who have a cytogenetic relapse with frontline TKI. SALVAGE THERAPY: For CML post failure on frontline therapy, second-line options include second and third generation TKIs. Although potent and selective, these exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient and disease characteristics, such as patients' comorbidities, disease stage, and BCR-ABL1 mutational status. Patients who develop the T315I ""gatekeeper"" mutation display resistance to all currently available TKIs except ponatinib. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains an important therapeutic option for patients with CML-CP who have failed at least 2 TKIs, and for all patients in advanced phase disease. Even among older patients who have a cytogenetic relapse post failure on all TKIs, they can maintain long-term survival if they continue on a daily most effective/less toxic TKI, with or without the addition of non-TKI anti-CML agents (hydroxyurea, omacetaxine, azacitidine, decitabine, cytarabine, busulfan, others).","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is often overexpressed or abnormally activated in leukemia and involved in cell self-renewal, proliferation, and stress adaptation. Overexpressed Aurora A (AURKA) is associated with poor prognosis in tumors, and inhibitors against AURKA are already in clinical trials. However, it has rarely been reported whether AURKA inhibitors restrain STAT5-activated leukemia cells. In this study, we constructed STAT5 constitutively activated (cS5) cells and found that STAT5 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation. Moreover, cS5 cells showed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, which indicated higher mitochondrial metabolism in cS5 cells. A novel AURKA inhibitor AKI604 was synthesized and showed significant inhibitory effects to the proliferation and colony formation in both STAT5 constitutively activated and nonactivated AML cells. AKI604 induced mitochondrial impairment, leading to the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and the elevation of ROS as well as cellular calcium (Ca(2+) ) levels. AKI604 could also decline basal oxygen consumption rate and ATP biosynthesis, indicating the damage of oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, AKI604 exhibited significant antitumor effect in the HL-60 cS5 xenograft model of the BALB/c nude mice without an obvious influence on mice body weight and other healthy indicators. This study suggested that AKI604 was a potential strategy to overcome STAT5-induced leukemic proliferation in AML treatment by inducing mitochondrial impairment.","['Wang, Jin-Xing', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Huang, Ze-Wei', 'Zhang, Xue-Ning', 'Jiang, Yan-Yan', 'Liu, Fang-Jie', 'Long, Liang', 'Xue, Man-Jie', 'Lu, Gui', 'Liu, Quentin', 'Long, Zi-Jie']","['Wang JX', 'Zhang L', 'Huang ZW', 'Zhang XN', 'Jiang YY', 'Liu FJ', 'Long L', 'Xue MJ', 'Lu G', 'Liu Q', 'Long ZJ']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Medical Research Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0675-7069', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1616-6019']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200402,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aurora Kinase A/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*AURKA inhibitor', '*STAT5', '*mitochondrial impairment', '*targeted therapy']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29680 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Nov;235(11):8358-8370. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29680.

Further, luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis confirmed that Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli-1) was a direct target of miR-33b. Overexpression of miR-33b dramatically suppressed HCC tumor cell proliferation and cell mobility, but facilitated tumor cell apoptosis in vitro. Besides, restoration of Fli-1 partially attenuated miR-33b-mediated inhibition of cell growth and metastasis via activating Notch1 signaling and its downstream effectors.

Therefore, LSC measurements are warranted to facilitate accurate risk stratification. Previously, we published the composition of a one-tube flow cytometric assay, characterised by the presence of 13 important membrane markers for LSC detection. Here we present the validation experiments of the assay in several large AML research centres, both in Europe and the United States. Variability within instruments and sample processing showed high correlations between different instruments (Rpearson > 0.91, P < 0.001). Multi-centre testing introduced variation in reported LSC percentages but was found to be below the clinical relevant threshold. Clear gating protocols resulted in all laboratories being able to perform LSC assessment of the validation set. Participating centres were nearly unanimously able to distinguish LSC(high) (>0.03% LSC) from LSC(low) (<0.03% LSC) despite inter-laboratory variation in reported LSC percentages. This study proves that the LSC assay is highly reproducible. These results together with the high prognostic impact of LSC load at diagnosis in AML patients render the one-tube LSC assessment a good marker for future risk classification.","['Hanekamp, Diana',

Retinoids are well-known inducers of granulocytic maturation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

Exploring the mechanisms of this repression, we showed that transcription factor binding was dependent on the epigenetic status of hTERT promoter. In the present study, we used APL cells lines and publicly available datasets from APL patients to further investigate the integrated epigenetic events that promote hTERT promoter transition from its silent to its active state, and inversely. We showed, in APL patients, that the methylation of the distal domain of hTERT core promoter was altered and correlated with the outcome of the disease. Further studies combining complementary approaches carried out on APL cell lines highlighted the significance of a domain outside the minimal promoter, localized around 5 kb upstream from the transcription start site, in activating hTERT. This domain is characterized by DNA hypomethylation and H3K4Me3 deposition. Our findings suggest a cooperative interplay between hTERT promoter methylation, chromatin accessibility, and histone modifications that force the revisiting of previously proposed concepts regarding hTERT epigenetic regulation. They represent, therefore, a major advance in predicting sensitivity to retinoid-induced hTERT repression and, more generally, in the potential development of therapies targeting hTERT expression in cancers.","['Garsuault, Delphine', 'Bouyer, Claire', 'Nguyen, Eric', 'Kandhari, Rohan', 'Prochazkova-Carlotti, Martina', 'Chevret, Edith', 'Forgez, Patricia', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, Evelyne']","['Garsuault D', 'Bouyer C', 'Nguyen E', 'Kandhari R', 'Prochazkova-Carlotti M', 'Chevret E', 'Forgez P', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E']","['Team: Cellular Homeostasis, Cancer, and Therapies, INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite de Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Paris Sorbonne Cite, France.', 'Paris-Sud University, Paris-Saclay University, Orsay, France.', 'Team: Cellular Homeostasis, Cancer, and Therapies, INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite de Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Paris Sorbonne Cite, France.', 'Team: Cellular Homeostasis, Cancer, and Therapies, INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite de Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Paris Sorbonne Cite, France.', 'Team: Cellular Homeostasis, Cancer, and Therapies, INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite de Paris, France.', 'Indian Institute of Technology, BHU, Varanasi, India.', 'Team Cutaneous Lymphoma Oncogenesis, INSERM U1053, Bordeaux, France.', 'Team Cutaneous Lymphoma Oncogenesis, INSERM U1053, Bordeaux, France.', 'Team: Cellular Homeostasis, Cancer, and Therapies, INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite de Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Paris Sorbonne Cite, France.', 'Team: Cellular Homeostasis, Cancer, and Therapies, INSERM UMR-S 1124, Universite de Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Paris Sorbonne Cite, France.', 'BioMedTech Facilities, CNRS UMS2009/INSERM US36, Universite de Paris, France.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9813-4880'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200422,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Loci', 'Genome, Human', 'Histone Code/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",PMC7266276,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATRA', '*DNA methylation', '*acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*hTERT promoter', '*histone marks', '*telomerase']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/07/01 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12681 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2020 Jun;14(6):1310-1326. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12681.

Treatment includes administration of glucarpidase, an enzyme that rapidly inactivates MTX. Dosing of glucarpidase is based on body weight; however, recommendations for dosage adjustments in obese patients are lacking. We describe three obese adult patients (body mass index [BMI] range 31-43 kg/m(2) ) who received HD-MTX following all precautions for its treatment. Although peak MTX concentrations were within the expected range (308-368 micromol/L), MTX concentrations after 24 hours or later were markedly increased (97, 52, and 19 micromol/L, respectively). Two patients experienced AKI. After a single intravenous dose of glucarpidase 4000 units (50 units/kg on the basis of ideal body weight [IBW]) was administered to each patient 38, 46, and 60 hours, respectively, after the start of MTX, MTX concentrations dropped quickly to 1.37, 0.07, and 0.03 micromol/L, respectively, and further decreased steadily. Over time, clinical status and renal function improved in all patients. Glucarpidase is a highly hydrophilic molecule with a volume of distribution of 3.6 L, representing the intravascular volume of an adult. Therefore, we used IBW for glucarpidase dose calculations, allowing us to reduce the dose that would have been determined by using total body weight. This approach resulted in a rapid decrease of MTX serum concentrations and may reduce treatment costs of this highly expensive drug.","['Kruger, Caroline', 'Engel, Nils', 'Reinert, Jochim', 'Alsdorf, Winfried', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Dierlamm, Judith', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Langebrake, Claudia']","['Kruger C', 'Engel N', 'Reinert J', 'Alsdorf W', 'Fiedler W', 'Dierlamm J', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Langebrake C']","['Hospital Pharmacy, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Hospital Pharmacy, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1249-4223'],['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200420,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '2GFP9BJD79 (glucarpidase)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ideal Body Weight', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Obesity, Morbid', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*glucarpidase', '*high dose', '*methotrexate', '*obesity']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/phar.2390 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2020 May;40(5):479-483. doi: 10.1002/phar.2390.

Yet, many features of these genes and their role in cancer remain unclear, first and foremost when a somatic mutation is truly oncogenic. In this review, we first summarize some of the recent efforts in completing the catalogue of cancer driver genes. Then, we give an overview of different aspects that influence the oncogenicity of somatic mutations in the core cancer driver genes, including their interactions with the germline genome, other cancer driver mutations, the immune system, or their potential role in healthy tissues. In the coming years, this research holds promise to illuminate how, when, and why cancer driver genes and mutations are really drivers, and thereby move personalized cancer medicine and targeted therapies forward.","['Porta-Pardo, Eduard', 'Valencia, Alfonso', 'Godzik, Adam']","['Porta-Pardo E', 'Valencia A', 'Godzik A']","['Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca I Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Biomedical Sciences, University of California Riverside School of Medicine, Riverside, CA, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2425-852X'],['eng'],['R35 GM118187/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200428,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,,IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', '*Genomics', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/*genetics']",PMC7529711,['NIHMS1584848'],['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer drivers', '*cancer genes', '*multiscale analysis', '*personalized medicine', '*variants of unknown significance']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1873-3468.13781 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2020 Dec;594(24):4233-4246. doi: 10.1002/1873-3468.13781.

These mechanisms involve a number of homeostatic modules, which are regulated at the level of gene expression by the transactivator NF-kappaB. This transcription factor shifts between activation and repression of discrete, cell-dependent gene expression clusters. Some of its target genes provide feedback to NF-kappaB itself, thereby strengthening the inflammatory response of the tissue and later terminating inflammation to facilitate restoration of tissue homeostasis. Disruption of key feedback modules for NF-kappaB in certain cell types facilitates the survival of clones with genomic aberrations, and protects them from being recognized and eliminated by the immune system, to enable thereby carcinogenesis.","['Lambrou, George I', 'Hatziagapiou, Kyriaki', 'Vlahopoulos, Spiros']","['Lambrou GI', 'Hatziagapiou K', 'Vlahopoulos S']","['First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Thivon & Levadeias 8, 11527, Goudi-Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Thivon & Levadeias 8, 11527, Goudi-Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Thivon & Levadeias 8, 11527, Goudi-Athens, Greece. sblachop@med.uoa.gr.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8389-1360', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1469-1928', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6245-3863']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200401,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Homeostasis/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/*metabolism/*physiology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Innate immunity', 'Leukemia', 'NF-kappaB', 'Tissue homeostasis']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-020-05410-w [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-020-05410-w [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2020 May;47(5):4047-4063. doi: 10.1007/s11033-020-05410-w.

They are known to bind to the ubiquitin 3 ligase CRBN complex and thereby triggering degradation of IKZF1/3. In this study, we demonstrate that IMiDs also directly bind and activate zeta-chain-associated protein kinase-70 (Zap-70) via its tyrosine residue phosphorylation in T cells. IMiDs also triggered phosphorylation of Zap-70 in natural killer (NK) cells. Importantly, increased granzyme-B (GZM-B) expression and NK-cell activity triggered by IMiDs is associated with Zap-70 activation and inhibited by Zap-70 knockdown (KD), independent of CRBN. We also demonstrate a second mechanism whereby IMiDs trigger GZM-B and NK cytotoxicity which is CRBN and IKZF3 mediated, and inhibited or enhanced by KD of CRBN or IKZF3, respectively, independent of Zap-70. Our studies therefore show that IMiDs can enhance NK and T-cell cytotoxicity in (1) ZAP-70-mediated CRBN independent, as well as (2) CRBN-mediated ZAP-70 independent mechanisms; and provide the framework for developing novel therapeutics to activate Zap-70 and thereby enhance T and NK anti-MM cytotoxicity.","['Hideshima, Teru', 'Ogiya, Daisuke', 'Liu, Jiye', 'Harada, Takeshi', 'Kurata, Keiji', 'Bae, Jooeun', 'Massefski, Walter', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Hideshima T', 'Ogiya D', 'Liu J', 'Harada T', 'Kurata K', 'Bae J', 'Massefski W', 'Anderson KC']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Bioregulatory Sciences, University of Tokushima Graduate School of Medicine, 3-18-15 Kuramoto, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry Instrumentation Facility, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. kenneth_anderson@dfci.harvard.edu.']",,['eng'],"['P01 CA155258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200401,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRBN protein, human)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Immunomodulation/drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",PMC7529681,['NIHMS1578112'],,,2020/04/03 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0809-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0809-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Jan;35(1):177-188. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0809-x.

METHODS: This retrospective study included 72 patients who underwent autologous PBSC collection. A median volume of 3.9 x 10(6) CD34-positive cells/kg (range: 0.3-47.4 x 10(6) cells/kg) was collected on the first day. We defined failure as inability to collect 2.0 x 10(6) cells/kg on the first day. PBSC collection was classified as failed (n = 25, 34.7%) and successful (n = 47, 65.3%), and patient clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The success group had significantly more cases in which a differential white blood cell count in peripheral blood on the day of PBSC collection detected promyelocytes (n = 34 [72.3%] vs. n = 11 [44.0%] in the failure group; P = 0.008). Sixty-two patients underwent autologous PBSC transplantation (median number of transplanted cells, 5.6 x 10(6)/muL; range: 1.60-47.4 x 10(6) cells/muL). Among transplanted patients, the success and failure groups did not significantly differ in relation to the interval until neutrophil, platelet, or red blood cell engraftment. CONCLUSION: The presence of promyelocytes in peripheral blood may be a useful indicator of the optimal timing for single-step PBSC collection.","['Marumo, Atsushi', 'Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Hirakawa, Tsuneaki', 'Inai, Kazuki', 'Onai, Daishi', 'Omori, Ikuko', 'Yamanaka, Satoshi', 'Fujiwara, Yusuke', 'Sakaguchi, Masahiro', 'Wakita, Satoshi', 'Okamoto, Muneo', 'Yui, Shunsuke', 'Inokuchi, Koiti']","['Marumo A', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Hirakawa T', 'Inai K', 'Onai D', 'Omori I', 'Yamanaka S', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Sakaguchi M', 'Wakita S', 'Okamoto M', 'Yui S', 'Inokuchi K']","['Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200331,Japan,J Nippon Med Sch,Journal of Nippon Medical School = Nippon Ika Daigaku zasshi,100935589,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Female', '*Granulocyte Precursor Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cells', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['malignant lymphoma', 'multiple myeloma', 'peripheral blood stem cell transplantation', 'stem cell collection']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1272/jnms.JNMS.2021_88-104 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nippon Med Sch. 2021 Mar 11;88(1):45-53. doi: 10.1272/jnms.JNMS.2021_88-104.

The risk status was evaluated by determining the frequency of recurring gene mutations using next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of 23 selected genes and cytogenetic profiling of bone marrow samples at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 12 months (range: 2-82 months), 86 patients (68.8%) had achieved complete remission after one cycle of induction, and 94 patients (75.2%) had achieved it after two cycles. The median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 16 and 12 months, respectively. In 21 AML patients aged above 75 years, the median OS and DFS were longer in the low- and intermediate-risk group than the high-risk group, but the differences were not statistically significant. The median OS and DFS were similar in patients with or without TET2, DNMT3A, IDH2, TP53 and FLT3 mutations. Multivariate analysis showed that patient age above 75 years, high-risk status, and genetic anomalies, like deletions in chromosomes 5 and/or 7, were significant variables in predicting OS. D-CAG regimen tends to improve the prognosis of a subgroup of elderly patients with high-risk AML.","['Hong, Ming', 'Zhu, Han', 'Sun, Qian', 'Zhu, Yu', 'Miao, Yi', 'Yang, Hui', 'Qiu, Hai-Rong', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Qian, Si-Xuan']","['Hong M', 'Zhu H', 'Sun Q', 'Zhu Y', 'Miao Y', 'Yang H', 'Qiu HR', 'Li JY', 'Qian SX']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'The Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200401,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Decitabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7185116,,['NOTNLM'],"['*D-CAG', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*elderly', '*high-risk']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.18632/aging.102973 [doi]', '102973 [pii]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Apr 1;12(7):5792-5811. doi: 10.18632/aging.102973.

We identified a novel ZBTB20-JAK2 gene fusion as a chimeric RNA transcript using the Archer platform. This gene fusion from the same patient was recently identified by Peterson et al. (2019) at the genomic level using a different sequencing technology platform. The configuration of this gene fusion predicts the production of a kinase-activating JAK2 fusion protein, which would normally lead to a diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome-like B-ALL (Ph-like B-ALL). However, the unusual presentation of eosinophilia led us to demonstrate the presence of this gene fusion in nonlymphoid hematopoietic cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies with morphologic correlation. Therefore, we believe this disease, in fact, represents blast crisis arising from an underlying myeloid neoplasm with JAK2 rearrangements. This case illustrates the difficulty in differentiating Ph-like B-ALL and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia and gene rearrangements (MLN-EGR) in blast crisis. As currently defined, the diagnosis of MLN-EGR relies on the hematologic presentations and the identification of marker gene fusions (including PCM1-JAK2, ETV6-JAK2, and BCR-JAK2). However, these same gene fusions, when limited to B-lymphoblasts, also define Ph-like B-ALL. Yet, our case does not conform to either condition. Therefore, the assessment for lineage restriction of gene rearrangements to reflect the pathophysiologic difference between B-ALL and MLN-EGR in blast crisis is likely a more robust diagnostic approach and allows the inclusion of MLN-EGR with novel gene fusions.","['Lee, Winston Y', 'Pfau, Ruthann B', 'Choi, Sarah M', 'Yang, Jiong', 'Xiao, Hong', 'Putnam, Eileen M', 'Ryan, Russell Jh', 'Bixby, Dale L', 'Shao, Lina']","['Lee WY', 'Pfau RB', 'Choi SM', 'Yang J', 'Xiao H', 'Putnam EM', 'Ryan RJ', 'Bixby DL', 'Shao L']","['Department of Pathology, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2800, USA.', ""Institute of Genomic Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital and Department of Pathology, the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43205-2664, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2800, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2800, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2800, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2800, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2800, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2800, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2800, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200401,United States,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies,101660017,"['0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB20 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'Pdgfrb-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/diagnosis/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Therapeutics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC7133749,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*eosinophilia', '*pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['mcs.a004937 [pii]', '10.1101/mcs.a004937 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud. 2020 Apr 1;6(2). pii: mcs.a004937. doi: 10.1101/mcs.a004937.

METHODS: We delineate expansion methods using interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7 and allogeneic feeder cells and anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 stimulation by which to dependably augment Th2 polarization and direct cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood CD3(+)Valpha24(+)Vbeta11(+) iNKT cells. RESULTS: Gene and protein expression profiling demonstrated augmented Th2 cytokine secretion (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) in expanded iNKT cells stimulated with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 antibodies. Cytotoxic effector molecules including granzyme B were increased in expanded iNKT cells after CD2/CD3/CD28 stimulation. Direct cytotoxicity assays using unstimulated expanded iNKT cell effectors revealed alpha-galactosyl ceramide (alpha-GalCer)-dependent killing of the T-ALL cell line Jurkat. Moreover, CD2/CD3/CD28 stimulation of expanded iNKT cells augmented their (alpha-GalCer-independent) killing of Jurkat cells. Co-culture of expanded iNKT cells with stimulated responder cells confirmed contact-dependent inhibition of activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) responder T cells. DISCUSSION: These data establish a robust protocol to expand and novel pathways to enhance Th2 cytokine secretion and direct cytotoxicity in human iNKT cells, findings with direct implications for autoimmunity, vaccine augmentation and anti-infective immunity, cancer immunotherapy and transplantation.","['Andrews, Kelly', 'Hamers, Anouk A J', 'Sun, Xiaodian', 'Neale, Geoffrey', 'Verbist, Katherine', 'Tedrick, Paige', 'Nichols, Kim E', 'Pereira, Shalini', 'Geraghty, Daniel E', 'Pillai, Asha B']","['Andrews K', 'Hamers AAJ', 'Sun X', 'Neale G', 'Verbist K', 'Tedrick P', 'Nichols KE', 'Pereira S', 'Geraghty DE', 'Pillai AB']","[""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Departments of Pediatrics and Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."", 'Departments of Pediatrics and Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', ""Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Scisco Genetics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Scisco Genetics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA; Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Departments of Pediatrics and Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.

These genetic associations provide a powerful opportunity for understanding the etiology of human disease. HLA class I associations are often interpreted in the light of 'protective' or 'detrimental' CD8(+) T cell responses which are restricted by the host HLA class I allotype. However, given the diverse receptors which are bound by HLA class I molecules, alternative interpretations are possible. As well as binding T cell receptors on CD8(+) T cells, HLA class I molecules are important ligands for inhibitory and activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) which are found on natural killer cells and some T cells; for the CD94:NKG2 family of receptors also expressed mainly by NK cells and for leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) on myeloid cells. The aim of this study is to develop an immunogenetic approach for identifying and quantifying the relative contribution of different receptor-ligand interactions to a given HLA class I disease association and then to use this approach to investigate the immune interactions underlying HLA class I disease associations in three viral infections: Human T cell Leukemia Virus type 1, Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 and Hepatitis C Virus as well as in the inflammatory condition Crohn's disease.","['Debebe, Bisrat J', 'Boelen, Lies', 'Lee, James C', 'Thio, Chloe L', 'Astemborski, Jacquie', 'Kirk, Gregory', 'Khakoo, Salim I', 'Donfield, Sharyne M', 'Goedert, James J', 'Asquith, Becca']","['Debebe BJ', 'Boelen L', 'Lee JC', 'Thio CL', 'Astemborski J', 'Kirk G', 'Khakoo SI', 'Donfield SM', 'Goedert JJ', 'Asquith B']","['Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Rho, Chapel Hill, Durham, United States.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, United States.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5911-3160'],['eng'],"['U01 DA036297/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', '317040/European Union Seventh Framework Programme', '105920/Z/14/Z/Wellcome', '317040/European Commission', '15012/Bloodwise', 'R01 HD041224/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 AI118591/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 OD011132/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'G1001052/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '103865Z/14/Z/Wellcome', 'R01 DA013324/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'MR/J007439/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'DA13324/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'J007439/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 DA012568/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200402,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Crohn Disease/immunology', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'HIV-1', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Hepatitis C/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR/metabolism']",PMC7253178,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD8 T cell', '*GWAS', '*HLA', '*computational biology', '*disease association', '*human', '*immunogenetics', '*immunology', '*inflammation', '*natural killer cell', '*systems biology']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.54558 [doi]', '54558 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2020 Apr 2;9. pii: 54558. doi: 10.7554/eLife.54558.,,,['Elife. 2020 May 14;9:.

METHODS: The expression of eIF3b was inhibited by transfecting aspecifically designed shRNA into the CML cell lines of TK-6 and K562. The CCK8 assay was conducted to determine cell viability, and flow cytometry was used to examine the change in the cell cycle and cell apoptosis. RNAsequencing was applied to screen the candidate targets of eIF3b to identify the underlying mechanisms of eIF3b.An in vivo tumour xenograft mouse model was established by injecting shRNA transfected cells into the NCG mice. The tumour size and body weight of mice were monitored every other day. The mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after the tumour cell injection. The expression of eIF3b and target genes in the tumour tissues were determined by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. RESULTS: The group with inhibited expression of eIF3b led to about 50% lower cell viability compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05). Flow cytometry suggested that the percentage of increase in apoptotic cells was eight times higher than those in control group for TK-6 and K562 cells (P < 0.05). However, the difference between the cell amounts in the S phase for the experiment and control groups was not significant. After RNAsequencing and further validation via qPCR, C3G was screened as the potential target of eIF3b involved in the cell proliferation and apoptosis of CML cell lines. Subsequent in vivo analysis proved that the inhibition of eIF3b suppressed tumour formation and decreased C3G expression, thereby indicating that C3G was the potential target of eIF3b. CONCLUSION: eIF3b is correlated with the cell proliferation and cell apoptosis of CML. Moreover, eIF3b regulation most probably occurs via regulating the expression of C3G.","['Huang, Laiquan', 'Wei, Zhongling', 'Chang, Xiangxiang', 'Zheng, Xinyuan', 'Yan, Jiawei', 'Huang, Jun', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Sheng, Lili']","['Huang L', 'Wei Z', 'Chang X', 'Zheng X', 'Yan J', 'Huang J', 'Zhang J', 'Sheng L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College (Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College), Wuhu City, 241001, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College (Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College), Wuhu City, 241001, Anhui Province, China.', 'Wannan Medical College, Wuhu City, 241001, Anhui Province, China.', 'Wannan Medical College, Wuhu City, 241001, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College (Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College), Wuhu City, 241001, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College (Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College), Wuhu City, 241001, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College (Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College), Wuhu City, 241001, Anhui Province, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College (Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College), No. 2 Zheshan West Road, Wuhu City, 241001, Anhui Province, China. xiwen708391@163.com.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200331,Netherlands,Biotechnol Lett,Biotechnology letters,8008051,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide-Releasing Factor 2)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (TRIP-1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide-Releasing Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Mice']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['C3G', 'Cell apoptosis', 'Cell proliferation', 'Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'eIF3b']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10529-020-02878-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10529-020-02878-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Lett. 2020 Jul;42(7):1275-1286. doi: 10.1007/s10529-020-02878-1.

However, acquired resistance significantly limits the efficacy of EGFRTKIs and consequently, the current chemotherapeutic strategies for NSCLCs. It is, therefore, necessary to overcome this resistance. In the present study, the anticancer potential of natural extracts of Coptis chinensis (ECC) against gefitinibresistant (GR) NSCLC cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo. ECC inhibited the viability, migration and invasion, and effectively induced the apoptosis of GR cells. These effects were associated with the suppression of EGFR/AKT signaling and the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, Mcl1 and Bcl2, which were overexpressed in GR NSCLC cells. Combination treatment with ECC and gefitinib enhanced the sensitivity of GR cells to gefitinib in vitro, but not in vivo. However, ECC increased the survival of individual zebrafish without affecting the anticancer effect to cancer cells in vivo, which indicated a specific cytotoxic effect of ECC on cancer cells, but not on normal cells; this is an important property for the development of novel anticancer drugs. On the whole, the findings of the present study indicate the potential of ECC for use in the treatment of NSCLC, particularly in combination with EGFRTKI therapy, in EGFRTKIresistant cancers.","['Kim, Jae Hwan', 'Ko, Eun Sun', 'Kim, Dasom', 'Park, Seong-Hee', 'Kim, Eun-Jung', 'Rho, Jinkyung', 'Seo, Hyemin', 'Kim, Min Jung', 'Yang, Woong Mo', 'Ha, In Jin', 'Park, Myung-Jin', 'Lee, Ji-Yun']","['Kim JH', 'Ko ES', 'Kim D', 'Park SH', 'Kim EJ', 'Rho J', 'Seo H', 'Kim MJ', 'Yang WM', 'Ha IJ', 'Park MJ', 'Lee JY']","['Department of Pathology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, College of Oriental Medicine, Dongguk University, Gyeongjusi, Gyeongsangbukdo 38066, Republic of Korea.', 'Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, College of Medicine, University of Ulsan, Seoul 05505, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Biological Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Korean Medicine Clinical Trial Center (KCTC), Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Radiation Cancer Research, Research Center for RadioSenescence, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200324,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phytochemicals)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coptis/*chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gefitinib/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phytochemicals/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Zebrafish']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Coptis chinensis', '*epidermal growth factor receptor', '*gefitinib', '*epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance', '*apoptosis']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2020.5025 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2020 Jun;56(6):1540-1550. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2020.5025.

In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) subjects receiving PIbased treatment, an impressive decrease in the amount of HIVassociated cancers, unconnected to viral burden or CD4 amount was observed. Research has reported that PIs have influence on cancer proliferation, spread, and survival as an effect on endoplasmic reticulum stress, proteasome, NFkappaB and Akt signalling. Nelfinavir (NFV) is a nonpeptidic PI that functions by connecting to the catalytic site of the HIV protease, thus stopping the cleavage of viral polyprotein into complete, operative proteins that are fundamental for viral survival. NFV, currently not frequently employed for antiretroviral treatment, has demonstrated noteworthy off target effects in tumor patients with or without HIV disease. NFV appears to cause cell death in tumor cells by different mechanisms, which include necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy. In this review, data from preclinical research and clinical trials are reported and the mechanisms of action of NFV and their results in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and especially in patients with multiple myeloma are examined. In the future, experimental studies may help identify the role of NFV in cancer treatment and may promote the application of this drug into daily clinical practice.","['Allegra, A', 'Innao, V', 'Allegra, A G', 'Pulvirenti, N', 'Pugliese, M', 'Musolino, C']","['Allegra A', 'Innao V', 'Allegra AG', 'Pulvirenti N', 'Pugliese M', 'Musolino C']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood 'Gaetano Barresi', University of Messina, I98125 Messina, Italy."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood 'Gaetano Barresi', University of Messina, I98125 Messina, Italy."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood 'Gaetano Barresi', University of Messina, I98125 Messina, Italy."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood 'Gaetano Barresi', University of Messina, I98125 Messina, Italy."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood 'Gaetano Barresi', University of Messina, I98125 Messina, Italy."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood 'Gaetano Barresi', University of Messina, I98125 Messina, Italy.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200326,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'HO3OGH5D7I (Nelfinavir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Nelfinavir/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV', '*protease inhibitors', '*nelfinavir', '*endoplasmic reticulum stress', '*proteasome', '*hematologic malignancies', '*multiple myeloma']",2020/04/03 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2020.7562 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2020 Jun;43(6):1729-1736. doi: 10.3892/or.2020.7562.

ASXL1 is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies. We previously found that ASXL1 forms together with BAP1 a complex that can deubiquitinylate mono-ubiquitinylated lysine 119 on histone H2A (H2AK119ub1), a Polycomb repressive mark. However, a complete mechanistic understanding of ASXL1 in transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression remains to be defined. Here, we find that depletion of Asxl1 confers murine 32D cells to IL3-independent growth at least partly due to sustained activation of PI3K/AKT signaling. Consistently, Asxl1 is critical for the transcriptional activation of Pten, a key negative regulator of AKT activity. Then we confirm that Asxl1 is specifically enriched and required for H2AK119 deubiquitylation at the Pten promoter. Interestingly, ASXL1 and PTEN expression levels are positively correlated in human blood cells and ASXL1 mutations are associated with lower expression levels of PTEN in human myeloid malignancies. Furthermore, malignant cells with ASXL1 downregulation or mutations exhibit higher sensitivity to the AKT inhibitor MK2206. Collectively, this study has linked the PTEN/AKT signaling axis to deregulated epigenetic changes in myeloid malignancies. It also provides a rationale for mechanism-based therapy for patients with ASXL1 mutations.","['Cao, Lei', 'Xia, Xianyou', 'Kong, Yu', 'Jia, Fengqin', 'Yuan, Bo', 'Li, Rui', 'Li, Qian', 'Wang, Yuxin',

The highly conserved protein nuclear RNA export factor1 (Nxf1) is an important mediator of this process. Although studies in yeast and in human cell lines have shed light on the biochemical mechanisms of Nxf1 function, its contribution to mammalian physiology is less clear. Several groups have identified recurrent NXF1 mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), placing it alongside several RNA-metabolism factors (including SF3B1, XPO, RPS15) whose dysregulation is thought to contribute to CLL pathogenesis. We report here an allelic series of germline point mutations in murine Nxf1. Mice heterozygous for these loss-of-function Nxf1 mutations exhibit thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, together with milder hematological defects. This is primarily caused by cell-intrinsic defects in the survival of platelets and peripheral lymphocytes, which are sensitized to intrinsic apoptosis. In contrast, Nxf1 mutations have almost no effect on red blood cell homeostasis. Comparative transcriptome analysis of platelets, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes from Nxf1-mutant mice shows that, in response to impaired Nxf1 function, the cytoplasmic representation of transcripts encoding regulators of RNA metabolism is altered in a unique, lineage-specific way. Thus, blood cell lineages exhibit differential requirements for Nxf1-mediated global mRNA export.","['Chappaz, Stephane', 'Law, Charity W', 'Dowling, Mark R', 'Carey, Kirstyn T', 'Lane, Rachael M', 'Ngo, Linh H', 'Wickramasinghe, Vihandha O', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Ritchie, Matthew E', 'Kile, Benjamin T']","['Chappaz S', 'Law CW', 'Dowling MR', 'Carey KT', 'Lane RM', 'Ngo LH', 'Wickramasinghe VO', 'Smyth GK', 'Ritchie ME', 'Kile BT']","['Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF) Chemical Biology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Epigenetics and Development Division and.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Immunology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'RNA Biology and Cancer Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'RNA Biology and Cancer Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'RNA Biology and Cancer Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Bioinformatics Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia; and.', 'School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Epigenetics and Development Division and.', 'Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF) Chemical Biology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (NXF1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Germ Cells', '*Lymphopenia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Viral', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Thrombocytopenia/genetics']",PMC7160253,,,,2020/04/03 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2019/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31388-4 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001323 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Apr 14;4(7):1270-1283. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001323.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isavuconazole (ISAV) is an extended spectrum mold-active triazole and has superior tolerability and fewer significant drug-drug interactions compared with other triazoles. METHODS: In our investigator-initiated, phase 2 trial, treatment-naive adult patients with AML or MDS starting RIC received ISAV per the dosing recommendations in the US label until neutrophil recovery (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >/= 0.5 x 109/L) and attainment of complete remission, occurrence of invasive fungal infection (IFI), or for a maximum of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFI during ISAV PAP and up to 30 days after the last dose. RESULTS: Sixty-five of 75 enrolled patients received ISAV PAP (median age, 67 years, median ANC at enrollment, 0.72 x 109/L). Thirty-two patients (49%) received oral targeted leukemia treatments (venetoclax, FTL3 inhibitors). Including the 30-day follow-up period, probable/proven and possible IFIs were encountered in 4 (6%) and 8 patients (12%), respectively. ISAV trough serum concentrations were consistently > 1 microg/mL, showed low intraindividual variation, and were not significantly influenced by chemotherapy regimen. Tolerability of ISAV was excellent, with only 3 cases (5%) of mild to moderate elevations of liver function tests and no QTc prolongations. CONCLUSIONS: ISAV is a safe and effective alternative for PAP in patients with newly diagnosed AML/MDS undergoing RIC in the era of recently approved or emerging small-molecule antileukemia therapies.

However, less than 5% of BLV-infected cattle will develop lymphoma, suggesting that, in addition to viral infection, host genetic polymorphisms might play a role in disease susceptibility. Bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3 is a highly polymorphic gene associated with BLV proviral load (PVL) susceptibility. Due to the fact that PVL is positively associated with disease progression, it is believed that controlling PVL can prevent lymphoma development. Thus, many studies have focused on the relationship between PVL and BoLA-DRB3. Despite this, there is little information regarding the relationship between lymphoma and BoLA-DRB3. Furthermore, whether or not PVL-associated BoLA-DRB3 is linked to lymphoma-associated BoLA-DRB3 has not been clarified. Here, we investigated whether or not lymphoma-associated BoLA-DRB3 is correlated with PVL-associated BoLA-DRB3. We demonstrate that two BoLA-DRB3 alleles were specifically associated with lymphoma resistance (*010:01 and *011:01), but no lymphoma-specific susceptibility alleles were found; furthermore, two other alleles, *002:01 and *012:01, were associated with PVL resistance and susceptibility, respectively. In contrast, lymphoma and PVL shared two resistance-associated (DRB3*014:01:01 and *009:02) BoLA-DRB3 alleles. Interestingly, we found that PVL associated alleles, but not lymphoma associated alleles, are related with the anti-BLV gp51 antibody production level in cows. Overall, our study is the first to demonstrate that the BoLA-DRB3 polymorphism confers differential susceptibility to BLV-induced lymphoma and PVL.","['Lo, Chieh-Wen', 'Borjigin, Liushiqi', 'Saito, Susumu', 'Fukunaga, Koya', 'Saitou, Etsuko', 'Okazaki, Katsunori', 'Mizutani, Tetsuya', 'Wada, Satoshi', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Lo CW', 'Borjigin L', 'Saito S', 'Fukunaga K', 'Saitou E', 'Okazaki K', 'Mizutani T', 'Wada S', 'Takeshima SN', 'Aida Y']","['Laboratory of Global Animal Resource Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, the University of Tokyo, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Research and Education Center for Prevention of Global Infectious Diseases of Animals, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Pharmacogenomics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama City, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.', 'Hyogo Prefectural Awaji Meat Inspection Center, 49-18 Shitoorinagata, Minamiawaji, Hyogo 656-0152, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, 1757 Kanazawa, Ishikari-Tobetsu, Hokkaido 061-0293, Japan.', 'Research and Education Center for Prevention of Global Infectious Diseases of Animals, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Department of Food and Nutrition, Jumonji University, Niiza, Saitama 352-8510, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Animal Resource Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, the University of Tokyo, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Research and Education Center for Prevention of Global Infectious Diseases of Animals, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1890-4916'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200322,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (BoLA-DRB3 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*complications/*virology', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/*veterinary', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Viral Load']",PMC7150773,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BoLA-DRB3', '*association study', '*bovine leukemia virus', '*lymphoma', '*polymorphism', '*proviral load', '*resistance', '*susceptibility']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/02/18 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['v12030352 [pii]', '10.3390/v12030352 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2020 Mar 22;12(3). pii: v12030352. doi: 10.3390/v12030352.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atypical Anemia as a Clue for an Early Diagnosis.,,E2374 [pii] 10.3390/ijms21072374 [doi],"Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by mild microcytic anemia, diabetes, retinopathy, liver disease, and progressive neurological symptoms due to iron accumulation in pancreas, retina, liver, and brain. The disease is caused by mutations in the Ceruloplasmin (CP) gene that produce a strong reduction or absence of ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity, leading to an impairment of iron metabolism. Most patients described so far are from Japan. Prompt diagnosis and therapy are crucial to prevent neurological complications since, once established, they are usually irreversible. Here, we describe the largest series of non-Japanese patients with aceruloplasminemia published so far, including 13 individuals from 11 families carrying 13 mutations in the CP gene (7 missense, 3 frameshifts, and 3 splicing mutations), 10 of which are novel. All missense mutations were studied by computational modeling. Clinical manifestations were heterogeneous, but anemia, often but not necessarily microcytic, was frequently the earliest one. This study confirms the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of aceruloplasminemia, a disease expected to be increasingly diagnosed in the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) era. Unexplained anemia with low transferrin saturation and high ferritin levels without inflammation should prompt the suspicion of aceruloplasminemia, which can be easily confirmed by low serum ceruloplasmin levels. Collaborative joint efforts are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of this potentially disabling disease.","['Vila Cuenca, Marc', 'Marchi, Giacomo', 'Barque, Anna', 'Esteban-Jurado, Clara', 'Marchetto, Alessandro', 'Giorgetti, Alejandro', 'Chelban, Viorica', 'Houlden, Henry', 'Wood, Nicholas W', 'Piubelli, Chiara', 'Dorigatti Borges, Marina', 'Martins de Albuquerque, Dulcineia', 'Yotsumoto Fertrin, Kleber', 'Jove-Buxeda, Ester', 'Sanchez-Delgado, Jordi', 'Baena-Diez, Neus', 'Burnyte, Birute', 'Utkus, Algirdas', 'Busti, Fabiana', 'Kaubrys, Gintaras', 'Suku, Eda', 'Kowalczyk, Kamil', 'Karaszewski, Bartosz', 'Porter, John B', 'Pollard, Sally', 'Eleftheriou, Perla', 'Bignell, Patricia', 'Girelli, Domenico', 'Sanchez, Mayka']","['Vila Cuenca M', 'Marchi G', 'Barque A', 'Esteban-Jurado C', 'Marchetto A', 'Giorgetti A', 'Chelban V', 'Houlden H', 'Wood NW', 'Piubelli C', 'Dorigatti Borges M', 'Martins de Albuquerque D', 'Yotsumoto Fertrin K', 'Jove-Buxeda E', 'Sanchez-Delgado J', 'Baena-Diez N', 'Burnyte B', 'Utkus A', 'Busti F', 'Kaubrys G', 'Suku E', 'Kowalczyk K', 'Karaszewski B', 'Porter JB', 'Pollard S', 'Eleftheriou P', 'Bignell P', 'Girelli D', 'Sanchez M']","['Iron Metabolism: Regulation and Diseases Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'EuroBloodNet Referral Center for Iron Disorders and Gruppo Interdisciplinare Malattie del Ferro, Internal Medicine Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Iron Metabolism: Regulation and Diseases Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Iron Metabolism: Regulation and Diseases Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London WC1N 3BG, UK.', 'Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, Institute of Neurology, University College London, London WC1N 3BG, UK.', 'Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Institute of Emergency Medicine, Toma Ciorba 1, Chisinau, MD-2052 Chisinau, Republic of Moldova.', 'National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London WC1N 3BG, UK.', 'Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, Institute of Neurology, University College London, London WC1N 3BG, UK.', 'Neurogenetics Laboratory, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London WC1N 3BG, UK.', 'National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London WC1N 3BG, UK.', 'Neurogenetics Laboratory, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London WC1N 3BG, UK.', 'Centre for Tropical Diseases, Ospedale Sacro Cuore - Don Calabria, 37024 Negrar (VR), Italy.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-Hemocentro Campinas, University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-Hemocentro Campinas, University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center-Hemocentro Campinas, University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', ""Internal Medicine Department, Parc Tauli Hospital Universitari, Institut d' Investigacio i Innovacio Parc Tauli I3PT, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, 08208 Sabadell, Spain."", ""Hepatology Unit, Digestive Diseases Department, Parc Tauli Hospital Universitari.

A case/non-case study was performed using AE reports registered in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to compare the risk of CV event reports related to TKIs indicated in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Disproportionality of CV event-related TKIs was computed using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) as a measure of potential risk increase. Nilotinib accounts for more than half of reported cases related to TKIs. Signal of Disproportionate Reporting (SDR) was found for cardiac failure, ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, torsade de pointes/QT prolongation, hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension. Dasatinib and bosutinib were related to the highest disproportionality for cardiac failure. Nilotinib was associated with the highest SDR for ischemic heart disease, torsade de pointes/QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. Only ponatinib was related to an SDR for hypertension, while dasatinib and imatinib were related to pulmonary hypertension. In the context of CML, TKIs have different safety profiles related to CV events, among which nilotinib seems particularly related to. These results claim for a revision of its CV safety profile mainly for the risk of torsade de pointes/QT prolongation.","['Cirmi, Santa', 'El Abd, Asmae', 'Letinier, Louis', 'Navarra, Michele', 'Salvo, Francesco']","['Cirmi S', 'El Abd A', 'Letinier L', 'Navarra M', 'Salvo F']","['Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, I-98168 Messina, Italy.', 'Inserm, UMR 1219, Team Pharmacoepidemiology, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, University of Bordeaux, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.', 'Inserm, UMR 1219, Team Pharmacoepidemiology, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, University of Bordeaux, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.', 'Inserm, UMR 1219, Team Pharmacoepidemiology, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, University of Bordeaux, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale, Pole de Sante Publique, CHU de Bordeaux, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, I-98168 Messina, Italy.', 'Inserm, UMR 1219, Team Pharmacoepidemiology, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, University of Bordeaux, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale, Pole de Sante Publique, CHU de Bordeaux, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6916-0307', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9777-419X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6492-7820']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200330,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7226142,,['NOTNLM'],"['FAERS', 'adverse drug reaction', 'cardiovascular toxicity', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/04/03 06:00,2020/04/03 06:01,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/03 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12040826 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12040826 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Mar 30;12(4). pii: cancers12040826. doi: 10.3390/cancers12040826.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is increasingly evident that the bone marrow immune environment of AML patients is profoundly altered, contributing to the severity of the disease but also providing several windows of opportunity to prompt or rewire a proficient antitumor immune surveillance. In this Review, we present current evidence on immune defects in AML, discuss the challenges with selective targeting of AML cells, and summarize the clinical results and immunologic insights from studies that are testing the latest immunotherapy approaches to specifically target AML cells (antibodies, cellular therapies) or more broadly reactivate antileukemia immunity (vaccines, checkpoint blockade). Given the complex interactions between AML cells and the many components of their environment, it is reasonable to surmise that the future of immunotherapy in AML lies in the rational combination of complementary immunotherapeutic strategies with chemotherapeutics or other oncogenic pathway inhibitors.

We evaluated the value of CpG methylation in predicting relapse for adults with T-LBL treated with ALL-like regimens. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 549 adults with T-LBL from 27 medical centers were included in the analysis. Using the Illumina Methylation 850K Beadchip, 44 relapse-related CpGs were identified from 49 T-LBL samples by two algorithms: least absolute shrinkage and selector operation (LASSO) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). We built a four-CpG classifier using LASSO Cox regression based on association between the methylation level of CpGs and relapse-free survival in the training cohort (n = 160). The four-CpG classifier was validated in the internal testing cohort (n = 68) and independent validation cohort (n = 321). RESULTS: The four-CpG-based classifier discriminated patients with T-LBL at high risk of relapse in the training cohort from those at low risk (P < 0.001). This classifier also showed good predictive value in the internal testing cohort (P < 0.001) and the independent validation cohort (P < 0.001). A nomogram incorporating five independent prognostic factors including the CpG-based classifier, lactate dehydrogenase levels, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, central nervous system involvement, and NOTCH1/FBXW7 status showed a significantly higher predictive accuracy than each single variable. Stratification into different subgroups by the nomogram helped identify the subset of patients who most benefited from more intensive chemotherapy and/or sequential hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Our four-CpG-based classifier could predict disease relapse in patients with T-LBL, and could be used to guide treatment decision.","['Tian, Xiao-Peng', 'Su, Ning', 'Wang, Liang', 'Huang, Wei-Juan', 'Liu, Yan-Hui', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Huang, Hui-Qiang', 'Lin, Tong-Yu', 'Ma, Shu-Yun', 'Rao, Hui-Lan', 'Li, Mei', 'Liu, Fang', 'Zhang, Fen', 'Zhong, Li-Ye', 'Liang, Li', 'Lan, Xiao-Liang', 'Li, Juan', 'Liao, Bing', 'Li, Zhi-Hua', 'Tang, Qiong-Lan', 'Liang, Qiong', 'Shao, Chun-Kui', 'Zhai, Qiong-Li', 'Cheng, Run-Fen', 'Sun, Qi', 'Ru, Kun', 'Gu, Xia', 'Lin, Xi-Na', 'Yi, Kun', 'Shuang, Yue-Rong', 'Chen, Xiao-Dong', 'Dong, Wei', 'Sun, Cai', 'Sang, Wei', 'Liu, Hui', 'Zhu, Zhi-Gang', 'Rao, Jun', 'Guo, Qiao-Nan', 'Zhou, Ying', 'Meng, Xiang-Ling', 'Zhu, Yong', 'Hu, Chang-Lu', 'Jiang, Yi-Rong', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Gao, Hong-Yi', 'He, Wen-Jun', 'Xia, Zhong-Jun', 'Pan, Xue-Yi', 'Hai, Lan', 'Li, Guo-Wei', 'Song, Li-Yan', 'Kang, Tie-Bang', 'Xie, Dan', 'Cai, Qing-Qing']","['Tian XP', 'Su N', 'Wang L', 'Huang WJ', 'Liu YH', 'Zhang X', 'Huang HQ', 'Lin TY', 'Ma SY', 'Rao HL', 'Li M', 'Liu F', 'Zhang F', 'Zhong LY', 'Liang L', 'Lan XL', 'Li J', 'Liao B', 'Li ZH', 'Tang QL', 'Liang Q', 'Shao CK', 'Zhai QL', 'Cheng RF', 'Sun Q', 'Ru K', 'Gu X', 'Lin XN', 'Yi K', 'Shuang YR', 'Chen XD', 'Dong W', 'Sun C', 'Sang W', 'Liu H', 'Zhu ZG', 'Rao J', 'Guo QN', 'Zhou Y', 'Meng XL', 'Zhu Y', 'Hu CL', 'Jiang YR', 'Zhang Y', 'Gao HY', 'He WJ', 'Xia ZJ', 'Pan XY', 'Hai L', 'Li GW', 'Song LY', 'Kang TB', 'Xie D', 'Cai QQ']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, P.R.

Beside standard bench top instruments, several biochip-based methods have been developed for this purpose. Our biochip design incorporates micron size immunomagnetic beads together with micropad arrays, thus requires automated detection and quantification of not only cells but also the micropads and the immunomagnetic beads. The main purpose of the biochip is to capture target cells having different antigens simultaneously. In this proposed study, a digital image processing-based method to quantify the leukemia cells, immunomagnetic beads and micropads was developed as a readout method for the biochip. Color, size-based object detection and object segmentation methods were implemented to detect structures in the images acquired from the biochip by a bright field optical microscope. It has been shown that manual counting and flow cytometry results are in good agreement with the developed automated counting. Average precision is 85 % and average error rate is 13 % for all images of patient samples, average precision is 99 % and average error rate is 1% for cell culture images. With the optimized micropad size, proposed method can reach up to 95 % precision rate for patient samples with an execution time of 90 s per image.","['Uslu, Fatma', 'Icoz, Kutay', 'Tasdemir, Kasim', 'Dogan, Refika S', 'Yilmaz, Bulent']","['Uslu F', 'Icoz K', 'Tasdemir K', 'Dogan RS', 'Yilmaz B']","['BioMINDS (Bio Micro/Nano Devices and Sensors) Lab, Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Abdullah Gul University, Kayseri, 38080, Turkey.', 'BioMINDS (Bio Micro/Nano Devices and Sensors) Lab, Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Abdullah Gul University, Kayseri, 38080, Turkey; Bioengineering Department, Abdullah Gul University, Kayseri, 38080, Turkey; Computer Engineering Department, Abdullah Gul University, Kayseri, 38080, Turkey.

A significant number of children with ovarian mass lesions present ""out of hours ""as surgical emergencies, and surgical management does not always involve a surgical oncologist. This multicenter study reports how the mode of clinical presentation may influence (i) operation (conventional open vs minimally invasive surgery (MIS)) and (ii) examines if young females presenting as surgical emergency(s) are more likely to undergo total oophorectomy or ovarian sparing surgery. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study amongst UK pediatric surgical oncology centers. Females <16years with diagnosis of ovarian tumor from 2006 to 2016 were included. Functional/neonatal ovarian cysts were excluded. RESULTS: Three hundred ten patients with ovarian tumors treated at 12 surgical oncology centers were identified. Mean age at surgery was 11years [IQR 8-14]. Most common diagnosis were mature teratoma (57%, 177 cases), immature teratoma (10.9%, 34 cases) and cystadenoma (12%, 36 cases). Seventy percent (217) of cases were performed as open procedures. Thirty percent (94) of children underwent MIS. Tumors were significantly smaller in children who underwent MIS. Median tumor size in the laparoscopic group was 6cm compared to 11cm in the open group (p<0.00001). Children who underwent MIS were significantly more likely to have ovary sparing surgery. CONCLUSION: This UK nationwide study demonstrates that ovary-sparing surgery and minimally invasive surgery are still infrequently deployed by pediatric surgeons in the UK. Patients with smaller tumors were more likely to undergo MIS, and more frequently underwent ovary-sparing surgery. In view of the implications on fertility and hormonal health caused by unilateral oophorectomy, it is time to review this current practise and agree consensus guidelines to reduce rates of unnecessary oophorectomy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE STATEMENT: This is a level II evidence study. It is a retrospective multicentre collaborative study, which summarizes data from a national cohort of children.","['Braungart, Sarah', 'Craigie, Ross J', 'Farrelly, Paul', 'Losty, Paul D']","['Braungart S', 'Craigie RJ', 'Farrelly P', 'Losty PD']","[""Department of Paediatric Surgery, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK; Department of Paediatric Surgery, Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, UK.

A clear benefit has been demonstrated when treating patients with a reduced disease burden, thus a prophylactic and preemptive approach to these patients has emerged. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with myeloid malignancies treated with azacytidine in the posttransplantation setting between September 2013 and April 2018 in a single tertiary care hospital. Of 32 patients analyzed, 21 were treated for prophylactic use and 11 preemptively, with a median follow-up of 20 months. Prophylactic treatment consisted of AZA at 32 mg/m(2) for 5 days every 28 days, and preemptive treatment of AZA 75 mg/m(2) for 5 or 7 days per cycle. In addition, 10 patients received one or more donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs). Two patients presented with infectious complications demanding hospitalization, and 13 patients (10 in the prophylactic group and 3 in the preemptive group) presented graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Of patients who had GvHD, 3 needed treatment discontinuation. Overall, 12 patients suspended treatment, 8 for disease progression and 1 due to patient request. RESULTS: In the prophylactic group, all patients are alive at 1 year with an event-free survival (EFS) of 95%, as only 1 patient relapsed. In the preemptive group, 1-year EFS was 54% and 1-year overall survival was 82%. CONCLUSION: Low-dose AZA in posttransplantation patients with myeloid neoplasms is a well-tolerated therapy with the potential to prevent relapse and maintain stable remissions. Randomized prospective trials are needed to determine patient selection and dosage, timing, and duration of treatment.","['Marini, Carolina', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Bazarbachi, Abdulhamid', 'Dulery, Remy', 'Sestili, Simona', 'Battipaglia, Giorgia', 'Mediavilla, Clemence', 'Paviglianiti, Annalisa', 'Belhocine, Ramdane', 'Isnard, Francoise', 'Lapusan, Simona', 'Adaeva, Rosa', 'Bannet, Anne', 'van de Wiegert, Zoe', 'Vekhoff, Anne', 'Ledraa, Tounes', 'Legrand, Ollivier', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Bonnin, Agnes', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Malard, Florent', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Marini C', 'Brissot E', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Dulery R', 'Sestili S', 'Battipaglia G', 'Mediavilla C', 'Paviglianiti A', 'Belhocine R', 'Isnard F', 'Lapusan S', 'Adaeva R', 'Bannet A', 'van de Wiegert Z', 'Vekhoff A', 'Ledraa T', 'Legrand O', 'Labopin M', 'Bonnin A', 'Ruggeri A', 'Malard F', 'Mohty M']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; Sorbonne University, INSERM UMRs 948, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; Sorbonne University, INSERM UMRs 948, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; Sorbonne University, INSERM UMRs 948, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; Sorbonne University, INSERM UMRs 948, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; Sorbonne University, INSERM UMRs 948, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; Sorbonne University, INSERM UMRs 948, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France; Sorbonne University, INSERM UMRs 948, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France.

Methods: High-throughput sequencing was used to detect 65 blood tumor-related genes in 191 MDS patients and 9 secondary acute myelocytic leukemia patitents(SAML), and to analyze the characteristics of abnormal genes, mutation burden, as well as the relationship with disease subtypes, chromosome karyotypes and age. Results: Mutations were found in 148 patients (77.5%), including 47 abnormal genes and 186 mutation sites. And gene mutations were found in 9 SAML patients, the number of mutations was significantly higher than that in MDS patients (chi(2)=11.911, P=0.018). Among the abnormal genes, the mutation frequency of U2AF1 (37.3%) and ASXL1 (41.6%) were higher, and there were significant differences in mutation burden among different abnormal genes (F=91.946, P<0.001). There were differences in the number of gene mutations among different subtypes of MDS, and the number of EB-2 gene mutations was the highest (2.2+/-1.5). In SLD, MLD, EB-1 and EB-2, the proportion of carrying >/= 3 mutations increased gradually (chi(2)=52.471, P=0.037). TP53 mutation was associated with abnormal karyotype (r(phi)=0.177, P=0.019), especially with complex karyotype (r(phi)=0.440, P<0.001), while NPM1 mutation is associated with normal karyotype (r(phi)=0.173, P=0.024). The number of mutations carried by patients under 30 years old was the least, and the number of mutations increased with the increase of age. The number of mutations was the most in patients aged 60 to 79 years old (P=0.017), and the mutation frequency of epigenetic related genes increased with the increase of age (P=0.041). Conclusions: The mutation characteristics and mutation load of MDS-related genes are closely related to clinical factors such as disease subtype, chromosome karyotype and patient age.","['Lu, X D', 'Li, Y W', 'Guo, Z', 'Xin, Y P', 'Hu, J Y', 'Fan, R H', 'Song, Y P']","['Lu XD', 'Li YW', 'Guo Z', 'Xin YP', 'Hu JY', 'Fan RH', 'Song YP']","['Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450014, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.']",,['chi'],"['182300410371/Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province', '192102310051/Key Scientific and Technological Projects in Henan Province']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gene mutation', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Mutation burden', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome']",2020/04/03 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20190806-01751 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 31;100(12):933-937. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20190806-01751.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed detailed time-dependent expression analyses of HOXA9 and its promoters, MLL1 and WDR5, in rat gastrocnemius muscles after the following three types of sciatic nerve surgeries: nerve transection (denervation), end-to-end repair (repair), and sham operation (sham). Then, the specific mechanisms of HOXA9 were detected in vitro by transfecting primary satellite cells with empty pIRES2-DsRed2, pIRES2-DsRed2-HOXA9, empty pPLK/GFP-Puro, and pPLK/GFP-Puro-HOXA9 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmids. We found, for the first time, that HOXA9 protein expression simultaneously increased with increasing denervated muscle atrophy severity and that upregulated MLL1 and WDR5 expression was partly associated with denervation. Indeed, in vitro experiments revealed that HOXA9 inhibited myogenic differentiation, affected the best known atrophic signaling pathways, and promoted apoptosis but did not eliminate the differentiation potential of primary satellite cells. HOXA9 may promote denervated muscle atrophy by regulating the activity of satellite cells.","['Lu, Xiaomei', 'Liang, Bingsheng', 'Li, Shuaijie', 'Chen, Zhi', 'Chang, Wenkai']","['Lu X', 'Liang B', 'Li S', 'Chen Z', 'Chang W']","['Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5889-3337', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4070-8033', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1071-3189', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4210-6968', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8389-3136']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200401,United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

For humans, the predominant circadian stimulus is the daily light-dark cycle. Herein, we explore associations between perinatal photoperiod characteristics (photoperiod: duration of daylight as determined by time-of-year and location) and childhood cancer risk. We use pooled data on 182,856 mothers and babies from prospective birth cohorts in six countries (Australia, Denmark, Israel, Norway, UK, USA) within the International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium (I4C). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In line with predicted differential dose-responses, restricted cubic splines indicate a potential non-linear, non-monotonic relationship between perinatal mean daily photoperiod (0-24 h) and childhood cancer risk. In a restricted analysis of 154,121 individuals who experienced third trimester photoperiods exclusively within the 8-16-h range, the relative risk of developing childhood cancer decreased by 9% with every hour increase in third trimester mean daily photoperiod [HR: 0.91 (95%CIs: 0.84-0.99)]. In conclusion, in this first study of perinatal photoperiod and childhood cancer, we detected an inverse [""protective""] linear association between third trimester mean daily photoperiod and childhood cancer risk in the 8-16-h set of the total study population. Limited statistical power impeded the investigation of risks with individuals exposed to more extreme photoperiods. Future studies are needed to confirm differential photoperiod-associated risks and further investigations into the hypothesized circadian imprinting mechanism are warranted.","['Lewis, Philip', 'Hellmich, Martin', 'Fritschi, Lin', 'Tikellis, Gabriella', 'Morfeld, Peter', 'Gross, J Valerie', 'Foster, Russell G', 'Paltiel, Ora', 'Klebanoff, Mark A', 'Golding, Jean', 'Olsen, Sjurdur', 'Magnus, Per', 'Ponsonby, Anne-Louise', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Ward, Mary H', 'Caporaso, Neil', 'Dwyer, Terence', 'Erren, Thomas C']","['Lewis P', 'Hellmich M', 'Fritschi L', 'Tikellis G', 'Morfeld P', 'Gross JV', 'Foster RG', 'Paltiel O', 'Klebanoff MA', 'Golding J', 'Olsen S', 'Magnus P', 'Ponsonby AL', 'Linet MS', 'Ward MH', 'Caporaso N', 'Dwyer T', 'Erren TC']","['Institute and Policlinic for Occupational Medicine, Environmental Medicine and Prevention Research, University Hospital of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Statistics and Computational Biology (IMSB), Faculty of Medicine & University Hospital of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.', 'School of Public Health, Curtin University , Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Population Epidemiology, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, University of Melbourne , Melbourne, Australia.', 'Institute and Policlinic for Occupational Medicine, Environmental Medicine and Prevention Research, University Hospital of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute and Policlinic for Occupational Medicine, Environmental Medicine and Prevention Research, University Hospital of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.', 'Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, OMPI G, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford , Oxford, UK.', 'Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Hadassah-Hebrew University , Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Departments of Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Division of Epidemiology, Ohio State University , Columbus, Ohio, USA.', ""Center for Perinatal Research, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital , Columbus, Ohio, USA."", 'Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol , Bristol, UK.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut , Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centre for Fertility and Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health , Oslo, Norway.', 'Population Epidemiology, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, University of Melbourne , Melbourne, Australia.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH , Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH , Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH , Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Population Epidemiology, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, University of Melbourne , Melbourne, Australia.', 'The George Institute for Global Health, University of Oxford , UK.', 'Institute and Policlinic for Occupational Medicine, Environmental Medicine and Prevention Research, University Hospital of Cologne , Cologne, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5881-6032', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5174-928X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2091-7663', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7110-1031']",['eng'],"['MC_PC_15018/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '092731/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200401,England,Chronobiol Int,Chronobiology international,8501362,,IM,"['Australia', 'Child', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Light', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Norway', '*Photoperiod', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*PLICCS', '*Perinatal', '*childhood cancer', '*circadian', '*cohort', '*leukemia', '*light']",2020/04/03 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/04/03 06:00'],"['2020/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07420528.2020.1740724 [doi]'],ppublish,Chronobiol Int. 2020 Jul;37(7):1034-1047. doi: 10.1080/07420528.2020.1740724.

Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) is a protean condition defined by chronic blood eosinophilia >/= 1.5 G/L (> 1 month) leading to eosinophilic-related organ damage. HES subtypes includes neoplastic (clonal) disorders (HESN, that comprises FIP1L1-PDGFRA- related chronic eosinophilic leukemia and myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes associated with eosinophilia) and reactive HES (HESR, that aggregates all conditions e.g. parasitic infections, adverse drug reactions, inflammatory or neoplastic diseases that lead to the production of Th2-related cytokines and thereby to non-clonal hypereosinophilia). HESR also includes the lymphoid variant of HES (HESL), a chronic clonal indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder in which mature peripheral T cells secrete high amounts of IL-5, leading to the polyclonal expansion of eosinophils. Despite an extensive etiological workup, approximately 50% of HES remain of undetermined cause. HES-related clinical manifestations are highly diverse, but dermatological, respiratory and gastro-intestinal symptoms are the most frequent. The long-term prognosis is driven by cardiac involvement and, for patients with HESN and HESL, by the risk of acute transformation into high-grade hematological malignancies. Treatment of HESN relies on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. imatinib mesylate), while oral glucocorticoids are the usual the fist-line therapy for HESR (including SHEL). In this setting, second-line treatments include hydroxyurea and Peg-interferon alfa-2a. IL-5-targeted therapies are very promising (except for HESN). Yet, to date, their use is restricted to clinical trials and to a compassionate use program dedicated to severe and refractory patients.","['Groh, Matthieu', 'Lefevre, Guillaume', 'Ackermann, Felix', 'Etienne, Nicolas', 'Kahn, Jean-Emmanuel']","['Groh M', 'Lefevre G', 'Ackermann F', 'Etienne N', 'Kahn JE']","['Centre de reference des syndromes hypereosinophiliques (CEREO).

Younger patients who reached complete remission with complete (CR) or incomplete (CRi) recovery were then scheduled to receive an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). That was if they had a HLA-identical sibling donor; in all other cases, an autologous HSCT had to be administered. At an 11-year median follow-up, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year overall survival (OS) rates were 33.2%, 30.1% and 28.0%, respectively. No significant difference between the three randomized groups regarding OS was observed (P = .38). In young patients, 15-45 years old, no treatment difference (P = .89) regarding OS was observed, while in patients 46-60 years old, MXR and IDA groups had a trend for a longer OS as compared to the DNR group (P = .029). Among younger patients without a favorable MRC cytogenetic risk subgroup who achieved a CR/CRi after induction chemotherapy, those with a HLA-identical sibling donor had higher 10-year and 15-year OS rates than those without. In older patients who reached CR/CRi, the long-term outcomes of those with or without a donor was similar. In conclusion, long-term outcomes of the study confirmed similar OS in the three randomized groups in the whole cohort of patients.","['Baron, Frederic', 'Efficace, Fabio', 'Cannella, Laura', 'Muus, Petra', 'Trisolini, Silvia', 'Halkes, Constantijn J M', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'van der Velden, Walter', 'La Sala, Edoardo', 'Vitolo, Umberto', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Lefrere, Francois', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Guimaraes, Jose E', 'Allione, Bernardino', 'Vrhovac, Radovan', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Stevens-Kroef, Marian', 'Meert, Liv', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Willemze, Roelof', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Suciu, Stefan']","['Baron F', 'Efficace F', 'Cannella L', 'Muus P', 'Trisolini S', 'Halkes CJM', 'Fazi P', 'Vignetti M', 'Marie JP', 'Chiusolo P', 'van der Velden W', 'La Sala E', 'Vitolo U', 'Thomas X', 'Lefrere F', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Bourhis JH', 'Specchia G', 'Guimaraes JE', 'Allione B', 'Vrhovac R', 'Ferrara F', 'Stevens-Kroef M', 'Meert L', 'de Witte T', 'Willemze R', 'Amadori S', 'Suciu S']","['GIGA-I3 and CHU, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', ""Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Dell'Adulto GIMEMA, Rome, Italy."", ""Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Dell'Adulto GIMEMA, Rome, Italy."", 'Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', ""Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Dell'Adulto GIMEMA, Rome, Italy."", ""Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Dell'Adulto GIMEMA, Rome, Italy."", 'Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Gemelli Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', ""Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Dell'Adulto GIMEMA, Rome, Italy."", 'Candiolo Cancer Institute-IRCCS, Torino, Italy.', 'Lyon-Sud University Hospital, Lyon, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Necker Children's Hospital, Paris, France."", 'Universita di Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Gustave Roussy cancer campus Grand Paris, Villejuif, France.', 'Giovanni XXIII- University Hospital, Bari, Italy.', 'Hospital S.

The present study focussed on the pre-clinical evaluation of a novel drug class, BMI-1 modulators, in MM. We demonstrate potent activity of PTC-028 and PTC596 in a comprehensive set of in vitro and in vivo models, including models of drug resistance and stromal support. Treatment of MM cells with PTC-028 and PTC596 downregulated BMI-1 protein levels, which was found to correlate with drug activity. Surprisingly, BMI-1 was dispensable for the activity of BMI-1 modulators and MM cell growth. Our data rather point to mitotic arrest accompanied by myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (MCL-1) loss as key anti-MM mechanisms and reveal impaired MYC and AKT signalling activity due to BMI-1 modulator treatment. Moreover, we observed a complete eradication of MM after PTC596 treatment in the 5TGM.1 in vivo model and define epigenetic compounds and B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetics as promising combination partners. These results bring into question the postulated role of BMI-1 as an essential MM gene and confirm BMI-1 modulators as potent anti-mitotic agents with encouraging pre-clinical activity that supports their rapid translation into clinical trials.","['Bolomsky, Arnold', 'Muller, Josephine', 'Stangelberger, Kathrin', 'Lejeune, Margaux', 'Duray, Elodie', 'Breid, Helene', 'Vrancken, Louise', 'Pfeiffer, Christina', 'Hubl, Wolfgang', 'Willheim, Martin', 'Weetall, Marla', 'Branstrom, Art', 'Zojer, Niklas', 'Caers, Jo', 'Ludwig, Heinz']","['Bolomsky A', 'Muller J', 'Stangelberger K', 'Lejeune M', 'Duray E', 'Breid H', 'Vrancken L', 'Pfeiffer C', 'Hubl W', 'Willheim M', 'Weetall M', 'Branstrom A', 'Zojer N', 'Caers J', 'Ludwig H']","['Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, GIGA-I3, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, GIGA-I3, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, GIGA-I3, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, GIGA-I3, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'PTC Therapeutics Inc, South Plainfield, NJ, USA.', 'PTC Therapeutics Inc, South Plainfield, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, GIGA-I3, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Medicine I, Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1585-5429', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3302-8726']",['eng'],['Brian D Novis Research Grant/International Myeloma Foundation'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200330,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTC596)', '0 (Pyrazines)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', '*Multiple Myeloma/diet therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BMI-1', '*PTC-028', '*PTC596', '*myeloma', '*pre-clinical']",2020/04/02 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16595 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Sep;190(6):877-890. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16595.

Twenty-three patients with R/R B-ALL were pretreated with intensive chemotherapy (fludarabine combined with medium-dose cytarabine) 12 days before CAR-T therapy. Adverse events (AEs), curative effects, infection indicators and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) were monitored. Each of the 23 patients received a dose of 1.0 x 10(6) cells/kg CAR-T cell infusion on day 0. After 14 days, 19 patients (82.61%) achieved complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete count recovery. No survival benefit was achieved with consolidative haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), with a median follow-up of 14.0 months (range, 1.5-21.0 months). The notable AEs were grade 1-2 CRS in 18 patients, while the other five patients were grade 3 CRS. No patients died of CRS. Only one patient died of respiratory failure due to cytomegalovirus infection 24 days after infusion. The proportion of leukaemic cells in bone marrow on infusion day and the peaks of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-8 levels were correlated with CRS levels. A lower disease burden was achieved by intensive lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and the subsequent CAR-T therapy had a high response and manageable toxicity. Trial registration: The patients were enrolled in a clinical trial of ChiCTR-ONN-16009862, and ChiCTR1800019622.","['Wang, Jia', 'Mou, Nan', 'Yang, Zhenxing', 'Li, Qing', 'Jiang, Yanyu', 'Meng, Juanxia', 'Liu, Xuxiang', 'Deng, Qi']","['Wang J', 'Mou N', 'Yang Z', 'Li Q', 'Jiang Y', 'Meng J', 'Liu X', 'Deng Q']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Shanghai Genbase Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Genbase Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8518-6948', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8707-0567', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3646-4953']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200331,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adoptive Transfer', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy']",PMC7687133,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*chimaeric antigen receptor', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*lymphodepleting chemotherapy', '*refractory']",2020/04/02 06:00,2021/03/17 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16623 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Oct;191(2):212-222. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16623.

Still, it is unclear how CTCF binding is perturbed in leukemia or in cancer in general. We studied CTCF binding by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in normal bone marrow (NBM) in the context of gene expression, DNA methylation, and azacitidine exposure. CTCF binding was increased in AML compared with NBM. Aberrant CTCF binding was enriched for motifs for key myeloid transcription factors such as CEBPA, PU.1, and RUNX1. AML with TET2 mutations was characterized by a particularly strong gain of CTCF binding, highly enriched for gain in promoter regions, while AML in general was enriched for changes at enhancers. There was a strong anticorrelation between CTCF binding and DNA methylation. Gain of CTCF occupancy was associated with increased gene expression; however, the genomic location (promoter vs distal regions) and enrichment of motifs (for repressing vs activating cofactors) were decisive for the gene expression pattern. Knockdown of CTCF in K562 cells caused loss of CTCF binding and transcriptional repression of genes with changed CTCF binding in AML, as well as loss of RUNX1 binding at RUNX1/CTCF-binding sites. In addition, CTCF knockdown caused increased differentiation. Azacitidine exposure caused major changes in CTCF occupancy in AML patient cells, partly by restoring a CTCF-binding pattern similar to NBM. We conclude that AML displays an aberrant increase in CTCF occupancy that targets key genes for AML development and impacts gene expression.","['Mujahed, Huthayfa', 'Miliara, Sophia', 'Neddermeyer, Anne', 'Bengtzen, Sofia', 'Nilsson, Christer', 'Deneberg, Stefan', 'Cordeddu, Lina', 'Ekwall, Karl', 'Lennartsson, Andreas', 'Lehmann, Soren']","['Mujahed H', 'Miliara S', 'Neddermeyer A', 'Bengtzen S', 'Nilsson C', 'Deneberg S', 'Cordeddu L', 'Ekwall K', 'Lennartsson A', 'Lehmann S']","['Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Huddinge, and.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; and.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Hematology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Huddinge, and.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Huddinge, and.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Huddinge, and.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; and.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; and.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden; and.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Huddinge, and.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Hematology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Response Elements']",,,,,2020/04/02 06:00,2021/02/27 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61884-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002326 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jul 16;136(3):339-352. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002326.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although advances in molecular genetic technologies have enabled highly sensitive detection of AML-associated mutations and translocations, determination of MRD is complicated by the fact that many treated patients have persistent clonal hematopoiesis (CH) that may not reflect residual AML. CH detected in AML patients in CR includes true residual or early recurrent AML, myelodysplastic syndrome or CH that is ancestral to the AML, and independent or newly emerging clones of uncertain leukemogenic potential. Although the presence of AML-related mutations has been shown to be a harbinger of relapse in multiple studies, the significance of other types of CH is less well understood. In patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), post-HCT clones can be donor-derived and in some cases engender a new myeloid neoplasm that is clonally unrelated to the recipient's original AML. In this article, we discuss the spectrum of CH that can be detected in treated AML patients, propose terminology to standardize nomenclature in this setting, and review clinical data and areas of uncertainty among the various types of posttreatment hematopoietic clones.","['Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Steensma, David P', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'Ebert, Benjamin L']","['Hasserjian RP', 'Steensma DP', 'Graubert TA', 'Ebert BL']","['Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; and.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; and.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",,['eng'],"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA206963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Clonal Hematopoiesis/*physiology', '*Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7225688,,,,2020/04/02 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62027-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019004770 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 May 14;135(20):1729-1738. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019004770.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the relevance of TRIM31 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Herein, we investigated the role of TRIM31 in AML. We examined the expression levels of TRIM31 in the blood samples from 34 patients with AML and 34 healthy volunteers using qRT-PCR. The mRNA levels of TRIM31 in human bone marrow stromal cells (HS-5) and five AML cell lines were also detected. Loss/gain-of-function assays were performed to assess the role of TRIM31 in AML cells proliferation, apoptosis and sensitivity to daunorubicin. The expression levels of pro-caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, Wnt3a, beta-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc were measured using Western blot. TRIM31 expression levels were significantly up-regulated in AML patients and cell lines. Knockdown of TRIM31 suppressed cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in AML-5 and U937 cells. The IC50 of daunorubicin was significantly decreased in TRIM31 siRNA (si-TRIM31) transfected cells. Oppositely, induced cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis were observed in pcDNA-3.1-TRIM31 transfected cells. Furthermore, knockdown of TRIM31 suppressed the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in AML cells. Activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by LiCl abolished the effects of si-TRIM31 on cell proliferation, apoptosis and sensitivity to daunorubicin in AML cells. In conclusion, the results indicated that TRIM31 promoted leukemogenesis and chemoresistance to daunorubicin in AML. The oncogenic role of TRIM31 in AML was mediated by the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Thus, TRIM31 might serve as a therapeutic target for the AML treatment.","['Xiao, Yi', 'Deng, Taoran', 'Ming, Xi', 'Xu, Jinhuang']","['Xiao Y', 'Deng T', 'Ming X', 'Xu J']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM31 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lithium Chloride/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/drug effects']",PMC7160243,,['NOTNLM'],"['*TRIM31', '*Wnt/beta-catenin pathway', '*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*daunorubicin', '*drug resistance']",2020/04/02 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['222521 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20194334 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2020 Apr 30;40(4). pii: 222521. doi: 10.1042/BSR20194334.,,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We could thus evidence B7-negative and B7-positive leukemias either with an isolated expression or part of eight different checkpoint ligand ""signatures"" that always included an inhibitory B7 molecule. B7-positive AMLs encompassed intermediate and adverse European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk cases and displayed mainly central memory CD4+ T cells with high ICOS levels and effector CD8+ T cells with high PD-1 expression. B7-negative cases were rather classified as AML with recurrent genetic anomalies and displayed predominantly naive T cells, with the exception of NPM1 mutated AMLs, which expressed B7-H3. These different B7 immune profiles suggest that specific immunotherapies are required to target the distinct immune evasion strategies of this genetically heterogeneous disease.","['Antohe, Ion', 'Dascalescu, Angela', 'Danaila, Catalin', 'Titieanu, Amalia', 'Zlei, Mihaela', 'Ivanov, Iuliu', 'Sireteanu, Adriana', 'Pavel, Mariana', 'Cianga, Petru']","['Antohe I', 'Dascalescu A', 'Danaila C', 'Titieanu A', 'Zlei M', 'Ivanov I', 'Sireteanu A', 'Pavel M', 'Cianga P']","['Hematology Department, Grigore T.

Trichothecene mycotoxins are extremely toxic to leukocytes and leukopenia is one of the leading signs of trichothecene toxicosis, implying that trichothecenes hinder cell proliferation. Both toxins retarded proliferation of all four cell lines tested. NIV was more potent than DON in human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60, human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line MOLT-4, and rat aortic myoblast cell line A-10. In contrast, both toxins exhibited almost the same potencies in human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2. While exposure to 0.3 mug/mL DON greatly induced the secretion of anti-hematopoietic cytokines CCL3 and CCL4, treatment with NIV decreased the secretion of these cytokines in HL60 cells, indicating that the toxicity mechanisms of these mycotoxins differ. Because molecular chaperone Hsp90 occupies a pivotal position in a wide range of pathological processes, the effects of an Hsp90-specific inhibitor radicicol on cytokine secretions were investigated. Radicicol counteracted the effect of DON on cytokine secretion, indicating that Hsp90 plays a crucial role in DON-induced cytokine secretion in HL60 cells. Conversely, the results of co-treatment with NIV and radicicol indicate that radicicol does not mitigate the effect of NIV. Regarding CCL3 and CCL4 secretions, DON and NIV have Hsp90-related and -unrelated mechanisms of toxicities, respectively. Taken together the results suggest that, although these toxins share similar chemical structure, there are differences in their toxic mechanisms.","['Nagashima, Hitoshi']",['Nagashima H'],"['Food Research Institute, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 2-1-12 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8642, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180525,Japan,Food Saf (Tokyo),"Food safety (Tokyo, Japan)",101685527,,,,PMC6989201,,['NOTNLM'],"['cell proliferation', 'cytokine secretion', 'deoxynivalenol', 'heat shock protein 90', 'nivalenol', 'radicicol']",2018/05/25 00:00,2018/05/25 00:01,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2017/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/25 00:01 [medline]']","['10.14252/foodsafetyfscj.2017026 [doi]', '2017026 [pii]']",epublish,Food Saf (Tokyo). 2018 May 25;6(2):51-57. doi: 10.14252/foodsafetyfscj.2017026. eCollection 2018 Jun.,,"['(c)2018 Food Safety Commission, Cabinet Office, Government of Japan.']",,['Conflict of interest: The author has no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we will discuss clinical trials of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib in older patients with CLL, and the possible contributions of anti-CD20 antibodies to these therapies.","['Rogers, Andrew', 'Woyach, Jennifer A']","['Rogers A', 'Woyach JA']","['Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, 410 West 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3403-9144'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200323,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC7092382,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'acalabrutinib', 'elderly', 'ibrutinib', 'obinutuzumab', 'ofatumumab', 'rituximab', 'zanabrutinib']",2020/04/02 06:00,2020/04/02 06:01,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620720912990 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620720912990 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Mar 23;11:2040620720912990. doi: 10.1177/2040620720912990. eCollection 2020.,,"['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']",,"['Conflict of interest statement: JW receives research funding from Pharmacyclics,', 'Janssen, Karyopharm, Morphosys, Verastem, Loxo, and Abbvie, and has consulted for', 'Pharmacycics, Janssen, AstraZeneca, and Arqule.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This binding stimulates leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) production and inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by epithelial cells of the endometrium. These effects ensure essential help in the preparation of the endometrium for initial embryo implantation. hCG also effects angiogenic and immunomodulatory actions as reported in many articles by our laboratories and other ones. By stimulating angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, hCG provides the placenta with an adequate maternal blood supply and optimal embryo nutrition during the invasion of the uterine endometrium. The immunomodulatory properties of hCG are numerous and important for programming maternal immune tolerance toward the embryo. The reported effects of hCG on uterine NK, Treg, and B cells, three major cell populations for the maintenance of pregnancy, demonstrate the role of this embryonic signal as a crucial immune regulator in the course of pregnancy. Human embryo rejection for hCG-related immunological reasons has been studied in different ways, and a sufficient dose of hCG seems to be necessary to maintain maternal tolerance. Different teams have studied the addition of hCG in patients suffering from recurrent miscarriages or implantation failures. hCG could also have a beneficial or a negative impact on autoimmune diseases during pregnancy. In this review, we will discuss the immunological impacts of hCG during pregnancy and if this hormone might be used therapeutically.","['Gridelet, Virginie', ""Perrier d'Hauterive, Sophie"", 'Polese, Barbara', 'Foidart, Jean-Michel', 'Nisolle, Michelle', 'Geenen, Vincent']","['Gridelet V', ""Perrier d'Hauterive S"", 'Polese B', 'Foidart JM', 'Nisolle M', 'Geenen V']","['GIGA-I3 Center of Immunoendocrinology GIGA Research Institute, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Center for Assisted Medical Procreation, University of Liege, CHR Citadelle, Liege, Belgium.', 'GIGA-I3 Center of Immunoendocrinology GIGA Research Institute, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Center for Assisted Medical Procreation, University of Liege, CHR Citadelle, Liege, Belgium.', 'GIGA-I3 Center of Immunoendocrinology GIGA Research Institute, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Tumor and Development Biology, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Center for Assisted Medical Procreation, University of Liege, CHR Citadelle, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, CHR Citadelle, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'GIGA-I3 Center of Immunoendocrinology GIGA Research Institute, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200313,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/etiology', 'Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology', 'Autoimmunity', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/chemistry/immunology/*physiology', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Pregnancy/immunology', 'Protein Isoforms']",PMC7083149,,['NOTNLM'],"['*autoimmunity', '*hCG', '*immunology', '*implantation', '*miscarriages', '*pregnancy']",2020/04/02 06:00,2021/03/02 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00343 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Mar 13;11:343. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00343. eCollection 2020.,,"[""Copyright (c) 2020 Gridelet, Perrier d'Hauterive, Polese, Foidart, Nisolle and"", 'Geenen.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemokines are highly specialized groups of cytokines that play important roles in organizing, trafficking, homing, and in the migration of immune cells to the bone marrow, lymphoid organs and sites of infection and inflammation. Aberrant expression or function of chemokines, or their receptors, has been linked to the protection against or susceptibility to specific infectious diseases, as well as increased the risk of autoimmune diseases and malignancy. Chemokines and their receptors participate in pathogenesis of HTLV-1 associated diseases from inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) which occurs in cases of HAM/TSP to T cell immortalization and tissue infiltration observed in ATL patients. Chemokines represent viable effective prognostic biomarkers for HTLV-1-associated diseases which provide the early identification of high-risk, treatment possibilities and high-yielding clinical trials. This review focuses on the emerging roles of these molecules in the outcome of HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Zargari, Razieh', 'Mahdifar, Maryam', 'Mohammadi, Asadollah', 'Vahidi, Zohreh', 'Hassanshahi, Gholamhossein', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang']","['Zargari R', 'Mahdifar M', 'Mohammadi A', 'Vahidi Z', 'Hassanshahi G', 'Rafatpanah H']","['Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200313,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC7083101,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HAM/TSP', 'HTLV-1', 'chemokine', 'inflammatory response']",2020/04/02 06:00,2020/04/02 06:01,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2020.00421 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 Mar 13;11:421. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00421. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zargari, Mahdifar, Mohammadi, Vahidi, Hassanshahi and', 'Rafatpanah.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its transformation into a more aggressive lymphoma occurs in 2-8% of all patients. Most commonly, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma develops. Transformation into a classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) occurs in <1%. Plasmablastic transformation has been only rarely reported. Cases of synchronous divergent transformation of CLL into a composite lymphoma are exceedingly rare. We describe the unique occurrence of the transformation of a long-standing CLL into a synchronous clonally related cHL as well as plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) in an 85-year-old female patient. After 10 years of asymptomatic CLL, our patient was treated with a rituximab-chlorambucil scheme in combination with pegfilgrastim for recurrent infections and the development of B symptoms. Five cycles (of six planned) were administrated with no adverse effects. After the fifth cycle, lymphadenopathy with pronounced B symptoms appeared. Histology showed the presence of cHL in the lymph node, while the bone marrow was infiltrated by PBL. Our patient died in sepsis not receiving further specific oncologic treatment due to her poor general condition. Additional cytogenetic and molecular studies showed that this was a case of mutated CLL with trisomies of chromosomes 12, 3, and 18 (a rare specific +12 plus other-non+19 CLL subgroup). The presence of trisomy 12 has also been proved in plasmablasts and in cHL cells.","['Gasljevic, Gorana', 'Grat, Mateja', 'Kloboves Prevodnik, Veronika', 'Grcar Kuzmanov, Biljana', 'Gazic, Barbara', 'Lovrecic, Luca', 'Podgornik, Helena']","['Gasljevic G', 'Grat M', 'Kloboves Prevodnik V', 'Grcar Kuzmanov B', 'Gazic B', 'Lovrecic L', 'Podgornik H']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital Celje, Celje, Slovenia.', 'Department of Cytology, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Clinical Institute of Medical Genetics, University Medical Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200213,Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,,,,PMC7098336,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', ""Classical Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'Plasmablastic lymphoma', ""Richter's transformation"", 'Trisomy 12']",2020/04/02 06:00,2020/04/02 06:01,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000505683 [doi]', 'cro-0013-0120 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2020 Feb 13;13(1):120-129. doi: 10.1159/000505683. eCollection 2020 Jan-Apr.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 by S.

To delineate comprehensive chromatin landscapes during early organogenesis, we mapped chromatin accessibility in 19,453 single nuclei from mouse embryos at 8.25 days post-fertilization. Identification of cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin pinpointed two TAL1-bound endothelial enhancers, which we validated using transgenic mouse assays. Integrated gene expression and transcription factor motif enrichment analyses highlighted cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. Subsequent in vivo experiments in zebrafish revealed a role for the ETS factor FEV in endothelial identity downstream of ETV2 (Etsrp in zebrafish). Concerted in vivo validation experiments in mouse and zebrafish thus illustrate how single-cell open chromatin maps, representative of a mammalian embryo, provide access to the regulatory blueprint for mammalian organogenesis.","['Pijuan-Sala, Blanca', 'Wilson, Nicola K', 'Xia, Jun', 'Hou, Xiaomeng', 'Hannah, Rebecca L', 'Kinston, Sarah', 'Calero-Nieto, Fernando J', 'Poirion, Olivier', 'Preissl, Sebastian', 'Liu, Feng', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Pijuan-Sala B', 'Wilson NK', 'Xia J', 'Hou X', 'Hannah RL', 'Kinston S', 'Calero-Nieto FJ', 'Poirion O', 'Preissl S', 'Liu F', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Center for Epigenomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Center for Epigenomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Center for Epigenomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. bg200@cam.ac.uk.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. bg200@cam.ac.uk.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0922-9111', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3358-8253', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8971-5616', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3228-0943', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6302-5705']",['eng'],"['105031/Z/14/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/S036113/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '105031/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200330,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (ER71 protein, mouse)', '0 (Etv2 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Fev protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Organ Specificity', 'Organogenesis/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7145456,['EMS85858'],,,2020/04/02 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41556-020-0489-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41556-020-0489-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2020 Apr;22(4):487-497. doi: 10.1038/s41556-020-0489-9.

Here we show that the axon guidance cue Netrin-1 promotes naive pluripotency by triggering profound signalling, transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in mESCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 can substitute for blockade of Gsk3alpha/beta and Mek1/2 to sustain self-renewal of mESCs in combination with leukaemia inhibitory factor and regulates the formation of the mouse pluripotent blastocyst. Mechanistically, we reveal how Netrin-1 and the balance of its receptors Neo1 and Unc5B co-regulate Wnt and MAPK pathways in both mouse and human ESCs. Netrin-1 induces Fak kinase to inactivate Gsk3alpha/beta and stabilize beta-catenin while increasing the phosphatase activity of a Ppp2r2c-containing Pp2a complex to reduce Erk1/2 activity. Collectively, this work identifies Netrin-1 as a regulator of pluripotency and reveals that it mediates different effects in mESCs depending on its receptor dosage, opening perspectives for balancing self-renewal and lineage commitment.","['Huyghe, Aurelia', 'Furlan, Giacomo', 'Ozmadenci, Duygu', 'Galonska, Christina', 'Charlton, Jocelyn', 'Gaume, Xavier', 'Combemorel, Noemie', 'Riemenschneider,

We studied 1116 newly diagnosed AML patients (age range, 18-86 years) who had received induction chemotherapy. Among 771 patients not selected by genetics, the ELN-2017 classification re-assigned 26.5% of patients into a more favorable or, more commonly, a more adverse-risk group compared with the ELN-2010 recommendations. Forty percent of the cohort, and 51% of patients >/=60 years, were classified as adverse-risk by ELN-2017. In 599 patients <60 years, estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 64% for ELN-2017 favorable, 42% for intermediate-risk and 20% for adverse-risk patients. Among 517 patients aged >/=60 years, corresponding 5-year OS rates were 37, 16, and 6%. Patients with biallelic CEBPA mutations or inv(16) had particularly favorable outcomes, while patients with mutated TP53 and a complex karyotype had especially poor prognosis. DNMT3A mutations associated with inferior OS within each ELN-2017 risk group. Our results validate the prognostic significance of the revised ELN-2017 risk classification in AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy across a broad age range. Further refinement of the ELN-2017 risk classification is possible.","['Herold, Tobias', 'Rothenberg-Thurley, Maja', 'Grunwald, Victoria V', 'Janke, Hanna', 'Goerlich, Dennis', 'Sauerland, Maria C',

Of 428 patients transplanted between 1990-2012 for leukaemia and immunodeficiency 121 surviving >1 year after a single HSCT were recruited. Group A had a treosulfan-based regimen (low-toxicity); Group B had fludarabine/melphalan (Flu-Mel) (reduced-intensity) and Group C had busulphan/cyclophosphamide (Bu-Cy) (myelo-ablative). Mean age at HSCT and follow-up and length of follow-up were 3.6, 11.8 and 9.9 years. Mean AMH standard deviation scores (SDS) were significantly higher in Group A (-1.047) and Group B (-1.255) than Group C (-1.543), suggesting less ovarian reserve impairment after treosulfan and Flu-Mel than after Bu-Cy. Mean serum AMH concentration was significantly better with treosulfan (>1.0 mug/l) than with Flu-Mel or Bu-Cy. In males, mean Inhibin B SDS was significantly higher in Group A (-0.506) than in Group B (-2.53) and Group C (-1.23) with the Flu-Mel group suffering greatest impairment. In conclusion, a treosulfan-based regimen confers a more favourable outlook for gonadal reserve than Flu-Mel or Bu-Cy in both sexes. Higher values of Inhibin B after Bu-Cy than after Flu-Mel may reflect recovery over time.","['Leiper, Alison', 'Houwing, Maite', 'Davies, E Graham', 'Rao, Kanchan', 'Burns, Siobhan', 'Morris, Emma', 'Laven, Joop', 'van der Kooi, Anne-Lotte', 'van den Heuvel Eibrink, Marry', 'Nussey, Stephen']","['Leiper A', 'Houwing M', 'Davies EG', 'Rao K', 'Burns S', 'Morris E', 'Laven J', 'van der Kooi AL', 'van den Heuvel Eibrink M', 'Nussey S']","['Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, WC1N 3JH, UK. a.leiper@nhs.net.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Centre - Sophia Children's Hospital, 3015 CN, Rotterdam, Netherlands."", 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, WC1N 3JH, UK.', 'Department of Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, WC1N 3JH, UK.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, WC1N 3JH, UK.', 'Department Immunology, UCL Institute of Immunity & Transplantation, Department of immunology, Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Pond Street, London, NW3 2QG, UK.', 'Department Immunology, UCL Institute of Immunity & Transplantation, Department of immunology, Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Pond Street, London, NW3 2QG, UK.', 'Division of Reproductive Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Erasmus Medical Centre - University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Division of Reproductive Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Erasmus Medical Centre - University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""Department of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London, SW17 0RE, UK.""]","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3758-1753', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4834-1130']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200330,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (inhibin B)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '80497-65-0 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone)', 'CO61ER3EPI (treosulfan)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['*Anti-Mullerian Hormone/therapeutic use', '*Busulfan/analogs & derivatives', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Inhibins/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Vidarabine']",,,,,2020/04/02 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0866-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0866-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Oct;55(10):1985-1995. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0866-9.

Baseline data were collected from patients' electronic medical records. Patients' peripheral bloods, bone marrow aspirates, and biopsies were obtained for routine examination, and treatment response and survival profiles as well as adverse events were evaluated. The rates of complete remission (CR), CR with minimal residual disease (MRD) negative/positive, and bridging to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) were 92.3%, 76.9%, 15.4%, and 43.6%, respectively. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 11.6 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0-19.2 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 14.0 months (95% CI: 10.9-17.1 months). Bridging to HSCT independently predicted better EFS and OS, while high bone marrow blasts level independently predicted worse EFS. The incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was 97.4%, and refractory disease as well as decreased white blood cell independently predicted higher risk of severe CRS. Other common adverse events included hematologic toxicities (grade I: 5.1%, grade II: 7.7%, grade III: 17.9%, grade IV: 69.2%), neurotoxicity (28.2%), infection (38.5%), and admission for intensive care unit (10.3%). In conclusion, CAR-T therapy presents with promising treatment response, survival and safety profiles, and higher disease burden predicts worse survival as well as increased risk of severe CRS in Chinese R/R B-ALL patients.","['Li, Limin', 'Liu, Jie', 'Xu, Mengyuan', 'Yu, Hongjuan', 'Lv, Chengfang', 'Cao, Fenglin', 'Wang, Zhenkun', 'Fu, Yueyue', 'Zhang, Mingwen', 'Meng, Hongbin', 'Zhang, Xiaoqian', 'Kang, Liqing', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Li, Jinmei', 'Feng, Jiawei', 'Lian, Xin', 'Yu, Lei', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Li L', 'Liu J', 'Xu M', 'Yu H', 'Lv C', 'Cao F', 'Wang Z', 'Fu Y', 'Zhang M', 'Meng H', 'Zhang X', 'Kang L', 'Zhang Z', 'Li J', 'Feng J', 'Lian X', 'Yu L', 'Zhou J']","['Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Shanghai Unicar-Therapy Bio-medicine Technology Co., Ltd, 201612, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China.', 'Shanghai Unicar-Therapy Bio-medicine Technology Co., Ltd, 201612, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, The Institute of The Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, 150001, Harbin, China. jinzhouh85@163.com.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1106-6200'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200330,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asians', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",PMC7105502,,,,2020/04/02 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2388-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2388-1 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Mar 30;11(3):207. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2388-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapamycin, an mTOR kinase inhibitor, and also a potent autophagy inducer, could not only effectively reverse glucocorticoid resistance, but also promote autophagy in the ALL cells. Autophagy has been suggested to play a paradoxical role in cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to address the role of the rapamycin-induced autophagy in the leukemia treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay in ALL cell lines of CEM-C1 and CEM-C7. Western Blot analysis was performed to test protein expressions. RESULTS: Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin could reverse glucocorticoid resistance in CEM-C1 cells, and also induce autophagy in these cells by up-regulation of LC3-II and Beclin-1 expressions. This autophagy played a pro-survival role since its inhibition by 6-amino-3-methylpurine or chroloquine could enhance rapamycin-induced cell death. Rapamycin increased the expression of intracellular ferritin, and this effect could be totally blocked by 6-amino-3-methylpurine and chroloquine, suggesting that the protective role of autophagy might be mediated through up-regulation of ferritin, the major iron-binding stress protein. Ciclopirox olamine, an iron chelator, could enhance rapamycin's anti-leukemia effect by down-regulation of intracellular ferritin expression. CONCLUSIONS: All these findings would suggest that rapamycin-induced autophagy plays a pro-survival role in leukemia cells and this effect might be mediated by up-regulation of intracellular ferritin expression. We hypothesize that the combination of mTOR pathway inhibitors and autophagy inhibition is rational and would induce strong anti-leukemia effects in ALL.","['Gong, Y', 'Wu, J', 'Yang, R', 'Zhang, L', 'Ma, Z']","['Gong Y', 'Wu J', 'Yang R', 'Zhang L', 'Ma Z']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 60041, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 60041, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 60041, PR China.', 'Department of Forensic Biology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences &amp; Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu 60041, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 60041, PR China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Ferritins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,,,2020/04/02 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['14067 [pii]', '10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-1.14067 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2020 Mar;42(1):11-15. doi: 10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-1.14067.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This issue requires the finding of biomarkers which could predict efficiency of drug administration and choose the best treatment option for each patient individually. The aim of this study was to find out association between cell surface receptors expression levels and CLL B cells sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs ex vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed on malignant B cells isolated from peripheral blood of primary CLL patients. Flow cytometry, qPCR, ex vivo drug sensitivity assay, and cell viability assay were used in this study. RESULTS: The high CD5 expression level was linked to better bendamustine (BEN) and cyclophosphamide (CP) CLL B cells response in contrast to B cells with low CD5 expression. Sensitivity of CLL B cells to CP also could be predicted by high level of CD20 expression. Expression of CD38 and high levels of CD37 and CD40 showed CLL B cells resistance to BEN ex vivo. CLL B cells sensitivity to analyzed chemotherapeutic drugs was not dependent on CD22 expression status. The CD180 expression was detected in CLL B cells which were more susceptible to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) combinatory action. CLL B cells that coexpressed CD150 and CD180 on the cell surface were characterized by significantly decreased cell viability under fludarabine (FLU) exposure alone or FC in comparison with CD150(-)CD180(-) B cells. Cell surface expression level of CD150 was not associated with CLL B cells chemosensitivity. However, high mRNA expression level of mCD150 isoform in CLL B cells was linked to their FLU sensitivity and CP resistance, while high nCD150 mRNA expression level showed resistance to FLU. Simultaneous CD150 and CD180 ligation increased FLU resistance, but BEN susceptibility of CLL B cells. CD150 and CD180 alone or in combination are involved in upregulation of CD20 cell surface expression. CONCLUSION: Expression status of the CD5, CD20, CD37, CD38, CD40, CD150, and CD180 cell surface receptors could be used in prediction CLL B cells sensitivity to FLU, CP, BEN and FC ex vivo. Moreover, CD150 and CD180 receptors are involved in regulation of CLL B cells susceptibility to FLU and BEN. The CD150 and CD180 are positive regulators of CD20 expression that could make CD150(+)CD180(+) CLL B cells more responsive to CD20-based immunotherapy.","['Shcherbina, V', 'Gordiienko, I', 'Shlapatska, L', 'Ivanivska, T', 'Sidorenko, S']","['Shcherbina V', 'Gordiienko I', 'Shlapatska L', 'Ivanivska T', 'Sidorenko S']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Pathobiology, R.E.

The MYC proto-oncogene is considered to contribute to CLL pathogenesis. Increased MYC copy number is associated with poor prognosis in CLL. AIM: To investigate the frequency of MYC gene copy number amplification in IR-exposed CLL patients and relate the findings to the MYC mRNA levels, the presence of unfavourable prognosis mutations (TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1), and patient`s outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of MYC copy number was carried out by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 70 IR-exposed CLL patients. The MYC mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: Increased MYC gene copy number was present in 5.7% of cases. There was a statistically significant association between increased MYC copy number and increased MYC mRNA (p < 0.014). Additionally, somatic deletion in MYC locus was found in one patient. Most of patients (80%) with detected MYC aberrations were previously untreated, suggesting that these lesions might occur early in the course of the disease. The MYC aberrations were found mutually exclusive with high risk TP53 and SF3B1 mutations, while one case was identified, where MYC amplification and NOTCH1 mutation coincided simultaneously. Regarding clinical outcome, the MYC aberrations were associated with a shorter time to first treatment (3 vs 25 months, p = 0.008) as well as reduced overall survival (60 vs 139 months). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that MYC aberrations might be an early event in IR-related CLL and contribute to aggressive disease development in the absence of high risk TP53 and SF3B1 mutations.","['Bilous, N', 'Abramenko, I', 'Chumak, A', 'Dyagil, I', 'Martina, Z']","['Bilous N', 'Abramenko I', 'Chumak A', 'Dyagil I', 'Martina Z']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Hematology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Hematology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Ukraine']",,,,,2020/04/02 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['14214 [pii]', '10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-1.14214 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2020 Mar;42(1):60-65. doi: 10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-1.14214.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its aberrant expression has been considered to be potentially useful as tumor marker. However, the biological background of the role of this aberrant alkaline phosphatase (AP) in cancer is still unclear. The expression of various forms of AP in cells of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has not yet been studied. AIM: To analyze the expression patterns of various AP forms in cells originated from CML patients in blast crisis and to modify their expression by vitamin E. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA extracted from leukemic cells was converted to cDNA and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed using SYBR Green protocol with primers to tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), intestinal alkaline phosphatase and CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins alpha (C/EBPalpha). To analyze the modulation of expression of APs and C/EBPalpha, CML cells were incubated with 100 microM vitamin E. RESULTS: We have observed the aberrant expression of mRNA intestinal alkaline phosphatase in CML cells that upon sequencing demonstrated the significant alignment with PLAP sequence while no gene homology with tissue placental alkaline phosphatase (PAP) was revealed. Vitamin E decreases mRNA PLAP expression and increases mRNA TNAP expression. Moreover, along with down-regulation of aberrant PLAP and up-regulation of TNAP, vitamin E increases C/EBPalpha mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: The loss of TNAP in CML may contribute to pathogenesis of this disease. PLAP may be considered as a putative target in differentiation therapies in myeloid neoplasms. Our findings suggest the potential role of vitamin E as the inducer of differentiation potential of leukemic cells in CML.","['Shvachko, L P', 'Zavelevich, M P', 'Gluzman, D F', 'Telegeev, G D']","['Shvachko LP', 'Zavelevich MP', 'Gluzman DF', 'Telegeev GD']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, NAS of Ukraine, Kyiv 03680, Ukraine.', 'R.E.

The success of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy for treatment of refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has pushed forward research on hematological malignancies. Among the effector types of innate lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells show great importance in immune surveillance against infectious and tumor diseases. Particularly, the role of NK cells has been argued in either elimination of target tumor cells or escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance. Therefore, an NK cell activation approach has been explored. Recent findings demonstrate that invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells capable of producing IFN-gamma when optimally activated can promptly trigger NK cells. Here, we review the role of NKT and/or NK cells and their interaction in anti-tumor responses by highlighting how innate immune cells recognize tumors, exert effector functions, and amplify adaptive immune responses. In addition, we discuss these innate lymphocytes in hematological disorders, particularly multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. The immune balance at different stages of both diseases is explored in light of disease progression. Various types of innate immunity-mediated therapeutic approaches, recent advances in clinical immunotherapies, and iNKT-mediated cancer immunotherapy as next-generation immunotherapy are then discussed.","['Shimizu, Kanako', 'Iyoda, Tomonori', 'Yamasaki, Satoru', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Fujii, And Shin-Ichiro']","['Shimizu K', 'Iyoda T', 'Yamasaki S', 'Kadowaki N', 'Tojo A', 'Fujii AS']","['Laboratory for Immunotherapy, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, 1-7-22, Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Immunotherapy, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, 1-7-22, Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Immunotherapy, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, 1-7-22, Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology, Rheumatology and Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa 761-0793, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Immunotherapy, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, 1-7-22, Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.']",,['eng'],['JP19K07653/JSPS KAKENHI'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200328,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7226455,,['NOTNLM'],"['NK cells', 'dendritic cells', 'hematological malignancy', 'iNKT cells', 'innate immunity']",2020/04/02 06:00,2020/04/02 06:01,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/02 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12040817 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12040817 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Mar 28;12(4). pii: cancers12040817. doi: 10.3390/cancers12040817.,,,,"['K.S., T.I., S.Y., N.K., and A.T. declare no conflicts of interest.

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the intracellular second messenger, has also recently emerged as a target molecule in the immune reaction underlying inflammatory skin conditions. Here, we investigated whether undecane, a naturally occurring plant compound, has anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory activities on sensitized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells and HaCaT keratinocytes and we further explored the potential involvement of the cAMP as a molecular target for undecane. We confirmed that undecane increased intracellular cAMP levels in mast cells and keratinocytes. In sensitized mast cells, undecane inhibited degranulation and the secretion of histamine and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In addition, in sensitized keratinocytes, undecane reversed the increased levels of p38 phosphorylation, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity and target cytokine/chemokine genes, including thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and interleukin-8 (IL-8).

The use of plant in vitro cultures in conjunction with modern genetic engineering techniques allows greater amounts of valuable secondary metabolites to be obtained without interfering with the natural environment. This work presents the first findings concerning the acquisition of transgenic hairy roots of Senna obtusifolia overexpressing the gene encoding squalene synthase 1 from Panax ginseng (PgSS1) (SOPSS hairy loot lines) involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Our results confirm that one of PgSS1-overexpressing hairy root line extracts (SOPSS2) possess a high cytotoxic effect against a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (NALM6) cell line. Further analysis of the cell cycle, the expression of apoptosis-related genes (TP53, PUMA, NOXA, BAX) and the observed decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential also confirmed that the SOPSS2 hairy root extract displays the highest effects; similar results were also obtained for this extract combined with doxorubicin. The high cytotoxic activity, observed both alone or in combination with doxorubicin, may be due to the higher content of betulinic acid as determined by HPLC analysis. Our results suggest synergistic effects of tested extract (betulinic acid in greater amount) with doxorubicin which may be used in the future to develop new effective strategies of cancer chemosensitization.","['Kowalczyk, Tomasz', 'Sitarek, Przemyslaw', 'Toma, Monika', 'Picot, Laurent', 'Wielanek, Marzena', 'Skala, Ewa', 'Sliwinski, Tomasz']","['Kowalczyk T', 'Sitarek P', 'Toma M', 'Picot L', 'Wielanek M', 'Skala E', 'Sliwinski T']","['Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Genetics, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151 Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'La Rochelle Universite, UMRi CNRS 7266 LIENSs, Faculte des Sciences et Technologies, F-17042 La Rochelle CEDEX 1, France.', 'Department of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151 Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200327,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '4G6A18707N (betulinic acid)', '8013-11-4 (Senna Extract)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.5.1.21 (Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Panax/*genetics', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes/analysis', 'Plant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Plant Roots/chemistry/cytology/genetics', 'Plants, Genetically Modified/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Senna Extract/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Senna Plant/genetics']",PMC7226363,,['NOTNLM'],"['*NALM6 leukemia cell line', '*Senna obtusifolia', '*anticancer properties', '*betulinic acid', '*transgenic hairy roots']",2020/04/02 06:00,2021/04/16 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2020/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['biom10040510 [pii]', '10.3390/biom10040510 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2020 Mar 27;10(4). pii: biom10040510. doi: 10.3390/biom10040510.,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, there has been a substantial shift away from the traditional chemotherapy infusions which have allowed patients greater autonomy with oral cancer therapies. This paradigm shift poses new challenges for the medical team, including drug-drug interactions, adherence counseling, and financial toxicity. Pharmacists are uniquely trained and equipped to help to manage the changing landscape of CLL care. From identifying common medications which may impair ibrutinib clearance to ensuring patients are on the appropriate anti-infective prophylaxis while receiving obinutuzumab, pharmacists can play a vital role in ensuring the highest quality of patient care. Furthermore, additional credentialing of clinical pharmacists in select states allows for independent visits with the pharmacists, allowing for greater involvement, particularly for initiation of venetoclax and management of ibrutinib-induced toxicities. Pharmacists are essential to both expanding and enhancing the care of patients with CLL and should be leveraged to improve patient outcomes whenever possible.","['Chen, Kevin Y', 'Brunk, Kelly M', 'Patel, Bianka A', 'Stocker, Kurtis J', 'Auten, Jessica J', 'Buhlinger, Kaitlyn M', 'Muluneh, Benyam']","['Chen KY', 'Brunk KM', 'Patel BA', 'Stocker KJ', 'Auten JJ', 'Buhlinger KM', 'Muluneh B']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.', 'UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.', 'UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.', 'UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.', 'UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200327,Switzerland,Pharmacy (Basel),"Pharmacy (Basel, Switzerland)",101678532,,,,PMC7355755,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'drug-drug interactions', 'ibrutinib', 'initiation', 'monitoring', 'pharmacist', 'toxicity', 'venetoclax']",2020/04/02 06:00,2020/04/02 06:01,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2020/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/02 06:01 [medline]']","['pharmacy8020052 [pii]', '10.3390/pharmacy8020052 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmacy (Basel). 2020 Mar 27;8(2). pii: pharmacy8020052. doi: 10.3390/pharmacy8020052.,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, the leukemic clones of all patients appear to require continuous input from the exterior, most often through membrane receptors, to allow them to survive and grow. This review is presented according to the temporal course that the disease follows, focusing on those external influences from the tissue microenvironment (TME) that support the time lines as well as those internal influences that are inherited or develop as genetic and epigenetic changes occurring over the time line. Regarding the former, special emphasis is placed on the input provided via the B-cell receptor for antigen and the C-X-C-motif chemokine receptor-4 and the therapeutic agents that block these inputs. Regarding the latter, prominence is laid upon inherited susceptibility genes and the genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that lead to the developmental and progression of the disease.","['Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Chen, Shih-Shih', 'Rai, Kanti R']","['Chiorazzi N', 'Chen SS', 'Rai KR']","['The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.', 'The Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York 11549, USA.']",,['eng'],['R01 CA238523/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210201,United States,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine,101571139,"['0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/etiology/genetics/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', '*Signal Transduction', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC7849345,,,,2020/04/02 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2023/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['cshperspect.a035220 [pii]', '10.1101/cshperspect.a035220 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2021 Feb 1;11(2). pii: cshperspect.a035220. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a035220.,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,['2023/02/01 00:00'],,,

In particular, MDR is characterized by increased expression and activity of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily transporters. Sphingolipids are substrates of ABC proteins in cell signaling, membrane biosynthesis, and inflammation, for example, and their products can favor cancer progression. Glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is a ubiquitous glycosphingolipid (GSL) generated by glucosylceramide synthase, a key regulatory enzyme encoded by the UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG) gene. Stressed cells increase de novo biosynthesis of ceramides, which return to sub-toxic levels after UGCG mediates incorporation into GlcCer. Given that cancer cells seem to mobilize UGCG and have increased GSL content for ceramide clearance, which ultimately contributes to chemotherapy failure, here we investigated how inhibition of GSL biosynthesis affects the MDR phenotype of chronic myeloid leukemias. We found that MDR is associated with higher UGCG expression and with a complex GSL profile. UGCG inhibition with the ceramide analog d-threo-1-(3,4,-ethylenedioxy)phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (EtDO-P4) greatly reduced GSL and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside levels, and co-treatment with standard chemotherapeutics sensitized cells to mitochondrial membrane potential loss and apoptosis. ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) expression was reduced, and ABCC-mediated efflux activity was modulated by competition with nonglycosylated ceramides. Consistently, inhibition of ABCC-mediated transport reduced the efflux of exogenous C6-ceramide. Overall, UGCG inhibition impaired the malignant glycophenotype of MDR leukemias, which typically overcomes drug resistance through distinct mechanisms. This work sheds light on the involvement of GSL in chemotherapy failure, and its findings suggest that targeted GSL modulation could help manage MDR leukemias.","['Salustiano, Eduardo J', 'da Costa, Kelli M', 'Freire-de-Lima, Leonardo', 'Mendonca-Previato, Lucia', 'Previato, Jose O']","['Salustiano EJ', 'da Costa KM', 'Freire-de-Lima L', 'Mendonca-Previato L', 'Previato JO']","['Laboratorio de Glicobiologia, Instituto de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho - Centro de Ciencias da Saude C1-042, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Av.

This complex is comprised of core subunits of LMO2 and LDB1 as well as single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSBP) cofactors and DNA-binding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and GATA transcription factors. We analyzed the steady-state abundance and kinetic stability of LMO2 and its partners via Halo protein tagging in conjunction with variant proteins deficient in binding their respective direct protein partners. We discovered a hierarchy of protein stabilities (with half-lives in descending order) as follows: LDB1 > SSBP > LMO2 > TAL1. Importantly, LDB1 is a remarkably stable protein that confers enhanced stability upon direct and indirect partners, thereby nucleating the formation of the multisubunit protein complex. The data imply that free subunits are more rapidly degraded than those incorporated within the LMO2/LDB1 complex. Our studies provided significant insights into LMO2/LDB1 macromolecular protein complex assembly and stability, which has implications for understanding its role in blood cell formation and for therapeutically targeting this complex in human leukemias.","['Layer, Justin H', 'Christy, Michael', 'Placek, Lindsey', 'Unutmaz, Derya', 'Guo, Yan', 'Dave, Utpal P']","['Layer JH', 'Christy M', 'Placek L', 'Unutmaz D', 'Guo Y', 'Dave UP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut, USA.', 'University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA udave@iu.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",,['eng'],"['I01 BX001799/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 CA207530/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 DK106846/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200528,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SSBP1 protein, human)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",PMC7261719,,['NOTNLM'],"['*LIM domain Only 2', '*LIM domain protein 1', '*hematopoietic stem cell', '*leukemia', '*multisubunit complex', '*protein degradation', '*protein turnover', '*pulse-chase']",2020/04/02 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00652-19 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00652-19 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2020 May 28;40(12). pii: MCB.00652-19. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00652-19.

The function of Grasp55 in protein trafficking has been attributed to its PDZ-mediated interaction with the C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs of protein cargos. We have recently shown that such an interaction occurs between Grasp55 and the adhesion molecule Jam-C, which plays a central role in stemness maintenance of hematopoietic and spermatogenic cells. Accordingly, we have found that Grasp55-deficient mice suffer from spermatogenesis defects similar to Jam-C knockout mice. However, whether Grasp55 is involved in the maintenance of immunohematopoietic homeostasis through regulation of protein transport and Jam-C expression remains unknown. In this study, we show that Grasp55 deficiency does not affect hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, engraftment, or mobilization, which are known to depend on expression of Grasp55-dependent protein cargos. In contrast, using an Myc-dependent leukemic model addicted to autophagy, we show that knockdown of Grasp55 in leukemic cells reduces spleen and bone marrow tumor burden upon i.v. leukemic engraftment. This is not due to reduced homing of Grasp55-deficient cells to these organs but to increased spontaneous apoptosis of Grasp55-deficient leukemic cells correlated with increased sensitivity of the cells to glucose deprivation. These results show that Grasp55 plays a role in Myc-transformed hematopoietic cells but not in normal hematopoietic cells in vivo.","['Bailly, Anne-Laure', 'Grenier, Julien M P', 'Cartier-Michaud, Amandine', 'Bardin, Florence', 'Balzano, Marielle', 'Goubard, Armelle', 'Lissitzky, Jean-Claude', 'De Grandis, Maria', 'Mancini, Stephane J C', 'Serge, Arnauld', 'Aurrand-Lions, Michel']","['Bailly AL', 'Grenier JMP', 'Cartier-Michaud A', 'Bardin F', 'Balzano M', 'Goubard A', 'Lissitzky JC', 'De Grandis M', 'Mancini SJC', 'Serge A', 'Aurrand-Lions M']","['Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang PACA Corse, Biologie des Groupes Sanguins, UMR 7268, Aix Marseille Universite, CNRS, Marseille 13005, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue contre le Cancer, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancerology Research Center of Marseille, Marseille 13009, France; and michel.aurrand-lions@inserm.fr.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4141-1132', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9255-4606', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4271-3706', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8361-3034']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200330,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Golgi Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Gorasp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Autophagy', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Survival', 'Golgi Apparatus/*pathology', 'Golgi Matrix Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden']",,,,,2020/04/02 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1901124 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1901124 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 May 15;204(10):2685-2696. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1901124.

However, some patients will develop a relapse. We sought define the unfavorable group of CBF-AML by analysis of (c-KIT and FLT3-ITD) and to correlate them with treatment outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 70 patients with CBF-AML diagnosed and managed at the medical oncology department of the (National Cancer Institute), Cairo University, with analysis of c-KIT and FLT3 mutations. All patients had received ""3 + 7"" induction, followed by 3 to 4 courses of high-dose cytarabine consolidation. The institutional review board approved the present study. RESULTS: The median patient age was 31 years (range, 18-60 years), with a male/female ratio of 4:3. Of the 70 patients, 42 (60%) had t(8;21) and 28 had inv(16) (40%). c-KIT mutations (exons 8 and 17) were detected in 10 of 52 tested patients, and FLT3-ITD was detected in 3 of 70 patients. Patients with inv(16) experienced more lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, had a higher median initial leukocyte count. Hepatitis C antibody positivity (8 of 42) was exclusively present in patients with t(8;21). The median overall survival (OS) was 19.5 months, and the median disease-free survival (DFS) was not reached. Patients with inv(16) had near-significant (P = .07) better DFS than patients with t(8;21). c-KIT mutations had no significant effect on OS or DFS. However, reverse tyrosine kinase mutations had a negative effect on DFS but not OS (P = .04). CONCLUSION: CBF-AML with reverse tyrosine kinase mutation conveys a worse prognosis. Hepatitis C virus antibody positivity might be associated with t(8;21) AML and inv(16) with more extramedullary disease.","['Alnagar, Ahmed A', 'Mahmoud, Asmaa A', 'El Gammal, Mosaad M', 'Hamdy, Naera', 'Samra, Mohamed A']","['Alnagar AA', 'Mahmoud AA', 'El Gammal MM', 'Hamdy N', 'Samra MA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between TAB3 and PIM1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and determined the potential role and molecular mechanism of TAB3 in PIM1-mediated CRC growth. We found that TAB3 and PIM1 expression levels were positively correlated in CRC tissues. The knockdown of TAB3 significantly decreased PIM1 expression and inhibited CRC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The upregulation of PIM1 rescued the decreased cell proliferation induced by TAB3 knockdown, whereas PIM1 knockdown decreased TAB3-enhanced CRC proliferation. Additionally, TAB3 regulates PIM1 expression through the STAT3 signalling pathway and confirmed a positive correlation between TAB3 and phosphorylated-STAT3 expression in CRC tissues. Patients with high expression of TAB3 and phosphorylated-STAT3 had the worst prognosis. Mechanistically, TAB3 regulates PIM1 expression by promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and activation through the formation of the TAB3-TAK1-STAT3 complex. Overall, a novel CRC regulatory circuit involving the TAB3-TAK1-STAT3 complex and PIM1 was identified, the dysfunction of which may contribute to CRC tumorigenesis.","['Li, Qing', 'Chen, Leifeng', 'Luo, Chen', 'ChenYan', 'Ge, Jin', 'Zhu, Zhengming', 'Wang, Kai', 'Yu, Xin', 'Lei, Jun', 'Liu, Tiande', 'Peng, Xiaogang', 'Liu, Xiuxia', 'Yuan, Rongfa']","['Li Q', 'Chen L', 'Luo C', 'ChenYan', 'Ge J', 'Zhu Z', 'Wang K', 'Yu X', 'Lei J', 'Liu T', 'Peng X', 'Liu X', 'Yuan R']","['Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Department of Pathology,Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Jiangxi Province Clinical Research Center of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Pathology,Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Pathology,Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.

MDR is caused by different mechanisms such as the expression of the ABC-transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1, ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2). These transporters efflux xenobiotic toxins, including chemotherapeutics, and they were found to be overexpressed in different cancer types. PURPOSE: Identification of novel molecules that overcome MDR by targeting ABC-transporters. METHODS: Resazurin reduction assay was used for cytotoxicity test. AutoDock 4.2. was used for molecular docking. The function of P-gp and BCRP was tested using a doxorubicin uptake assay and an ATPase assay. ROS generation was detected using flow cytometry for the measurement of H2DCFH-DA fluorescence. Annexin/PI staining was applied for the detection of apoptosis. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using LigandScout 3.12. software and DataWarrior software. RESULTS: In our search for new molecules that selectively act against resistant phenotypes, we identified isopetasin and S-isopetasin, which are bioactive natural products from Petasites formosanus. They exerted collateral sensitivity towards leukemia cells with high P-gp expression in CEM/ADR5000 cells, compared to sensitive wild-type CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. Also, they revealed considerable activity towards breast cancer cells overexpressing breast cancer resistance protein, MDA-MB-231-BCRP clone 23. This motivated us to investigate whether the function of P-gp was inhibited. In-silico results showed the compounds bound with high affinity and interacted with key amino acid residues in P-gp . Then, we found that the two compounds increased doxorubicin accumulation in P-gp overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 by three-fold compared to cells without inhibitor. P-gp-mediated drug efflux was ATP-dependent. Isopetasin and S-isopetasin increased the ATPase activity of human P-gp in a comparable fashion as verapamil used as control P-gp inhibitor. As isopetasin and S-isopetasin exerted dual roles, first as cytotoxic compounds and then as P-gp inhibitors, we suggested that their P-gp inhibition is part of a larger complex of mechanisms to induce cell death in cancer patients. P-gp dysfunction induces mitochondrial stress to generate ATP. Upon continuing stress by P-gp inhibition, the mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Initially established for verapamil, this theory was validated in the present study for isopetasin and S-isopetasin, as treatment with the two candidates increased ROS levels in CEM/ADR5000 cells followed by apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance of isopetasin and S-isopetasin as novel ROS-generating and apoptosis-inducing P-gp inhibitors.","['Abdelfatah, Sara', 'Bockers, Madeleine', 'Asensio, Maitane', 'Kadioglu, Onat', 'Klinger, Anette', 'Fleischer, Edmond', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Abdelfatah S', 'Bockers M', 'Asensio M', 'Kadioglu O', 'Klinger A', 'Fleischer E', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany; Experimental Hepatology and Drug Targeting (HEVEFARM), IBSAL, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.

METHODS: We designed a prospective genetically randomized study to evaluate donor options between acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients positive for measurable residual disease (MRD) pre-transplantation who underwent HIDT (n = 169) or MSDT (n = 39). RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of positive MRD post-transplantation was 26% (95% CI, 19-33%) and 44% (95% CI, 28-60%) for HIDT and MSDT, respectively (P = 0.043). Compared to the HIDT cohort, the MSDT cohort had a higher 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; 47%, 95% CI, 31-63% vs. 23%, 95% CI, 17-29%; P = 0.006) and lower 3-year probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS; 43%, 95% CI, 27-59% vs. 65%, 95% CI, 58-72%; P = 0.023) and overall survival (OS; 46%, 95% CI, 30-62% vs. 68%, 95% CI, 61-75%; P = 0.039), without a difference in non-relapse-mortality (10%, 95% CI, 1-19% vs. 11%, 95% CI, 6-16%; P = 0.845). Multivariate analysis showed that HIDT is associated with a low CIR (HR = 0.364; 95% CI, 0.202-0.655; P = 0.001) and better LFS (HR = 0.414; 95% CI, 0.246-0.695; P = 0.001) and OS (HR = 0.380; 95% CI, 0.220-0.656; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HIDT is better than MSDT in view of favorable anti-leukemia activity for patients with pre-transplantation MRD positive ALL.

They are divided into short and long ncRNAs, according to their length. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are included in the second group and were recently discovered as being originated by back-splicing, joining either single or multiple exons, or exons with retained introns. The human Plasmacytoma Variant Translocation 1 (PVT1) gene maps on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q24) and encodes for 52 ncRNAs variants, including 26 linear and 26 circular isoforms, and 6 microRNAs. PVT1 genomic locus is 54 Kb downstream to MYC and several interactions have been described among these two genes, including a feedback regulatory mechanism. MYC-independent functions of PVT1/circPVT1 have been also reported, especially in the regulation of immune responses. We here review and discuss the role of both PVT1 and circPVT1 in the hematopoietic system. No information is currently available concerning their transforming ability in hematopoietic cells. However, present literature supports their cooperation with a more aggressive and/or undifferentiated cell phenotype, thus contributing to cancer progression. PVT1/circPVT1 upregulation through genomic amplification or rearrangements and/or increased transcription, provides a proliferative advantage to malignant cells in acute myeloid leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, Burkitt lymphoma, multiple myeloma (linear PVT1) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (circPVT1). In addition, PVT1 and circPVT1 regulate immune responses: the overexpression of the linear form in myeloid derived suppressor cells induced immune tolerance in preclinical tumor models and circPVT1 showed immunosuppressive properties in myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets. Overall, these recent data on PVT1 and circPVT1 functions in hematological malignancies and immune responses reflect two faces of the same coin: involvement in cancer progression by promoting a more aggressive phenotype of malignant cells and negative regulation of the immune system as a novel potential therapy-resistance mechanism.","['Ghetti, Martina', 'Vannini, Ivan', 'Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Simonetti, Giorgia']","['Ghetti M', 'Vannini I', 'Storlazzi CT', 'Martinelli G', 'Simonetti G']","['Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, FC, Italy.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, FC, Italy. ivan.vannini@irst.emr.it.', 'Department of Biology, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, FC, Italy.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, FC, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200330,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (PVT1 long-non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunity/*immunology', 'RNA, Circular/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",PMC7104523,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematological malignancies', '*Immune response', '*Non coding RNAs', '*PVT1']",2020/04/02 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-020-01187-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-020-01187-5 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2020 Mar 30;19(1):69. doi: 10.1186/s12943-020-01187-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigations have shown that the heterodimers S100A8 and S100A9 inhibit the enzyme casein kinase 2 and then prevent the activation of the E7 oncoprotein. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of calprotectin as an antitumor compound on the Nalm6 (B cell precursor leukemia cell line). MATERIALS & METHODS: Transformation of genes encoding S100A8 and S100A9 human, designed in the pQE32 plasmid, was performed by the thermal shock method into E. coli M15 bacteria. After bacterial growth in LB medium, the expression of two S100A8 and S100A9 subunits, the solubility of the protein by SDS-PAGE method was determined. Finally, the S100A8 / A9 complex was equally placed in the microtube. In the next step, the cytotoxic effects of calprotectin produced on the Nalm6 cell line were evaluated using the wst1 test. Then, the apoptosis in these cells was measured using flow cytometry methods with Annexin-V coloration. RESULTS: In the current study, the results showed that the cytotoxic effects of Calprotectin are time and concentration- dependent. Therefore, it can reduce the tumor expression and had a beneficial effect by induced apoptosis in Nalm6 cell line. CONCLUSION: Calprotectin has an anti-tumor effect on the Nalm6 cell line by increasing apoptosis.","['Charkhizadeh, Samira', 'Imani, Mehdi', 'Gheibi, Nematollah', 'Shabaani, Fateme', 'Nikpajouh, Akbar', 'Rezvany, Mohammad R']","['Charkhizadeh S', 'Imani M', 'Gheibi N', 'Shabaani F', 'Nikpajouh A', 'Rezvany MR']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Ghazvin, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Ghazvin, Iran.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Calprotectin', '*Nalm6', '*S100A8', '*S100A9', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*pQE32 plasmid']",2020/04/02 06:00,2021/05/29 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-105556 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200331101209 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(8):951-962. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200331101209.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carnitine (250 mg/kg body weight/day) and etoposide (5 mg/kg body weight/day) were administered from 25-days postpartum to 32-days postpartum. Testes were collected at 32-days postpartum, 64-days postpartum, and 127-days postpartum, and submitted to the immuno-labeling of UTF1, SOX2, and PLZF proteins to identify undifferentiated spermatogonia populations. At 127-days postpartum, sperm were collected for analysis. Carnitine+etoposide group showed a higher numerical density of spermatogonia labeled for all studied proteins at 64-days postpartum (critical age) compared to the etoposide group. Moreover, there was an improvement of spermatic parameters and sperm DNA integrity in rats of the carnitine+etoposide group in comparison with rats of the etoposide group. The results suggest that carnitine improves the self-renewal of undifferentiated spermatogonia and promotes a partial protection on them, alleviating the etoposide harmful late effects and leading to an enhancement of the sperm parameters in adulthood.","['Okada, Fatima Kazue', 'Stumpp, Taiza', 'Miraglia, Sandra Maria']","['Okada FK', 'Stumpp T', 'Miraglia SM']","['Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8678-1095'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200331,United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox2 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (UTF1 protein, rat)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carnitine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Self Renewal/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/metabolism', 'Rats', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Seminiferous Epithelium/drug effects/growth & development', 'Spermatogenesis/drug effects', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Testis/drug effects/growth & development', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC7226625,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA integrity', '*cancer', '*carnitine', '*cell protector', '*chemotherapeutic agent', '*etoposide', '*pre-puberty', '*sperm', '*spermatogonia stem cell']",2020/04/02 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/04/02 06:00'],"['2020/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1369/0022155420916274 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 2020 May;68(5):327-342. doi: 10.1369/0022155420916274.

To approach the challenge of site-specific LSD1 inhibition, we developed an enzyme-prodrug system with the bacterial nitroreductase NfsB (NTR) that was expressed in the virally transfected AML cell line THP1-NTR(+) . The cellular activity of the NTR was proven with a new luminescent NTR probe. We synthesised a diverse set of nitroaromatic prodrugs that by design do not affect LSD1 and are reduced by the NTR to release an active LSD1 inhibitor.

The 2-nitroimidazolyl prodrug of a potent LSD1 inhibitor emerged as one of the best prodrug candidates with a pronounced selectivity window between wild-type and transfected THP1 cells.

The TARGET survey examined real-world management of CML patients compared with international recommendations. This online survey was completed in 2017. Results were discussed by a Steering Committee (SC) of eight international haematologists, challenges were identified and practical solutions developed. Of the 1008 haematologists invited (33 countries), 614 completed the survey. Gaps regarding treatment efficacy and molecular monitoring were identified. Half of the physicians did not perform three-monthly testing of during the initial 12 months of treatment, citing cost as the major barrier, although they know it should be done. Treatment-free remission was not considered a primary treatment goal or as a priority factor influencing treatment decisions. European Leukemia Net guidelines interpretation was generally acceptable, but awareness regarding management of persistent adverse events was poor. Practical solutions proposed by the SC were mostly focused on enhancing physician education and awareness, or encouraging hospitals to work with the government, in order to improve the quality of BCR-ABL testing. Gaps in current CML management were identified compared with international recommendations, which the proposed practical solutions would help to address.","['Turkina, Anna', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Mathews, Vikram', 'Saydam, Guray', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Al Hashmi, Hani Hassan', 'Yassin, Mohamed', 'Le Clanche, Solenn', 'Miljkovic, Darko', 'Slader, Cassandra', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['Turkina A', 'Wang J', 'Mathews V', 'Saydam G', 'Jung CW', 'Al Hashmi HH', 'Yassin M', 'Le Clanche S', 'Miljkovic D', 'Slader C', 'Hughes TP']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Ege University Hospital, Bornova Izmir, Turkey.', 'Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Adult Hematology & Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Department, Oncology Center, King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam, KSA, Saudi Arabia.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Doha, Qatar.', 'KPL, Paris, France.', 'Novartis Hematology Emerging Growth Markets, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Hematology Emerging Growth Markets, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9437-9151', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9417-2353', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1060-8397', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0910-3730']",['eng'],"['Novartis', 'Fusion Pharma']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200330,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', '*Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*management', '*real-life practice', '*treatment-free remission', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/04/01 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/04/01 06:00'],"['2019/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16599 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Sep;190(6):869-876. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16599.

Recognising that there are unique aspects of veterinary practice in certain geographical regions of the world, the Vaccination Guidelines Group undertook a regional project in Latin America between 2016 and 2019, culminating in the present document. The Vaccination Guidelines Group gathered scientific and demographic data during visits to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, by discussion with national key opinion leaders, visiting veterinary practices and review of the scientific literature. A questionnaire survey was completed by 1390 veterinarians in five Latin American countries and the Vaccination Guidelines Group delivered continuing education at seven events attended by over 3500 veterinarians. The Vaccination Guidelines Group recognised numerous challenges in Latin America, for example: (1) lack of national oversight of the veterinary profession, (2) extraordinary growth in private veterinary schools of undetermined quality, (3) socioeconomic constraints on client engagement with preventive health care, (4) high regional prevalence of some key infectious diseases (e.g. feline leukaemia virus infection, canine visceral leishmaniosis), (5) almost complete lack of minimal antigen vaccine products as available in other markets, (6) relative lack of vaccine products with extended duration of immunity as available in other markets, (7) availability of vaccine products withdrawn from other markets (e.g. Giardia vaccine) or unique to Latin America (e.g. some Leishmania vaccines), (8) accessibility of vaccines directly by pet owners or breeders such that vaccination is not delivered under veterinary supervision, (9) limited availability of continuing education in veterinary vaccinology and lack of compulsion for continuing professional development and (10) limited peer-reviewed published scientific data on small companion animal infectious diseases (with the exception of leishmaniosis) and lack of support for such academic research. In this document, the Vaccination Guidelines Group summarises the findings of this project and assesses in evidence-based fashion the scientific literature pertaining to companion animal vaccine-preventable diseases in Latin America. The Vaccination Guidelines Group makes some recommendations on undergraduate and postgraduate education and academic research. Recognising that current product availability in Latin America does not permit veterinarians in these countries to vaccinate according to the global World Small Animal Veterinary Association guidelines, the Vaccination Guidelines Group makes a series of ""pragmatic"" recommendations as to what might be currently achievable, and a series of ""aspirational"" recommendations as to what might be desirable for the future. The concept of ""vaccine husbandry"" is addressed via some simple guidelines for the management of vaccine products in the practice. Finally, the Vaccination Guidelines Group emphasises the global trend towards delivery of vaccination as one part of an ""annual health check"" or ""health care plan"" that reviews holistically the preventive health care needs of the individual pet animal. Latin American practitioners should transition towards these important new practices that are now well embedded in more developed veterinary markets. The document also includes 70 frequently asked questions and their answers; these were posed to the Vaccination Guidelines Group during our continuing education events and small group discussions and should address many of the issues surrounding delivery of vaccination in the Latin American countries.

The accumulation of MDSCs has been demonstrated in many types of human solid tumors. However, the relevance of this heterogeneous population in hematopoietic malignancies has only recently gained stronger attention. MDSCs are a phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous group of cells. The results of recent studies indicate that the immune dysregulation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) affects a monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) subpopulation. This study aimed to analyze the frequency of M-MDSCs with intracellular IL-10 and TGF-b1 expression in newly diagnosed CLL patients. We investigated the potential role of M-MDSCs in CLL by analyzing the level of IL-10 and TGF-beta1 expression in circulating M-MDSCs in correlation with clinical and laboratory parameters characterizing disease activity and patients' immune status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy CLL patients and 17 age-matched healthy volunteers were included in this study. Flow cytometric detection of Mo-MDSCs (CD14+CD11b+CD15-HLA-DR-/low) with intracellular IL-10 and TGF-c1 expression was done. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher median percentage of M-MDSC with IL-10 or TGF-beta1 expression in CLL patients than in healthy volunteers. The percentage of M-MDSC with intracellular IL-10 or TGF-beta1 expression was significantly lower in CLL patients at stage 0 as compared to the stages I/II and III/IV according to Rai stages. The percentage of M-MDSC with intracellular TGF-beta1 expression was significantly higher in ZAP-70-positive and CD38-positive patients compared with ZAP-70-negative and group of CD38-negative ones. There was also a significantly higher percentage of M-MDSC positive for intracellular TGF-beta expression in patients carrying the 11q22.3 and/or the 17p13.1 deletion than in patients without these genetic aberrations. The percentage of M-MDSC IL-10-positive and M-MDSC TGF-beta1-positive measured at the time of diagnosis was higher in patients requiring therapy as compared to patients without treatment during the observation period. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have shown that an increased percentage of M-MDSC cells producing IL-10 and TGF-beta1 in CLL patients may be associated with the suppression of the immune response against CLL. It can be assumed that the increased percentage of M-MDSC with an intracellular expression of IL-10 and TGF-beta1 may be used in the future as the factor defining the group of patients with shorter time to onset of treatment.","['Kowalska, Wioleta', 'Bojarska-Junak, Agnieszka']","['Kowalska W', 'Bojarska-Junak A']","['Chair and Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland. abojarskajunak@gmail.com.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2340-9442', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0930-5874']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200330,Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*physiology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-10', '*M-MDSC', '*TGF-b', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*flow cytometry', '*genetic analysis']",2020/04/01 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/04/01 06:00'],"['2020/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['VM/OJS/J/67740 [pii]', '10.5603/FHC.a2020.0006 [doi]']",ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2020;58(1):25-36. doi: 10.5603/FHC.a2020.0006.

However, disseminated VZV infection with multiple organ involvement can occur in immunocompromised patients with impaired T cell immunity including solid or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, receiving immunosuppressive therapy, leukemia, lymphoma, and HIV infection. Prompt antiviral therapy is mandatory in those immunocompromised persons. A 52 year-old man receiving chronic immunosuppressive drugs for his underlying leukocytoclastic vasculitis visited emergency department for diffuse skin vesicular rash that developed 4 days after contact with varicella zoster patients at his office.

Methods: Related articles published between January 2009 and April 2019 were selected and patients were separated as monotherapy group and combination group for meta-analysis. Studies on HMA combination therapy were further divided into two subgroups according to the intensity of combined chemotherapy. Meanwhile, subgroups with similar patients' baseline characteristics were selected for further analysis. Complete response (CR) rate, overall response (ORR) rate, two-year overall survival (OS) rate, one-month and 24-month death rate and the proportion of adverse events (AE) were pooled and compared. Results: 21 RCT or cohort studies with 1764 patients (1266 patients for monotherapy group and 498 patients for HMA combination group) were selected for meta-analysis. For the pooled data, the age of patients was significantly younger and the percentage of patients with favorable/intermediate cytogenetic risk was significantly higher in the HMA combination group than that in the HMA monotherapy group. Combination therapy group had a significantly higher CR and ORR rate (55% vs 22%, P=0.000 for CR and 67% vs 42%, P=0.000 for ORR), and a higher two-year OS rate (37% vs 21%, P=0.000). However, the incidence of infection and gastrointestinal disorder was significantly higher (51% vs 23% for infection, P=0.000; 21% vs 0% for gastrointestinal disorder, P=0.000) in combination group. In subgroups with different intensity of combined chemotherapy, all baseline characteristics were compatible except that the percentage of patients with favorable/intermediate cytogenetic risk was significantly lower (63% vs 88%, P=0.000) in the HMA + high-intensity chemotherapy subgroup, and this group presented with a lower CR and ORR rate (46% vs 65% for CR, P=0.000; 57% vs 79% for ORR, P=0.000), but a compatible two-month to 24-month death rate compared with HMA + low-intensity chemotherapy subgroup (9% vs 14% for 2-month death rate, P=0.060; 58% vs 65% for 24-month death rate, P=0.242). In subgroup with similar patients' baseline characteristics, 208 and 205 patients were included in combination group and HMA monotherapy group, respectively. Although combination group had a significantly higher CR rate (62% vs 24%, P=0.000) and ORR rate (68% vs 48%, P=0.000), it finally had a lower two-year OS (30% vs 45%, P=0.001) compared with monotherapy group, and the death rate was significantly higher since the ninth month in combination therapy group than that in the monotherapy group (42% vs 31%, P=0.032). In this subgroup, patients with HMA+ high-intensity chemotherapy had a compatible CR, ORR and 1.5-year OS rate as compared with baseline-compatible patients with HMA + low-intensity chemotherapy. Conclusions: HMA combined with chemotherapy could increase CR rate and ORR rate in all patients. HMA combined with high-intensity chemotherapy can rescue the 2-year OS with less favorable cytogenetic stratification to some extent. For patients with similar older age and risk stratification, combination therapy even had a lower long-term OS regardless of the intensity of combined chemotherapy.","['Ji, Jiang', 'Chen, Miao', 'Han, Bing']","['Ji J', 'Chen M', 'Han B']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100730, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200304,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,PMC7086269,,['NOTNLM'],"['HMA and chemotherapy combination therapy', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hypomethylating agent', 'monotherapy', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",2020/04/01 06:00,2020/04/01 06:01,['2020/04/01 06:00'],"['2019/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.40614 [doi]', 'jcav11p2972 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 Mar 4;11(10):2972-2980. doi: 10.7150/jca.40614. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) The author(s).'],,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To further understand the involvement of this gene family into Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia reactions, knowledge of haplotype structures, and allelic linkage is of importance. In this analysis, we estimate population-specific KIR haplotype frequencies at allele group resolution in a cohort of n = 458 German families. We addressed the polymorphism of the KIR gene complex and phasing ambiguities by a combined approach. Haplotype inference within first-degree family relations allowed us to limit the number of possible diplotypes. Structural restriction to a pattern set of 92 previously described KIR copy number haplotypes further reduced ambiguities. KIR haplotype frequency estimation was finally accomplished by means of an expectation-maximization algorithm. Applying a resolution threshold of (1/2) n, we were able to identify a set of 551 KIR allele group haplotypes, representing 21 KIR copy number haplotypes. The haplotype frequencies allow studying linkage disequilibrium in two-locus as well as in multi-locus analyses. Our study reveals associations between KIR haplotype structures and allele group frequencies, thereby broadening our understanding of the KIR gene complex.","['Solloch, Ute V', 'Schefzyk, Daniel', 'Schafer, Gesine', 'Massalski, Carolin', 'Kohler, Maja', 'Pruschke, Jens', 'Heidl, Annett', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Schmidt, Alexander H', 'Lange, Vinzenz', 'Sauter, Jurgen']","['Solloch UV', 'Schefzyk D', 'Schafer G', 'Massalski C', 'Kohler M', 'Pruschke J', 'Heidl A', 'Schetelig J', 'Schmidt AH', 'Lange V', 'Sauter J']","['DKMS, Tubingen, Germany.', 'DKMS, Tubingen, Germany.', 'DKMS Life Science Lab, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS Life Science Lab, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS Life Science Lab, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS, Tubingen, Germany.', 'DKMS Life Science Lab, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS, Tubingen, Germany.', 'University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS, Tubingen, Germany.', 'DKMS Life Science Lab, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS Life Science Lab, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS, Tubingen, Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200312,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Cohort Studies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Germany', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics', 'Whites/genetics']",PMC7080815,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HSCT', '*KIR', '*donor selection', '*haplotype frequency', '*immunogenetics']",2020/04/01 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/04/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00429 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Mar 12;11:429. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00429. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Solloch, Schefzyk, Schafer, Massalski, Kohler, Pruschke,', 'Heidl, Schetelig, Schmidt, Lange and Sauter.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoiesis cell kinase (HCK), a member of the c-SRC family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, was among the top hits. The C-terminal 40 amino acids of HCK selectively bound to NLRP12's PYD + NBD, but not to that of NLRP3 and NLRP8. Amino acids F503, I506, Q507, L510, and D511 of HCK are critical for the binding of HCK's C-terminal 40 amino acids to NLRP12's PYD + NBD. Additionally, the C-terminal 30 amino acids of HCK are sufficient to bind to NLRP12's PYD + NBD, but not to its PYD alone nor to its NBD alone. In cell lines that express HCK endogenously, it was co- immunoprecipitated with stably expressed exogenous NLRP12. Also, NLRP12 co-immunoprecipitated and co-localized with HCK when both were overexpressed in 293T cells. In addition, in this overexpression system, steady-state NLRP12 protein expression levels significantly decreased when HCK was co-expressed. Bioinformatic analysis showed that HCK mRNA co-occurred with NLRP12 mRNA, but not with other NLRP mRNAs, in blood and marrow samples from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The mRNA of NLRP12 is also co-expressed with HCK in AML patient samples, and the levels of mRNA expression of each are correlated. Together these data suggest that NLRP12, through its binding to HCK, may have an effect on the pathogenesis of AML.","['Zhang, Yue', 'Okamoto, Curtis T']","['Zhang Y', 'Okamoto CT']","['Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, USA 90089-9121.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, USA 90089-9121.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200305,Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NLRP12 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/blood/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/blood/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",PMC7097926,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HCK', '*NLRP12', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*innate immunity', '*protein-protein interaction', '*yeast two-hybrid']",2020/04/01 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2020/04/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijbs.41798 [doi]', 'ijbsv16p1507 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2020 Mar 5;16(9):1507-1525. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.41798. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) The author(s).'],,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, and Embase up to January 2020 and Web of Science up to 2018 July, including cohort studies reporting the association between maternal reproductive factors of age at birth, birth order, number of births, delivery methods, and breastfeeding duration and cancer in children. Teams of two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted random effects meta-analyses to estimate summary relative estimates, calculated absolute differences between those with and without risk factors, and used the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: For most exposures and most cancers, we found no suggestion of a causal relation. We found low to very low certainty evidence of the following very small possible impact: higher maternal age at birth with adult multiple myeloma and lifetime uterine cervix cancer incidence; lower maternal age at birth with childhood overall cancer mortality (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.01-1.30; AR/10,000 = 1, 95% CI = 0 to 2), adult leukemia and lifetime uterine cervix cancer incidence; higher birth order with adult melanoma, cervix uteri, corpus uteri, thyroid cancer incidence, lifetime lung, corpus uteri, prostate, testis, sarcoma, thyroid cancer incidence; larger number of birth with childhood brain (RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.06-1.52; AR/10,000 = 1, 95% CI = 0 to 2), leukemia (RR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.62-2.75; AR/10,000 = 9, 95% CI = 5 to 14), lymphoma (RR = 4.66, 95% CI = 1.40-15.57; AR/10,000 = 11, 95% CI = 1 to 44) incidence, adult stomach, corpus uteri cancer incidence and lung cancer mortality, lifetime stomach, lung, uterine cervix, uterine corpus, multiple myeloma, testis cancer incidence; Caesarean delivery with childhood kidney cancer incidence (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.01-1.55; AR/10,000 = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 1); and breastfeeding with adult colorectal cancer incidence.

Whether such therapies are efficient during an acute infection remains elusive. To address this, inhibitory receptors were blocked and regulatory T cells depleted in acutely Friend retrovirus-infected mice. CIT resulted in a dramatic expansion of cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a subsequent reduction in viral loads. Despite limited viral replication, mice developed fatal immunopathology after CIT. The pathology was most severe in the gastrointestinal tract and was mediated by granzyme B producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A similar post-CIT pathology during acute Influenza virus infection of mice was observed, which could be prevented by vaccination. Melanoma patients who developed immune-related adverse events under immune checkpoint CIT also presented with expanded granzyme-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Our data suggest that acute infections may induce immunopathology in patients treated with CIT, and that effective measures for infection prevention should be applied.","['David, Paul',

This study aims to demonstrate the antagonistic regulation between beta-catenin and PTPRG in CML cells. The specific inhibition of PTPRG increases the activation state of BCR-ABL1 and modulates the expression of the BCR-ABL1- downstream gene beta-Catenin. PTPRG was found to be capable of dephosphorylating beta-catenin, eventually causing its cytosolic destabilization and degradation in cells expressing PTPRG. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the increased expression of beta-catenin in PTPRG-negative CML cell lines correlates with DNA (cytosine-5)-methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1) over-expression, which is responsible for PTPRG promoter hypermethylation, while its inhibition or down-regulation correlates with PTPRG re-expression. We finally confirmed the role of PTPRG in regulating BCR-ABL1 and beta-catenin phosphorylation in primary human CML samples. We describe here, for the first time, the existence of a regulative loop occurring between PTPRG and beta-catenin, whose reciprocal imbalance affects the proliferation kinetics of CML cells.","['Tomasello, Luisa', 'Vezzalini, Marzia', 'Boni, Christian', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'Yassin, Mohamed', 'Al-Dewik, Nader', 'Takam Kamga, Paul', 'Krampera, Mauro', 'Sorio, Claudio']","['Tomasello L', 'Vezzalini M', 'Boni C', 'Bonifacio M', 'Scaffidi L', 'Yassin M', 'Al-Dewik N', 'Takam Kamga P', 'Krampera M', 'Sorio C']","['Department of Medicine, General Pathology Division, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, General Pathology Division, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, General Pathology Division, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Department of Hematology and BMT, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar and College of Medicine Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', ""Pediatrics department, Women's Wellness and Research Center (WWRC), Interim Translational Research Institute (iTRI), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and College of Health and Life Science (CHLS), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar."", 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, General Pathology Division, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5476-0844', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9982-4100', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1144-8076', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5739-1135', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8586-1381', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7280-2040']",['eng'],"['4-157-3-052/Qatar National Research Fund', 'IG 4667/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro']",['Journal Article'],20200326,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRG protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 5)']",IM,"['DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 5/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta Catenin/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC7177637,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine', 'DNMT', 'PTPRG', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'methylation', 'tumor suppressor', 'tyrosine phosphatase', 'beta-catenin']",2020/04/01 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/04/01 06:00'],"['2020/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21072298 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21072298 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Mar 26;21(7). pii: ijms21072298. doi: 10.3390/ijms21072298.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data on the therapeutic utility of CD38 targeting in other lymphoid malignancies are limited. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the prognostic significance of CD38 expression is well accepted, and preclinical studies on the use of Daratumumab in monotherapy or combination therapy have demonstrated considerable efficacy. In other lymphoproliferative disorders, preclinical and clinical data have not been as compelling; however, CD38 overexpression likely contributes to resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, prompting numerous clinical trials in Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma to investigate whether blocking CD38 enhances the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, due to its widespread expression in hematological tumors, CD38 represents an attractive target for cellular therapies such as CAR-T cells. The present review discusses current knowledge of CD38 expression and its implications in various lymphoid malignancies. Furthermore, it addresses current and future therapeutic perspectives, with a particular emphasis on the significance of CD38 interaction with immune cells of the tumor microenvironment.

New and targeted treatment options are warranted for this disease. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are increasingly being used for preclinical testing of novel treatment modalities. A novel approach involving targeted error-corrected RNA sequencing using ArcherDX HemeV2 kit was employed to compare 25 primary pediatric acute leukemia samples and their corresponding PDX samples. A comparison of the primary samples and PDX samples revealed a high concordance between single nucleotide variants and gene fusions whereas other complex structural variants were not as consistent. The presence of gene fusions representing the major driver mutations at similar allelic frequencies in PDX samples compared to primary samples and over multiple passages confirms the utility of PDX models for preclinical drug testing.

A 72-year-old man had been diagnosed with CLL 16 years ago and was followed-up without treatment. He developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia 2 years ago, which resolved with rituximab and prednisolone treatment. Subsequently, he presented with fever, abdominal bloating, and fatigue. Progressive lymphocytosis and splenomegaly with elevated lactic dehydrogenase levels were suggestive of RS. Bone marrow examination revealed a small- to medium-sized lymphoid infiltrate, which was positive for CD5, CD20, CCND1, and SOX-11 and negative for CD23 and LEF1 on immunostaining. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was positive for IgH/CCND1, which indicated MCL. Southern blot analysis showed that both the MCL and the previous CLL expressed different IgH gene rearrangement bands. At the time of relapse or progression of CLL, sequential development of MCL should be considered.","['Saga, Tomoyuki', 'Ishihara, Toshimichi', 'Ito, Mariko', 'Kano, Satoshi', 'Kanagawa, Michiyo']","['Saga T', 'Ishihara T', 'Ito M', 'Kano S', 'Kanagawa M']","['Department of Hematology, Kin-ikyo Chuo Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Kin-ikyo Chuo Hospital.', 'Department of Pathology, Kin-ikyo Chuo Hospital.', 'Department of Pathology, Kin-ikyo Chuo Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Kin-ikyo Chuo Hospital.']",,['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell', 'Male', 'Rituximab']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Clonal relationship', 'Mantle cell lymphoma', 'Richter syndrome']",2020/04/01 06:00,2020/05/13 06:00,['2020/04/01 06:00'],"['2020/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.61.251 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2020;61(3):251-256. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.61.251.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Increased percentages of CD4+CD25+ T cells, CD4+CD39+ T cells, CD4+Foxp3+ T cells, and CD4+CD25High T cells were observed in children with ALL in comparison to healthy controls. In addition, the ALL patients with >12 months of therapy showed increased CD4+CD39+ T cells compared to the ALL patients with </=12 months and healthy controls. Similarly, the CD4+CD25+ T cells and CD4+Foxp3+ T cells increased according to maintenance therapy time. CONCLUSION: Our results showed increased percentages of regulatory T cells in pediatric ALL patients despite chemotherapy, which might be compromising the anti-leukemic cellular immune response.","['Medina-Rosales, Marina Nayeli', 'Godina-Gonzalez, Susana', 'Garcia-Hernandez, Mariana Haydee']","['Medina-Rosales MN', 'Godina-Gonzalez S', 'Garcia-Hernandez MH']","['Unidad de Investigacion Biomedica de Zacatecas, Delegacion Zacatecas.

Leukemia stem cells (LSC) have been identified as the main cause for recurrence. Increased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH(high)) activity in a variety of cancer stem cells prevents effective action of chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we found that approximately 50.7% of AML patients had ALDH(high), and the presence of ALDH(high) stem cells was associated with poor cytogenetic prognosis. Lentiviral vector transduced ALDH(high) leukemia cell lines are insensitive to the conventional chemotherapy drug cytarabine, and inhibition of ALDH activity by disulfiram (DSF) can increase the sensitivity of ALDH(high) leukemia cells to cytarabine. Unlike traditional chemotherapy drugs, DSF is not toxic to healthy umbilical cord blood stem cells. An ALDH(high) leukemia cell xenograft model was established using immunodeficient mice to mimic the disease environment, and DSF and cytarabine were found to eliminate the ALDH(high) leukemia cells in transplanted mice while not affecting the healthy blood cells of mice. These findings suggest that DSF may have therapeutic potential by inhibiting ALDH activity and thereby increasing chemosensitivity.","['Yang, Wanfang', 'Xie, Juan', 'Hou, Ruixia', 'Chen, Xiuhua', 'Xu, Zhifang', 'Tan, Yanhong', 'Ren, Fanggang', 'Zhang, Yaofang', 'Xu, Jing', 'Chang, Jianmei', 'Wang, Hongwei']","['Yang W', 'Xie J', 'Hou R', 'Chen X', 'Xu Z', 'Tan Y', 'Ren F', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu J', 'Chang J', 'Wang H']","['Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China; Shanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Jinzhong, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.

We previously reported that two EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, HCC827 and H1975, contain subpopulations of cells that display an epithelial-to-mesenchymal phenotype and can thrive independently of EGFR signaling. In this study, we explored to what extent these two sublines, HCC827 GR2 and H1975 WR7, depended on the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members, Bcl-xL and/or MCL1, for survival. Although HCC827 GR2 cells were hardly affected by Bcl-xL or MCL1 knockdown alone, dual inhibition of Bcl-xL and MCL1 caused the cells to undergo apoptosis, resulting in decreased viability. In H1975 WR7 cells, not only dual inhibition, but also MCL1 silencing alone, induced the cells to undergo apoptosis. Interestingly, the two sublines markedly declined in number when autophagy flux was suppressed, because they depend, in part, on active autophagy for survival. However, autophagy inhibition was inferior to dual inhibition of Bcl-xL plus MCL1 for GR2 cells, or MCL1 inhibition alone, for decreasing the viability of WR7 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that inhibiting Bcl-xL plus MCL1, or MCL1 alone, may represent a new approach to treat EGFR-independent EGFR-mutant cancer cells.","['Hirai, Sachie', 'Tada, Makoto', 'Yamaguchi, Miki', 'Niki, Toshiro', 'Sakuma, Yuji']","['Hirai S', 'Tada M', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Niki T', 'Sakuma Y']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan; Department of Thoracic Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Division of Integrative Pathology, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.

To illuminate the potential mechanism, we used short hairpin RNA to knock down the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) in the differentiated THP-1 macrophages. The results showed that T3 decreased lactate dehydrogenase and reactive oxygen species levels, while increasing cell viability and superoxide dismutase in silica-induced THP-1 macrophages. In addition, silica increased the expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and T3 treatment reduced those pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. Compared with silica-alone treated groups, cells treated with silica and T3 restored the mitochondrial membrane potential loss and had reduced levels of cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3 expressions. Lastly, we observed that TRalpha-knockdown inhibited the protective effects of T3 silica-induced THP-1 macrophages. Together, these findings revealed that T3 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for protection against silica-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and mitochondrial apoptosis, which are mediated by the activation of the T3/TRalpha signal pathway.","['Gan, Shiming', 'Yang, Meng', 'Fan, Lieyang', 'Xie, Li', 'Xu, Yiju', 'Wang, Bin', 'Xu, Tao', 'Yu, Linling', 'Ma, Jixuan',

The mechanisms through which ATO exerts its effects on cells are not fully characterized though they involve the SUMOylation, the ubiquitylation, and the degradation of the PML/RARalpha oncoprotein through the PML moiety. To better understand the mechanisms that underlie the cytotoxicity induced with increasing ATO levels, we profiled the changes in protein SUMOylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation on HEK293 cells following exposure to low (1 muM) or elevated (10 muM) ATO for 4 h. Our analyses revealed that a low dose of ATO resulted in the differential modification of selected substrates including the SUMOylation (K380, K394, K490, and K497) and ubiquitylation (K337, K401) of PML. These experiments also highlighted a number of unexpected SUMOylated substrates involved in DNA damage response (e.g., PCNA, YY1, and poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1)) and messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing (e.g., ACIN1, USP39, and SART1) that were regulated at higher ATO concentrations. Interestingly, additional enzymatic assays revealed that SUMOylation of PARP1 impeded its proteolytic cleavage by caspase-3, suggesting that SUMOylation could have a protective role in delaying cell apoptosis.","['Rinfret Robert, Clemence', 'McManus, Francis P', 'Lamoliatte, Frederic', 'Thibault, Pierre']","['Rinfret Robert C', 'McManus FP', 'Lamoliatte F', 'Thibault P']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Montreal, P.O.

METHODS: Among 2893 children and adolescents diagnosed and treated for acute leukemia, 39 (1.35%) patients fulfilled the WHO criteria of MPAL. The T/myeloid phenotype was most prevalent. RESULTS: Cytogenetics findings were seen in 2 (5.1%), while chromosomal abnormalities were found in 14 (35.9%) patients. Thirty-two patients achieved CR-1, including 23 (92.0%) treated with ALL-directed chemotherapy and 9 (64.3%) treated with AML-type induction regimens. Within these patients, 4 (12.5%) died due to treatment-related complications and 11 (34.4%) relapsed. Nineteen (63.3%) patients underwent allo-HSCT in CR-1 and 14 (73.7%) of them have been in CR-1. In total, 17 (43.6%) patients remain in CR-1 for 1-12 years, including 14 (58.3%) with T/myeloid MPAL. The 5-year pOS and pEFS were 51.8% and 44.2%, respectively. The overall survival for ALL-directed therapy was significantly better than the one for AML-type chemotherapy (P = .001). It was also better for patients who underwent HSCT in CR-1 (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of MPAL is unsatisfactory, but initial treatment with ALL-directed chemotherapy consolidated with allo-HSCT improves the outcomes in MPAL.","['Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Irga-Jaworska, Ninela', 'Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Zawitkowska, Joanna', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Cwiklinska, Magdalena', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Mizia-Malarz, Agnieszka', 'Badowska, Wanda', 'Kamienska, Elzbieta', 'Urasinski, Tomasz', 'Kaczorowska, Aneta', 'Kazanowska, Bernarda', 'Chybicka, Alicja', 'Wysocki, Mariusz', 'Sedek, Lukasz', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Woszczyk, Mariola', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Karolczyk, Grazyna', 'Chaber, Radoslaw', 'Wachowiak, Jacek']","['Zajac-Spychala O', 'Irga-Jaworska N', 'Drozynska E', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Zawitkowska J', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Cwiklinska M', 'Balwierz W', 'Mizia-Malarz A', 'Badowska W', 'Kamienska E', 'Urasinski T', 'Kaczorowska A', 'Kazanowska B', 'Chybicka A', 'Wysocki M', 'Sedek L', 'Szczepanski T', 'Woszczyk M', 'Matysiak M', 'Mlynarski W', 'Karolczyk G', 'Chaber R', 'Wachowiak J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland."", 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Chemotherapy, Department of Pediatric, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children Hospital, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hemato-Oncology and Gastroenterology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hemato-Oncology and Gastroenterology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Silesian Medical University, Zabrze, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Silesian Medical University, Zabrze, Poland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Chorzow Pediatric and Oncology Center, Chorzow, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, Warszawa, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University, Lodz, Poland.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children Hospital, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncohematology, Children Hospital, Rzeszow, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8836-8605', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7207-156X']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200417,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Clinical Decision-Making', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'diagnosis', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'mixed phenotype acute leukemia', 'prognosis']",2020/03/31 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/03/31 06:00'],"['2019/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13413 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Jul;105(1):85-93. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13413.

Standard regimens with DNMTIs, decitabine (DEC) or azacitidine (AZA) include daily subcutaneous (s.c.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration for 5-7 consecutive days. Attempts to provide the therapy orally have been limited given rapid clearance of the agents by the enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA), which is ubiquitous in the gut and liver as part of first-pass metabolism. Recently, cedazuridine (CDZ), an oral inhibitor of CDA, was successfully combined with DEC to approximate the pharmacokinetics of i.v. DEC in patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if an oral dosing strategy might be feasible in the clinic with AZA, we attempted to increase the bioavailability of oral AZA through the use of CDZ, in a murine model. METHODS: Following pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment of oral AZA dosed with CDZ in murine and monkey models, we tested this regimen in vivo with a human cell line-derived xenograft transplantation experiment (CDX). Following this we combined the regimen with venetoclax (VEN) to test the efficacy of an all-oral regimen in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. RESULTS: Parenteral AZA and oral AZA + CDZ exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles, and efficacy against human AML cells. Tumor regression was seen with AZA + CDZ in MOLM-13 CDX and PDX models. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that oral AZA when combined with CDZ achieves successful tumor regression in both CDX and PDX models. Furthermore, the combination of AZA + CDZ with VEN in a PDX model emulated responses seen with VEN + AZA in the clinic, implying a potential all-oral VEN-based therapy opportunity in myeloid diseases.","['Ramsey, Haley E', 'Oganesian, Aram', 'Gorska, Agnieszka E', 'Fuller, Londa', 'Arrate, Maria', 'Boyd, Kelli', 'Keer, Harold', 'Azab, Mohammad', 'Savona, Michael R']","['Ramsey HE', 'Oganesian A', 'Gorska AE', 'Fuller L', 'Arrate M', 'Boyd K', 'Keer H', 'Azab M', 'Savona MR']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Program, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Pleasanton, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Pleasanton, CA, USA.', 'Astex Pharmaceuticals, Pleasanton, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA. michael.savona@vanderbilt.edu.', 'Cancer Biology Program, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA. michael.savona@vanderbilt.edu.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, 777 Preston Research Building, 2200 Pierce Avenue, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA. michael.savona@vanderbilt.edu.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,France,Target Oncol,Targeted oncology,101270595,"['39IS23Q1EW (cedazuridine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Mice', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uridine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",PMC7182630,,,,2020/03/31 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/31 06:00'],"['2020/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11523-020-00709-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11523-020-00709-x [pii]']",ppublish,Target Oncol. 2020 Apr;15(2):231-240. doi: 10.1007/s11523-020-00709-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyses of SALL4 expression have shown its oncogenic role in precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal, breast, and lung cancers. The aim of this study was to determine the immunohistochemical profile of SALL4 in pediatric yolk sac tumors (YSTs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry detection of SALL4 was performed in 22 cases of pediatric YSTs and 10 mature teratomas. The percentage of tumor cells stained was scored as 0, 1+ (1-30% cells), 2+ (31-60%), 3+ (61-90%), and 4+ (> 90%). To compare its sensitivity and specificity with Glypican-3 and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), we also stained tumors from these cases for Glypican-3 and AFP. In contrast to AFP and glypican-3, SALL4 staining in more than 90% of the tumor cells was seen in all 22 pediatric YSTs (100% sensitivity) (P < 0.001 for both SALL4 vs. AFP and SALL4 vs. glypican-3). CONCLUSIONS: SALL4 is a sensitive marker for pediatric YSTs and it can be used to distinguish them from mature teratomas. SALL4 is likely to become a new and valuable biomarker for the diagnosis of pediatric YST.","['Wu, Peng', 'Luo, Ruogu', 'Sun, Baiping', 'Zhao, Jingru', 'Xu, Quan', 'Feng, Shaoguang', 'Chen, Xiaoming', 'Wang, Chen']","['Wu P', 'Luo R', 'Sun B', 'Zhao J', 'Xu Q', 'Feng S', 'Chen X', 'Wang C']","[""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Northwest Women and Children's Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Northwest Women and Children's Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Northwest Women and Children's Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Northwest Women and Children's Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Northwest Women and Children's Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hangzhou Children's Hospital, No. 195 Wenhui Rd, Xiacheng District, Hangzhou, China."", 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hangzhou Children's Hospital, No. 195 Wenhui Rd, Xiacheng District, Hangzhou, China. hzchwc123@163.com.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200328,Germany,Pediatr Surg Int,Pediatric surgery international,8609169,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Endodermal Sinus Tumor/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['AFP', 'Glypican-3', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Pediatric yolk sac tumor', 'SALL4']",2020/03/31 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2020/03/31 06:00'],"['2020/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00383-020-04652-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00383-020-04652-w [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Surg Int. 2020 Jun;36(6):727-734. doi: 10.1007/s00383-020-04652-w.

We explored whether there is an increased risk of overall and cause-specific cancers in those receiving levothyroxine treatment. We included all individuals >/= 18 years in Sweden (N = 8,573,313) on January 1 2009, and identified patients with two or more dispensed prescriptions of levothyroxine 2005-2006 (n = 253,193, 3.0 %). A cancer diagnosis in the Swedish Cancer Register 2009-2015 was used as outcome. We excluded patients with a cancer diagnosis before 2005. Cox regression was used (hazard ratios, HRs, and 95 % confidence intervals, CI) with adjustments for age, socioeconomic/neighborhood factors and co-morbidities. Totally 399,751 cases of incident cancer were identified, with a slight increased overall risk associated with levothyroxine treatment for both men, adjusted HR 1.06 (95 % CI 1.03-1.10), and women, adjusted HR 1.08 (95 % CI 1.07-1.10). For men, increased risks were found for cancers of the thyroid gland and other endocrine glands. For women, increased risks were found for cancers of the breast, endometrium, other female genitals (ovaries not included), stomach, colon, liver, pancreas, urinary bladder, skin, leukemia, and unspecified primary tumor. Unlike men, for women, no increased risk was found for cancer of the thyroid gland. In conclusions, levothyroxine treatment was associated with an excess cancer risk, including many different types of cancer, especially among women. Our results need confirmation by other studies, but levothyroxine is recommended to be prescribed only on approved indications.","['Wandell, Per', 'Carlsson, Axel C', 'Li, Xinjun', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Sundquist, Kristina']","['Wandell P', 'Carlsson AC', 'Li X', 'Sundquist J', 'Sundquist K']","['Division of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a free-radical scavenger, has shown therapeutic benefits in many preclinical and clinical studies. This study investigates the radioprotective effects of DMSO on oral administration. Single dose of oral DMSO administrated before irradiation conferred 100% survival of C57BL6/J mice receiving otherwise lethal as well as super-lethal radiation dose, with wide radioprotective time frame (from 15min to 4h). Oral DMSO not only protected radiation-induced acute hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) injury, but also ameliorated long-term BM suppression following irradiation in mice. Mechanistically, DMSO directly protected HSPC survival after irradiation in vitro and in vivo, whereas no radioprotective effect was seen in MLL-AF9-induced leukemia cells. Unexpectedly, DMSO treatment did not inhibit radiation-induced HSPC apoptosis, and the HSPC survival from Trp53-and PUMA-deficient mice after irradiation was also protected by DMSO. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the radioprotective efficacy of oral DMSO. Given its oral efficacy and little toxicity, DMSO is an attractive candidate for human use in a wide variety of settings, including nuclear accidents and medical radiation.","['Peng, Renjun', 'Zhang, Wenting', 'Zuo, Zongchao', 'Shan, Yajun', 'Liu, Xiaolan', 'Tang, Yingying', 'Yu, Zuyin', 'Wang, Limei', 'Cong, Yuwen']","['Peng R', 'Zhang W', 'Zuo Z', 'Shan Y', 'Liu X', 'Tang Y', 'Yu Z', 'Wang L', 'Cong Y']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology (BKLRB), Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology (BKLRB), Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology (BKLRB), Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology (BKLRB), Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology (BKLRB), Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology (BKLRB), Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology (BKLRB), Beijing, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology (BKLRB), Beijing, PR China.

Previously, six candidate gene variants associated with mercaptopurine intolerance were reported. Herein, we investigated the association between the mean tolerable dose of mercaptopurine and these genetic variants in Taiwanese patients. METHODS: In total, 294 children with ALL were treated at the National Taiwan University Hospital from April 1997 to December 2017. Germline variants were analyzed for NUDT15, SUCLA2, TPMT, ITPA, PACSIN2, and MRP4. Mean daily tolerable doses of mercaptopurine in the continuation phase of treatment were correlated with these genetic variants. RESULTS: Mercaptopurine intolerance was significantly associated with polymorphisms in NUDT15 (P value < 0.0001). Patients with SUCLA2 variants received lower mercaptopurine doses (P value = 0.0119). The mean mercaptopurine doses did not differ among patients with TPMT, ITPA, MRP4, and PACSIN2 polymorphisms (P value = 0.9461, 0.5818, and 0.7951, respectively). After multivariable linear regression analysis, only NUDT15 variants retained their clinically significant correlation with mercaptopurine intolerance (P value < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, the major genetic determinant of mercaptopurine intolerance was NUDT15 in Taiwanese patients. IMPACT: NUDT15 causes mercaptopurine intolerance in children with ALL. The NUDT15 variant is a stronger predictor of mercaptopurine intolerance than TPMT in a Taiwanese cohort. This finding is similar with studies performed on Asian populations rather than Caucasians. Pre-emptive genotyping of the patients' NUDT15 before administering mercaptopurine may be more helpful than genotyping TPMT in Asians.","['Wang, Der-Shiun', 'Yu, Chih-Hsiang', 'Lin, Chien-Yu', 'Chang, Ya-Hsuan', 'Lin, Kai-Hsin', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng', 'Lu, Meng-Yao', 'Chang, Hsiu-Hao', 'Lin, Shu-Wha', 'Chen, Hsuan-Yu', 'Yang, Yung-Li']","['Wang DS', 'Yu CH', 'Lin CY', 'Chang YH', 'Lin KH', 'Lin DT', 'Jou ST', 'Lu MY', 'Chang HH', 'Lin SW', 'Chen HY', 'Yang YL']","['Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tri-service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. yangyl92@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. yangyl92@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. yangyl92@ntu.edu.tw.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200327,United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (TPMT protein, human)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (NUDT15 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Pharmacogenomic Variants', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Pyrophosphatases/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan']",,,,,2020/03/30 06:00,2021/11/23 06:00,['2020/03/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41390-020-0868-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41390-020-0868-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2021 Jan;89(1):217-222. doi: 10.1038/s41390-020-0868-8.

Delivery systems containing avocado polyols have not been described. Herein, natural surface active properties of these polyols are characterized and incorporated into self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) that rely on molecular self-assembly to form fine, transparent, oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsions as small as 20 nanometers in diameter. Mechanistically, a 1:1 molar ratio of avocadene and avocadyne (i.e., avocatin B or AVO was shown to be a eutectic mixture which can be employed as a novel, bioactive, co-surfactant that significantly reduces droplet size of medium-chain triglyceride O/W emulsions stabilized with polysorbate 80. In vitro cytotoxicity of avocado polyol-SEDDS in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines indicated significant increases in potency and bioactivity compared to conventional cell culture delivery systems. A pilot pharmacokinetic evaluation of AVO SEDDS in C57BL/6J mice revealed appreciable accumulation in whole blood and biodistribution in key target tissues. Lastly, incorporation of AVO in SEDDS significantly improved encapsulation of the poorly water-soluble drugs naproxen and curcumin.","['Ahmed, Nawaz', 'Kermanshahi, Behnoush', 'Ghazani, Saeed M', 'Tait, Katrina', 'Tcheng, Matthew', 'Roma, Alessia', 'Callender, Shannon P', 'Smith, Richard W', 'Tam, William', 'Wettig, Shawn D', 'Rogers, Michael A', 'Marangoni, Alejandro G', 'Spagnuolo, Paul A']","['Ahmed N', 'Kermanshahi B', 'Ghazani SM', 'Tait K', 'Tcheng M', 'Roma A', 'Callender SP', 'Smith RW', 'Tam W', 'Wettig SD', 'Rogers MA', 'Marangoni AG', 'Spagnuolo PA']","['Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2WI, Canada.', 'Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2WI, Canada.', 'Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2WI, Canada.', 'Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2WI, Canada.', 'Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2WI, Canada.', 'Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2WI, Canada.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, N2L 3G1, Canada.', 'University of Waterloo Mass Spectrometry Facility, Department of Chemistry, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada.', 'Guelph-Waterloo Centre for Graduate Work in Chemistry and Biochemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2W1, Canada.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, N2L 3G1, Canada.', 'Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. W., Waterloo, Ontario, N2L 3G1, Canada.', 'Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2WI, Canada.', 'Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2WI, Canada.', 'Department of Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2WI, Canada. paul.spagnuolo@uoguelph.ca.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0079-4309'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200327,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Emulsions)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Polysorbates)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '0 (polyol)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Emulsions/administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Persea/*chemistry', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'Polysorbates/chemistry', 'Solubility/drug effects', 'Surface-Active Agents/*chemistry', 'Tissue Distribution/physiology', 'Water/chemistry']",PMC7101315,,,,2020/03/30 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/03/30 06:00'],"['2019/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-62334-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-62334-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Mar 27;10(1):5566. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-62334-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This highlights the lack of suitable treatment for Down syndrome children with B-ALL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To facilitate the translation of new therapeutic agents into clinical trials, we built the first preclinical cohort of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of DS-ALL, comprehensively characterized at the genetic and transcriptomic levels, and have proven its suitability for preclinical studies by assessing the efficacy of drug combination between the MEK inhibitor trametinib and conventional chemotherapy agents. RESULTS: Whole-exome and RNA-sequencing experiments revealed a high incidence of somatic alterations leading to RAS/MAPK pathway activation in our cohort of DS-ALL, as well as in other pediatric B-ALL presenting somatic gain of the chromosome 21 (B-ALL+21). In murine and human B-cell precursors, activated KRAS(G12D) functionally cooperates with trisomy 21 to deregulate transcriptional networks that promote increased proliferation and self renewal, as well as B-cell differentiation blockade. Moreover, we revealed that inhibition of RAS/MAPK pathway activation using the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib decreased leukemia burden in several PDX models of B-ALL+21, and enhanced survival of DS-ALL PDX in combination with conventional chemotherapy agents such as vincristine. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, using novel and suitable PDX models, this study indicates that RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition represents a promising strategy to improve the outcome of Down syndrome children with B-cell precursor leukemia.","['Laurent, Anouchka P', 'Siret, Aurelie', 'Ignacimouttou, Cathy', 'Panchal, Kunjal', ""Diop, M'Boyba"", 'Jenni, Silvia', 'Tsai, Yi-Chien', 'Roos-Weil, Damien', 'Aid,

Limited studies have systematically described the clinical features and outcomes of the whole patient group, especially in Eastern populations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1592 patients with newly diagnosed B-CLPD were enrolled. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) accounted for 39%, and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), leukemic marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) constituted 13%, 13%, 9%, and 8% of cases, respectively. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 58 years, and the male/female ratio was 1.8:1. The 17p and 11q deletions were most common in MCL (36% and 17%, respectively), and 13q deletion and trisomy 12 were most frequent in CLL (35% and 21%, respectively). Patients with leukemic MCL had significantly worse survival than that of patients with other disease entities, with a 3-year overall survival (OS) of 58%, followed by 68.2% for WM/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Those with CLL, leukemic marginal zone lymphoma, and FL had relatively favorable outcomes, with a 5-year OS > 80%. The survival of patients with B-CLPDs has improved over time with the emergence of novel drugs (3-year OS improvement from 82.1% to 92.2%). The improvement in survival mainly resulted from improvement among patients with MCL, WM/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and FL. On multivariate analysis, only hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and 17p deletion were independently associated with survival (hazard ratio, 1.6, 2.0, and 3.1, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive analysis of the clinical characteristics, immunophenotypic profiles, and cytogenetic features can be helpful in the differential diagnosis, especially for patients without a non-bone marrow biopsy specimen available. Universal prognostic factors could help with the early detection of high-risk patients and stratification for risk-adapted therapy.","['Yan, Yuting', 'Lv, Rui', 'Xiong, Wenjie', 'Li, Zengjun', 'Wang, Yi', 'Yu, Ying', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Wang, Tingyu', 'Sui, Weiwei', 'Liu, Wei', 'Zou, Dehui', 'Yi, Shuhua', 'Qiu, Lugui']","['Yan Y', 'Lv R', 'Xiong W', 'Li Z', 'Wang Y', 'Yu Y', 'Yu Z', 'Wang T', 'Sui W', 'Liu W', 'Zou D', 'Yi S', 'Qiu L']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.

In conclusion, late relapse in adults with ALL is not uncommon, and is associated with better outcome after relapse compared to early relapse.","['Ganzel, Chezi', 'Wang, Xin V', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Richards, Susan M', 'Buck, Georgina', 'Marks, David I', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Douer, Dan', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Goldstone, Anthony H']","['Ganzel C', 'Wang XV', 'Rowe JM', 'Richards SM', 'Buck G', 'Marks DI', 'Litzow MR', 'Paietta EM', 'Foroni L', 'Luger SM', 'Willman CL', 'Mullighan CG', 'Roberts KG', 'Wiernik PH', 'Douer D', 'Lazarus HM', 'Tallman MS', 'Goldstone AH']","['Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute - ECOG-ACRIN Biostatistics Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Clinical Trial Service Unit, Oxford, UK.', 'Clinical Trial Service Unit, Oxford, UK.', 'University Hospitals Bristol National Health Service Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.', 'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'University College London, London, UK.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1722-4807'],['eng'],"['UG1 CA233290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233234/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA232760/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180853/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20200327,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Autografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7687130,['NIHMS1593966'],['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*late relapse']",2020/03/29 06:00,2021/03/17 06:00,['2020/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16616 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Oct;191(1):37-43. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16616.

METHODS: We investigated adult AL patients who underwent SCT at the Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital after transplantation. Physical/functional and emotional/mental recovery were evaluated using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire to identify its trajectory as well as related predictors for the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The score was also used to establish a QoL prediction model. RESULTS: A total of 326 AL patients responded to our QoL survey. The results revealed the profile of patient follow-up from 2013 to 2015. Along follow-up after transplantation, there was a significant increase in PCS (p = 0.139) and MCS (p = 0.122). On multivariate regression analysis, apart from follow-up, marriage, financial situation, employment situation, and history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) had clinical significance for both PCS and MCS. A prediction model for patient risk hierarchy estimation was further established. The logistic results revealed that the significant characteristics of patients with high PCS and high MCS were unmarried, without financial burden, reliable on drugs, and with history of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). CONCLUSIONS: This well-established study enabled evaluation of the QoL of AL patients post-HSCT in China. The established prediction model could provide more indications and insights into improvement in quality of life for better medical interventions.","['Xie, Wenjun', 'Zhang, Xiaoyu', 'Wang, Jiao', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Liu, Jie', 'Wang, Bei', 'Guan, Wei', 'Zhang, Huijuan', 'Xu, Li', 'Liu, Guiying', 'Feng, Sizhou', 'Li, Changping', 'Han, Mingzhe']","['Xie W', 'Zhang X', 'Wang J', 'Zhang J', 'Liu J', 'Wang B', 'Guan W', 'Zhang H', 'Xu L', 'Liu G', 'Feng S', 'Li C', 'Han M']","['Department of Nursing Care, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Department of Nursing Care, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Nursing Care, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Nursing Care, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Nursing Care, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Nursing Care, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Nursing Care, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Nursing Care, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China. mzhan@ihcams.com.cn.']",,['eng'],['2017330026/Youth Fund of PUMC&CAMS'],['Journal Article'],20200327,Netherlands,Qual Life Res,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",9210257,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'GVHD', 'Informal caregiver', 'Quality of life', 'Short-term posttransplantation']",2020/03/29 06:00,2020/07/31 06:00,['2020/03/29 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11136-020-02444-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11136-020-02444-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Qual Life Res. 2020 Jul;29(7):1809-1816. doi: 10.1007/s11136-020-02444-2.

In this subtype of AML, the translocation of a GATA2 enhancer (3q21) to MECOM (3q26) results in overexpression of the MECOM isoform EVI1 and monoallelic expression of GATA2 from the unaffected allele. The full-length MECOM transcript, MDS1-EVI1, is not expressed as the result of the 3q26 rearrangement. Besides the classical inv(3)/t(3;3), a number of other 3q26/MECOM rearrangements with poor treatment response have been reported in AML. Here, we demonstrate, in a group of 33 AML patients with atypical 3q26 rearrangements, MECOM involvement with EVI1 overexpression but no or low MDS1-EVI1 levels. Moreover, the 3q26 translocations in these AML patients often involve superenhancers of genes active in myeloid development (eg, CD164, PROM1, CDK6, or MYC). In >50% of these cases, allele-specific GATA2 expression was observed, either by copy-number loss or by an unexplained allelic imbalance. Altogether, atypical 3q26 recapitulate the main leukemic mechanism of inv(3)/t(3;3) AML, namely EVI1 overexpression driven by enhancer hijacking, absent MDS1-EVI1 expression and potential GATA2 involvement. Therefore, we conclude that both atypical 3q26/MECOM and inv(3)/t(3;3) can be classified as a single entity of 3q26-rearranged AMLs. Routine analyses determining MECOM rearrangements and EVI1 and MDS1-EVI1 expression are required to recognize 3q-rearranged AML cases.","['Ottema, Sophie', 'Mulet-Lazaro, Roger', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Erpelinck, Claudia', 'van Herk, Stanley', 'van der Helm, Robert', 'Havermans, Marije', 'Grob, Tim', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Bindels, Eric', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Smeenk, Leonie', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Ottema S', 'Mulet-Lazaro R', 'Beverloo HB', 'Erpelinck C', 'van Herk S', 'van der Helm R', 'Havermans M', 'Grob T', 'Valk PJM', 'Bindels E', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C', 'Smeenk L', 'Delwel R']","['Department of Hematology.', 'Oncode Institute, and.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Oncode Institute, and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Oncode Institute, and.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Oncode Institute, and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Oncode Institute, and.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Oncode Institute, and.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Oncode Institute, and.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,2020/03/29 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61900-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019003701 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jul 9;136(2):224-234. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019003701.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are thought to play a driver role in MPN pathogenesis via autosomal activation of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade. Mutant CALR binds to MPL, activates downstream MPL signaling cascades, and induces essential thrombocythemia in mice. However, embryonic lethality of Calr-deficient mice precludes determination of a role for CALR in hematopoiesis. To clarify the role of CALR in normal hematopoiesis and MPN pathogenesis, we generated hematopoietic cell-specific Calr-deficient mice. CALR deficiency had little effect on the leukocyte count, hemoglobin levels, or platelet count in peripheral blood. However, Calr-deficient mice showed some hematopoietic properties of MPN, including decreased erythropoiesis and increased myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. Transplantation experiments revealed that Calr haploinsufficiency promoted the self-renewal capacity of HSCs. We generated CALRdel52 mutant transgenic mice with Calr haploinsufficiency as a model that mimics human MPN patients and found that Calr haploinsufficiency restored the self-renewal capacity of HSCs damaged by CALR mutations. Only recipient mice transplanted with Lineage-Sca1+c-kit+ cells harboring both CALR mutation and Calr haploinsufficiency developed MPN in competitive conditions, showing that CALR haploinsufficiency was necessary for the onset of CALR-mutated MPNs.","['Shide, Kotaro', 'Kameda, Takuro', 'Kamiunten, Ayako', 'Ozono, Yoshinori', 'Tahira, Yuki', 'Yokomizo-Nakano, Takako', 'Kubota, Sho', 'Ono, Masaya', 'Ikeda, Kazuhiko', 'Sekine, Masaaki', 'Akizuki, Keiichi', 'Nakamura, Kenichi', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Kubuki, Yoko', 'Iwakiri, Hisayoshi', 'Hasuike, Satoru', 'Nagata, Kenji', 'Sashida, Goro', 'Shimoda, Kazuya']","['Shide K', 'Kameda T', 'Kamiunten A', 'Ozono Y', 'Tahira Y', 'Yokomizo-Nakano T', 'Kubota S', 'Ono M', 'Ikeda K', 'Sekine M', 'Akizuki K', 'Nakamura K', 'Hidaka T', 'Kubuki Y', 'Iwakiri H', 'Hasuike S', 'Nagata K', 'Sashida G', 'Shimoda K']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation in Leukemogenesis, International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation in Leukemogenesis, International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Chemotherapy and Clinical Research, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.', 'Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation in Leukemogenesis, International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Calreticulin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Calreticulin/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Transcriptome']",PMC7332892,,,,2020/03/29 06:00,2021/02/18 06:00,['2020/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61921-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019003358 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jul 2;136(1):106-118. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019003358.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 Jul 2;136(1):6-7.

This occurs in part through a process called adhesion-mediated drug resistance, which depends on ALL cell adhesion to the stroma through adhesion molecules, including integrins. Integrin alpha6 has been implicated in minimal residual disease in ALL and in the migration of ALL cells to the central nervous system. However, it has not been evaluated in the context of chemotherapeutic resistance. Here, we show that the anti-human alpha6-blocking Ab P5G10 induces apoptosis in primary ALL cells in vitro and sensitizes primary ALL cells to chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibition in vitro and in vivo. We further analyzed the underlying mechanism of alpha6-associated apoptosis using a conditional knockout model of alpha6 in murine BCR-ABL1+ B-cell ALL cells and showed that alpha6-deficient ALL cells underwent apoptosis. In vivo deletion of alpha6 in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment was more effective in eradicating ALL than treatment with a TKI (nilotinib) alone. Proteomic analysis revealed that alpha6 deletion in murine ALL was associated with changes in Src signaling, including the upregulation of phosphorylated Lyn (pTyr507) and Fyn (pTyr530). Thus, our data support alpha6 as a novel therapeutic target for ALL.","['Gang, Eun Ji', 'Kim, Hye Na', 'Hsieh, Yao-Te', 'Ruan, Yongsheng', 'Ogana, Heather A', 'Lee, Solomon', 'Pham, Jennifer', 'Geng,

Adults age >/=18 years with newly diagnosed AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy were enrolled in this international phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Patients (N = 211) were randomized 2:1 to venetoclax (n = 143) or placebo (n = 68) in 28-day cycles, plus low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) on days 1 to 10. Primary end point was overall survival (OS); secondary end points included response rate, transfusion independence, and event-free survival. Median age was 76 years (range, 36-93 years), 38% had secondary AML, and 20% had received prior hypomethylating agent treatment. Planned primary analysis showed a 25% reduction in risk of death with venetoclax plus LDAC vs LDAC alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-1.07; P = .11), although not statistically significant; median OS was 7.2 vs 4.1 months, respectively. Unplanned analysis with additional 6-month follow-up demonstrated median OS of 8.4 months for the venetoclax arm (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98; P = .04). Complete remission (CR) plus CR with incomplete blood count recovery rates were 48% and 13% for venetoclax plus LDAC and LDAC alone, respectively. Key grade >/=3 adverse events (venetoclax vs LDAC alone) were febrile neutropenia (32% vs 29%), neutropenia (47% vs 16%), and thrombocytopenia (45% vs 37%). Venetoclax plus LDAC demonstrates clinically meaningful improvement in remission rate and OS vs LDAC alone, with a manageable safety profile. Results confirm venetoclax plus LDAC as an important frontline treatment for AML patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03069352.","['Wei, Andrew H', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Ivanov, Vladimir', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Novak, Jan', 'Laribi, Kamel', 'Kim, Inho', 'Stevens, Don A', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Pagoni, Maria', 'Samoilova, Olga', 'Hu, Yu', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Bergeron, Julie', 'Hou, Jing-Zhou', 'Murthy, Vidhya', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'McDonald, Andrew', 'Chyla, Brenda', 'Gopalakrishnan, Sathej', 'Jiang, Qi', 'Mendes, Wellington', 'Hayslip, John', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis']","['Wei AH', 'Montesinos P', 'Ivanov V', 'DiNardo CD', 'Novak J', 'Laribi K', 'Kim I', 'Stevens DA', 'Fiedler W', 'Pagoni M', 'Samoilova O', 'Hu Y', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Bergeron J', 'Hou JZ', 'Murthy V', 'Yamauchi T', 'McDonald A', 'Chyla B', 'Gopalakrishnan S', 'Jiang Q', 'Mendes W', 'Hayslip J', 'Panayiotidis P']","['The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Leukaemia Translational Research, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Cancer (CIBERONIC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Center, Saint Petersburg, Russia.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, Le Mans, France.', 'Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Norton Cancer Institute, Louisville, KY.', 'Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Evaggelismos General Hospital, Athens Greece.', 'Nizhny Novgorod Regional Clinical Hospital, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.', 'Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'George Papanicolaou General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', ""Centre Integre Universitaire de Sante et de Services Sociaux de l'Est-de-l'Ile-de-Montreal (CIUSSSEMTL), Installation Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'University of Fukui Hospital, Fukui, Japan.', 'Netcare Pretoria East Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa.', 'AbbVie, Inc., North Chicago, IL; and.', 'AbbVie, Inc., North Chicago, IL; and.', 'AbbVie, Inc., North Chicago, IL; and.', 'AbbVie, Inc., North Chicago, IL; and.', 'AbbVie, Inc., North Chicago, IL; and.', 'Laiko General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece.']",,['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Remission Induction', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7290090,,,,2020/03/29 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/03/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61957-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020004856 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jun 11;135(24):2137-2145. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020004856.,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03069352'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 Jun 11;135(24):2114-2115.

Here, we model an aggressive form of prostate cancer and show the unconventional association of LKB1 dosage to prostate tumorigenesis. Whereas loss of Lkb1 alone in the murine prostate epithelium was inconsequential for tumorigenesis, its combination with an oncogenic insult, illustrated by Pten heterozygosity, elicited lethal metastatic prostate cancer. Despite the low frequency of LKB1 deletion in patients, this event was significantly enriched in lung metastasis. Modeling the role of LKB1 in cellular systems revealed that the residual activity retained in a reported kinase-dead form, LKB1K78I, was sufficient to hamper tumor aggressiveness and metastatic dissemination. Our data suggest that prostate cells can function normally with low activity of LKB1, whereas its complete absence influences prostate cancer pathogenesis and dissemination.","['Hermanova, Ivana',

Furthermore, in a tissue microarray of 140 patients with breast cancer, an elevated BCL11A level was correlated with unfavorable overall survival (OS), and exogenous BCL11A-knockdown was subsequently verified to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC. Notably, the same tissue microarray revealed that a favorable patient outcome was associated with high expression levels of BCL11A and androgen receptor (AR). Moreover, BCL11A-knockdown significantly inhibited the expression level of AR and further had an influence on proliferation, migration and invasion in TNBC cell lines. Collectively, the results of the current study indicate the function of BCL11A in TNBC progression, and provide new insights into the unique mechanism of BCL11A in AR regulation, emphasizing the significance of more research on BCL11A and AR regulation in TNBC molecular treatment.","['Wang, Xin', 'Xu, Yumei', 'Xu, Kun', 'Chen, Yajuan', 'Xiao, Xiudi', 'Guan, Xiaoxiang']","['Wang X', 'Xu Y', 'Xu K', 'Chen Y', 'Xiao X', 'Guan X']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210002, P.R.

Bone marrow and peripheral blood of 18 newly diagnosed children with childhood AL admitted to Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang were selected, and the miR-125a-3p level in peripheral blood of healthy children and children with AL was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Leukemia cells from the bone marrow of children with AL were primarily cultured and purified to observe the morphology. miR-125a-3p mimic was transfected into childhood AL cells. The cells were randomly divided into three groups: control group, GEM group and GEM + miR-125a-3p mimic group. 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining assay was chosen to detect the proliferation of childhood AL cells in each group. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining assay was adopted to determine apoptosis of childhood AL cells. The protein level of c-myc was measured via western blotting. Compared with that in the healthy children, the level of miR-125a-3p in the peripheral blood of children with AL was remarkably decreased. Compared with those in the control group, GEM inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of childhood AL cells, and impeded the protein expression of c-myc in these cells. Compared with those in the GEM group, GEM + miR-125a-3p mimic notably reduced the proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of cells, and the protein expression of c-myc in cells was overtly reduced. The level of miR-125a-3p in peripheral blood of children with AL is obviously decreased. It is suggested in this study that GEM can inhibit the proliferation and promote apoptosis of childhood AL cells, and the mechanism may be related to upregulated miR-125a-3p inhibiting the expression of c-myc.","['Xing, Weiwei', 'Yin, Yuxia', 'Yang, Saina', 'Lu, Guang']","['Xing W', 'Yin Y', 'Yang S', 'Lu G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang, Weifang, Shandong 262500, P.R.

Next-generation sequencing has identified the value of tumor mutation burden (TMB) as a predictor for ICB efficacy in multiple types of tumor, including HCC. Specific driver gene mutations may be indicative of a high TMB (TMB-H) and analysis of such mutations may provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of TMB-H and potential therapeutic strategies. In the present study, a hybridization-capture method was used to target 1.45 Mb of the genomic sequence (coding sequence, 1 Mb), analyzing the somatic mutation landscape of 81 HCC tumor samples. Mutations in five genes were significantly associated with TMB-H, including mutations in tumor protein 53 (TP53), Catenin((R))1 (CTNNB1), AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) and nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCOR1). Further analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma database showed that TP53, CTNNB1 and MLL mutations were positively correlated with TMB-H. Meanwhile, mutations in ARID1A, TP53 and MLL were associated with poor overall survival of patients with HCC. Overall, TMB-H and associated driver gene mutations may have potential as predictive biomarkers of ICB therapy efficacy for treatment of patients with HCC.","['Li, Li', 'Rao, Xiaosong', 'Wen, Zhaohong', 'Ding, Xiaosheng', 'Wang, Xiangyi', 'Xu, Weiran', 'Meng, Chao', 'Yi, Yuting', 'Guan, Yanfang', 'Chen, Yongshen', 'Wang, Jiayin', 'Jun, Liang']","['Li L', 'Rao X', 'Wen Z', 'Ding X', 'Wang X', 'Xu W', 'Meng C', 'Yi Y', 'Guan Y', 'Chen Y', 'Wang J', 'Jun L']","['Department of Oncology, Peking University International Hospital, Beijing 102206, P.R.

Identification of these antigens and understanding their biology are a key requisite for more insight into how graft vs. leukemia effect and graft vs. host disease could be separated. We here identified four new HLA class II-restricted minor histocompatibility antigens using whole genome association scanning. For one of the new antigens, i.e., LB-PIP4K2A-1S, we measured strong T-cell recognition of the donor variant PIP4K2A-1N when pulsed as exogenous peptide, while the endogenously expressed variant in donor EBV-B cells was not recognized. We showed that lack of T-cell recognition was caused by intracellular cleavage by a protease named asparagine endopeptidase (AEP). Furthermore, microarray gene expression analysis showed that PIP4K2A and AEP are both ubiquitously expressed in a wide variety of healthy tissues, but that expression levels of AEP were lower in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In line with that, we confirmed low activity of AEP in AML cells and demonstrated that HLA-DRB1(*)03:01 positive primary AML expressing LB-PIP4K2A-1S or its donor variant PIP4K2A-1N were both recognized by specific T-cells. In conclusion, LB-PIP4K2A-1S not only represents a novel minor histocompatibility antigen but also provides evidence that donor T-cells after allogeneic stem cell transplantation can target the autologous allelic variant as leukemia-associated antigen. Furthermore, it demonstrates that endopeptidases can play a role in cell type-specific intracellular processing and presentation of HLA class II-restricted antigens, which may be explored in future immunotherapy of AML.","['Kremer, Anita N', 'Bausenwein, Judith', 'Lurvink, Ellie', 'Kremer, Andreas E', 'Rutten, Caroline E', 'van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'Kretschmann, Sascha', 'van der Meijden, Edith', 'Honders, Maria W', 'Mazzeo, Daniela', 'Watts, Colin', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Griffioen, Marieke']","['Kremer AN', 'Bausenwein J', 'Lurvink E', 'Kremer AE', 'Rutten CE', 'van Bergen CAM', 'Kretschmann S', 'van der Meijden E', 'Honders MW', 'Mazzeo D', 'Watts C', 'Mackensen A', 'Falkenburg JHF', 'Griffioen M']","['Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 1, Gastroenterology, Pneumology and Endocrinology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Division of Cell Signaling & Immunology, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Cell Signaling & Immunology, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.']",,['eng'],['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200311,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (PIP4K2A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.34 (asparaginylendopeptidase)']",IM,"['Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/metabolism', '*Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*genetics/immunology/metabolism']",PMC7078166,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD4 T-cells', '*HLA class II', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*graft vs. leukemia effect', '*minor histocompatibility antigens']",2020/03/29 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/03/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00381 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Mar 11;11:381. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00381. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Kremer, Bausenwein, Lurvink, Kremer, Rutten, van Bergen,', 'Kretschmann, van der Meijden, Honders, Mazzeo, Watts, Mackensen, Falkenburg and', 'Griffioen.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this trial, the response rate with standard therapy was particularly low. We retrospectively assessed the characteristics and outcome of patients with R/R FLT3-mutated AML included in the Toulouse-Bordeaux DATAML registry. Among 347 patients who received FLT3 TKI-free intensive chemotherapy as first-line treatment, 174 patients were refractory (n = 48, 27.6%) or relapsed (n = 126, 72.4%). Salvage treatments consisted of intensive chemotherapy (n = 99, 56.9%), azacitidine or low-dose cytarabine (n = 9, 5.1%), other low-intensity treatments (n = 17, 9.8%), immediate allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 4, 2.3%) or best supportive care only (n = 45, 25.9%). Among the 114 patients who previously received FLT3 TKI-free intensive chemotherapy as first-line treatment (refractory, n = 32, 28.1%; relapsed, n = 82, 71.9%), the rate of CR (complete remission) or CRi (complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) after high- or low-intensity salvage treatment was 50.0%, with a bridge to transplant in 34.2% (n = 39) of cases. The median overall survival (OS) was 8.2 months (interquartile range, 3.0-32); 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 36.0% (95%CI: 27-45), 24.7% (95%CI: 1-33) and 19.7% (95%CI: 1-28), respectively. In this real-word study, although response rate appeared higher than the controlled arm of the ADMIRAL trial, the outcome of patients with R/R FLT3-mutated AML remains very poor with standard salvage therapy.","['Bertoli, Sarah', 'Dumas, Pierre-Yves', 'Berard, Emilie', 'Largeaud, Laetitia', 'Bidet, Audrey', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Tavitian, Suzanne', 'Gadaud, Noemie', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Leroy,

An interesting strategy in the design of novel anticancer agents is based on the conjugation of two or more biologically active structural motifs into one hybrid compound. In this study, we investigated the anticancer potential of 4-benzyl-5,7-dimethoxy-4-methyl-3-methylidene-3,4-dihydro-2H-chroman-2-one (DL-247), a new hybrid molecule combining a chroman-2-one skeleton with an exo-methylidene bond conjugated with a carbonyl group, in human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line. The cytotoxicity of the new compound was tested using MTT assay. The effect of DL-247 on cell proliferation and apoptosis induction were studied by flow cytometry, fluorometric assay and ELISA analysis. DL-247 displayed high cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 1.15 microM, after 24 h incubation), significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by both, the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. A combination of DL-247 with taxol exhibited a strong synergistic effect on DNA damage generation, apoptosis induction and inhibition of cell growth.","['Gach-Janczak, Katarzyna', 'Drogosz-Stachowicz, Joanna', 'Dlugosz-Pokorska, Angelika', 'Jakubowski, Rafal', 'Janecki, Tomasz', 'Szymanski, Jacek', 'Janecka, Anna']","['Gach-Janczak K', 'Drogosz-Stachowicz J', 'Dlugosz-Pokorska A', 'Jakubowski R', 'Janecki T', 'Szymanski J', 'Janecka A']","['Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Zeromskiego 116, 90-924 Lodz, Poland.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, Sienkiewicza 112, 90-363 Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Zeromskiego 116, 90-924 Lodz, Poland.', 'Central Laboratory, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.']",,['eng'],"['2015/17/D/NZ3/02226/National Science Centre, Poland']",['Journal Article'],20200325,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",PMC7180485,,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'coumarins', 'cytotoxicity', 'leukemia', 'synergistic effect', 'alpha-methylidene-delta-lactones']",2020/03/29 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/03/29 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25071479 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25071479 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Mar 25;25(7). pii: molecules25071479. doi: 10.3390/molecules25071479.,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the influence of genetics on CLL response to anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. METHODS: First, we studied 32 primary CLL samples composed of 26 immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene variable (IGHV)-unmutated (9 ATM-mutated, 8 TP53-mutated, and 9 without mutations in ATM, TP53, NOTCH1 or SF3B1) and 6 IGHV-mutated samples without mutations in the above-mentioned genes. Then, we mimicked the leukemic microenvironment in the primary cells by '2S stimulation' through interleukin-2 and nuclear factor kappa B. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-generated ATM -knockout and TP53-knockout clones (four and seven, respectively) from CLL-derived cell lines MEC1 and HG3 were used. All these samples were exposed to CAR T cells. In vivo survival study in NSG mice using HG3 wild-type (WT), ATM -knockout or TP53-knockout cells was also performed. RESULTS: Primary unstimulated CLL cells were specifically eliminated after >24 hours of coculture with CAR T cells. '2S' stimulated cells showed increased survival when exposed to CAR T cells compared with unstimulated ones, confirming the positive effect of this stimulation on CLL cells' in vitro fitness. After 96 hours of coculture, there was no difference in survival among the genetic classes. Finally, CAR T cells were specifically activated in vitro in the presence of target knockout cell lines as shown by the production of interferon-gamma when compared with control (CTRL) T cells (p=0.0020), but there was no difference in knockout cells' survival. In vivo, CAR T cells prolonged the survival of mice injected with WT, TP53-knockout and ATM-knockout HG3 tumor cells as compared with CTRL T cells (p=0.0485, 0.0204 and <0.0001, respectively). When compared with ATM-knockout, TP53-knockout disease was associated with an earlier time of onset (p<0.0001), higher tumor burden (p=0.0002) and inefficient T-cell engraftment (p=0.0012). CONCLUSIONS: While in vitro no differences in survival of CLL cells of various genetic backgrounds were observed, CAR T cells showed a different effectiveness at eradicating tumor cells in vivo depending on the driver mutation. Early disease onset, high-tumor burden and inefficient T-cell engraftment, associated with TP53-knockout tumors in our experimental setting, ultimately led to inferior performance of CAR T cells.","['Mancikova, Veronika', 'Peschelova, Helena', 'Kozlova, Veronika', 'Ledererova, Aneta', 'Ladungova, Adriana', 'Verner, Jan', 'Loja, Tomas', 'Folber, Frantisek', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Smida, Michal']","['Mancikova V', 'Peschelova H', 'Kozlova V', 'Ledererova A', 'Ladungova A', 'Verner J', 'Loja T', 'Folber F', 'Mayer J', 'Pospisilova S', 'Smida M']","['Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic veronika.mancikova@ceitec.muni.cz michal.smida@ceitec.muni.cz.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic veronika.mancikova@ceitec.muni.cz michal.smida@ceitec.muni.cz.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8155-9927'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*therapeutic use', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC7206910,,['NOTNLM'],"['*genetics', '*haematology', '*immunology']",2020/03/29 06:00,2021/09/01 06:00,['2020/03/29 06:00'],"['2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2019-000471 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2019-000471 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2020 Mar;8(1). pii: jitc-2019-000471. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2019-000471.,,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

We examine the key mutational and transcriptomic alterations in an organoid biobank enriched in EOCRCs. DESIGN: We established paired cancer (n=32) and normal organoids (n=18) from 20 patients enriched in microsatellite-stable EOCRC. Exome and transcriptome analysis was performed. RESULTS: We observed a striking diversity of molecular phenotypes, including PTPRK-RSPO3 fusions. Transcriptionally, RSPO fusion organoids resembled normal colon organoids and were distinct from APC mutant organoids, with high BMP2 and low PTK7 expression. Single cell transcriptome analysis confirmed the similarity between RSPO fusion organoids and normal organoids, with a propensity for maturation on Wnt withdrawal, whereas the APC mutant organoids were locked in progenitor stages. CRISPR/Cas9 engineered mutation of APC in normal human colon organoids led to upregulation of PTK7 protein and suppression of BMP2, but less so with an engineered RNF43 mutation. The frequent co-occurrence of RSPO fusions with SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutation was confirmed in TCGA database searches. RNF43 mutation was found in organoid from a leukaemia survivor with a novel mutational signature; and organoids with POLE proofreading mutation displayed ultramutation. The cancer organoid genomes were stable over long culture periods, while normal human colon organoids tended to be subject to clonal dominance over time. CONCLUSIONS: These organoid models enriched in EOCRCs with linked genomic data fill a gap in existing CRC models and reveal distinct genetic profiles and novel pathway cooperativity.","['Yan, Helen H

JAK2, MPL and CALR mutations are associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Although SF3B1 and MPN-associated mutations frequently co-occur in the rare entity MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T), myeloid neoplasms with concurrent spliceosome and MPN-associated mutations encompass many disease entities and are not well characterised. METHODS: Specimens from 2016 to 2019 with concurrent spliceosome and MPN-associated mutations were identified, and the clinicopathologic features were assessed. RESULTS: The 36 cases were divided into mutational categories based on their spliceosome mutation. At diagnosis, cases with concurrent U2AF1 and MPN-associated mutations had lower leucocyte counts and platelet counts than did the other groups. Cases with mutant SRSF2 were more likely to have ASXL1 and IDH2 mutations, while U2AF1-mutated neoplasms were more likely to have an abnormal karyotype. The most common SF3B1 K700 and U2AF1 S34 mutational hotspots were underrepresented in our cohort of myeloid neoplasms with concurrent spliceosome and MPN-associated mutations, as SF3B1 and U2AF1 mutations tended to involve other codons. Numerous WHO-defined disease entities were represented in each spliceosome gene category; although MDS/MPN-RS-T were only identified in the group with SF3B1 mutations, they constituted only 1/4 of the neoplasms in the category. CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid neoplasms with different mutant splicing factor and concurrent MPN-associated mutations demonstrate somewhat different clinical and pathologic features, but t he association between genotypes and phenotypes in these overlapping neoplasms is not straightforward.","['Liu, Yen-Chun', 'Illar, Gwendolyn M', 'Bailey, Nathanael Glen']","['Liu YC', 'Illar GM', 'Bailey NG']","['Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA baileyng@upmc.edu.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6747-680X'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200326,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['0 (RNA Splicing Factors)'],IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Pathology, Molecular', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spliceosomes/*genetics', 'Thrombocytosis/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['leukaemia', 'molecular pathology', 'myelodysplasia', 'myeloproliferative disease']",2020/03/29 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/03/29 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2020-206495 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206495 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2020 Nov;73(11):728-736. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206495.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this multicenter cross-sectional nationwide retrospective study was to evaluate the epidemiology, etiology, and outcome of infections in patients with MM undergoing ASCT in 13 Polish transplant centers, carried out on behalf of the Infectious Complications Study Group of the Polish Adult Leukemia Group. METHODS: A total number of consecutive 1374 patients with MM treated in Polish adult transplant centers from 2012 to 2014 were followed for infectious complications up to day +100 after ASCT in nationwide study. RESULTS: Altogether 490 infection episodes in 336 patients (49% male, aged 21-72 years) were reported, including 145 episodes of neutropenic fever (103 patients) and 34 episodes of clinically documented infections (CDIs) (27 patients). Among microbiologically confirmed infections there were 251 episodes of bacterial infections (180 patients), 42 episodes of fungal infections (38 patients), and 18 episodes of viral infections (17 patients). The overall incidence of infections reached 13.1% for bacterial, 3.6% for fungal, and 1.3% for viral infections. There were 16 cases of infection-related deaths after ASCT (1.2%). The mortality risk factors included multidrug-resistant bacteria etiology (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; P = .033), coexistence of bacterial and fungal infection (OR, 6.3; P = .002), and CDI (OR, 5.5; P = .007). CONCLUSION: ASCT in patients with MM was connected with low risk of life-threatening infections. However, multidrug-resistant bacteria bacterial etiology, mixed etiology, and CDI increased the risk of fatal outcome.","['Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Drozd-Sokolowska, Joanna', 'Basak, Grzegorz Wladyslaw', 'Piekarska, Agnieszka', 'Mensah-Glanowska, Patrycja', 'Sadowska-Klasa, Alicja', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka', 'Rzepecki, Piotr', 'Tomaszewska, Agnieszka', 'Manko, Joanna', 'Hus, Marek', 'Adamska, Monika', 'Romejko-Jarosinska, Joanna', 'Dybko, Jaroslaw', 'Biernat, Monika', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Sedzimirska, Mariola', 'Winciorek, Natalia', 'Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw Wiktor', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Gil, Lidia']","['Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Basak GW', 'Piekarska A', 'Mensah-Glanowska P', 'Sadowska-Klasa A', 'Wierzbowska A', 'Rzepecki P', 'Tomaszewska A', 'Manko J', 'Hus M', 'Adamska M', 'Romejko-Jarosinska J', 'Dybko J', 'Biernat M', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Sedzimirska M', 'Winciorek N', 'Jedrzejczak WW', 'Styczynski J', 'Giebel S', 'Gil L']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.

Nevertheless, the role of PBX1 contributing to progression of BC has been unevaluated. Here, on the basis of ONCOMINE and GOBO databases, we compared BC samples with normal controls about the expression of PBX1 in various types of cancers, as well as their related expression levels in cancer cell lines by Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) analysis. It was also found that, when compared with normal controls, PBX1 was markedly higher expressed not only in BC samples but also in BC cell lines, and coexpressed with EMP2 by ONCOMINE and CCLE coexpression analysis, which was also expressed higher in BC samples and BC cell lines similarly. According to Kaplan-Meier plotter, we further explored the prognostic functions of PBX1 and EMP2 in different molecular subtypes of BC, respectively. We demonstrated that overexpression of PBX1 mRNA was correlated with worse survival in luminal B subtype BC, whereas increased EMP2 expression was associated with shorter relapse-free survival in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative patients. Combining with previous studies, we could make a conclusion that coexpression of PBX1 and EMP2 predicts poor prognosis in ER-negative BC, which could be effective biomarkers for BC.","['Qiu, Yier', 'Lu, Guowen', 'Wu, Yingjie']","['Qiu Y', 'Lu G', 'Wu Y']","[""Department of Endoscopic Surgery of Thyroid Gland and Breast, The Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo, P.R.

Its diagnosis is based on clinical, cytogenetic, and cytomorphologic criteria, last criterion being sometimes difficult to assess. A high frequency of ASXL1 mutations have been described in this leukemia. We sequenced ASXL1 gene mutations in 61 patients with AML-MRC and 46 controls with acute myeloid leukemia without other specifications (AML-NOS) to identify clinical, cytomorphologic, and cytogenetic characteristics associated with ASXL1 mutational status. Mutated ASXL1 (ASXL1+) was observed in 31% of patients with AML-MRC compared to 4.3% in AML-NOS. Its presence in AML-MRC was associated with older age, a previous history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), leukocytosis, presence of micromegakaryocytes in bone marrow, lower number of blasts in bone marrow, myelomonocytic/monocytic morphological features and normal karyotype. ASXL1 mutation was not observed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome-related cytogenetic abnormalities or TP53 mutations. Differences in terms of overall survival were found only in AML-MRC patients without prior MDS or MDS/MPN and with intermediate-risk karyotype, having ASXL1+ patients a worst outcome than ASXL1-. We conclude that the ASXL1 mutation frequency is high in AML-MRC patients being its presence associated with specific characteristics including morphological signs of dysplasia. This association raises the possible role of ASXL1 as a surrogate marker in AML-MRC, which could facilitate the diagnosis of patients within this group when the karyotype is normal, and especially when the assessment of multilineage dysplasia morphologically is difficult. This mutation could be used as a worst outcome marker in de novo AML-MRC with intermediate-risk karyotype.","['Prats-Martin, Concepcion', 'Burillo-Sanz, Sergio', 'Morales-Camacho, Rosario M', 'Perez-Lopez, Olga', 'Suito, Milagros', 'Vargas, Maria T', 'Caballero-Velazquez, Teresa', 'Carrillo-Cruz, Estrella', 'Gonzalez, Jose', 'Bernal, Ricardo', 'Perez-Simon, Jose A']","['Prats-Martin C', 'Burillo-Sanz S', 'Morales-Camacho RM', 'Perez-Lopez O', 'Suito M', 'Vargas MT', 'Caballero-Velazquez T', 'Carrillo-Cruz E', 'Gonzalez J', 'Bernal R', 'Perez-Simon JA']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS/CISC/CIBERONC), Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio.

We aim to investigate the prognostic value of clinical and cytogenetic features and propose a new risk stratification in AML-M5 children. METHODS: We included 132 children with AML-M5. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were documented. Cox regression was performed to evaluate the potential risk factors of prognosis. RESULTS: The 5-year-OS was 46.0% (95% confidence intervals, 41.6%-50.4%) in all patients. There was significantly lower OS in the age </= 3 years old (P = .009) and hyperleukocytosis (P < .001). The FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) and MLL-rearrangement carriers were associated with fewer survivors in all patients (37.1% and 36.7%) and chemotherapy-only group (19.0% and 35.0%). Notably, the number of survivor with MLL-rearrangement did not increase in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) group. According to the Cox regression analysis, HSCT was a significantly favorable factor (P = .001), while hyperleukocytosis, age </= 3 years old, and BM blast >/= 70% adversely affected the OS in all patients (all P < .05). Additionally, FLT3-ITD was a risk factor for OS in the chemotherapy-only group (P = .023), while hyperleukocytosis and age </= 3 years independently contributed to poor PFS (both P < .05). In comparison to the standard-risk group, significant poorer outcome was found in the high-risk group (both P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: We propose that AML-M5 children with any of MLL-rearrangement, FLT3-ITD, hyperleukocytosis, BM blast >/= 70%, or age </= 3 years old are classified into the high-risk group, and HSCT is beneficial especially in patients with FLT3-ITD mutation, hyperleukocytosis, and age </= 3 years old. Importantly, the choice of HSCT should be made more carefully in children with MLL-rearrangement for its suboptimal performance.","['Liu, Li-Peng', 'Zhang, Ao-Li', 'Ruan, Min', 'Chang, Li-Xian', 'Liu, Fang', 'Chen, Xia', 'Qi, Ben-Quan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Zou, Yao', 'Chen, Yu-Mei', 'Chen, Xiao-Juan', 'Yang, Wen-Yu', 'Guo, Ye', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Liu LP', 'Zhang AL', 'Ruan M', 'Chang LX', 'Liu F', 'Chen X', 'Qi BQ', 'Zhang L', 'Zou Y', 'Chen YM', 'Chen XJ', 'Yang WY', 'Guo Y', 'Zhu XF']","['Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7987-7793'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200326,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/classification/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7286455,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute monocytic leukemia', '*children', '*clinical characteristics', '*gene mutation', '*prognostic factors']",2020/03/28 06:00,2021/05/14 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3023 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Jun;9(11):3647-3655. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3023.

Moreover, MLL rearrangements are the major cause of infant leukemia, and RUNX1 rearrangements are frequently detected in cord blood. These genes are sensitive to topoisomerase II inhibitors, and various genes have been identified as potential fusion partners. However, fetal exposure to these inhibitors is rare. Therefore, we postulated that even a proliferation signal itself might induce gene rearrangements in hematopoietic stem cells. To test this hypothesis, we detected gene rearrangements in etoposide-treated or non-treated CD34(+) cells cultured with cytokines using inverse PCR. In the etoposide-treated cells, variable-sized rearrangement bands were detected in the RUNX1 and MLL genes at 3 hours of culture, which decreased after 7 days. However, more rearrangement bands were detected in the non-treated cells at 7 days of culture. Such gene rearrangements were also detected in peripheral blood stem cells mobilized by cytokines for transplantation. However, none of these rearranged genes encoded the leukemogenic oncogene, and the cells with rearrangements did not expand. These findings suggest that MLL and RUNX1 rearrangements, which occur with very low frequency in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, may be induced under cytokine stimulation. Most of the cells with gene rearrangements are likely eliminated, except for leukemia-associated gene rearrangements, resulting in the low prevalence of leukemia development.","['Harada, Yuka', 'Shingai, Naoki', 'Ding, Ye', 'Sadato, Daichi', 'Hayashi, Yoshihiro', 'Yamaguchi, Masaki', 'Okuyama, Yoshiki', 'Shimoyama, Tatsu', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Harada, Hironori']","['Harada Y', 'Shingai N', 'Ding Y', 'Sadato D', 'Hayashi Y', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Okuyama Y', 'Shimoyama T', 'Ohashi K', 'Harada H']","['Laboratory of Oncology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Bunkyo Gakuin University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Bunkyo Gakuin University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Edogawa Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Ishikawa Prefectural Central Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1490-9923', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9401-5470']",['eng'],"['24591398/the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of', 'Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan', '25461422/the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of', 'Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan', '15K09460/the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of', 'Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan', '16K09831/the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of', 'Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan']",['Journal Article'],20200414,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Rearrangement/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/pharmacology']",PMC7226195,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL/KMT2A', 'RUNX1', 'cytokine', 'gene rearrangements', 'hematopoietic stem cells']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14392 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2020 May;111(5):1851-1855. doi: 10.1111/cas.14392.

Fifteen pediatric cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy and 15 healthy controls were studied. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was acquired. A visual n-back task was used to test working memory function during the fMRI scan. Responses were recorded via an MRI compatible button box for analysis. fMRI scans were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping software. All statistics were corrected for multiple comparisons by false discovery rate, with p < 0.05 as significance. Patients however gave more incorrect responses (p < 0.05), more no responses (p < 0.05), and longer response times (p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls. Correct responses generated significantly lower BOLD responses in the posterior cingulate for pediatric cancer survivors compared with controls (p < 0.05). Incorrect responses generated significantly greater BOLD responses in the angular gyrus in survivors (p < 0.05), and no response trials generated greater BOLD responses within the superior parietal lobule (p < 0.05) compared with controls. Working memory impairment appears to be due to an inability to manipulate information and to retrieve information from memory. The ability to delineate the affected neural circuits associated with chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment could inform treatment strategies, identify patients at high risk of developing cognitive deficits, and pre-emptively tailor behavioral enrichment to overcome specific cognitive deficits.","['Stefancin, Patricia', 'Cahaney, Christine', 'Parker, Robert I', 'Preston, Thomas', 'Coulehan, Kelly', 'Hogan, Laura', 'Duong, Timothy Q']","['Stefancin P', 'Cahaney C', 'Parker RI', 'Preston T', 'Coulehan K', 'Hogan L', 'Duong TQ']","['Department of Radiology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University Hospital, Stony Brook, New York.', 'Department of Radiology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University Hospital, Stony Brook, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University Hospital, Stony Brook, New York.', 'Department of Neurology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University Hospital, Stony Brook, New York.', 'Department of Neurology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University Hospital, Stony Brook, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University Hospital, Stony Brook, New York.', 'Department of Radiology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University Hospital, Stony Brook, New York.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6403-2827'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200325,England,NMR Biomed,NMR in biomedicine,8915233,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/*diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', '*Memory, Short-Term']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI', '*chemobrain', '*cognitive impairment', '*cognitive late effects', '*functional MRI', '*n-back tasks']",2020/03/28 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/nbm.4296 [doi]'],ppublish,NMR Biomed. 2020 Jun;33(6):e4296. doi: 10.1002/nbm.4296.

Routine clinicopathologic testing showed a significant lymphocytosis and proteinuria. Lymphocytes were of small to intermediate in size with a mature morphology. Infectious disease screening was negative. PCR for antigen receptor gene rearrangements showed a clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement consistent with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Bone marrow cytology showed <30% lymphocytes, while the proportion in splenic fine-needle aspirate cytology was considered increased. The dog was initially monitored but started on prednisolone and chlorambucil therapy 2 months later due to worsening clinical signs and progressive lymphocytosis. After an additional 2 weeks, the dog developed multifocal spinal pain and single-node lymphadenomegaly. Cytology of the lymph node showed a monomorphic population of large lymphoblasts consistent with lymphoma. Cytology of a cerebrospinal fluid sample also showed large lymphoblasts. PCR for antigen receptor gene rearrangement at both sites showed a clonal TCR rearrangement of the same molecular size as in the initial leukemic cells. The dog was diagnosed with a transformation of the CLL to Richter syndrome (RS) with involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). Therapy was started with L-asparaginase and an increased dose of prednisolone; however, the dog was euthanized due to progressive clinical signs.

Despite the reduction in relapse overall, it remains common, especially in high-risk groups. The outcomes for patients who relapse after transplant remains very poor. A large proportion of the morbidity that prevents most patients from accessing allo-HSCT is due to toxic nonspecific conditioning agents that are required to remove recipient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), allowing for successful donor engraftment. CD300f is expressed evenly across HSPC subtypes. CD300f has transcription and protein expression equivalent to CD33 on AML. We have developed an anti-CD300f antibody that efficiently internalizes into target cells. We have generated a highly potent anti-CD300f antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with a pyrrolobenzodiazepine warhead that selectively depletes AML cell lines and colony forming units in vitro. The ADC synergizes with fludarabine, making it a natural combination to use in a minimal toxicity conditioning regimen. Our ADC prolongs the survival of mice engrafted with human cell lines and depletes primary human AML engrafted with a single injection. In a humanized mouse model, a single injection of the ADC depletes CD34+ HSPCs and CD34+CD38-CD90+ hematopoietic stem cells. This work establishes an anti-CD300f ADC as an attractive potential therapeutic that, if validated in transplant models using a larger cohort of primary AML samples, will reduce relapse rate and toxicity for patients with AML undergoing allo-HSCT.","['Abadir, Edward', 'Silveira, Pablo A', 'Gasiorowski, Robin E', 'Ramesh, Murari', 'Romano, Adelina', 'Mekkawy, Ahmed H', 'Lo, Tsun-Ho', 'Kabani, Karieshma', 'Sutherland, Sarah', 'Pietersz, Geoffrey A', 'Ho, P Joy', 'Bryant, Christian E', 'Larsen, Stephen R', 'Clark, Georgina J']","['Abadir E', 'Silveira PA', 'Gasiorowski RE', 'Ramesh M', 'Romano A', 'Mekkawy AH', 'Lo TH', 'Kabani K', 'Sutherland S', 'Pietersz GA', 'Ho PJ', 'Bryant CE', 'Larsen SR', 'Clark GJ']","['Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Concord Repatriation General Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Atherothrombosis and Vascular Biology, Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Burnet Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Animals', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Mice', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7160263,,,,2020/03/28 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31377-X [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001289 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Apr 14;4(7):1206-1216. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001289.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To validate the accuracy of a predictive scoring system for 90-day mortality among patients with locally advanced HNSCC who have completed CCRT. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study included 16029 patients with HNSCC who completed CCRT between January 2006 and December 2015. Data were extracted from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database. A risk scoring system was developed based on significant risk factors and corresponding risk coefficients. Data analysis was conducted from June 2018 to February 2019. Exposures: Mortality within 90 days of completion of definitive CCRT. Main Outcomes and Measures: The 90-day mortality rate after completion of CCRT and the accuracy of the scoring system, based on a comparison of mortality rates between training and test data sets. Results: Among 16029 patients with locally advanced HNSCC, 1068 (6.66%; 1016 [95.1%] men; mean [SD] age, 55.11 [11.45] years) died before reaching the 90-day threshold, and 14961 (93.4%; 14080 [94.1%] men; mean [SD] age, 52.07 [9.99] years) survived. Multivariable analysis revealed that being aged 50 years or older (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.263; 95% CI, 1.104-1.445; P < .001), being aged 70 years or older (aHR, 2.183; 95% CI, 1.801-2.645; P < .001), having pneumonia (aHR, 1.946; 95% CI, 1.636-2.314; P < .001), having sepsis (aHR, 3.005; 95% CI, 2.503-3.607; P < .001), having hemiplegia (aHR, 1.430; 95% CI, 1.085-1.884; P = .01), having moderate or severe renal disease (aHR, 2.054; 95% CI, 1.643-2.568; P < .001), having leukemia (aHR, 4.541; 95% CI, 1.132-8.207; P = .03), and having non-HNSCC metastatic solid cancers (aHR, 1.457; 95% CI, 1.292-1.644; P < .001) were significant risk factors for 90-day mortality. Risk scores were categorized as very low risk (score of 0), low risk (score 1-3), moderate risk (score 4-6), and high risk (score >/=7), with 90-day mortality rates of 3.37%, 5.00% to 10.98%, 16.15% to 29.13%, and 33.93% to 37.50%, respectively. Mortality rates for patients with the same risk score in the training and test data sets were similar (score of 0, 3.27% vs 3.66%; score of 6, 27.42% vs 25.00%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prognostic study, a 90-day mortality scoring system accurately predicted 90-day mortality among patients with locally advanced HNSCC who completed CCRT.","['Lin, Kuan-Chou', 'Chen, Tsung-Ming', 'Yuan, Kevin Sheng-Po', 'Wu, Alexander T H', 'Wu, Szu-Yuan']","['Lin KC', 'Chen TM', 'Yuan KS', 'Wu ATH', 'Wu SY']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Shuang-Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Program for Translational Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Food Nutrition and Health Biotechnology, Asia University College of Medical and Health Science, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology, Lo-Hsu Medical Foundation, Lotung Poh-Ai Hospital, Yilan, Taiwan.', 'Big Data Center, Lo-Hsu Medical Foundation, Lotung Poh-Ai Hospital, Yilan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chemoradiotherapy/*mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Taiwan']",,,,,2020/03/28 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['2763489 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.20671 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2020 Mar 2;3(3):e1920671. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.20671.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population and mortality data were obtained from the Brazilian Health Informatics Department. The sample included children 0 to 14 years of age diagnosed with leukemia from 1997 to 2013, living in the city of Sao Paulo. The variables were sex, age bracket, and Regional Health Divisions. The survival analysis calculated the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator and compared the survival curves through the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional risks model was adjusted. The estimated majority of new cases were males, 0 to 4 years of age, diagnosed from 2000 to 2004, and living in the southeast regional division of the city of Sao Paulo. The estimated overall incidence rate was 34.7 new cases per million, and the mortality rate was 9.0 deaths per million. The overall five-year survival of children from acute lymphocytic leukemia was 68%. There was a statistically significant difference according to decade of diagnosis (p = 0.026), and specifically the survival rates decreased over the years, with the worst prognosis in the years 2005-2009.","['Silva, Franciane Figueiredo da', 'Latorre, Maria do Rosario Dias de Oliveira']","['Silva FFD', 'Latorre MDRDO']","['Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo, Vitoria, Brasil.', 'Faculdade de Saude Publica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8125-6582', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5189-3457']",['por'],,['Journal Article'],20200323,Brazil,Cad Saude Publica,Cadernos de saude publica,8901573,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cities', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,2020/03/28 06:00,2020/08/08 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0102-311X2020000305010 [pii]', '10.1590/0102-311X00008019 [doi]']",epublish,Cad Saude Publica. 2020 Mar 23;36(3):e00008019. doi: 10.1590/0102-311X00008019. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sobrevida das leucemias linfoides agudas em criancas no Municipio de Sao Paulo, Brasil.",,,,

In this age group, AML is frequently associated with poor-risk features, while patients' present comorbidities and reduced functional reserves. As such, intensive chemotherapy (ICT) is frequently too toxic or ineffective in elderly patients and is restricted to a select minority, though it is standard therapy for the youngest and fittest patients or for those belonging to either the favorable or intermediate-risk groups. The use of hypomethylating agents represent an effective alternative for patients who are unfit for ICT, yet the results remain unsatisfactory. In recent years, prognostic scores were developed that include geriatric assessment tools and improved risk-stratification. In addition, several effective new drugs have emerged. The combination of these drugs with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine has produced encouraging preliminary results that may change standard practices and offer an alternative to the dilemma of ICT versus low-intensity therapies.","['Vey, Norbert']",['Vey N'],"['Institut Paoli-Calmettes, 232 Boulevard de Sainte Marguerite, Marseille, 13009, France.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7027-040X'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200318,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC7081460,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'elderly', 'hypomethylating agents', 'intensive chemotherapy', 'low-dose cytarabine']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/03/28 06:01,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620720913010 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620720913010 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Mar 18;11:2040620720913010. doi: 10.1177/2040620720913010. eCollection 2020.,,"['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']",,"['Conflict of interest statement: The author declares that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, up to half of patients have persistent minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) not recognized by routine microscopy, which constitutes the leading determinant of relapse. Many studies in pediatric and adult populations have demonstrated that achievement of MRD negativity after induction chemotherapy or during consolidation is associated with significantly better long-term outcomes, and MRD status constitutes an independently prognostic marker, often superseding other conventional risk factors. Persistence of MRD after intensive chemotherapy is indicative of treatment refractoriness and warrants alternative therapeutic approaches including allogeneic stem cell transplantation, blinatumomab, or investigational therapies such as inotuzumab ozogamicin or chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Furthermore, the incorporation of novel monoclonal antibodies or potent BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as ponatinib into frontline treatment may have the advantage of achieving higher rates of MRD negativity while minimizing chemotherapy-related toxicities. Many studies are therefore ongoing to determine whether this strategy can improve cure rates without the need for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Abou Dalle, Iman', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Short, Nicholas J']","['Abou Dalle I', 'Jabbour E', 'Short NJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2983-2738'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200306,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC7065280,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'minimal residual disease', 'risk stratification']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/03/28 06:01,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620720910023 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620720910023 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Mar 6;11:2040620720910023. doi: 10.1177/2040620720910023. eCollection 2020.,,"['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']",,"['Conflict of interest statement: N.J.S. reports consulting fees from Takeda', 'Oncology and AstraZeneca, research funding from Takeda Oncology and Astellas', 'Pharma Inc., and honoraria from Amgen.

A characteristic balanced chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 t (15;17) (q24; q21) is seen in 95% of cases - the translocation results in the formation of the PML-RARA fusion protein. The introduction of retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been responsible for initially remarkable cure rates. However, relapsed APL, particularly in the high-risk subset of patients, remains an important clinical problem. In addition, despite the success of ATRA & ATO, many clinicians still elect to use cytotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment of APL. Patients who become resistant to ATO have an increased risk of mortality. The probability of relapse is significantly higher in the high-risk subset of patients undergoing treatment for APL; overall approximately 10-20% of APL patients relapse regardless of their risk stratification. Furthermore, 20-25% of patients undergoing treatment will develop differentiation syndrome, a common side effect of differentiation agents. Recent evidence using in vitro models has shown that mutations in the B2 domain of the PML protein, mediate arsenic resistance. Alternative agents and approaches considering these clinical outcomes are needed to address ATO resistance as well as the relapse rate in high risk APL.","['Jimenez, Joaquin J', 'Chale, Ravinder S', 'Abad, Andrea C', 'Schally, Andrew V']","['Jimenez JJ', 'Chale RS', 'Abad AC', 'Schally AV']","['Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Endocrine, Polypeptide and Cancer Institute, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200317,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC7082115,,['NOTNLM'],"['arsenic trioxide', 'promyelocytic leukemia', 'resistance', 'retinoic acid']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/03/28 06:01,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27513 [doi]', '27513 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2020 Mar 17;11(11):992-1003. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27513. eCollection 2020 Mar 17.,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Through pharmacologic and genetic experiments, we could validate that DOT1L is essential for growth and viability of a subset of MM cell lines, in line with a recent report from another team. In vivo activity against established MM xenografts was observed with a novel DOT1L inhibitor. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of the dependency in MM, we examined gene expression changes upon DOT1L inhibition in sensitive and insensitive cell lines and discovered that genes belonging to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway and protein synthesis machinery were specifically suppressed in sensitive cells. Whole-genome CRISPR screens in the presence or absence of a DOT1L inhibitor revealed that concomitant targeting of the H3K4me3 methyltransferase SETD1B increases the effect of DOT1L inhibition.

In this preclinical study, we characterized the binding affinity and selectivity of quizartinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of FLT3, and AC886, the active metabolite of quizartinib, compared with those of other FLT3 inhibitors. Selectivity profiling against >400 kinases showed that quizartinib and AC886 were highly selective against FLT3. Quizartinib and AC886 inhibited FLT3 signaling pathways in FLT3-ITD-mutated AML cells, leading to potent growth inhibition with IC50 values of <1 nM. When quizartinib was administered to mice bearing FLT3-ITD mutated tumors, AC886 was rapidly detected and tumor regression was observed at doses of >/=1 mg/kg without severe body weight loss. In addition, quizartinib inhibited the viability of midostaurin-resistant MOLM-14 cells and exerted potent antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models without severe body weight loss, while midostaurin and gilteritinib did not show significant antitumor effects. This is the first detailed characterization of quizartinib and AC886 in comparison with other FLT3 inhibitors under the same experimental conditions. Preclinical antileukemic activity in midostaurin-resistant FLT3-ITD-mutated AML cells suggests the potential value of quizartinib following midostaurin failure in patients with FLT3-ITD mutated AML.","['Aikawa, Tomoya', 'Togashi, Noriko', 'Iwanaga, Koichi', 'Okada, Hiroyuki', 'Nishiya, Yumi', 'Inoue, Shinichi', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Isoyama, Takeshi']","['Aikawa T', 'Togashi N', 'Iwanaga K', 'Okada H', 'Nishiya Y', 'Inoue S', 'Levis MJ', 'Isoyama T']","['Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.', 'Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200317,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC7082118,,['NOTNLM'],"['AC886', 'FLT3 inhibitors', 'midostaurin resistance', 'quizartinib', 'relapsed/refractory AML']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/03/28 06:01,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27489 [doi]', '27489 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2020 Mar 17;11(11):943-955. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27489. eCollection 2020 Mar 17.,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST MJL is a consultant for Agios, Amgen, Astellas, Daiichi', 'Sankyo Co, Ltd, Fujifilm, Menarini, and Novartis and has received research', 'funding from Astellas, Novartis, and Fujifilm.

Fungal pathogens mainly occur in patients with immunocompromised disorders such as hematologic malignancies, acute myeloid leukemia, transplant patients. CASE REPORT: In this study, we presented a COPD patient infected with S. capitata. At the first check, the patient showed cough, dyspnea, chest pain on both sides. The clinical laboratory test result was characterized with high White blood cell (12.8 G/L), HIV negative. The X ray showed bronchitis and emphysema. Bronchoscopy illustrated bronchial mucositis. CT scanner demonstrated pneumonia with fuzzy nodular lesions and thick interstitial organization in both lungs. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin 800 mg/day; cefuroxime 2250 mmg/day. However, the fever appeared 2 weeks thereafter. The S. capitata was discovered in the bronchial fluid. The patient was then treated with fluconazole 400 mg/day for 14 days. At the end of treatment, all signs and symptoms of S. capitata infection disappeared and the patient recovered. CONCLUSION: This case study showed that S. capitata infection can occur in the COPD patients and fluconazole is a pertinent drug for treatment of the infection.","['Duan, Pham Ngoc', 'Hung, Nguyen Nhu', 'Nhu, Phong Tran', 'Thien, Chu Dinh', 'Tran, Quang Canh']","['Duan PN', 'Hung NN', 'Nhu PT', 'Thien CD', 'Tran QC']","['Department of Parasitology, Hanoi Medical University, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Hanoi Medical University Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Microbiology, 74 Hospital, Phuc Yen, Vinh Phuc, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Nursing, Dainam University, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Institute for Research and Development, Duy Tan University, 03 Quang Trung, Danang, Vietnam.', 'Center for Hygiene and Food Safety, Haiduong Medical Technical University, Hai Duong, Vietnam.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191220,North Macedonia,Open Access Maced J Med Sci,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,101662294,,,,PMC7084037,,['NOTNLM'],"['COPD', 'Fluconazole', 'Saprochaete capitata']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/03/28 06:01,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3889/oamjms.2019.385 [doi]', 'OAMJMS-7-4329 [pii]']",epublish,Open Access Maced J Med Sci. 2019 Dec 20;7(24):4329-4332. doi: 10.3889/oamjms.2019.385. eCollection 2019 Dec 30.,,"['Copyright: (c) 2019 Pham Ngoc Duan, Nguyen Nhu Hung, Phong Tran Nhu, Chu Dinh', 'Thien, Quang Canh Tran.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulated evidence shows that lycorine not only possesses strong pharmacological effects on many diseases, including anti-leukemia, anti-tumor, anti-angiogenesis, anti-virus, anti-bacteria, anti-inflammation, and antimalaria, but also exerts many other biological functions, such as inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and topoisomerase, suppression of ascorbic acid biosynthesis, and control of circadian period length. Notably, lycorine exhibits its numerous pharmacological effects on various diseases with very low toxicity and mild side effects.

On this perspective, feline AGP can be a useful comparative model, as it has different concentrations in cats susceptible or resistant to some disease. As a preliminary approach to the study of feline AGP (fAGP) we have purified this protein from feline serum by HPLC using human AGP (hAGP) as a model. Immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against fAGP and with a monoclonal antibody against hAGP was performed on serum from healthy cats, from cats exposed to feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection and from cats with purulent inflammations, such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Immunohistochemistry on tissues from healthy cats and from cats with different diseases (FIP, FIV, FeLV, locally extensive inflammation) was also performed with the same antibodies. Both hAGP and fAGP have been purified to homogenity as determined by SDS-PAGE. fAGP did not react with the anti-hAGP antibody which, in contrast, detected in feline serum a low MW protein that we called fAGP-related protein (fAGPrP). This protein was underexpressed in cats with FeLV and FIP. Both fAGP and fAGPrP were immunohistochemically detected in plasma and hepatocytes with a stronger intensity in cats with FIP and some inflammatory conditions. Moreover, fAGPrP was detected in the cytoplasm of tissue cells, most likely identifiable with plasma cells. These cells were rarely detectable in cats with FIV and FeLV, and numerous in cats with FIP and with locally extensive inflammation. In conclusion, purified fAGP has physicochemical characteristics similar to those of hAGP, but does not cross-react with anti-hAGP antibodies. In contrast, the anti-hAGP detected an AGP-related protein whose blood concentration and tissue distribution was not related to that of fAGP. Moreover, both fAGP and fAGPrP were differently expressed in cats with pathologic conditions compared to controls. Further study of these proteins by analysing their structural characteristics is required.","['Paltrinieri, Saverio', 'Ceciliani, Fabrizio', 'Gabanti, Elisa', 'Sironi, Giuseppe', 'Giordano, Alessia', 'Addie, Diane']","['Paltrinieri S', 'Ceciliani F', 'Gabanti E', 'Sironi G', 'Giordano A', 'Addie D']","['1Universita di Milano, Milan.grid.4708.b0000000417572822', '4Dipartimento di Patologia Animale, Igiene e Sanita Pubblica Veterinaria Universita di Milano, Via Celoria 10, I20133 Milano, Italy.grid.4708.b0000000417572822', '1Universita di Milano, Milan.grid.4708.b0000000417572822', 'Fondazione Istituto Neurologico C.

In the Iberian lynx, interspecific killing (without prey consumption) of some mesocarnivores, such as the Egyptian mongoose, genet, and red fox, has been reported. Although vaguely documented, evidence suggests feral cats fall victim to interactions with this apex predator. Here, we describe the first documented case of interspecific killing and partial consumption of a feral cat by an adult male Iberian lynx reintroduced in Southwestern Spain. Ulterior analyses demonstrated that the victim was viremic to feline leukemia virus. To prevent the dissemination of the virus and a potential outbreak in the Iberian lynx population, control measures, including the clinical evaluation of the male Iberian lynx, and intensive monitoring were implemented in order to detect intraspecific interactions. After 3 weeks, the lynx was evaluated, presented good condition and resulted negative to both ELISA and RT-PCR. Thanks to the long-term monitoring, this case could be detected and measures to prevent an outbreak could be implemented.","['Najera, F', 'Sanchez-Cuerda, S', 'Lopez, G', 'Del Rey-Wamba, T', 'Rueda, C', 'Vallverdu-Coll, N', 'Panadero, J', 'Palacios, M J', 'Lopez-Bao, J V', 'Jimenez, J']","['Najera F', 'Sanchez-Cuerda S', 'Lopez G', 'Del Rey-Wamba T', 'Rueda C', 'Vallverdu-Coll N', 'Panadero J', 'Palacios MJ', 'Lopez-Bao JV', 'Jimenez J']","['1Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Avda.

All the wildcats but one (95.4%) presented evidence of contact with at least one of the agents (mean = 2.2). Contact with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was detected in 81% of the wildcats (antibodies, 77%; antigen p27, 15%). Antibodies to feline calicivirus (FCV, 80%), feline herpesvirus (FHV, 20%), feline parvovirus (FPV, 18%), and Chlamydophila sp. (27%) were also detected. Analyses were negative for feline immunodeficiency virus and feline coronavirus. The probability of having antibodies to FPV was inversely related with the concentration of serum cholesterol and with a morphometric index of body condition. Similarity in the composition of antibodies against disease agents (number and identity of detected and undetected antibodies) was significantly higher in pairs of female wildcats than in pairs of males or heterosexual pairs, suggesting that females had a more homogeneous exposure to pathogens. Seroprevalence for FHV was higher in males than in females. Antibodies to FHV and Chlamydophila sp. were more frequent in winter than in other seasons. In addition, the mean similarity of the pathogen community between pairs of serum samples was higher if both wildcats were caught during the same season than if they were not. Mean similarity was lowest when serum samples obtained in winter were compared with those from spring or summer. The results suggest that some agents probably had a reservoir in domestic cats and may cause some undetected morbidity/mortality in the studied wildcat population, whereas others, such as FeLV and FCV, may be enzootic.","['Millan, Javier', 'Rodriguez, Alejandro']","['Millan J', 'Rodriguez A']","['Fundacio Natura Parc, 07142 Santa Eugenia (Balearic Islands), Spain.', '2Department of Conservation Biology, Estacion Biologica de Donana (CSIC), Avda.

Samples were tested for antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline/canine parvovirus (FPV/CPV), feline coronavirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukaemia virus and canine distemper virus (CDV) and for FeLV p27 antigen, to document baseline exposure levels. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 44% of lynx, with a significantly greater prevalence in DNP (61%) than in SM (12%). In DNP, prevalence was significantly higher in adult (81%) than in juvenile and sub-adult (41%) lynx, but no such difference was observed in SM. Low prevalences (</=11%) of minimally positive titres were found for FHV-1, FCV and FPV/CPV. This, combined with the lack of evidence for exposure to CDV, FIV and FeLV, suggests that these lynx populations are naive and might be vulnerable to a disease outbreak in the future. Because of the reduced size of lynx populations, the documented low level of genetic variation (particularly in the DNP population) coupled with the recently documented state of immune depletion in a majority of necropsied lynx, it is important to better understand the threat and potential impact that disease agents might pose for the conservation of this endangered species. Future surveillance programs must include possible disease reservoir hosts such as domestic cats and dogs and other wild carnivores.","['Roelke, Melody E', 'Johnson, Warren E', 'Millan, Javier', 'Palomares, Francisco', 'Revilla, Eloy', 'Rodriguez, Alejandro', 'Calzada, Javier', 'Ferreras, Pablo', 'Leon-Vizcaino, Luis', 'Delibes, Miguel', ""O'Brien, Stephen J""]","['Roelke ME', 'Johnson WE', 'Millan J', 'Palomares F', 'Revilla E', 'Rodriguez A', 'Calzada J', 'Ferreras P', 'Leon-Vizcaino L', 'Delibes M', ""O'Brien SJ""]","['1Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, SAIC-Frederick, NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201 USA.grid.418021.e0000000405358394', '2Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, National Cancer Institute, NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201 USA.grid.418021.e0000000405358394', '3Department of Conservation Biology, Estacion Biologica de Donana (CSIC), 41013 Sevilla, Spain.grid.418875.70000000110916248', '3Department of Conservation Biology, Estacion Biologica de Donana (CSIC), 41013 Sevilla, Spain.grid.418875.70000000110916248', '3Department of Conservation Biology, Estacion Biologica de Donana (CSIC), 41013 Sevilla, Spain.grid.418875.70000000110916248', '3Department of Conservation Biology, Estacion Biologica de Donana (CSIC), 41013 Sevilla, Spain.grid.418875.70000000110916248', '4Departamento de Biologia Ambiental y Salud Publica, Facultad de Ciencias Experimentales, Universidad de Huelva, 21071 Huelva, Spain.grid.18803.320000000417698134', '5IREC (CSIC-UCLM-JCCM), Ronda de Toledo s/n, 13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.grid.452528.c', '6Infectious Diseases Area, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Murcia, 30100 Murcia, Spain.grid.10586.3a0000000122878496', '3Department of Conservation Biology, Estacion Biologica de Donana (CSIC), 41013 Sevilla, Spain.grid.418875.70000000110916248', '2Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, National Cancer Institute, NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201 USA.grid.418021.e0000000405358394']",,['eng'],['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20070724,Germany,Eur J Wildl Res,European journal of wildlife research,101242668,,,,PMC7087597,,['NOTNLM'],"['Andalusia', 'Conservation', 'Disease risk', 'Serosurvey', 'Spain']",2008/01/01 00:00,2008/01/01 00:01,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2007/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10344-007-0122-2 [doi]', '122 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Wildl Res. 2008;54(2):171-178. doi: 10.1007/s10344-007-0122-2.

Our study of genetic homozygosity degree includes an analysis of the presence, distribution and individual combination of 20 to 30 selected genetically controlled morphophysiological traits in the sample of BEN patients and in the control-healthy group. Assuming that BEN is genetically controlled disease, we made a hypothesis that an increased homozygosity level, as well as the changed variability among the patients, could be populationgenetic parameter for the prediction of the illness.

This compound is the most important natural product for potential development of new anti-HIV drugs and phytomedicines. The scientometric analysis (1953-2014) here performed revealed that the most studied species of Calophyllum genus are: C. inophyllum and C. brasiliense, distributed in the Asian, and American continents, respectively. Current research on these species is carried out mainly in India and Brazil, respectively, where these species grow. Research on C. brasiliense is focused mainly on ecological, antiparasitic, cytotoxic properties, and isolation of new compounds. Chemical studies and biodiesel development are the main topics in the case of C. inophyllum. Text mining analysis revealed that coumarins, and xanthones are the main secondary active metabolites responsible for most of the reported pharmacological properties, and are potential compounds for the treatment of leukemia and against intracellular parasites causing American Trypanosomiasis and Leshmaniasis.

EDC proved to provide good yields of the analogs from the respective omega-amino-1- or -2-hydroxyalkylphosphonates and nucleobase-derived acetic acids. New phosphorus-nucleobase linkers are characterized by two fragments of the restricted rotation within amide bonds and in four-atom units (P-CH(OH)-CH2-N, P-CH(OH)-CH2-C and P-CH2-CH(OH)-C) in which antiperiplanar disposition of P and N/C atoms was deduced from (1)H and (13)C NMR spectral data. The synthesized analogs P-X-HNC(O)-CH2B [X=CH(OH)CH2, CH(OH)CH2CH2, CH2CH(OH)CH2] appeared inactive in antiviral assays on a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses at concentrations up to 100 muM, while two phosphonates showed cytostatic activity towards myeloid leukemia (K-562) and multiple myeloma cells (MM.1S) with IC50 of 28.8 and 40.7 muM, respectively.

A reduced SIRT7-expression in aged murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) resulted in reduced longevity and increased proliferation. In this study we investigated age-related changes of SIRT7-expression in healthy humans and relevant pathomechanisms in AML and CML. SIRT7-expression in leukocytes of healthy people decreased in an age-dependent manner. Low SIRT7 mRNA levels were also detected in AML and CML patients. With positive treatment response, SIRT7-expression increased, but showed reduction when patients progressed or relapsed. Pharmacologic inhibition of driver mutations in AML (FLT3-ITD) or CML (BCR-ABL) also restored SIRT7 levels in cell lines and patient samples. Furthermore, SIRT7-expression increased with time during PMA-mediated monocyte differentiation of THP-1 cells. SIRT7-overexpression in THP-1 cells resulted in increased expression of differentiation markers. BCR-ABL, FLT3-ITD, and differentiation-associated SIRT7-expression in general were positively regulated by C/EBPalpha, -beta, and -epsilon binding to two different C/EBP-binding sites within the SIRT7 promoter. SIRT7 is important in human hematopoietic cell aging and longevity. It might act as tumor suppressor and could potentially serve as general biomarker for monitoring treatment response in myeloid stem-cell disorders.","['Kaiser, Alexander', 'Schmidt, Martin', 'Huber, Otmar', 'Frietsch, Jochen J', 'Scholl, Sebastian', 'Heidel, Florian H', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Muller, Jorg P', 'Ernst, Thomas']","['Kaiser A', 'Schmidt M', 'Huber O', 'Frietsch JJ', 'Scholl S', 'Heidel FH', 'Hochhaus A', 'Muller JP', 'Ernst T']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Biochemie II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat, Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Biochemie II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute on Aging (Fritz-Lipmann-Institute), Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Molekulare Zellbiologie, CMB, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany. thomas.ernst@med.uni-jena.de.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4359-1747', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1476-8059']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200325,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (SIRT7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Healthy Aging', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Sirtuins/genetics/*physiology', 'THP-1 Cells', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC8318878,,,,2020/03/28 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0803-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0803-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Aug;34(8):2206-2216. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0803-3.

Even so, haematopoietic stem cells and their progeny that have chosen a particular fate can still ""change their mind"" and adopt a different developmental pathway. Many of the leukaemias arise in haematopoietic stem cells with the bulk of the often partially differentiated leukaemia cells belonging to just one cell type. We argue that the reason for this is that an oncogenic insult to the genome ""hard wires"" leukaemia stem cells, either through development or at some stage, to one cell lineage.

The immune response to VZV of healthy subjects has been rigorously assessed, but little is known about that of immunocompromised individuals. This study aimed to clarify the primary response to VZV infection in immunocompromised children. This prospective study enrolled six immunocompromised children (median age, 33 months; range, 20-62) receiving steroids or immunosuppressants, and 10 immunocompetent children (median age, 32 months; range, 15-81) with varicella. The immunocompromised children were three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, two recipients with liver transplantation and one patient with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Interferon-gamma-producing CD69(+)T-cells produced by VZV stimulation (VZV-specific T-cells) were studied during the acute or convalescent phase. To further address the direct effect of immunosuppressants, we analyzed the number of VZV-specific T-cells after stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from healthy adults with live-attenuated VZV with or without prednisolone, cyclosporine-A, or tacrolimus. The circulating numbers of lymphocytes in the convalescent stage but not acute stage were lower in immunocompromised children compared with immunocompetent children. In the acute stage, immunocompromised patients showed lower VZV-specific CD8(+)T-cell counts than immunocompetent subjects. In contrast, in the convalescent phase, immunocompromised patients had lower VZV-specific CD4(+)T-cell counts than immunocompetent hosts. The in vitro culture of activated lymphocytes with prednisolone or immunosuppressants significantly decreased the proportion of VZV-specific CD4(+)T-cells. In conclusion, the decreased numbers of VZV-specific CD8(+)T-cells during the acute phase and VZV-specific CD4(+)T-cells during the convalescent phase of disease may account for severe varicella in immunocompromised children.","['Murata, Kenji', 'Hoshina, Takayuki', 'Onoyama, Sagano', 'Tanaka, Tamami', 'Kanno, Shunsuke', 'Ishimura, Masataka', 'Koga, Yuhki', 'Nakayama, Hideki', 'Ohga, Shouichi']","['Murata K', 'Hoshina T', 'Onoyama S', 'Tanaka T', 'Kanno S', 'Ishimura M', 'Koga Y', 'Nakayama H', 'Ohga S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization Fukuoka Higashi Medical Center.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Chickenpox/drug therapy/*immunology/*virology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Convalescence', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['cellular immunity', 'chickenpox', 'immunosuppressive agents', 'interferon-gamma', 'varicella-zoster virus']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/12/19 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.250.181 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2020 Mar;250(3):181-190. doi: 10.1620/tjem.250.181.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the main culprit causing myeloid leukemia and hemangioma in chickens. The distinctiveness of the env gene of ALV-J, with low homology to those of other ALVs, is linked to its unique pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies show that env of ALV-J can be grouped into three species based on the tyrosine motifs in the cytoplasmic domain (CTD) of Gp37, i.e., the inhibitory, bifunctional, and active groups. To explore whether the C terminus or the tyrosine motifs in the CTD of Gp37 affect the pathogenicity of ALV-J, a set of ALV-J infectious clones containing different C termini of Gp37 or the mutants at the tyrosine sites were tested in vitro and in vivo Viral growth kinetics indicated not only that ALV-J with active env is the fastest in replication and ALV-J with inhibitory env is the lowest but also that the tyrosine sites essentially affected the replication of ALV-J. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that chickens infected by ALV-J with active or bifunctional env showed higher viremia, cloacal viral shedding, and viral tissue load than those infected by ALV-J with inhibitory env Notably, the chickens infected by ALV-J with active or bifunctional env showed significant loss of body weight compared with the control chickens. Taken together, these findings reveal that the C terminus of Gp37 plays a vital role in ALV-J pathogenesis, and change from inhibitory env to bifunctional or active env increases the pathogenesis of ALV-J.IMPORTANCE ALV-J can cause severe immunosuppression and myeloid leukemia in infected chickens. However, no vaccine or antiviral drug is available against ALV-J, and the mechanism for ALV-J pathogenesis needs to be elucidated. It is generally believed that gp85 and LTR of ALV contribute to its pathogenesis. Here, we found that the C terminus and the tyrosine motifs (YxxM, ITIM, and ITAM-like) in the CTD of Gp37 of ALV-J could affect the pathogenicity of ALV-J in vitro and in vivo The pathogenicity of ALV-J with Gp37 containing ITIM only was significantly less than ALV-J with Gp37 containing both YxxM and ITIM and ALV-J with Gp37 containing both YxxM and ITAM-like. This study highlights the vital role of the C terminus of Gp37 in the pathogenesis of ALV-J and thus provides a new perspective to elucidate the interaction between ALV-J and its host and a molecular basis to develop efficient strategies against ALV-J.","['Li, Tuofan', 'Yao, Xiaohui', 'Li, Chunping', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Xie, Quan', 'Wang, Weikang', 'Lu, Hao', 'Fu, Hui', 'Li, Luyuan', 'Xie, Jing',

The most active compound 4 with an IC50 value of 9.7 muM against HepG2 cells was selected to examine the cytotoxic mechanism, which induced the apoptosis and arrested the HepG2 cell cycle at S stage. The in vivo zebrafish experiments revealed that compound 4 had the property of inhibiting tumor proliferation and migration.","['Liang, Yue', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Yang, Xueyuan', 'Li, Ying', 'Zhang, Xuke', 'Li, Yuhao', 'Du, Qing', 'Jin, Da-Qing', 'Cui, Jianlin', 'Lall, Namrita', 'Tuerhong, Muhetaer', 'Lee, Dongho', 'Abudukeremu, Munira', 'Xu, Jing', 'Shuai, Ling', 'Guo, Yuanqiang']","['Liang Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Yang X', 'Li Y', 'Zhang X', 'Li Y', 'Du Q', 'Jin DQ', 'Cui J', 'Lall N', 'Tuerhong M', 'Lee D', 'Abudukeremu M', 'Xu J', 'Shuai L', 'Guo Y']","[""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory for Tibet Plateau Phytochemistry of Qinghai Province, College of Pharmacy, Qinghai Nationalities University, Xining 810007, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0002, South Africa.', ""College of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory of Xinjiang Native Medicinal and Edible Plant Resources Chemistry, Kashgar University, Kashgar 844000, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Biosystems and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.', ""College of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory of Xinjiang Native Medicinal and Edible Plant Resources Chemistry, Kashgar University, Kashgar 844000, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy, and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, People's Republic of China; State Key Laboratory for Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of Medicinal Resources, Guangxi Normal University, Guilin 541004, People's Republic of China.

CD200 and CD56 expression represented an independent prognostic factor in many hematological malignancies but its importance in AML patients remains to be identified. METHODS: CD200 and CD56 expression were assessed in the bone marrow blasts for Fifty-two (52) newly diagnosed AML by flowcytometry before start of therapy. RESULTS: CD200+ expression was reported in 28.8% of patients while 17.3% of patients showed CD56+ expression. M4 FAB revealed high frequency of both CD200+ and CD56+ expression. The overall survival of CD200+ patients was 19.2% compared to 35.3% in CD200- (P= 0.049). On the other hand, CD56+ patients had the lowest complete remission rate (22.2% vs. 53.4%). In addition, CD56+ population had significant bad influence on overall survival than those of CD56- population (11.1 % vs. 35.5 %, P= 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: CD200 and CD56 positive expression by myeloblasts at diagnosis denote poor prognostic indicator and correlated with poor cytogenetic findings. CD200 could be used as therapeutic target in AML.<br />.","['Aref, Salah', 'Abousamra, Nashwa', 'El-Helaly, Emann', 'Mabed, Mohamed']","['Aref S', 'Abousamra N', 'El-Helaly E', 'Mabed M']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Hematology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hematology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hematology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4822-5204'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200301,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (NCAM1 protein, human)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",PMC7437307,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD200', 'CD56', 'Prognosis']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/04/03 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.3.743 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Mar 1;21(3):743-748. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.3.743.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of IDH mutations and to evaluate its role in AML prognosis. METHODS: We have analyzed IDH1 and 2 mutations using High Resolution Melting curve analysis (HRM) in 70 denovo AML patients. RESULTS: The median age of AML patients is 40 years (16-75). Incidence of IDH mutations is 10/70 (14.3%); 2 (2.9%) IDH1 mutant and 8 (11.4%) IDH2 mutant. Median PB blasts of mutant IDH patients was 67.5% (25-96) vs. 44% (0-98) for wild type (p=0.065). Eight/10 (80%) mutant IDH patients had B.M blasts >/=50% vs. 2/10 (20%) <50% (p<0.001) and were classified as intermediate risk cytogenetics (p=0.020) with wild FLT3-ITD (p=0.001). Ten/10 (100%) mutant IDH patients showed wild NPM1 (p=0.049). Median OS of mutant IDH in the intermediate risk cytogenetics was 1.8 years (0.7-3.1) vs. 3.1 years (1.1-5.5) for wild IDH (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: IDH mutation is mainly associated with intermediate risk AML and when integrated in this specific subgroup displays a lower survival and can be considered an additional integrated molecular risk marker for AML prognosis.<br />.,"['ElNahass, Yasser H', 'Badawy, Ragia H', 'ElRefaey, Fatma A', 'Nooh, Hend A', 'Ibrahiem, Dalia', 'Nader, Heba A', 'Mahmoud, Hossam K', 'ElMetnawy, Wafaa H']","['ElNahass YH', 'Badawy RH', 'ElRefaey FA', 'Nooh HA', 'Ibrahiem D', 'Nader HA', 'Mahmoud HK', 'ElMetnawy WH']","['National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Kasr Al Eini Street, Fom El Khalig, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Kasr Al Eini Street, Fom El Khalig, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Kasr Al Eini Street, Fom El Khalig, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Kasr Al Eini Street, Fom El Khalig, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Kasr Al Eini Street, Fom El Khalig, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Genome Onco-Center, 52, Gameat Al Dowal Alarabya , Mohandeseen, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Kasr Al Eini Street, Fom El Khalig, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Al-Saray Street, El Manial, Cairo, Egypt.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200301,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Patients with hematologic malignancies by variable severity could be suspected for the infection with different types of this virus. This preliminary study reported the genotyping and related viral load of Epstein-Barr virus in Iranian patients with hematologic malignancies for estimation of possible factors affecting malignancy. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HL (n=20), NHL (n=29), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n=18) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=12) were obtained. After DNA extraction, a nested-PCR and a conventional-PCR targeting EBNA-2 and EBNA-3C genes were performed. A real-time PCR assay for viral load quantitation carried out. Standard curve analysis used for evaluation of amplification specificity. RESULTS: Of 79 included patients, 34 (43%) were EBV positive. There were 23.5% (8/34), 38.2% (13/34), 23.5% (8/34), 14.8% (5/34) in HL, NHL, ALL and CLL groups, respectively. Also, the main genotype was genotype I (91.2%) which it follows by 8.8% (3/34) genotype II. The real-time PCR assay showed the mean viral load +/- std. deviation was 2.75x105 +/- 1.202x106 copies/mug DNA and the higher viral load was seen in NHL patients. CONCLUSION: This preliminary investigation in Iran shows that the main EBV genotype into our region probably is genotype I (91.2%) which it is similar to others. We could not find any statistically significant association between the virus infection and viral load with any specific disease and patients' demographic data. <br />.","['Tabibzadeh, Alireza', 'Karbalaie Niya, Mohammad Hadi', 'Esghaei, Maryam', 'Bokharaei-Salim, Farah', 'Ataei-Pirkooh, Angila', 'Kiani, Seyed Jalal', 'Monavari, Seyed Hamid Reza']","['Tabibzadeh A', 'Karbalaie Niya MH', 'Esghaei M', 'Bokharaei-Salim F', 'Ataei-Pirkooh A', 'Kiani SJ', 'Monavari SHR']","['Department of Virology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2944-2147'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200301,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Viral Load']",PMC7437315,,['NOTNLM'],"['EBV Nuclear Antigen (EBNA)', 'Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)', 'Genotyping', 'hematologic malignancy']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/04/03 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.3.693 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Mar 1;21(3):693-698. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.3.693.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidences show that over-expression of Mcl-1 is linked to ABT-737 resistance in NSCLC cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miRNA-101 on Mcl-1 expression and sensitivity of the A549 NSCLC cells to ABT-737. METHODS: After miRNA-101 transfection, the Mcl-1 mRNA expression levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. Trypan blue staining was used to explore the effect of miRNA-101 on cell growth. The cytotoxic effects of miRNA-101 and ABT-737, alone and in combination, were measured using MTT assay. The effect of drugs combination was determined using the method of Chou-Talalay. Cell death was assessed using cell death detection ELISA assay kit. RESULTS: Results showed that miRNA-101 markedly suppressed the expression of Mcl-1 mRNA in a time dependent manner, which led to A549 cell proliferation inhibition and enhancement of apoptosis (p < 0.05, relative to blank control). Pretreatment with miRNA-101 synergistically decreased the cell survival rate and lowered the IC50 value of ABT-737. Furthermore, miRNA-101 dramatically enhanced the apoptotic effect of ABT-737. Negative control miRNA had no remarkable effect on cellular parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings propose that suppression of Mcl-1 by miRNA-101 can effectively inhibit the cell growth and sensitize A549 cells to ABT-737. Therefore, miRNA-101 can be considered as a potential therapeutic target in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.<br />.","['Shahverdi, Mahshid', 'Amini, Razieh', 'Amri, Jamal', 'Karami, Hadi']","['Shahverdi M', 'Amini R', 'Amri J', 'Karami H']","['Molecular and Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Traditional and Complementary Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Molecular and Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8824-8160'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200301,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/therapy', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",PMC7437340,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'Bcl-2', 'Lung cancer', 'Mcl-1', 'MiRNA-101']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/04/03 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.3.675 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Mar 1;21(3):675-681. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.3.675.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 50% of MDS patients have chromosomal abnormalities. Moreover, chromosome 5 and 7 are common genetic abnormalities in MDS patients and use to identify prognosis risk group and the proper treatment in MDS patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities and clinical features of MDS patients in upper northern Thailand. METHODS: Fifty bone marrow (BM) specimens were examined by conventional cytogenetic (CC) technique and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique for detected chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities. The clinical features were comparison between MDS patients with chromosomal abnormalities and those with normal karyotype. RESULTS: Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 8/50 MDS patients by CC and 17/50 cases by FISH technique. When the CC and FISH techniques were combined, chromosomal abnormalities increased to 21/50 cases. Abnormalities of isolated chromosome 5 were found in 13 cases and were associated with lower level of percentage blast of BM (p = 0.003) and higher level of hemoglobin (p = 0.019). Moreover, abnormalities of chromosome 7 were found in 3 cases, 1 case of isolated del(7q) and 2 cases of -7 and del(7q) with complex abnormalities. These three cases were associated with higher level of percentage blast of BM (p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: This study showed the frequency and pattern of chromosomal abnormalities of MDS patients in upper northern Thailand were different from other populations.

The current review highlights the role of miRNA in management of cancer by altering processes of body at cellular levels. METHODS: A deep research on the literature available till date for miRNA in cancer was conducted using various medical sites like PubMed, MEDLINE from internet and data was collected. The articles were majorly preferred in English language. RESULTS: The development of normal cells into cancerous cells is a multivalent procedure highlighting numerous responsible factors. During the progression of cancer, the role of oncogene and tumor suppressor genes outshines at different levels of tumorogenesis. Metastasis poses highest threat in cancer progression and fabricates obstacles to clinicians and researchers in preventing formation of tumor on secondary sites. The mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induce dissemination and ultimately progression of cancer. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive knowledge of the altered genes and the mechanism by which they induce formation of tumor is essential as they contribute in proliferating cancer at various stages, aggravating clinical symptoms. Hence miRNAs can be efficiently employed as an emerging treatment therapy for cancer.","['Behl, Tapan', 'Kumar, Chanchal', 'Makkar, Rashita', 'Gupta, Amit', 'Sachdeva, Monika']","['Behl T', 'Kumar C', 'Makkar R', 'Gupta A', 'Sachdeva M']","['Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India.', 'Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, University of Delhi, Delhi, India.', 'Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India.', 'Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India.', 'Fatima College of Health Science, AI Ain, UAE.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200301,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Disease Progression', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC7437313,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Leukemia', 'Metastasis', 'Tumor suppressor genes', 'carcinogenic']",2020/03/28 06:00,2020/04/03 06:00,['2020/03/28 06:00'],"['2019/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.3.593 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Mar 1;21(3):593-598. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.3.593.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering that hypoxia is one of the factors limiting the efficiency of organ culture, the aim of this study was to use isolated seminiferous tubules (STs), having more surface and less thickness, in an organotypic culture system in order to improve oxygen diffusion and reduce hypoxia. The mechanically separated STs embedded in agarose or alginate and 1-3-mm(3) testicular tissue fragments of 3 adult mice were separately placed on the flat surface of agarose gel that was half-soaked in the medium. Survival and differentiation of germ cells using PLZF and SCP3 markers, identity of Sertoli cell using GATA4, cell proliferation with the Ki67 marker, and ST integrity using a ST scoring were evaluated up to 36 d at different culture times, each corresponding to the duration of one spermatogenic cycle. We observed a significantly reduced ST integrity in STs embedded in agarose or alginate on day 9 (versus tissue fragments p </= 0.05). There was no difference in the number of PLZF-positive cells between groups, but the number of SCP3 (in all-time points) and GATA4-positive cells was significantly higher in the culture of embedded STs. Although embedding STs can be useful for the progress of in vitro spermatogenesis, it makes them sensitive to degeneration. Further improvements are required to modify the air-liquid interface method to maintain ST integrity.","['Gholami, Keykavos', 'Vermeulen, Maxime', 'Del Vento, Federico', 'de Michele, Francesca', 'Giudice, Maria Grazia', 'Wyns, Christine']","['Gholami K', 'Vermeulen M', 'Del Vento F', 'de Michele F', 'Giudice MG', 'Wyns C']","['Gynecology-Andrology Research Unit, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Medical School, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 1200, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Gametogenesis Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.', 'Gynecology-Andrology Research Unit, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Medical School, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 1200, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Gynecology-Andrology Research Unit, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Medical School, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 1200, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Gynecology-Andrology Research Unit, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Medical School, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 1200, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Gynecology-Andrology Research Unit, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Medical School, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 1200, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Gynecology-Andrology Research Unit, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Medical School, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 1200, Brussels, Belgium. christine.wyns@uclouvain.be.', 'Department of Gynecology-Andrology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Avenue Hippocrate 10, 1200, Brussels, Belgium. christine.wyns@uclouvain.be.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6581-5003'],['eng'],['456723/Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc'],['Journal Article'],20200324,Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Management of leukostasis requires time-sensitive diagnostics and therapeutics, and leukapheresis remains a mainstay of treatment in select patients. Leukapheresis requires coordination of multi-disciplinary resources, which can prove challenging in the emergency department setting, and delays in treatment due to the complexity and coordination required are common. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of utilization of an emergency department-ICU and a multidisciplinary care pathway on outcomes of critically ill leukostasis patients presenting to the emergency department. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Single large academic medical center in the United States. Patients: Adult emergency department patients with signs and symptoms of leukostasis requiring emergent leukapheresis from 2012-2019. Interventions: Implementation of a hybrid emergency department-ICU setting (emergency critical care center) and a multidisciplinary care pathway with members from Emergency Medicine, Hematology, Blood Bank, and Clinical Pathology. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 70 patients were identified and included for analysis: 14 preemergency critical care center; 32 postemergency critical care center, premultidisciplinary care pathway; and 24 postemergency critical care center, postmultidisciplinary care pathway. A statistically significant reduction in the time from emergency department presentation to initiation of leukapheresis was observed from preemergency critical care center to postemergency critical care center, premultidisciplinary care pathway and postemergency critical care center, postmultidisciplinary care pathway (11.5 vs 7.9 vs 7.7 hr; p = 0.004). Statistically significant reductions in in-hospital mortality were observed from preemergency critical care center to postemergency critical care center, premultidisciplinary care pathway and postemergency critical care center, postmultidisciplinary care pathway (64.3% vs 21.9% vs 25.0%; p = 0.01). A trend toward decreased inpatient ICU utilization was observed, although was not statistically significant (35.7% vs 12.5% vs 25.0%; p = 0.14.). Conclusions and Relevance: Implementation of a multidisciplinary care pathway via use of an emergency department-ICU for critically ill patients with leukostasis was associated with statistically significant reductions in time to leukapheresis and in-hospital mortality. These findings suggest an emergency department-ICU model may allow for maximal resource and care coordination at the point of contact with critically ill patients and improved clinical outcomes.","['Haas, Nathan L', 'Nafday, Abhinav', 'Cranford, James A', 'Yentz, Sarah E', 'Bixby, Dale L', 'Bassin, Benjamin S']","['Haas NL', 'Nafday A', 'Cranford JA', 'Yentz SE', 'Bixby DL', 'Bassin BS']","['Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Division of Critical Care, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Division of Critical Care, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200224,United States,Crit Care Explor,Critical care explorations,101746347,,,,PMC7069592,,['NOTNLM'],"['blast crisis', 'emergency department', 'emergency department-intensive care unit', 'leukapheresis', 'leukemia', 'leukostasis']",2020/03/27 06:00,2020/03/27 06:01,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCE.0000000000000084 [doi]'],epublish,Crit Care Explor. 2020 Feb 24;2(2):e0084. doi: 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000084. eCollection 2020 Feb.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Our pre-clinical studies showed GSK3 inhibition leads to sensitization of AML cells to tretinoin-mediated differentiation. We conducted a phase I trial of lithium, a GSK3 inhibitor, plus tretinoin for relapsed, refractory non-promyelocytic AML. Nine patients with median (range) age 65 (42-82) years were enrolled. All subjects had relapsed leukemia after prior therapy, with a median (range) of 3 (1-3) prior therapies. Oral lithium carbonate 300 mg was given 2-3 times daily and adjusted to meet target serum concentration (0.6 to 1.0 mmol/L); tretinoin 22.5 or 45 mg/m(2)/day (two equally divided doses) was administered orally on days 1-7 and 15-21 of a 28-day cycle. Four patients attained disease stability with no increase in circulating blasts for >/=4 weeks. Median (range) survival was 106 days (60-502). Target serum lithium concentration was achieved in all patients and correlated with GSK3 inhibition in leukemic cells. Immunophenotypic changes associated with myeloid differentiation were observed in five patients. The combination treatment led to a reduction in the CD34+ CD38- AML stem cell population both in vivo and in vitro. The combination of lithium and tretinoin is well-tolerated, induces differentiation of leukemic cells, and may target AML stem cells, but has limited clinical activity in the absence of other antileukemic agents. The results of this clinical trial suggest GSK3 inhibition can result in AML cell differentiation and may be a novel therapeutic strategy in this disease, particularly in combination with other antileukemic agents. Lithium is a weak GSK3 inhibitor and future strategies in AML treatment will probably require more potent agents targeting this pathway or combinations with other antileukemic agents.

METHODS: In the present study, CD49d expression was analyzed by multi-color flow cytometry in 98 newly diagnosed and untreated CLL patients at the hematopathology ward. The patients were divided into two subgroups according to CD49d expression (30% cut off) and the association of this marker with the patients' clinicopathological properties were evaluated. RESULTS: In this study, CD49d expression exhibited significant association with the Rai stage of the disease (P<0.0001), CD38 status (P<0.0001), hemoglobin level (P=0.0006), and platelet count (P=0.0016). The CD49d-positive patients presented in higher stages in comparison with CD49d-negative patients. Although only 1% of the CD49d-negative patients were CD38-positive, this proportion for CD49d-positive group was 69%. However, no significant correlation was observed between CD49d expression and patients' age (P=0.2031), gender (P=0.8119), and absolute lymphocytes count (P=0.1073).

The tax (transactivator from the X-gene region) and HBZ (HTLV-1 bZIP factor) genes of HTLV-1 play crucial roles in the development of ATL. The process and mechanism by which HTLV-1-infected T cells acquire malignancy and develop ATL remain to be elucidated. Constitutive expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha-chain (IL-2Ralpha/CD25), induced by the tax and HBZ genes of HTLV-1, on ATL cells implicates the involvement of IL-2/IL-2R pathway in the growth and development of ATL cells in vivo. However, the leukemic cells in the majority of ATL patients appeared unresponsive to IL-2, raising controversies on the role of this pathway for the growth of ATL cells in vivo. Here, we report the establishment of 32 IL-2-dependent T-cell lines infected with HTLV-1 from 26 ATL patients, including eight leukemic cell lines derived from five ATL patients, while no T-cell lines were established without IL-2. We have shown that the IL-2-dependent ATL cell lines evolved into IL-2-independent/-unresponsive growth phase, resembling ATL cells in vivo. Moreover, the IL-2-dependent non-leukemic T-cell lines infected with HTLV-1 acquired IL-2-independency and turned into tumor-producing cancer cells as with the ATL cell lines. HTLV-1-infected T cells in vivo could survive and proliferate depending on IL-2 that was produced in vivo by the HTLV-1-infected T cells of ATL patients and patients with HTLV-1-associated diseases and, acts as a physiological molecule to regulate T-cell growth. These results suggest that ATL cells develop among the HTLV-1-infected T cells growing dependently on IL-2 and that most of the circulating ATL cells progressed to become less responsive to IL-2, acquiring the ability to proliferate without IL-2.","['Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Tanabe-Shibuya, Junko', 'Miyazato, Paola', 'Masutani, Hiroshi', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Usami, Kazumasa', 'Shimizu, Akira', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Maeda M', 'Tanabe-Shibuya J', 'Miyazato P', 'Masutani H', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Usami K', 'Shimizu A', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Center for AIDS Research, School of Medicine, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Infection and Prevention, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Tenri Health Care University, Tenri, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Institute for Advancement for Clinical and Translational Science, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Taigenkai Hospital, Ichinomiya, Japan.', 'Institute for Advancement for Clinical and Translational Science, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200306,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC7067701,,['NOTNLM'],"['HBZ', 'IL-2/IL-15/IL-2R', 'Tax', 'adult T-cell leukemia', 'growth progression', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1', 'p53']",2020/03/27 06:00,2020/03/27 06:01,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2019/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2020.00356 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 Mar 6;11:356. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00356. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Maeda, Tanabe-Shibuya, Miyazato, Masutani, Yasunaga, Usami,', 'Shimizu and Matsuoka.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past few years, multiple markers have been discovered in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Among these, miRNAs seem to have important roles in the pathogenesis of CLL. The development and validation of miRNA-expression patterns as biomarkers should have a significant impact in cancer diagnosis, therapeutic success, and increasing the life expectancy of patients. In this study, to specify the utility of circulatory miRNA expression as noninvasive and useful biomarkers for CLL, we analyzed the dysregulation of seven miRNAs: miR30d, miR25-3p, miR19a-3p, miR133b, miR451a, miR145, and miR144 in CLL-patient sera. Methods: Thirty untreated patients with flow-cytometry confirmation of CLL were chosen. Serum samples were collected from 30 newly diagnosed CLL patients. Fifteen healthy samples were taken for comparison as controls. RNA was extracted using Trizol. RNA from CLL patient specimens was compared to controls with real-time PCR. Results: Seven miRNAs were differently expressed between CLL and normal specimens using the comparative 2(-DeltaDelta)Ct method. miRNAs 133b, 25-3p, 451a, 145, 19a-3p, and 144 were overexpressed in sera obtained from CLL patients, and miRNA-30d was underexpressed in patient samples. Among these seven miRNAs, miR19a-3p and miR25-3p showed the most deregulation in CLL patients. Conclusion: Real-time PCR is an applied means to perform high-throughput investigation of serum-RNA samples. We assessed the expression of seven miRNAs in CLL patients by this method. The results demonstrated that the use of miRNA-expression profiling may have an impressive role in the diagnosis of CLL. In addition, miRNA 19a-3p and 25-3p are known oncogenes with therapeutic and potential biomarkers.","['Farzadfard, Ehsan', 'Kalantari, Tahereh', 'Tamaddon, Gholamhossein']","['Farzadfard E', 'Kalantari T', 'Tamaddon G']","['School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8158-6004'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200312,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,PMC7075349,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'circulatory microRNAs', 'noncoding RNA', 'real-time PCR']",2020/03/27 06:00,2020/03/27 06:01,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S230842 [doi]', '230842 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2020 Mar 12;11:97-102. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S230842. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Farzadfard et al.'],,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Also B-cell survival and proliferation is unaffected in the absence of CD20. On the contrary, we found a strong defect in actin cytoskeleton polymerization and, consequently, defective cell adhesion and migration in response to homeostatic chemokines SDF1alpha, CCL19 and CCL21.

In mammals, mitophagy is mediated by BNIP3L (also known as NIX) that is a dual regulator of mitochondrial turnover and programmed cell death pathways. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with deficiency of BNIP3L are more sensitive to mitochondria-targeting drugs. But small molecular inhibitors for BNIP3L are currently not available. Some immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) have been proved by FDA for hematologic malignancies, however, the underlining molecular mechanisms are still elusive, which hindered the applications of BNIP3L inhibition for AML treatment. In this study we carried out MS-based quantitative proteomics analysis to identify the potential neosubstrates of a novel thalidomide derivative CC-885 in A549 cells. In total, we quantified 5029 proteins with 36 downregulated in CRBN(+/+) cell after CC-885 administration. Bioinformatic analysis showed that macromitophagy pathway was enriched in the negative pathway after CC-885 treatment. We further found that CC-885 caused both dose- and time-dependent degradation of BNIP3L in CRBN(+/+), but not CRBN(-/-) cell. Thus, our data uncover a novel role of CC-885 in the regulation of mitophagy by targeting BNIP3L for CRL4CRBN E3 ligase-dependent ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that CC-885 could be used as a selective BNIP3L degradator for the further investigation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CC-885 could enhance AML cell sensitivity to the mitochondria-targeting drug rotenone, suggesting that combining CC-885 and mitochondria-targeting drugs may be a therapeutic strategy for AML patients.","['Hao, Bing-Bing', 'Li, Xiao-Jing', 'Jia, Xing-Long', 'Wang, Yu-Xing', 'Zhai, Lin-Hui', 'Li, Duan-Zhuo', 'Liu, Jie', 'Zhang, Die', 'Chen, Yu-Lu', 'Xu,

In our previous study, a 3',5'-diprenylated chalcone, (E)-1-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3,5-diprenyl) phenyl-3-(3-pyridinyl)-propene-1-one (C10), was identified as a novel anti-prostate cancer (PCa) agent. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of C10 on the growth, metastasis, and invasion of PC3 cells in vitro. Our results show that C10 exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on proliferation and metastasis of PC3 cells via several cellular and flow cytometric analyses. Further mechanism studies revealed that C10 likely serves as an Fli-1 agonist for regulating the expression of Fli-1 target genes including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P110), murine double minute2 (MDM2), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1), and globin transcription factor-1 (Gata-1) as well as the phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated protein kinases 1 (ERK1). Further, we confirmed that C10 can regulate the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor 1 (VEGF-1), transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), p53, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) genes associated with tumor apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Thus, C10 exhibits stronger anticancer activity with novel molecular targets and regulatory molecular mechanisms, indicating its great potency for development as a novel targeted anticancer drug.","['Ma, Youfen', 'Xu, Bixue', 'Yu, Jia', 'Huang, Lirong', 'Zeng, Xiaoping', 'Shen, Xiangchun', 'Ren, Chunyan', 'Ben-David, Yaacov', 'Luo, Heng']","['Ma Y', 'Xu B', 'Yu J', 'Huang L', 'Zeng X', 'Shen X', 'Ren C', 'Ben-David Y', 'Luo H']","['State key laboratory of functions and applications of medicinal plants, Guizhou medical university, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'College of pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550029, China.', 'State key laboratory of functions and applications of medicinal plants, Guizhou medical university, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'State key laboratory of functions and applications of medicinal plants, Guizhou medical university, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'College of Food and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Guizhou Institute of Technology, Guiyang 550003, China.', 'State key laboratory of functions and applications of medicinal plants, Guizhou medical university, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'State key laboratory of functions and applications of medicinal plants, Guizhou medical university, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'College of pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550029, China.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'State key laboratory of functions and applications of medicinal plants, Guizhou medical university, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'State key laboratory of functions and applications of medicinal plants, Guizhou medical university, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3913-2479', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3418-5739']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200323,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Chalcones)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chalcones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC7139342,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fli-1 agonist', 'apoptosis', 'chalcone', 'invasion', 'migration', 'prostate cancer']",2020/03/27 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21062216 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21062216 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Mar 23;21(6). pii: ijms21062216. doi: 10.3390/ijms21062216.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Communication with other cell types is a vital prerequisite for the normal functions of the immune system, while disturbances in this communication support the development and progression of neoplastic disease. Integrins such as the integrin very late antigen-4 (VLA-4; CD49d/CD29) control the localization of healthy as well as malignant B cells within the tissue, and thus determine the patterns of organ infiltration. Malignant B cells retain some key characteristics of their normal counterparts, with B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and integrin-mediated adhesion being essential mediators of tumor cell homing, survival and proliferation. It is thus not surprising that targeting the BCR pathway using small molecule inhibitors has proved highly effective in the treatment of B cell malignancies. Attenuation of BCR-dependent lymphoma-microenvironment interactions was, in this regard, described as a main mechanism critically contributing to the efficacy of these agents. Here, we review the contribution of VLA-4 to normal B cell differentiation on the one hand, and to the pathophysiology of B cell malignancies on the other hand. We describe its impact as a prognostic marker, its interplay with BCR signaling and its predictive role for novel BCR-targeting therapies, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and beyond.","['Harzschel, Andrea', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Hartmann, Tanja Nicole']","['Harzschel A', 'Zucchetto A', 'Gattei V', 'Hartmann TN']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO) IRCCS, 33081 Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO) IRCCS, 33081 Aviano, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0377-7179'],['eng'],"['HA 8151/2-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'N.A./Forschungskommission Freiburg', 'IG-21687/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'PE 2016-02362756/Ministero della Salute, Rome, Italy']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200323,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cellular Microenvironment/genetics', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Integrins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7139737,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell differentiation', 'B cell receptor', ""Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'CD49d', 'CLL', 'adhesion', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'integrin', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'therapy', 'tumor microenvironment']",2020/03/27 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2020/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21062206 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21062206 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Mar 23;21(6). pii: ijms21062206. doi: 10.3390/ijms21062206.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about its cytotoxic effects on solid tumor cells. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying econazole-induced toxicity in vitro and evaluated its regulatory effect on the metastasis of gastric cancer cells. Using the gastric cancer cell lines AGS and SNU1 expressing wild-type p53 we demonstrated that econazole could significantly reduce cell viability and colony-forming (tumorigenesis) ability. Econazole induced G0/G1 phase arrest, promoted apoptosis, and effectively blocked proliferation- and survival-related signal transduction pathways in gastric cancer cells. In addition, econazole inhibited the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, which degrade the extracellular matrix and basement membrane. Econazole also effectively inhibited the metastasis of gastric cancer cells, as confirmed from cell invasion and wound healing assays. The protein level of p53 was significantly elevated after econazole treatment of AGS and SNU1 cells. However, apoptosis was blocked in econazole-treated cells exposed to a p53-specific small-interfering RNA to eliminate p53 expression. These results provide evidence that econazole could be repurposed to induce gastric cancer cell death and inhibit cancer invasion.","['Choi, Eun Kyoung', 'Park, Eun Jung', 'Phan, Tien Thuy', 'Kim, Hea Dong', 'Hoe, Kwang-Lae', 'Kim, Dong-Uk']","['Choi EK', 'Park EJ', 'Phan TT', 'Kim HD', 'Hoe KL', 'Kim DU']","['Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Functional Genomics, KRIBB School of Biosciences, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea.', 'Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of New Drug Development, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 34134, Republic of Korea.', 'Rare Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Biomol Ther (Seoul),Biomolecules & therapeutics,101472832,,,,PMC7327138,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Econazole', 'Gastric cancer', 'Invasion', 'Migration', 'p53']",2020/03/27 06:00,2020/03/27 06:01,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2019/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:01 [medline]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['biomolther.2019.201 [pii]', '10.4062/biomolther.2019.201 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2020 Jul 1;28(4):370-379. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2019.201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence has proved that TET2 mutation is associated with leukemogenesis, drug response, and prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, few studies revealed the TETs expression and its clinical significance in AML. We conducted a detailed expression and prognosis analysis of TETs expression in human AML cell lines and patients by using public databases. We observed that TETs expression especially TET2 and TET3 was closely associated with AML among various human cancers. TET1 expression was significantly reduced in AML patients, whereas TET2 and TET3 expression was significantly increased. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that only TET3 expression was associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) among both total AML as well as non-M3 AML, and was confirmed by another independent cohort. Moreover, Cox regression analysis revealed that TET3 expression may act as an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS in total AML. Interestingly, patients that received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) did not show significantly longer OS and DFS than those who did not receive HSCT in TET3 high-expressed groups; whereas, in TET3 low-expressed groups, patients that accepted HSCT showed significantly longer OS and DFS than those who did not accept HSCT. By bioinformatics analysis, TET3 expression was found positively correlated with tumor suppressor gene including CDKN2B, ZIC2, miR-196a, and negatively correlated with oncogenes such as PAX2 and IL2RA. Our study demonstrated that TETs showed significant expression differences in AML, and TET3 expression acted as a potential prognostic biomarker in AML, which may guide treatment choice between chemotherapy and HSCT.","['Zhang, Tingjuan', 'Zhao, Yangli', 'Zhao, Yangjing', 'Zhou, Jingdong']","['Zhang T', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhou J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Medical School, Nanjing Medical University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Medical School, Nanjing Medical University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Bioinformatics, School of Biomedical Engineering and Informatics, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Immunology, Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Medical School, Nanjing Medical University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200325,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.- (TET3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC7138570,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*HSCT', '*TET', '*expression', '*prognosis']",2020/03/27 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2019/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.18632/aging.102928 [doi]', '102928 [pii]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Mar 25;12(6):5031-5047. doi: 10.18632/aging.102928.

Extended follow-up up to 8 years is described, representing the longest follow-up for single-agent ibrutinib, or any BTK inhibitor, to date. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Phase Ib/II PCYC-1102 (NCT01105247) and extension study PCYC-1103 (NCT01109069) included patients receiving single-agent ibrutinib in first-line or relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL. RESULTS: Overall response rate was 89%, with similar rates in first-line (87%; complete response, 35%) and relapsed/refractory settings (89%; 10%). Estimated 7-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 83% in first-line and 34% in relapsed/refractory settings. Forty-one patients had CLL progression (n = 11 with Richter's transformation). Median PFS was not reached with first-line ibrutinib. In relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL, median PFS was 52 months overall, 26 months in patients with chromosome 17p deletion, 51 months with 11q deletion, not reached with trisomy 12 or 13q deletion, and 88 months in patients without these cytogenetic abnormalities. Estimated 7-year overall survival rates were 84% in first-line and 55% in relapsed/refractory settings.

However, this goal is thwarted by the diversity and stochasticity of evolutionary trajectories that drive uncertainty in the clinic. Although biophysical models can qualitatively predict whether a mutation causes resistance, they cannot quantitatively predict the relative abundance of resistance mutations in patient populations. We present stochastic, first-principle models that are parameterized on a large in vitro dataset and that accurately predict the epidemiological abundance of resistance mutations across multiple leukemia clinical trials. The ability to forecast resistance variants requires an understanding of their underlying mutation biases. Beyond leukemia, a meta-analysis across prostate cancer, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors suggests that resistance evolution in the adjuvant setting is influenced by mutational bias. Our analysis establishes a principle for rational drug design: when evolution favors the most probable mutant, so should drug design.","['Leighow, Scott M', 'Liu, Chuan', 'Inam, Haider', 'Zhao, Boyang', 'Pritchard, Justin R']","['Leighow SM', 'Liu C', 'Inam H', 'Zhao B', 'Pritchard JR']","['The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Park, PA 16802, USA.', 'The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Park, PA 16802, USA; Department of Oncology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200080, China.', 'The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Park, PA 16802, USA.', 'The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Park, PA 16802, USA.', 'The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Park, PA 16802, USA; The Huck Institute for the Life Sciences, Center for Resistance Evolution, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.

However, monoallelic deletion of Pten gene failed to induce high prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) until Pten(+/-) mice aged or fed a high-calorie diet. Because CEACAM1, a cell adhesion molecule with a potential tumor suppression activity, is induced in Pten(+/-) prostates, the study aimed at examining whether the rise of CEACAM1 limited neoplastic progression in Pten(+/-) prostates. METHODS: Pten(+/-) were crossbred with Cc1(-/-) mice harboring a null deletion of Ceacam1 gene to produce Pten(+/-)/Cc1(-/-) double mutants. Prostates from 7-month old male mice were analyzed histologically and biochemically for PIN progression. RESULTS: Deleting Ceacam1 in Pten(+/-) mice caused an early development of high-grade PIN in parallel to hyperactivation of PI3 kinase/Akt and Ras/MAP kinase pathways, with an increase in cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and inflammation relative to Pten(+/-) and Cc1(-/-) individual mutants. It also caused a remarkable increase in lipogenesis in prostate despite maintaining insulin sensitivity. Concomitant Ceacam1 deletion with Pten(+/-) activated the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways to suppress Irf-8 transcription that in turn, led to a decrease in the expression level of promyelocytic leukemia gene, a well characterized tumor suppressor in prostate. CONCLUSIONS: Ceacam1 deletion accelerated high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia in Pten haploinsufficient mice while preserving insulin sensitivity. This demonstrated that the combined loss of Ceacam1 and Pten advanced prostate cancer by increasing lipogenesis and modifying the STAT3-dependent inflammatory microenvironment of prostate.","['Liu, Jehnan', 'Muturi, Harrison T', 'Khuder, Saja S', 'Helal, Raghd Abu', 'Ghadieh, Hilda E', 'Ramakrishnan, Sadeesh K', 'Kaw, Meenakshi K', 'Lester, Sumona Ghosh', 'Al-Khudhair, Ahmed', 'Conran, Philip B', 'Chin, Khew-Voon', 'Gatto-Weis, Cara', 'Najjar, Sonia M']","['Liu J', 'Muturi HT', 'Khuder SS', 'Helal RA', 'Ghadieh HE', 'Ramakrishnan SK', 'Kaw MK', 'Lester SG', 'Al-Khudhair A', 'Conran PB', 'Chin KV', 'Gatto-Weis C', 'Najjar SM']","['Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH 45701, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH 45701, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH 45701, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Medicine, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH, 43614, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Medicine, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH, 43614, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Pathology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA.', 'Center for Diabetes and Endocrine Research, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH 43614, USA; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH 45701, USA; Diabetes Institute, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH, 45701, USA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A propensity score matching (PSM) study was performed. A Cox regression model was used to identify factors associated with responses and outcomes. RESULTS: Four hundred forty-two adults receiving generic imatinib (n = 236) or Glivec (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland; n = 206) were included. There were more patients with rural household registration (P < .001), lower education level (P < .001), divorced or widowed status (P = .009), higher white blood cell counts (P = .019), splenomegaly (P < .001), and longer intervals from diagnosis to imatinib initiation (P = .033) in the generic cohort. During the follow-up, there was no significant difference between the 2 cohorts in the 4-year probabilities of achieving a complete cytogenetic response (97.0% vs. 97.3%; P = .736), major molecular response (87.8% vs. 90.1%; P = .113), and molecular response(4.5) (32.5% vs. 38.8%; P = .186), as well as failure-free survival (77.3% vs. 81.4%; P = .313), progression-free survival (94.4% vs. 95.8%; P = .489), and overall survival (96.8% vs. 98.3%; P = .088). Multivariate analyses showed that the drug type was not associated with responses and outcomes. After the PSM procedure, 177 pairs of patients with comparable baseline characteristics were reanalyzed. Multivariate analyses confirmed that generic or branded imatinib used as first-line therapy was not associated with either responses or outcomes. CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic characteristics might influence the tyrosine kinase inhibitor that patients chose. Generic and branded imatinib as first-line therapy had comparable efficacy and safety in CML-CP patients.","['Dou, Xuelin', 'Qin, Yazhen', 'Lai, Yueyun', 'Shi, Hongxia', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Jiang, Qian']","['Dou X', 'Qin Y', 'Lai Y', 'Shi H', 'Huang X', 'Jiang Q']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; Research Unit of Key Technique for Diagnosis and Treatments of Hematologic Malignancies, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.

Historically, it was difficult to diagnose clinically, as patients present with manifestations shared with other hematologic malignancies or viral infections. It is now clear that JMML is a disease of hyperactive RAS signaling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the bone marrow of 41 Egyptian children with JMML by direct sequencing for mutations in the RAS pathway genes. RESULTS: Mutations were detected in 33 (80%) of 41 patients. We identified 12 (29%) of 41 patients with PTPN11 mutation; 18 (44%) of 41 with RAS mutation; 9 (22%) of 41 with NRAS mutation; 9 (22%) of 41 with KRAS mutation; and 3 (7%) of 41 with CBL mutation. Eleven (92%) of the PTPN11 mutations were detected in exon 3 and 1 (8%) in exon 13. Seven of the NRAS mutations were in exon 2, and 2 were in exon 3. All KRAS mutations were in exon 2. The 3 cases with CBL mutation were homozygous mutations in exon 8. All the mutations detected in PTPN11, NRAS/KRAS, and the CBL genes were previously reported missense mutations in JMML. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that Egyptian children diagnosed with JMML have high frequency of NRAS/KRAS mutations and lower frequency of PTPN11 mutations as compared with previous studies. The concept of mutually exclusive RAS pathway mutations was clearly observed in our patients. All cancer centers in our region should start implementing molecular diagnostic methods before confirming the diagnosis of JMML and before offering hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Hamdy, Nayera', 'Bokhary, Hossam', 'Elsayed, Amr', 'Hozayn, Walaa', 'Soliman, Sonya', 'Salem, Sherine', 'Alsheshtawi, Khaled', 'Abdalla, Amr', 'Hafez, Hanafy', 'Hammad, Mahmoud']","['Hamdy N', 'Bokhary H', 'Elsayed A', 'Hozayn W', 'Soliman S', 'Salem S', 'Alsheshtawi K', 'Abdalla A', 'Hafez H', 'Hammad M']","[""Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Clinical Pathology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt."", ""Department of Clinical Pathology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt; Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Postgraduate Studies for Advanced Science, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt."", 'Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Postgraduate Studies for Advanced Science, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Postgraduate Studies for Advanced Science, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt.', ""Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Clinical Pathology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt."", ""Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Clinical Pathology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt."", ""Department of Clinical Research, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357), Cairo, Egypt.

The most potent compounds had IC50 values of 1-5 muM on two acute leukemia tumor cell lines, i.e. RS4;11 and HL-60. Flow cytometry analysis of several active compounds and detection of caspase activation indicated that they induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. It was also encouraging to observe that these compounds did not have obvious cytotoxicity on normal cells, i.e. IC50 > 50 muM on HEK-293T cells.

METHODS: We studied defined events in 818 adult patients with AML in relation to 60,209 CRP and PA measures. We investigated correlations between CRP and PA levels and daily CRP and PA levels in relation to AML diagnosis, AML relapse, or bacteraemia (all +/-30 days), and death ( horizontal line 30-0 days). RESULTS: On the AML diagnosis date (D0), CRP levels increased with higher WHO performance score (PS), e.g. patients with PS 3/4 had 68.1 mg/L higher CRP compared to patients with PS 0, adjusted for relevant covariates. On D0, the PA level declined with increasing PS, e.g. PS 3/4 had 7.54 g/L lower adjusted PA compared to PS 0. CRP and PA levels were inversely correlated for the PA interval 25-55 g/L (R = - 0.51, p < 10-5), but not for </=24 g/L (R = 0.01, p = 0.57). CRP increases and PA decreases were seen prior to bacteraemia and death, whereas no changes occurred up to AML diagnosis or relapse. CRP increases and PA decreases were also found frequently in individuals, unrelated to a pre-specified event. CONCLUSIONS: PA decrease is an important biomarker for imminent bacteraemia in adult patients with AML.","['Gradel, Kim Oren', 'Povoa, Pedro', 'Garvik, Olav Sivertsen', 'Vinholt, Pernille Just', 'Nielsen, Stig Lonberg', 'Jensen, Thoger Gorm', 'Chen, Ming', 'Dessau, Ram Benny', 'Moller, Jens Kjolseth', 'Coia, John Eugenio', 'Ljungdalh, Pernille Sanberg', 'Lassen, Annmarie Touborg', 'Frederiksen, Henrik']","['Gradel KO', 'Povoa P', 'Garvik OS', 'Vinholt PJ', 'Nielsen SL', 'Jensen TG', 'Chen M', 'Dessau RB', 'Moller JK', 'Coia JE', 'Ljungdalh PS', 'Lassen AT', 'Frederiksen H']","['Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Odense University Hospital, and Research Unit of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Klovervaenget 30, Entrance 216, ground floor, 5000, Odense C, Denmark. kim.gradel@rsyd.dk.', 'OPEN - Odense Patient Data Exploratory Network, Odense University Hospital, J.B.

MCL represents only <1% cases of SM and this is the reason why there are no specific clinical trials to better explore this disease. As a consequence, MCL is treated and grouped within other forms of SM, being all KIT-driven diseases; however, its KIT dysregulation leads to uncontrolled activation of mast cells (MCs), which correlates with forms of myeloid acute leukemia (AML). AREAS COVERED: Different therapeutic approaches can be followed in the treatment of MCL. The authors look at both symptomatic therapies along with other approaches including targeted therapy. Further, the authors provide their expert opinion. EXPERT OPINION: In the scenario of mast cell leukemia treatment, the key approach to achieve clinical results is, more than other similar pathologies, personalizing the therapy. It could be interesting or desirable to introduce for instance KIT mutant forms as minor criteria for the diagnosis of advanced SM, considering the small patient population with MCL and the relatively large panel of activating mutations for KIT and other important proteins involved in MCs' regulation.","['Laforgia, Mariarita', 'Calabro, Concetta', 'Scattone, Anna', 'Laface, Carmelo', 'Porcelli, Mariangela', 'Gadaleta, Cosmo Damiano', 'Nardulli, Patrizia', 'Ranieri, Girolamo']","['Laforgia M', 'Calabro C', 'Scattone A', 'Laface C', 'Porcelli M', 'Gadaleta CD', 'Nardulli P', 'Ranieri G']","['S.C.

Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) enzymes occur in up to 65% of chondrosarcomas, resulting in accumulation of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Ivosidenib (AG-120) is a selective inhibitor of mutant IDH1 approved in the United States for specific cases of acute myeloid leukemia. We report outcomes of patients with advanced chondrosarcoma in an ongoing study exploring ivosidenib treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase I multicenter open-label dose-escalation and expansion study of ivosidenib monotherapy enrolled patients with mutant IDH1 advanced solid tumors, including chondrosarcoma. Ivosidenib was administered orally (100 mg twice daily to 1,200 mg once daily) in continuous 28-day cycles. Responses were assessed every other cycle using RECIST (version 1.1). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (escalation, n = 12; expansion, n = 9) with advanced chondrosarcoma received ivosidenib (women, n = 8; median age, 55 years; range, 30-88 years; 11 had received prior systemic therapy). Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were mostly grade 1 or 2. Twelve patients experienced grade >/= 3 AEs; only one event was judged treatment related (hypophosphatemia, n = 1). Plasma 2-HG levels decreased substantially in all patients (range, 14%-94.2%), to levels seen in healthy individuals. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.6 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 7.4 months); the PFS rate at 6 months was 39.5%. Eleven (52%) of 21 patients experienced stable disease. CONCLUSION: In patients with chondrosarcoma, ivosidenib showed minimal toxicity, substantial 2-HG reduction, and durable disease control. Future studies of ivosidenib monotherapy or rational combination approaches should be considered in patients with advanced mutant IDH1 chondrosarcoma.","['Tap, William D', 'Villalobos, Victor M', 'Cote, Gregory M', 'Burris, Howard', 'Janku, Filip', 'Mir, Olivier', 'Beeram, Murali', 'Wagner, Andrew J', 'Jiang, Liewen', 'Wu, Bin', 'Choe, Sung', 'Yen, Katharine', 'Gliser, Camelia', 'Fan, Bin', 'Agresta, Sam', 'Pandya, Shuchi S', 'Trent, Jonathan C']","['Tap WD', 'Villalobos VM', 'Cote GM', 'Burris H', 'Janku F', 'Mir O', 'Beeram M', 'Wagner AJ', 'Jiang L', 'Wu B', 'Choe S', 'Yen K', 'Gliser C', 'Fan B', 'Agresta S', 'Pandya SS', 'Trent JC']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Center for Sarcoma and Connective Tissue Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA.', 'Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, TN.', 'Phase I Clinical Trials Program, Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Ambulatory Care, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France.', 'START Center for Cancer Care, San Antonio, TX.', 'Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL.']",,['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA240139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200324,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'Q2PCN8MAM6 (ivosidenib)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chondrosarcoma/*drug therapy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyridines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",PMC7238491,,,,2020/03/27 06:00,2021/01/30 06:00,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.02492 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 May 20;38(15):1693-1701. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.02492.

The review describes the clinical case of a patient with CLL and RS diagnosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdominal cavity detected numerous normodense areas in the liver. Simultaneously, ultrasound examination (USG) of the thyroid revealed the presence of a solid hypoechogenic lump. The material sampled from closed biopsies of liver and thyroid in both cases allowed the diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The liver and the thyroid are particularly rare locations of RS. However, those cases allowed the conclusion that RS may occur even in a very unexpected and less probable location.","['Wasik-Szczepanek, Ewa', 'Szymczyk, Agnieszka', 'Szczepanek, Dariusz', 'Grywalska, Ewelina', 'Szumilo, Justyna', 'Trojanowski, Piotr', 'Czabak, Olga', 'Hus, Marek']","['Wasik-Szczepanek E', 'Szymczyk A', 'Szczepanek D', 'Grywalska E', 'Szumilo J', 'Trojanowski P', 'Czabak O', 'Hus M']","['Chair and Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Transplantology, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Neurosurgery and Paediatric Neurosurgery, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Clinical Pathomorphology, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Otolaryngology and Laryngological Oncology, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190409,Poland,Ann Agric Environ Med,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,9500166,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography']",,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Richter's syndrome"", 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'liver', 'thyroid']",2020/03/27 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2020/03/27 06:00'],"['2020/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['106041 [pii]', '10.26444/aaem/106041 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Agric Environ Med. 2020 Mar 17;27(1):160-164. doi: 10.26444/aaem/106041.

Giltertinib (formerly known as ASP2215) is a novel compound that entered the field late, but moved through the developmental process with remarkable speed. In many ways, this drug's rapid development was facilitated by the large body of knowledge gained over the years from efforts to develop other FLT3 inhibitors. Single-agent gilteritinib, a potent and selective oral FLT3 inhibitor, improved the survival of patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML compared with standard chemotherapy. This continues to validate the approach of targeting FLT3 itself and establishes a new backbone for testing combination regimens. This review will frame the preclinical and clinical development of gilteritinib in the context of the lessons learned from its predecessors.","['Levis, Mark', 'Perl, Alexander E']","['Levis M', 'Perl AE']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; and.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Pyrazines', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC7094008,,,,2020/03/26 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/26 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31440-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000174 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 24;4(6):1178-1191. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000174.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown to negatively regulate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling through nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in lung epithelial cells. Here we show that RUNX1 regulates TLR1/2 and TLR4 signaling and inflammatory cytokine production by neutrophils. Hematopoietic-specific RUNX1 loss increased the production of proinflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), by bone marrow neutrophils in response to TLR1/2 and TLR4 agonists. Hematopoietic RUNX1 loss also resulted in profound damage to the lung parenchyma following inhalation of the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, neutrophils with neutrophil-specific RUNX1 loss lacked the inflammatory phenotype caused by pan-hematopoietic RUNX1 loss, indicating that dysregulated TLR4 signaling is not due to loss of RUNX1 in neutrophils per se. Rather, single-cell RNA sequencing indicates the dysregulation originates in a neutrophil precursor. Enhanced inflammatory cytokine production by neutrophils following pan-hematopoietic RUNX1 loss correlated with increased degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB signaling, and RUNX1-deficient neutrophils displayed broad transcriptional upregulation of many of the core components of the TLR4 signaling pathway. Hence, early, pan-hematopoietic RUNX1 loss de-represses an innate immune signaling transcriptional program that is maintained in terminally differentiated neutrophils, resulting in their hyperinflammatory state. We hypothesize that inflammatory cytokine production by neutrophils may contribute to leukemia associated with inherited RUNX1 mutations.","['Bellissimo, Dana C', 'Chen, Chia-Hui', 'Zhu, Qin', 'Bagga, Sumedha', 'Lee, Chung-Tsai', 'He, Bing', 'Wertheim, Gerald B', 'Jordan, Martha', 'Tan, Kai', 'Worthen, G Scott', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Speck, Nancy A']","['Bellissimo DC', 'Chen CH', 'Zhu Q', 'Bagga S', 'Lee CT', 'He B', 'Wertheim GB', 'Jordan M', 'Tan K', 'Worthen GS', 'Gilliland DG', 'Speck NA']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Graduate Group in Genomics and Computational Biology.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, and.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Graduate Group in Genomics and Computational Biology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.']",,['eng'],"['T32 HL007439/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI099479/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UG3 TR002198/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL091724/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA196123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['*Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptors']",PMC7094023,,,,2020/03/26 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/26 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31437-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000785 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 24;4(6):1145-1158. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000785.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present the clinical phenotypes and genetic mutations detected in 10 novel RUNX1-mutated FPD-MM families. Genomic analyses on these families detected 2 partial gene deletions, 3 novel mutations, and 5 recurrent mutations as the germline RUNX1 alterations leading to FPD-MM. Combining genomic data from the families reported herein with aggregated published data sets resulted in 130 germline RUNX1 families, which allowed us to investigate whether specific germline mutation characteristics (type, location) could explain the large phenotypic heterogeneity between patients with familial platelet disorder and different HMs. Comparing the somatic mutational signatures between the available familial (n = 35) and published sporadic (n = 137) RUNX1-mutated AML patients showed enrichment for somatic mutations affecting the second RUNX1 allele and GATA2. Conversely, we observed a decreased number of somatic mutations affecting NRAS, SRSF2, and DNMT3A and the collective genes associated with CHIP and epigenetic regulation. This is the largest aggregation and analysis of germline RUNX1 mutations performed to date, providing a unique opportunity to examine the factors underlying phenotypic differences and disease progression from FPD to MM.","['Brown, Anna L', 'Arts, Peer', 'Carmichael, Catherine L', 'Babic, Milena', 'Dobbins, Julia', 'Chong, Chan-Eng', 'Schreiber, Andreas W', 'Feng, Jinghua', 'Phillips,

METHODS: The case-control study was conducted at the Children Hospital, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan, from January to December 2017, and comprised children of either gender aged 2-12 years with recently diagnosed acute lymphocytic or acute myelocytic leukaemia An age and gender matched equal group of healthy children was taken as controls. Dietary-intake data was collected for six food groups, namely raw vegetables, fresh fruits, packed fruit juices, caffeinated drinks, junk foods, and processed/precooked food items. Frequency of the selected food group consumption was summarised in six categories: rarely/never, 1-3 days/week, 4-6 days/week, once daily, twice daily and thrice daily. Data was collected through interviews with the mothers using a pre-designed questionnaire, and was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 90 subjects, 45(50%) were in each of the two groups. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (p>0.05). Consumption of caffeinated drinks and junk food was significantly higher in cases (p=0.001) while controls showed significantly higher consumption of fresh fruits (p=0.0012). No significant difference was noted for consumption of vegetables, packed fruit juices and processed food between the groups (p> 0. 05 ). CONCLUSIONS: Higher consumption of caffeinated drinks and junk food was observed in cases compared to controls.","['Ayub, Aqeela', 'Ahmad, Qazi Mumtaz', 'Javed, Tahir', 'Hayat, Muhammad Zubair', 'Farooq, Muhammad Azhar', 'Anwar, Hafiz Muhammad Zubair', 'Khan, Muhammad Aleem']","['Ayub A', 'Ahmad QM', 'Javed T', 'Hayat MZ', 'Farooq MA', 'Anwar HMZ', 'Khan MA']","['Department of Pediatric Medicine, Children Hospital, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pediatric, Mayo Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'M.

In this study, we generated a new C57BL/6.Rag2nullIl2rgnull (BRG) mouse line with Sirpahuman/human (BRGShuman) mice, in which mouse Sirpa was replaced by human SIRPA encompassing all 8 exons. Macrophages from C57BL/6 mice harboring Sirpahuman/human had a significantly stronger affinity for human CD47 than those harboring SirpaNOD/NOD and did not show detectable phagocytosis against human hematopoietic stem cells. In turn, Sirpahuman/human macrophages had a moderate affinity for mouse CD47, and BRGShuman mice did not exhibit the blood cytopenia that was seen in Sirpa-/- mice. In human to mouse xenograft experiments, BRGShuman mice showed significantly greater engraftment and maintenance of human hematopoiesis with a high level of myeloid reconstitution, as well as improved reconstitution in peripheral tissues, compared with BRG mice harboring SirpaNOD/NOD (BRGSNOD). BRGShuman mice also showed significantly enhanced engraftment and growth of acute myeloid leukemia and subcutaneously transplanted human colon cancer cells compared with BRGSNOD mice.

We assessed immunoglobulin heavy variable chain (IGHV) mutation status, common genomic aberrations, and gene mutations in 421 untreated patients within the CLL14 trial (NCT02242942), comparing obinutuzumab+chlorambucil (GClb) vs obinutuzumab+venetoclax (VenG). The incidences of genomic aberrations considering the hierarchical model were del(17p) 7%, del(11q) 18%, +12 18%, and del(13q) 35%, whereas IGHV was unmutated in 60% of patients. NOTCH1 mutations were most common (23%), followed by SF3B1 (16%), ATM (13%), and TP53 (10%). Although the overall response rate (ORR) for GClb was lower in patients with del(17p), del(11q), mutated TP53, ATM, and BIRC3, none of these parameters reduced complete remission (CR) rate and ORR with VenG. At a median follow-up of 28 months, del(17p) and mutated TP53 were the only abnormalities with an effect on progression-free survival (PFS) for both treatment groups: GClb (hazard ratio [HR], 4.6 [P < .01]; HR, 2.7 [P < .01], respectively) and VenG (HR, 4.4 [P < .01]; HR, 3.1 [P < .01], respectively). No other factors affected outcome with VenG, whereas for GClb del(11q), BIRC3, NOTCH1, and unmutated IGHV were associated with shorter PFS. Multivariable analysis identified del(17p), del(11q), unmutated IGHV, and mutated TP53, BIRC3, and SF3B1 as independent prognostic factors for PFS with GClb, whereas for VenG, only del(17p) was significant.

The etiology of the disease remains unknown. Multiple theories highlight genetic, environmental, and infectious factors that may a role. MS is considered as the main cause of disability in young people. Cladribine, known chemically as (2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine), is a purine analog chemotherapy used for hairy cell leukemia and other B-cell lymphomas. The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cladribine in patients with rapidly evolving or early secondary progressive MS. Methods This observational, single-center, retrospective chart review at the MS Clinic in the Ottawa General Hospital, Ottawa, Canada. A total of 24 patients (median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 4.5) received cladribine (0.07 mg/kg/day) for four consecutive days every six months for >/= 2 cycles with further cycles depending on lymphocyte recovery or disease activity to a maximum of eight cycles from 2005 until 2016 were included. Four patients who were already diagnosed with rapidly evolving or early secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) were induced with cladribine. We evaluated relapse, EDSS, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. Results Out of 24 patients (ages ranging from 30 - 60), 80% were female. Median follow-up time was seven years. The mean relapse rate in the two years before patients were given cladribine was 1.25. Twenty patients had previously received multiple disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) (>/= 2) prior to receiving cladribine. Following cladribine, eight patients suffered 10 relapses (33.3% of the cohort). Annualized relapse rates (ARRs) were reduced from 1.25 to 0.42, which was statistically significant (p-value = 0.002). There was no mean difference in EDSS (p-value = 0.06): 16% deteriorated, 62% did not change, and 12.5% improved. New MRI activity (new T2 or Gad+ lesions) was noted in only seven of 24 patients. Conclusion Parenteral cladribine reduced the relapse rate from 1.25 to 0.42, which was statistically significant (p-value = 0.002). MRI activity in patients with rapidly evolving or early secondary progressive multiple sclerosis had a reasonable safety profile.","['Alshamrani, Foziah', 'Alnajashi, Hind', 'Almuaigel, Mohammed F']","['Alshamrani F', 'Alnajashi H', 'Almuaigel MF']","['Department of Neurology, College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Al Khobar, SAU.', 'Department of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Department of Medical Education, College of Medicine, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, SAU.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200214,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,PMC7077152,,['NOTNLM'],"['cladribine', 'multiple sclerosis (ms)', 'secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (spms)']",2020/03/25 06:00,2020/03/25 06:01,['2020/03/25 06:00'],"['2020/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.6995 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Feb 14;12(2):e6995. doi: 10.7759/cureus.6995.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Alshamrani et al.']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This property cause to impede its usage as chemotherapeutic agent. Therefore, this hypothesis raised that synthesizing biocompatible nanoparticle could assist to prevail this struggle. Methods: Genistein covalently attached on Fe3O4 nanoparticles decorated with carboxymethylated chitosan to fabricate Fe3O4-CMC-genistein in alkaline circumstance. This obtained nanoparticles were evaluated by TEM, DLS, FTIR, XRD and VSM and its anti-cancer effect by growth rate and MTT assays as well as flow cytometer on ALL cancer cell lines. Results: Different evaluations indicated that the drug delivery vehicle had a mean diameter size around 12nm with well bounded components. This system presented high degree of magnetization and superparamagnetic properties as well as good water solubility. In comparison with pure genistein, significant growth inhibition on hematopoietic cancer cells in lower dose of genistein nano-conjugated onto Fe3O4-CMC. It increased long lasting effect of genistein in cancer cells also. Conclusion: This delivery system for genistein could be remarkably promised and futuristic as biocompatible chemotherapeutic agent against hematopoietic malignant cells.","['Ghasemi Goorbandi, Rachel', 'Mohammadi, Mohammad Reza', 'Malekzadeh, Kianoosh']","['Ghasemi Goorbandi R', 'Mohammadi MR', 'Malekzadeh K']","['1Sharif University of Technology, Kish International Campus, Kish Island, Iran.grid.412553.40000 0001 0740 9747', '2Molecular Medicine Research Center, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.grid.412237.10000 0004 0385 452X', '4Department of Medical Genetics; Faculty of Medicine, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.grid.412237.10000 0004 0385 452X', '2Molecular Medicine Research Center, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.grid.412237.10000 0004 0385 452X', '3Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.grid.412553.40000 0001 0740 9747']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200320,England,Biomater Res,Biomaterials research,101650636,,,,PMC7082912,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia lymphoma (ALL)', 'Chitosan', 'Genistein', 'Nano particle delivery system', 'Superparamagnetic Fe3O4']",2020/03/25 06:00,2020/03/25 06:01,['2020/03/25 06:00'],"['2019/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40824-020-00187-2 [doi]', '187 [pii]']",epublish,Biomater Res. 2020 Mar 20;24:9. doi: 10.1186/s40824-020-00187-2. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,"['Competing interestsAll three authors of this article included Rachel Ghasemi', 'Goorbandi, Kianoosh Malekzadeh and Mohammad Reza Mohammadi declare that have no', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluate DNAm levels of the MMP and TIMP gene families in human carotid plaques and blood samples of atherothrombotic stroke patients. METHODS: We profiled the DNAm status of stable and ulcerated atherosclerotic plaques obtained as pair sets from three patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy surgery. We selected 415 CpG sites, mapping into MMPs and TIMPs genes for further study. Secondly, the statistically associated CpG sites were analyzed in blood samples from two separate atherothrombotic stroke cohorts (total sample size = 307), ischemic stroke-cohort 1 (ISC-1): 37 atherothrombotic patients and 6 controls, ischemic stroke-cohort 2 (ISC-2): 80 atherothrombotic patients and 184 controls. DNAm levels from plaque tissue and blood samples were evaluated using a high-density microarray Infinium, HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. RESULTS: Three CpG sites were statistically significantly associated with unstable plaque portions; cg02969624, q-value = 0.035 (TIMP2), and cg04316754, q-value = 0.037 (MMP24) were hypermethylated, while cg24211657 q-value = 0.035 (TIMP2) was hypomethylated. Association of cg04316754 (MMP24) methylation levels with atherothrombotic risk was also observed in blood tissue: ISC-1 p-values = 0.03, ISC-2 p-value = 1.9 x 10(-04). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest different DNAm status of MMP24 between stable and unstable atherothrombotic carotid plaques, and between atherothrombotic stroke and controls in blood samples.","['Gallego-Fabrega, Cristina', 'Cullell, Natalia', 'Soriano-Tarraga, Carolina', 'Carrera, Caty', 'Torres-Aguila, Nuria P', 'Muino, Elena', 'Carcel-Marquez, Jara', 'de Moura, Manuel Castro', 'Fernandez-Sanles, Alba', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Elosua, Roberto', 'Jimenez-Conde, Jordi', 'Roquer, Jaume', 'Montaner, Joan', 'Krupinski, Jerzy', 'Fernandez-Cadenas, Israel']","['Gallego-Fabrega C', 'Cullell N', 'Soriano-Tarraga C', 'Carrera C', 'Torres-Aguila NP', 'Muino E', 'Carcel-Marquez J', 'de Moura MC', 'Fernandez-Sanles A', 'Esteller M', 'Elosua R', 'Jimenez-Conde J', 'Roquer J', 'Montaner J', 'Krupinski J', 'Fernandez-Cadenas I']","['Neurology, Hospital Universitari Mutua de Terrassa/Fundacio Docencia i Recerca MutuaTerrassa, Terrassa, Spain.', 'Stroke Pharmacogenomics and Genetics, Sant Pau Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Neurology, Hospital Universitari Mutua de Terrassa/Fundacio Docencia i Recerca MutuaTerrassa, Terrassa, Spain.', 'Stroke Pharmacogenomics and Genetics, Sant Pau Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Facultat de Medicina, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Neurology, Hospital del Mar, Neurovascular Research Group, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona/DCEXS-Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Stroke Pharmacogenomics and Genetics, Sant Pau Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Neurovascular Research Laboratory, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Research, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Stroke Pharmacogenomics and Genetics, Sant Pau Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Stroke Pharmacogenomics and Genetics, Sant Pau Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Stroke Pharmacogenomics and Genetics, Sant Pau Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics Research Group, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Physiological Sciences II, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics Research Group, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Neurology, Hospital del Mar, Neurovascular Research Group, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona/DCEXS-Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Neurology, Hospital del Mar, Neurovascular Research Group, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona/DCEXS-Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Neurovascular Research Laboratory, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Research, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Neurology, Hospital Universitari Mutua de Terrassa/Fundacio Docencia i Recerca MutuaTerrassa, Terrassa, Spain.', 'Centre for Biomedicine, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK.', 'These authors contributed equally to this work.', 'Stroke Pharmacogenomics and Genetics, Sant Pau Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'These authors contributed equally to this work.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200310,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC7075467,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'atherosclerotic plaque', 'epigenetics', 'matrix metalloproteinases']",2020/03/25 06:00,2020/03/25 06:01,['2020/03/25 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27469 [doi]', '27469 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2020 Mar 10;11(10):905-912. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27469. eCollection 2020 Mar 10.,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that CD19(-) escape is associated with downregulation, but preservation, of targetable expression of CD20 and CD22. Accordingly, we reasoned that broadening the spectrum of CD19CAR T-cells to include both CD20 and CD22 would enable them to target CD19(-) escape BL-ALL while preserving their upfront efficacy. We created a CD19/20/22-targeting CAR T-cell by coexpressing individual CAR molecules on a single T-cell using one tricistronic transgene. CD19/20/22CAR T-cells killed CD19(-) blasts from patients who relapsed after CD19CAR T-cell therapy and CRISPR/Cas9 CD19 knockout primary BL-ALL both in vitro and in an animal model, while CD19CAR T-cells were ineffective. At the subcellular level, CD19/20/22CAR T-cells formed dense immune synapses with target cells that mediated effective cytolytic complex formation, were efficient serial killers in single-cell tracking studies, and were as efficacious as CD19CAR T-cells against primary CD19(+) disease. In conclusion, independent of CD19 expression, CD19/20/22CAR T-cells could be used as salvage or front-line CAR therapy for patients with recalcitrant disease.","['Fousek, Kristen', 'Watanabe, Junji',

Values of the dose rate (cut-points) were chosen at 2 mSv y intervals from 2 to 40 mSv y, and risk estimates were made for 32,988 workers, considering the doses accumulated below and above each cut-point to have different effects. Similarly to that in the previous study for cancer by Sasaki et al., examinations of sensitivity analysis were also carried out for different risk models, lag periods, and impacts of adjusting the monitoring period to find the effect of the dose rate. As a result, emergence of a statistically significant difference between betaL1, which is the ERR for the doses accumulated below the specified cut-point, and betaH1, which is the ERR for that above the specified cut-point, was observed for cut-point of the dose rate of 4, 6, 34, 36, and 38 mSv y. While statistically negative values were estimated for betaL1 (4 and 6 mSv y) and for betaH1 (34, 36, and 38 mSv y), the overall relationship between the ERR and the cut-point of the dose rate was found to be similar to that obtained by the analysis of the mortality for all cancers excluding leukemia.","['Sasaki, Michiya', ""Kudo, Shin'ichi"", 'Furuta, Hiroshige']","['Sasaki M', 'Kudo S', 'Furuta H']","['Radiation Safety Research Center, Nuclear Technology Research Laboratory, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, 2-11-1 Iwado kita, Komae-shi, Tokyo 201-8511, Japan.', 'Institute of Radiation Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Association, 1-9-16 Kajicho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-0044, Japan.', 'Institute of Radiation Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Association, 1-9-16 Kajicho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-0044, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nuclear Reactors/statistics & numerical data', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment', 'Vascular Diseases/etiology/*mortality']",,,,,2020/03/25 06:00,2021/04/16 06:00,['2020/03/25 06:00'],"['2020/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/HP.0000000000001230 [doi]', '00004032-202009000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2020 Sep;119(3):280-288. doi: 10.1097/HP.0000000000001230.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell biological framework for HSPC generation has been rigorously developed, yet recent single-cell transcriptomic analyses have unveiled permutations of the hematopoietic hierarchy that differ considerably from the traditional roadmap. Deploying mutants that disrupt specific steps in hematopoiesis constitutes a powerful strategy for deconvoluting the complex cell biology. It is striking that a single transcription factor, GATA2, is so crucial for HSPC generation and function, and therefore it is instructive to consider mechanisms governing GATA2 expression and activity. The present review focuses on an essential GATA2 enhancer (+9.5) and how +9.5 mutants inform basic and clinical/translational science. RECENT FINDINGS: +9.5 is essential for HSPC generation and function during development and hematopoietic regeneration. Human +9.5 mutations cause immunodeficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia. Qualitatively and quantitatively distinct contributions of +9.5 cis-regulatory elements confer context-dependent enhancer activity. The discovery of +9.5 and its mutant alleles spawned fundamental insights into hematopoiesis, and given its role to suppress blood disease emergence, clinical centers test for mutations in this sequence to diagnose the cause of enigmatic cytopenias. SUMMARY: Multidisciplinary approaches to discover and understand cis-regulatory elements governing expression of key regulators of hematopoiesis unveil biological and mechanistic insights that provide the logic for innovating clinical applications.","['Soukup, Alexandra A', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Soukup AA', 'Bresnick EH']",,,['eng'],"['R01 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*GATA2 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precision Medicine']",PMC7331797,['NIHMS1602416'],,,2020/03/25 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/03/25 06:00'],"['2020/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000576 [doi]', '00062752-202005000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 May;27(3):163-171. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000576.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In diabetes, macrophages display a prolonged inflammatory phenotype preventing tissue repair. TLRs, particularly TLR4, have been shown to regulate myeloid-mediated inflammation in wounds. We examined macrophages isolated from wounds of patients afflicted with diabetes and healthy controls as well as a murine diabetic model demonstrating dynamic expression of TLR4 results in altered metabolic pathways in diabetic macrophages. Further, using a myeloid-specific mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) knockout (Mll1(f/f)Lyz2(Cre+) ), we determined that MLL1 drives Tlr4 expression in diabetic macrophages by regulating levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation on the Tlr4 promoter. Mechanistically, MLL1-mediated epigenetic alterations influence diabetic macrophage responsiveness to TLR4 stimulation and inhibit tissue repair. Pharmacological inhibition of the TLR4 pathway using a small molecule inhibitor (TAK-242) as well as genetic depletion of either Tlr4 (Tlr4(-/-) ) or myeloid-specific Tlr4 (Tlr4(f/f)Lyz2(Cre+)) resulted in improved diabetic wound healing. These results define an important role for MLL1-mediated epigenetic regulation of TLR4 in pathologic diabetic wound repair and suggest a target for therapeutic manipulation.","['Davis, Frank M', 'denDekker, Aaron', 'Kimball, Andrew', 'Joshi, Amrita D', 'El Azzouny, Mahmoud', 'Wolf, Sonya J', 'Obi, Andrea T', 'Lipinski, Jay', 'Gudjonsson, Johann E', 'Xing, Xianying', 'Plazyo, Olesya', 'Audu, Christopher', 'Melvin, William J', 'Singer, Kanakadurga', 'Henke, Peter K', 'Moore, Bethany B', 'Burant, Charles', 'Kunkel, Steven L', 'Gallagher, Katherine A']","['Davis FM', 'denDekker A', 'Kimball A', 'Joshi AD', 'El Azzouny M', 'Wolf SJ', 'Obi AT', 'Lipinski J', 'Gudjonsson JE', 'Xing X', 'Plazyo O', 'Audu C', 'Melvin WJ', 'Singer K', 'Henke PK', 'Moore BB', 'Burant C', 'Kunkel SL', 'Gallagher KA']","['Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA 95051.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; kgallag@med.umich.edu.', 'Department Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5847-8993', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9604-0557', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7613-2366', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0080-0812', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6859-7590', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3241-5919', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8278-3800', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3051-745X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9189-5003']",['eng'],"['U01 DK119083/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL137919/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL076123/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK102357/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL144481/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 DK117545/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK101755/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AR007197/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK124290/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK020572/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI117229/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200323,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*genetics/*immunology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Histones/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/immunology', 'Inflammation Mediators/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/immunology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*genetics/immunology', 'Wound Healing/*genetics/immunology']",PMC7443363,['NIHMS1598810'],,,2020/03/25 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/03/25 06:00'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1901263 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1901263 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 May 1;204(9):2503-2513. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1901263.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CD19-specific CAR-T cells were generated with the use of autologous T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express a CAR molecule containing anti-CD19 scFv derived from the HI19alpha murine monoclonal antibody, human CD8alpha hinge, and human 4-1BB (CD137) and CD3zeta costimulatory signaling transmembrane domains. After the conditioning regimen, which consisted of intravenous fludarabine and intravenous cyclophosphamide, 7 patients with a median age of 9 years (range, 2-10 years) with isolated testicular relapse received a single infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells at a total dose of 5 x 10(6) all T cells per kilogram. RESULTS: All 7 patients achieved complete remission with normal testes. Six patients remained in second remission for 5 to 23 months (median, 14 months), and 1 patient subsequently relapsed in the bone marrow. The probability of event-free survival for all patients at 12 months of follow-up was 83.3% +/- 15.2% (standard error). The treatment was well-tolerated, with grade 1 cytokine-release syndrome developing in 5 patients. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CAR-T cell therapy is a treatment option for patients with testicular relapse.","['Chen, Xiaojuan', 'Wang, Ying', 'Ruan, Min', 'Li, Jun', 'Zhong, Mengjun', 'Li, Zhanqi', 'Liu, Fang', 'Wang, Shuchun', 'Chen, Yumei', 'Liu, Lipeng', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Zhu, Xiaofan', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Chen X', 'Wang Y', 'Ruan M', 'Li J', 'Zhong M', 'Li Z', 'Liu F', 'Wang S', 'Chen Y', 'Liu L', 'Yang JJ', 'Zhu X', 'Wang J', 'Pui CH']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Division of Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.

Overexpression of MCL-1 is associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis; thus, MCL-1 inhibitors are rational therapeutic options for malignancies depending on MCL-1. Several MCL-1 inhibitors have entered clinical trials, including AZD5991, S64315, AMG 176, and AMG 397. A key area of investigation is whether MCL-1 inhibitors will complement the activity of BCL-2 inhibitors, such as venetoclax, and synergistically enhance anti-tumor efficacy when given in combination with other anti-cancer drugs. Another important question is whether a safe therapeutic window can be found for this new class of inhibitors. In summary, inhibition of MCL-1 shows potential as a treatment for hematologic malignancies and clinical evaluation of MCL-1 inhibitors is currently underway.","['Wei, Andrew H', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Spencer, Andrew', 'Rosenberg, Aaron Seth', 'Siegel, David', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Caenepeel, Sean', 'Hughes, Paul', 'McIver, Zach', 'Mezzi, Khalid', 'Morrow, Phuong Khanh', 'Stein, Anthony']","['Wei AH', 'Roberts AW', 'Spencer A', 'Rosenberg AS', 'Siegel D', 'Walter RB', 'Caenepeel S', 'Hughes P', 'McIver Z', 'Mezzi K', 'Morrow PK', 'Stein A']","['Alfred Hospital and Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

We present here data after two years of existence. METHODS: All cases of cancers or malignant hematological diseases (ICD-10 codes C00 to C97 and D37 to D48) seen between March 1, 2016, and March 1, 2018, have been identified. We present sociodemographic data, occupational exposures, occupation, business sector, and tobacco consumption. The causation level between the disease and each of the occupational exposures has been rated as strong, intermediate, weak or null by the occupational medicine specialist of the Occupational Diseases Center. RESULTS: Among the 196 patients encountered, there are 127 work-related diseases and 82 of these had one occupational exposure rated as strong or intermediate. The most frequent occupational hazards were asbestos (48 cases) and ionizing radiation (23 cases). The most frequent business sectors were metallurgy, mechanical engineering, and agriculture. Lung cancer was the most frequently reported disease (49 cases). DISCUSSION: . We identified well-known couples with occupational exposures and diseases, such as asbestos and lung cancer. We also identified a link between pesticides and leukemias. This in-patient clinical service is helpful to identify work-related exposures and in helping patients to get compensated.","['Grignoux, Justine', 'Lodde, Brice', 'Dewitte, Jean-Dominique', 'Larabi, Lynda', 'Durand-Moreau, Quentin']","['Grignoux J', 'Lodde B', 'Dewitte JD', 'Larabi L', 'Durand-Moreau Q']","[""CHRU Morvan, service de sante au travail et maladies liees a l'environnement, 2, avenue Foch, 29609 Brest cedex 2, France.

Deregulated splicing is a common feature of many cancers, which impacts drug response and constitutes an attractive therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to characterize global splicing profiles associated with GC resistance and determine whether splicing modulation could serve as a novel therapeutic option for GC-resistant patients. To this end, 38 primary ALL samples were profiled using RNA-seq-based differential splicing analysis. The impact of splicing modulators was investigated in GC-resistant leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic specimens. Our findings revealed, for the first time, markedly distinct splicing landscapes in ALL samples of B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and T-ALL lineages. Differential splicing events associated with GC resistance were involved in RNA processing, a direct response to GCs, survival signaling, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and energy metabolism. Furthermore, our analyses showed that GC-resistant ALL cell lines and primary samples are sensitive to splicing modulation, alone and in combination with GC. Together, these findings suggest that aberrant splicing is associated with GC resistance and splicing modulators deserve further interest as a novel treatment option for GC-resistant patients.","['Sciarrillo, Rocco', 'Wojtuszkiewicz, Anna', 'Kooi, Irsan E', 'Leon, Leticia G', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Kuiper, Roland P', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Giovannetti, Elisa', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Sciarrillo R', 'Wojtuszkiewicz A', 'Kooi IE', 'Leon LG', 'Sonneveld E', 'Kuiper RP', 'Jansen G', 'Giovannetti E', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Cloos J']","['Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Departments of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Departments of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Clinical Genetics, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Department of Immunology, 3000 CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam Immunology and Rheumatology Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Lab, AIRC Start-Up Unit, Fondazione Pisana per la Scienza, 56017 San Giuliano Terme (Pisa), Italy.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Emma's Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1869-0957', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4928-3809', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7565-7504']",['eng'],"['151/Stichting Kinderen Kankervrij', '2013/Cancer Center Amsterdam Foundation', '2015/Cancer Center Amsterdam Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20200319,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7140081,,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA sequencing', 'SF3B modulators', 'alternative splicing', 'glucocorticoid resistance', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/03/25 06:00,2020/03/25 06:01,['2020/03/25 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12030723 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12030723 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Mar 19;12(3). pii: cancers12030723. doi: 10.3390/cancers12030723.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To evaluate event-free survival (EFS) and safety of ICT in iron-overloaded patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS. Design: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (TELESTO). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00940602). Setting: 60 centers in 16 countries. Participants: 225 patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 2247 pmol/L; prior receipt of 15 to 75 packed red blood cell units; and no severe cardiac, liver, or renal abnormalities. Intervention: Deferasirox dispersible tablets (10 to 40 mg/kg per day) (n = 149) or matching placebo (n = 76). Measurements: The primary end point was EFS, defined as time from date of randomization to first documented nonfatal event (related to cardiac or liver dysfunction and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia) or death, whichever occurred first. Results: Median time on treatment was 1.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.5 to 3.1 years) in the deferasirox group and 1.0 year (IQR, 0.6 to 2.0 years) in the placebo group. Median EFS was prolonged by approximately 1 year with deferasirox versus placebo (3.9 years [95% CI, 3.2 to 4.3 years] vs. 3.0 years [CI, 2.2 to 3.7 years], respectively; hazard ratio, 0.64 [CI, 0.42 to 0.96]). Adverse events occurred in 97.3% of deferasirox recipients and 90.8% of placebo recipients. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events (>/=15 events per 100 patient treatment-years) in deferasirox versus placebo recipients, respectively, were 24.7 versus 23.9 for diarrhea, 21.8 versus 18.7 for pyrexia, 16.7 versus 22.7 for upper respiratory tract infection, and 15.9 versus 0.9 for increased serum creatinine concentration. Limitations: The protocol was amended from a phase 3 to a phase 2 study, with a reduced target sample size from 630 to 210 participants. There was differential follow-up between treatment groups. Conclusion: The findings support ICT in iron-overloaded patients with low- to intermediate-1-risk MDS, with longer EFS compared with placebo and a clinically manageable safety profile. Therefore, ICT may be considered in these patients.

The Swedish AML Registry contains data on FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations dating to 2007, and 1570 adult patients younger than 75 years, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, had molecular results reported. Females more often had FLT3ITD and/or NPM1mut (FLT3ITD: female, 29%; male, 22% [P = .0015]; NPM1mut: female, 36%; male, 27% [P = .0001]), and more males were double negative (female, 53%; male, 64%; P < .0001). Patients with FLT3ITD were younger than those without (59 vs 62 years; P = .023), in contrast to patients with NPM1mut (62 vs 60 years; P = .059). Interestingly, their prognostic effect had a strong dependence on age: FLT3ITD indicated poor survival in younger patients (<60 years; P = .00003), but had no effect in older patients (60-74 years; P = .5), whereas NPM1mut indicated better survival in older patients (P = .00002), but not in younger patients (P = .95). In FLT3ITD/NPM1mut patients, the survival was less dependent on age than in the other molecular subsets. These findings are likely to have clinical relevance for risk grouping, study design, and choice of therapy.","['Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Jadersten, Martin', 'Deneberg, Stefan', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Mollgard, Lars', 'Wennstrom, Lovisa', 'Antunovic, Petar', 'Cammenga, Jorg', 'Lorenz, Fryderyk', 'Olander, Emma', 'Lazarevic, Vladimir Lj', 'Hoglund, Martin']","['Juliusson G', 'Jadersten M', 'Deneberg S', 'Lehmann S', 'Mollgard L', 'Wennstrom L', 'Antunovic P', 'Cammenga J', 'Lorenz F', 'Olander E', 'Lazarevic VL', 'Hoglund M']","['Department of Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Stem Cell Center, Department of Hematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Norrland University Hospital, Umea, Sweden; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Sundsvall Hospital, Sundsvall, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Stem Cell Center, Department of Hematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC7094014,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31433-6 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001335 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 24;4(6):1094-1101. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001335.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a multicenter prospective cohort study of 195 patients, aged 5-12, 90 diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 42 with epilepsy and 63 with asthma, parents completed the PAT2.0 or the PAT2.0 generic version. Multivariate analysis was performed with disease as factor and age as covariate. Graph theory and network analysis was employed to study the connectivity and interdependencies among subscales of the PAT while data-driven cluster analysis was used to test whether common patterns of risk exist among the various diseases. Using a network modelling approach analysis, we observed unique patterns of interconnected domains of psychosocial factors. Each pathology was characterized by different interdependencies among the most central and most connected domains. Furthermore, data-driven cluster analysis resulted in two clusters: patients with ALL (89%) mostly belonged to cluster 1, while patients with epilepsy and asthma belonged primarily to cluster 2 (83% and 82% respectively). In sum, implementing a network approach improves our comprehension concerning the character of the problems central to the development of psychosocial difficulties. Therapy directed at problems related to the most central domain(s) constitutes the more rational one because such an approach will inevitably carry over to other domains that depend on the more central function.","['Colliva, Chiara', 'Cellini, Monica', 'Dalla Porta, Francesca', 'Ferrari, Martina', 'Bergamini, Barbara Maria', 'Guerra, Azzurra', 'Di Giuseppe, Silvia', 'Pinto, Annamaria', 'Capasso, Roberto', 'Caprino, Daniela', 'Ferrari, Marta', 'Benatti, Cristina', 'Tascedda, Fabio', 'Blom, Johanna M C']","['Colliva C', 'Cellini M', 'Dalla Porta F', 'Ferrari M', 'Bergamini BM', 'Guerra A', 'Di Giuseppe S', 'Pinto A', 'Capasso R', 'Caprino D', 'Ferrari M', 'Benatti C', 'Tascedda F', 'Blom JMC']","['Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Division of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Azienda Policlinico di Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Division of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Azienda Policlinico di Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Division of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Azienda Policlinico di Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Division of Pediatric Pneumology, University Hospital Azienda Policlinico di Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Division of Pediatric Neurology, University Hospital Azienda Policlinico di Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Center for Pediatric Hemato-oncology, University Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, Hospital Santobono Pausilipon, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, Hospital Santobono Pausilipon, Naples, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Institute Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Division of Pediatric Neurology, University Hospital Azienda Policlinico di Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Center for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Center for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Center for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0958-7333', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4974-1964']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200323,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Asthma/*psychology', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Empathy/physiology', 'Epilepsy/*psychology', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Parents/psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychological Tests', 'Psychometrics/methods']",PMC7089558,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0230194 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-21101 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Mar 23;15(3):e0230194. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0230194. eCollection 2020.,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Systematic integration of matched in situ Hi-C, RNA-seq and CTCF ChIP-seq datasets revealed widespread differences in intra-TAD chromatin interactions and TAD boundary insulation in T-ALL. Our studies identify and focus on a TAD 'fusion' event associated with absence of CTCF-mediated insulation, enabling direct interactions between the MYC promoter and a distal super-enhancer. Moreover, our data also demonstrate that small-molecule inhibitors targeting either oncogenic signal transduction or epigenetic regulation can alter specific 3D interactions found in leukemia.

However, rapid environmental changes can identify hidden fitness trade-offs that turn adaptation into maladaptation, resulting in evolutionary traps. Cancer, a disease that is prone to drug resistance, is in principle susceptible to such traps. We therefore performed pooled CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells treated with various chemotherapies to map the drug-dependent genetic basis of fitness trade-offs, a concept known as antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). We identified a PRC2-NSD2/3-mediated MYC regulatory axis as a drug-induced AP pathway whose ability to confer resistance to bromodomain inhibition and sensitivity to BCL-2 inhibition templates an evolutionary trap. Across diverse AML cell-line and patient-derived xenograft models, we find that acquisition of resistance to bromodomain inhibition through this pathway exposes coincident hypersensitivity to BCL-2 inhibition. Thus, drug-induced AP can be leveraged to design evolutionary traps that selectively target drug resistance in cancer.","['Lin, Kevin H', 'Rutter, Justine C', 'Xie, Abigail', 'Pardieu, Bryann', 'Winn, Emily T', 'Bello, Reinaldo Dal', 'Forget, Antoine', 'Itzykson, Raphael', 'Ahn, Yeong-Ran', 'Dai, Ziwei', 'Sobhan, Raiyan T', 'Anderson, Gray R', 'Singleton, Katherine R', 'Decker, Amy E', 'Winter, Peter S', 'Locasale, Jason W', 'Crawford, Lorin', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Wood, Kris C']","['Lin KH', 'Rutter JC', 'Xie A', 'Pardieu B', 'Winn ET', 'Bello RD', 'Forget A', 'Itzykson R', 'Ahn YR', 'Dai Z', 'Sobhan RT', 'Anderson GR', 'Singleton KR', 'Decker AE', 'Winter PS', 'Locasale JW', 'Crawford L', 'Puissant A', 'Wood KC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Universite de Paris, Genomes, Biologie Cellulaire et Therapeutique U944, INSERM, CNRS, Paris, France.', 'Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Universite de Paris, Genomes, Biologie Cellulaire et Therapeutique U944, INSERM, CNRS, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Universite de Paris, Genomes, Biologie Cellulaire et Therapeutique U944, INSERM, CNRS, Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Genomes, Biologie Cellulaire et Therapeutique U944, INSERM, CNRS, Paris, France.', 'Service Hematologie Adultes, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Universite de Paris, Genomes, Biologie Cellulaire et Therapeutique U944, INSERM, CNRS, Paris, France. alexandre.puissant@inserm.fr.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. kris.wood@duke.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6759-5406', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0858-638X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7766-3502', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0178-8242', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3997-9282', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5887-2253']",['eng'],"['F30 CA206348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA207083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007171/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200316,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological/genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Environment', 'Genetic Fitness/genetics', 'Genetic Pleiotropy/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",PMC7398704,['NIHMS1600203'],,,2020/03/24 06:00,2020/06/27 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41588-020-0590-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41588-020-0590-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2020 Apr;52(4):408-417. doi: 10.1038/s41588-020-0590-9.

Therefore, we prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of treosulfan-based conditioning in children with hematological malignancies in this phase II trial. Overall, 65 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (35.4%), acute myeloid leukemia (44.6%), myelodysplastic syndrome (15.4%), or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (4.6%) received treosulfan intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/m(2)/day (7.7%), 12 g/m(2)/day (35.4%), or 14 g/m(2)/day (56.9%) according to their individual body surface area in combination with fludarabine and thiotepa. The incidence of complete donor chimerism at day +28 was 98.4% with no primary and only one secondary graft failure. At 36 months, NRM was only 3.1%, while relapse incidence was 21.7%, and overall survival was 83.0%. The cumulative incidence of acute graft-vs.-host disease was 45.3% for grades I-IV and 26.6% for grades II-IV. At 36 months, 25.8% overall and 19.4% moderate/severe chronic graft-vs.-host disease were reported. These data confirm the safe and effective use of treosulfan-based conditioning in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies. Therefore, treosulfan/fludarabine/thiotepa can be recommended for myeloablative conditioning in children with hematological malignancies.","['Kalwak, Krzysztof', 'Mielcarek, Monika', 'Patrick, Katharine', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Bader, Peter', 'Corbacioglu, Selim', 'Burkhardt, Birgit', 'Sykora, Karl Walter', 'Drabko, Katarzyna', 'Gozdzik, Jolanta', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Greil, Johann', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Beier, Rita', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Muller, Ingo', 'Schlegel, Paul Gerhardt', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Stachel, Klaus Daniel', 'Hemmelmann, Claudia', 'Moller, Ann-Kristin', 'Baumgart, Joachim', 'Vora, Ajay']","['Kalwak K', 'Mielcarek M', 'Patrick K', 'Styczynski J', 'Bader P', 'Corbacioglu S', 'Burkhardt B', 'Sykora KW', 'Drabko K', 'Gozdzik J', 'Fagioli F', 'Greil J', 'Gruhn B', 'Beier R', 'Locatelli F', 'Muller I', 'Schlegel PG', 'Sedlacek P', 'Stachel KD', 'Hemmelmann C', 'Moller AK', 'Baumgart J', 'Vora A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland. krzysztof.kalwak@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', ""Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, UK."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum UMK Torun, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department for Children and Adolescents, Division for Stem Cell Transplantation, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and BMT, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', ""Medical College, University Children's Hospital in Cracow Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland."", ""Children's Hospital Regina Margherita, University of Turin, Turin, Italy."", ""University Children's Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Depertment of Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', ""IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Children's Hospital, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany."", 'medac GmbH, Wedel, Germany.', 'medac GmbH, Wedel, Germany.', 'medac GmbH, Wedel, Germany.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1174-5799', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3158-119X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1151-829X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7094-9129', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9257-900X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7477-6632']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200320,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'CO61ER3EPI (treosulfan)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Busulfan/analogs & derivatives', 'Child', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Thiotepa', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives']",PMC7515850,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0869-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0869-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Oct;55(10):1996-2007. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0869-6.

To address this issue, we conducted a nationwide registry-based study of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) age 50 years or older who underwent allogeneic HCT in complete remission using RIC (n = 284) or myeloablative conditioning (MAC, n = 190) between 2002 and 2007. The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 10.1 years for RIC recipients and 10.4 years for MAC recipients. The 10-year probabilities of overall survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality were 36.4%, 30.0%, and 35.7% for RIC recipients, and 39.8%, 26.3%, and 35.5% for MAC recipients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the conditioning intensity did not affect overall mortality (P = 0.184), relapse (P = 0.904), or non-relapse mortality (P = 0.387). For the 218 patients qualifying for propensity score-matched pairing (109 pairs), RIC was found to be associated with similar survival (P = 0.095) and relapse (P = 0.467), and significantly lower non-relapse mortality (P = 0.046) compared with MAC. Our results confirm the long-term efficacy of RIC allogeneic HCT for older patients with AML and mitigate concerns over an increase in late relapse.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Toya, Takashi', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yano, Shingo']","['Yanada M', 'Fukuda T', 'Tanaka M', 'Ota S', 'Toya T', 'Mori T', 'Uchida N', 'Ozawa Y', 'Nakamae H', 'Kanda Y', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yano S']","['Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan. myanada@aichi-cc.jp.', 'National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1602-9775', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7436-972X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8176-4760']",['eng'],"['2019-8/Aichi Cancer Research Foundation (Aichi Cancer Research for the Promotion', 'of Science Foundation)', '18ek0510023h0002/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200320,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0868-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0868-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Oct;55(10):2008-2016. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0868-7.

The results of 74 patients with SDS (6 acute myeloid leukemia, 7 myelodysplastic syndrome, and 61 bone marrow failure) treated with HSCT between 1988 and 2016 are reported. The donor source was: 24% sibling, 8% parent, and 68% unrelated donor. The stem cell source was: 70% bone marrow, 19% peripheral blood stem cells, and 11% cord blood. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 54% and reduced intensity in 46%. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved in 84% of patients after a median time of 17.5 days. Graft failure occurred in 15% of HSCTs. Grades I-IV acute and chronic GVHD were observed in 55% and 20% of patients, respectively. After a median follow-up of 7.3 years (95% CI 4.8-10.2), 28 patients died for progression/relapse (7) or toxicity (21).

CR1 (1.498): median follow-up (FU) after FTBI (1.285) and CC (213) was 6.8 and 6.1 years. Survivals were not significantly different. CR2 (1.556): median FU after FTBI (1.345) and CC (211) was 6.2 years. Outcomes after FTBI were superior as compared with CC with regard to overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), relapse incidence (RI), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). However, we must emphasize the preliminary character of the results of this retrospective ""real-world-practice"" study. These findings will be prospectively assessed in the ALL SCTped 2012 FORUM trial.","['Willasch, Andre Manfred', 'Peters, Christina', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Kitra-Roussou, Vassiliki',

Despite the consensus for proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in relapsing patients with ALL who achieve second complete remission (CR2) with salvage therapy, most patients lack a suitable matched-related histocompatible donor. The present multicenter retrospective study compared, for ALL patients in CR2, the HSCT outcome from all four possible alternative hematopoietic stem cell sources, namely matched unrelated 10/10 (n = 281), mismatched unrelated 9/10 (n = 125), haploidentical (n = 105), and cord blood (n = 104) donors. The 2-year outcomes were not statistically different between the four donor sources with respect to overall survival (38.3-47.2%), leukemia-free survival (30.5-39.6%), relapse incidence (32.6-37.6%), nonrelapse mortality (27.5-34.6%), and graft-versus-host disease-free relapse survival (21.4-33.1%). Donor choices for ALL patients achieving CR2 post first relapse are broad, ensuring that most patient in need secures a graft.

Between 2007 and 2015, 231 transplant-eligible patients were registered for a phase 2 study of alternative donor transplantation. After registration, a sufficient time period was given to find appropriate UD. Patients received CB transplantation (CBT) if an appropriate UD was unavailable. In total, 119 patients received CBT (106 AL and 13 MDS) and 91 patients received UD transplantation (UDT) (86 AL and 5 MDS). The median age was 39 years in both groups. The primary objective was overall survival (OS); secondary objectives included cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse, and disease-free survival. Diagnosis, disease status at transplantation, refined disease risk index, and hematopoietic cell transplant-specific comorbidity index did not differ between UDT and CBT. In multivariate analyses, graft source was not a significant risk factor for all objectives. In adjusted analyses, UDT and CBT showed similar OS, NRM, and relapse in this prospective study. CB can be a comparable alternative stem cell source to UD by achieving a timely transplant.","['Terakura, Seitaro', 'Nishida, Tetsuya', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Kato, Tomonori', 'Miyao, Kotaro', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Goto, Tatsunori', 'Kohno, Akio', 'Ozeki, Kazutaka', 'Onishi, Yasushi', 'Fukuhara, Noriko', 'Fujii, Nobuharu', 'Yokoyama, Hisayuki', 'Kasai, Masanobu', 'Iida, Hiroatsu', 'Kanemura, Nobuhiro', 'Endo, Tomoyuki', 'Ago, Hiroatsu', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Iyama, Satoshi', 'Nawa, Yuichiro', 'Nakamae, Mika', 'Nagata, Yasuyuki', 'Kurahashi, Shingo', 'Tomiya, Yasuo', 'Yanagisawa, Atsumi', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Kuwatsuka, Yachiyo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Murata, Makoto']","['Terakura S', 'Nishida T', 'Sawa M', 'Kato T', 'Miyao K', 'Ozawa Y', 'Goto T', 'Kohno A', 'Ozeki K', 'Onishi Y', 'Fukuhara N', 'Fujii N', 'Yokoyama H', 'Kasai M', 'Iida H', 'Kanemura N', 'Endo T', 'Ago H', 'Onizuka M', 'Iyama S', 'Nawa Y', 'Nakamae M', 'Nagata Y', 'Kurahashi S', 'Tomiya Y', 'Yanagisawa A', 'Suzuki R', 'Kuwatsuka Y', 'Atsuta Y', 'Miyamura K', 'Murata M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. tseit@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, JA Aichi Konan Kosei Hospital, Konan, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, JA Aichi Konan Kosei Hospital, Konan, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya Daini Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Meitetsu Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine, Gifu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shimane Prefectural Central Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University Hospital, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Ehime Prefectural Central Hospital, Matsuyama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Miyagi Cancer Center, Natori, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1194-8046'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20200316,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Fetal Blood', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Unrelated Donors']",,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0859-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0859-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Jul;55(7):1399-1409. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0859-8.

Here, we describe the results of a retrospective clinical analysis establishing the effect of donor KIR motifs on the outcomes of 119 HLA-matched, unrelated donor HCT for adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) using myeloablative conditioning (MAC) in a predominantly T-cell deplete (TCD) cohort. We observed that HCT involving donors with at least one KIR B haplotype were more likely to result in non-relapse mortality (NRM) than HCT involving donors with two KIR A haplotypes (p = 0.019). Upon separation of KIR haplotypes into their centromeric (Cen) and telomeric (Tel) motif structures, we demonstrated that the Cen-B motif was largely responsible for this effect (p = 0.001). When the cause of NRM was investigated further, infection was the dominant cause of death (p = 0.006). No evidence correlating donor KIR B haplotype with relapse risk was observed. The results from this analysis confirm previous findings in the unrelated, TCD, MAC transplant setting and imply a protective role for donor-encoded Cen-A motifs against infection in allogeneic HCT recipients.","['Bultitude, Will P', 'Schellekens, Jennifer', 'Szydlo, Richard M', 'Anthias, Chloe', 'Cooley, Sarah A', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Roberts, Chrissy H', 'Garcia-Sepulveda, Christian A', 'Lee, Julia', 'Pearce, Rachel M', 'Wilson, Marie C', 'Potter, Michael N', 'Byrne, Jenny L', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'MacKinnon, Stephen', 'Bloor, Adrian J', 'Patel, Amit', 'McQuaker, I Grant', 'Malladi, Ram', 'Tholouli, Eleni', 'Orchard, Kim', 'Potter, Victoria T', 'Madrigal, J Alejandro', 'Mayor, Neema P', 'Marsh, Steven G E']","['Bultitude WP', 'Schellekens J', 'Szydlo RM', 'Anthias C', 'Cooley SA', 'Miller JS', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Shaw BE', 'Roberts CH', 'Garcia-Sepulveda CA', 'Lee J', 'Pearce RM', 'Wilson MC', 'Potter MN', 'Byrne JL', 'Russell NH', 'MacKinnon S', 'Bloor AJ', 'Patel A', 'McQuaker IG', 'Malladi R', 'Tholouli E', 'Orchard K', 'Potter VT', 'Madrigal JA', 'Mayor NP', 'Marsh SGE']","['Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', 'Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', 'Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.', 'Fate Therapeutics, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Haematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Haematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'CIBMTR and Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin Clinical Cancer Center, Wisconsin, WI, USA.', 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Laboratorio de Genomica Viral y Humana, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi, San Luis Potosi, SLP, Mexico.', ""British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Guy's Hospital, London, UK."", ""British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Guy's Hospital, London, UK."", 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', ""British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Guy's Hospital, London, UK."", 'Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.', 'Nottingham University Hospital, Nottingham, UK.', 'Nottingham University Hospital, Nottingham, UK.', 'University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', 'Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK.', 'West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, UK.', 'University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', 'University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK.', 'Kings College Hospital, London, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK. steven.marsh@ucl.ac.uk.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, UK. steven.marsh@ucl.ac.uk.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1064-5980', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9381-1851', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0029-4611']",['eng'],['P01 CA111412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200313,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adult', 'HLA Antigens', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', '*Receptors, KIR/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0858-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0858-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Oct;55(10):1975-1984. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0858-9.

Fludarabine (Flu) with reduced doses of busulfan (Bu) (Flu + Bu) and Flu with reduced doses of melphalan (Mel) (Flu + Mel) are widely used RIC regimens for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A nationwide retrospective study comparing clinical outcomes of adult patients with AML receiving first allo-HCT after RIC between 2001 and 2010 was performed. Cumulative incidences of relapse were not significantly different among the Flu + ivBu-based (FBiv), Flu + poBu-based (FBpo), and Flu + Mel-based (FM) groups (p = 0.29). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was significantly lower in patients receiving FBiv compared with FBpo (p = 0.003) and FM (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, there was no significant difference in overall survival, but FM was associated with a significantly lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-0.85, p = 0.002), higher NRM (HR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.10-2.33, p = 0.013) and better leukemia-free survival (HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63-0.95, p = 0.015) compared with FBiv. These results suggest that Flu + Mel has a more intense disease control potential and Flu + ivBu is less toxic than the other. Both RIC regimens provide similar survival outcomes and are effective and useful regimens for patients with AML who received allo-HCT.","['Yamashita, Takuya', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Shiratori, Souichi', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Akasaka, Takashi', 'Miyakoshi, Shigesaburo', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yano, Shingo']","['Yamashita T', 'Takami A', 'Uchida N', 'Fukuda T', 'Eto T', 'Shiratori S', 'Ota S', 'Akasaka T', 'Miyakoshi S', 'Kondo T', 'Hidaka M', 'Kanda J', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yano S']","[""Department of Hematology, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. tayamash@luke.ac.jp."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University Hospital, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tenri Hospital, Tenri, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1822-9976', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8959-6271', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6704-3633']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200312,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Busulfan', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Melphalan', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives']",,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2018/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0856-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0856-y [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Oct;55(10):1955-1965. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0856-y.

Neuroblastoma cells display elevated expression of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins, suggesting that BH3-mimetics may be a promising treatment option. Here, we investigated the role of BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 in neuroblastoma. METHODS: A panel of neuroblastoma cell lines and primary patient-derived cells were exposed to BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-2 (ABT-199), BCL-XL (A1331852) or MCL-1 (S63845). In addition, protein expression and interaction patterns were analysed using Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: All tested BH3-mimetics were able to induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines, indicating that not only BCL-2 but also BCL-XL and MCL-1 may be promising therapeutic targets. Primary patient-derived cells displayed highest sensitivity to A1331852, highlighting the important role of BCL-XL in neuroblastoma. Further analysis into the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis revealed that A1331852 and S63845 displaced proapoptotic proteins like BIM and BAK from their antiapoptotic targets, subsequently leading to the activation of BAX and BAK and caspase-dependent apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: By using selective BH3-mimetics, this study demonstrates that BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 are all relevant therapeutic targets in neuroblastoma. A1331852 and S63845 induce rapid apoptosis that is initiated following a displacement of BAK from BCL-XL or MCL-1, respectively.","['Bierbrauer, Annika', 'Jacob, Maureen', 'Vogler, Meike', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Bierbrauer A', 'Jacob M', 'Vogler M', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. simone.fulda@kgu.de.']",,['eng'],"['70113111/Deutsche Krebshilfe (German Cancer Aid)/International', '70113791/Deutsche Krebshilfe (German Cancer Aid)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200318,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/genetics', 'Biomimetics', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics']",PMC7217842,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-0795-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-0795-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2020 May;122(10):1544-1551. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-0795-9.

However, its beneficial effect in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to identify a potential predictive biomarker for vitamin C treatment in AML. METHODS: Gene expression patterns and their relevance to the survival of AML patients were analysed with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database cases. In vitro experiments were performed on AML cell lines, a SLC2A3-knockdown cell line and patient-derived primary AML cells. RESULTS: SLC2A3 expression was significantly decreased in leukaemic blast cells. Below-median SLC2A3 expression was associated with poor overall survival. Low SLC2A3 expression was associated with less effective demethylation, and a diminished vitamin C effect in the AML and lymphoma cell lines. SLC2A3 knockdown in the KG-1 cell line decreased the response of vitamin C. In patient-derived primary AML cells, vitamin C only restored TET2 activity when SLC2A3 was expressed. CONCLUSION: SLC2A3 could be used as a potential biomarker to predict the effect of vitamin C treatment in AML.","['Liu, Jun', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Han, Heejoo', 'Park, Jihyun', 'Kim, Dongchan', 'Park, Hyejoo', 'Ko, Myunggon', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo']","['Liu J', 'Hong J', 'Han H', 'Park J', 'Kim D', 'Park H', 'Ko M', 'Koh Y', 'Shin DY', 'Yoon SS']","['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. alertjun@hanmail.net.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. alertjun@hanmail.net.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. alertjun@hanmail.net.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. ssysmc@snu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. ssysmc@snu.ac.kr.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. ssysmc@snu.ac.kr.']",,['eng'],['NRF-2018R1C1B5085214/National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200316,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SLC2A3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Glucose Transporter Type 3/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics']",PMC7217885,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-0788-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-0788-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2020 May;122(10):1445-1452. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-0788-8.

As such, there remains a critical need to identify key regulators of chemotherapy resistance in AML. In this study, we demonstrate that the membrane scaffold, CD82, contributes to the chemoresistant phenotype of AML. Using an RNA-seq approach, we identified the increased expression of the tetraspanin family member, CD82, in response to the chemotherapeutic, daunorubicin. Analysis of the TARGET and BEAT AML databases identifies a correlation between CD82 expression and overall survival of AML patients. Moreover, using a combination of cell lines and patient samples, we find that CD82 overexpression results in significantly reduced cell death in response to chemotherapy. Investigation of the mechanism by which CD82 promotes AML survival in response to chemotherapy identified a crucial role for enhanced protein kinase c alpha (PKCalpha) signaling and downstream activation of the beta1 integrin. In addition, analysis of beta1 integrin clustering by super-resolution imaging demonstrates that CD82 expression promotes the formation of dense beta1 integrin membrane clusters. Lastly, evaluation of survival signaling following daunorubicin treatment identified robust activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) downstream of PKCalpha and beta1 integrin signaling when CD82 is overexpressed. Together, these data propose a mechanism where CD82 promotes chemoresistance by increasing PKCalpha activation and downstream activation/clustering of beta1 integrin, leading to AML cell survival via activation of p38 MAPK. These observations suggest that the CD82-PKCalpha signaling axis may be a potential therapeutic target for attenuating chemoresistance signaling in AML.","['Floren, Muskan', 'Restrepo Cruz, Sebastian', 'Termini, Christina M', 'Marjon, Kristopher D', 'Lidke, Keith A', 'Gillette, Jennifer M']","['Floren M', 'Restrepo Cruz S', 'Termini CM', 'Marjon KD', 'Lidke KA', 'Gillette JM']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA. jgillette@salud.unm.edu.', 'University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA. jgillette@salud.unm.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1831-1347', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9328-4318']",['eng'],"['P30 CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 HL124977/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM085273/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007736/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL122483/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA232480/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200319,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CD82 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Kangai-1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*genetics', 'Kangai-1 Protein/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/*genetics', 'RNA-Seq', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics']",PMC7210072,['NIHMS1572780'],,,2020/03/24 06:00,2020/11/26 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-1261-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-1261-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 May;39(19):3910-3925. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-1261-0.

Some of these are known to be driver oncogenes, such as BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The products of such fusion genes are abnormal proteins that are ordinarily degraded in cells by a mechanism known as protein quality control. This suggests that the degradation of BCR-ABL protein is suppressed in CML cells to ensure their proliferative activity. Here, we show that ubiquitin-specific protease 25 (USP25) suppresses the degradation of BCR-ABL protein in cells harboring Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). USP25 was found proximal to BCR-ABL protein in cells. Depletion of USP25 using shRNA-mediated gene silencing increased the ubiquitylated BCR-ABL, and reduced the level of BCR-ABL protein. Accordingly, BCR-ABL-mediated signaling and cell proliferation were suppressed in BCR-ABL-positive leukemia cells by the depletion of USP25. We further found that pharmacological inhibition of USP25 induced rapid degradation of BCR-ABL protein in Ph-positive leukemia cells, regardless of their sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These results indicate that USP25 is a novel target for inducing the degradation of oncogenic BCR-ABL protein in Ph-positive leukemia cells. This could be an effective approach to overcome resistance to kinase inhibitors.","['Shibata, Norihito', 'Ohoka, Nobumichi', 'Tsuji, Genichiro', 'Demizu, Yosuke', 'Miyawaza, Keiji', 'Ui-Tei, Kumiko', 'Akiyama, Tetsu', 'Naito, Mikihiko']","['Shibata N', 'Ohoka N', 'Tsuji G', 'Demizu Y', 'Miyawaza K', 'Ui-Tei K', 'Akiyama T', 'Naito M']","['Division of Molecular Target and Gene Therapy Products, National Institute of Health Sciences, Kanagawa, 210-9501, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Target and Gene Therapy Products, National Institute of Health Sciences, Kanagawa, 210-9501, Japan.', 'Division of Organic Chemistry, National Institute of Health Sciences, Kanagawa, 210-9501, Japan.', 'Division of Organic Chemistry, National Institute of Health Sciences, Kanagawa, 210-9501, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, 409-3898, Japan.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Chiba, 277-8561, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Genetic Information, Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-0032, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Target and Gene Therapy Products, National Institute of Health Sciences, Kanagawa, 210-9501, Japan. miki-naito@nihs.go.jp.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7835-7718', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8695-9025', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0451-1337']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200312,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (USP25 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Deubiquitinating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Deubiquitinating Enzymes/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*genetics']",,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2020/11/26 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-1253-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-1253-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 May;39(19):3867-3878. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-1253-0.

Advanced ENKTL is multidrug chemoresistant and has a poor prognosis. In this study, we aim to develop a novel hexokinase domain component 1 (HKDC1)-based antitumor target for ENKTL that is involved with the antimetabolic signaling pathway, EBV replication, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression. We showed that HKDC1 is highly upregulated in ENKTL cells and HKDC1 knockdown significantly suppresses ENKTL tumor growth. In addition, HKDC1 is highly identical with four other hexokinase isoforms, with the only difference being in the last eight amino acids (aa) at the C-terminal. Further investigation showed that peptide delivery of the last eight aa of HKDC1 at the C-terminal (HKC8) with D-configuration using transferrin (Tf) receptor internalization sequence (Tf-D-HKC8) inhibits HKDC1 association with vascular endothelial growth factor 1 (VDAC1), resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overgeneration and subsequently suppressing EBV replication and P-gp expression, making it very effective in killing EBV-positive ENKTL cells. Further in vivo experiments showed that local injection of Tf-D-HKC8 peptide significantly suppresses ENKTL tumor growth and EBV replication in ENKTL xenograft mouse models. We conclude that HKDC1 C-terminal-based peptides inhibit ENKTL by modulation of mitochondrial function and EBV suppression.","['Chen, Qi', 'Feng, Jia', 'Wu, Jinhu', 'Yu, Zhendong', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Chen, Yonggang', 'Yao, Paul', 'Zhang, Hongyu']","['Chen Q', 'Feng J', 'Wu J', 'Yu Z', 'Zhang W', 'Chen Y', 'Yao P', 'Zhang H']","['Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, PR China.', 'Central Laboratory, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, PR China.', 'Shenzhen Peking University-The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Medical Center, Shenzhen, 518036, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, PR China. vasilis112@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, PR China. vasilis112@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, PR China. zyiqu@163.com.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9407-0779'],['eng'],"['31601172/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', 'JCYJ20170816105345191/Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation', 'Commission/International', 'JCYJ20170306161807726/Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation', 'Commission/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200323,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (HKDC1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*drug effects', 'Heterografts', 'Hexokinase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7515829,,,,2020/03/24 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0801-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0801-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Oct;34(10):2736-2748. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0801-5.

We identified 892 lymphoma patients who had undergone stem cell harvest at all transplant centers in Denmark. A total of 565 patients had an available harvest sample, which was analysed for CHIP by next-generation sequencing, and the median follow-up was 9.1 years. Of the patients who were intended for immediate ASCT, 25.5% (112/440) carried at least one CHIP mutation. In contrast to previous single-center studies CHIP was not associated with inferior overall survival (OS) in multivariate analyses. However, patients with mutations in genes of the DNA repair pathway (PPM1D, TP53, RAD21, BRCC3) had a significant inferior OS (HR after 1 year of follow-up 2.79, 95% confidence interval 1.71-4.56; p < 0.0001), which also was evident in multivariate analysis (p = 0.00067). These patients had also increased rates of therapy-related leukemia and admission to intensive care. Furthermore, in patients who did not undergo immediate ASCT, a significant inferior OS of individuals with DNA repair mutations was also identified (p = 0.003).","['Husby, Simon', 'Favero, Francesco',

The majority of ATLL patients have leukemic cells with phenotype similar to Tregs, prompting suggestions that ATLL cells themselves have immunosuppressive functions. In this study, we detected CD39 expression on ATLL cells, particularly frequent on aggressive subtypes. CD39 and CD73 convert extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine, a key player in Tregs' immunosuppression. In vitro culture, both CD39(+) ATLL cells and normal Tregs converted rapidly extracellular ATP to AMP, which was disturbed by CD39 inhibitors, and was negated in the CD39 knockout MJ cell line. The proliferation of cocultured CD4(+)/CD8(+) normal T cells was suppressed by CD39(+) MJ cells, but not by CD39 knockout MJ cells. Supplemented ATP was exhausted by an EG7-OVA T-cell line with stable CD39 induction, but not by mock. When these cell lines were subcutaneously transplanted into murine flanks, Poly(I:C) peritoneal administration reduced tumor size to 1/3 in mock-transplanted tumors, but not in CD39 induced tumors. Overall, we found that ATLL cells express CD39 at a high rate, and our results suggest that this helps ATLL cells escape antitumor immunity through the extracellular ATPDase-Adenosine cascade.

To examine the existence of lymphoma stem cells, we utilized a mouse model of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Established NPM-ALK(+) lymphomas contained heterogeneous cell populations ranging from mature T cells to undifferentiated hematopoietic stem cells. Interestingly, CD4(-)/CD8(-) double negative (DN) lymphoma cells aberrantly expressed the T cell receptor alpha/beta chain. Serial transplantation of sorted CD4/CD8 and DN lymphoma subpopulations identified lymphoma stem cells within the DN3/DN4 T cell population, whereas all other subpopulations failed to establish serial lymphomas. Moreover, transplanted lymphoma DN3/DN4 T cells were able to differentiate and gave rise to mature lymphoma T cells. Gene expression analyses unmasked stem-cell-like transcriptional regulation of the identified lymphoma stem cell population. Furthermore, these lymphoma stem cells are characterized by low CD30 expression levels, which might contribute to limited long-term therapeutic success in patients treated with anti-CD30-targeted therapies. In summary, our results highlight the existence of a lymphoma stem cell population in a NPM-ALK-driven CD30(+) mouse model, thereby giving the opportunity to test innovative treatment strategies developed to eradicate the origin of disease.","['Kreutmair, Stefanie', 'Klingeberg, Cathrin', 'Poggio, Teresa', 'Andrieux, Geoffroy', 'Keller, Alexander', 'Miething, Cornelius', 'Follo, Marie',

The incidence rates of RT among pts with CLL range from 2 to 10%. The aim of this analysis is to report the frequency, characteristics and outcomes of pts with RT enrolled in trials of the GCLLSG. A total of 2975 pts with advanced CLL were reviewed for incidence of RT. Clinical, laboratory, and genetic data were pooled. Time-to-event data, starting from time of CLL diagnosis, of first-line therapy or of RT diagnosis, were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology. One hundred and three pts developed RT (3%): 95 pts diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (92%) and eight pts Hodgkin lymphoma (8%). Median observation time was 53 months (interquartile range 38.1-69.5). Median OS from initial CLL diagnosis for pts without RT was 167 months vs 71 months for pts with RT (HR 2.64, CI 2.09-3.33). Median OS after diagnosis of RT was 9 months.

NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) has been identified as a tractable target in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We and others have shown that pevonedistat (TAK-924), a small-molecule inhibitor of NAE, abrogates NF-kappaB signaling in malignant B cells. However, NF-kappaB pathway activity is indispensable in immune response, and T-cell function is altered in patients with CLL. Using T cells derived from patients with CLL, we demonstrate that although targeting NAE results in markedly differential expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes and downregulation of interleukin (IL)-2 signaling during T-cell activation, T cells evade apoptosis. Meanwhile, NAE inhibition favorably modulates polarization of T cells in vitro, with decreased Treg differentiation and a shift toward TH1 phenotype, accompanied by increased interferon-gamma production. These findings were recapitulated in vivo in immunocompetent mouse models. T cells exposed to pevonedistat in washout experiments, informed by its human pharmacokinetic profile, recover NAE activity, and maintain their response to T-cell receptor stimulation and cytotoxic potential. Our data shed light on the potential immune implications of targeting neddylation in CLL and lymphoid malignancies.","['Best, Scott', 'Lam, Vi', 'Liu, Tingting', 'Bruss, Nur', 'Kittai, Adam', 'Danilova, Olga V', 'Murray, Susan', 'Berger, Allison', 'Pennock, Nathan D', 'Lind, Evan F', 'Danilov, Alexey V']","['Best S', 'Lam V', 'Liu T', 'Bruss N', 'Kittai A', 'Danilova OV', 'Murray S', 'Berger A', 'Pennock ND', 'Lind EF', 'Danilov AV']","['Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'University of Portland, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA. adanilov@coh.org.', 'City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E Duarte Rd, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA. adanilov@coh.org.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7026-2012', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4461-0970']",['eng'],['U01 CA217862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200316,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NEDD8 Protein)', '0 (NEDD8 protein, human)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'S3AZD8D215 (pevonedistat)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Models, Biological', 'NEDD8 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",PMC8288064,['NIHMS1718969'],,,2020/03/24 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0794-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0794-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Jan;35(1):156-168. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0794-0.

We analyzed bone marrow T cells (bmT) as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in pediatric precursor-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Based on data from 100 patients, we show that ALL is associated with late-stage CD4(+) phenotype and loss of early CD8(+) T cells. The inhibitory exhaustion marker TIM-3 on CD4(+) bmT increased relapse risk (RFS = 94.6/70.3%) confirmed by multivariate analysis. The hazard ratio of TIM-3 expression nearly reached the hazard ratio of MRD (7.1 vs. 8.0) indicating that patients with a high frequency of TIM-3(+)CD4(+) bone marrow T cells at initial diagnosis have a 7.1-fold increased risk to develop ALL relapse. Comparison of wild type primary T cells to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TIM-3 knockout and TIM-3 overexpression confirmed the negative effect of TIM-3 on T cell responses against ALL. TIM-3(+)CD4(+) bmT are increased in ALL overexpressing CD200, that leads to dysfunctional antileukemic T cell responses. In conclusion, TIM-3-mediated interaction between bmT and leukemia cells is shown as a strong risk factor for relapse in pediatric B-lineage ALL.

Numerous studies have investigated this association in adults, however only sparse knowledge exists on DIC in pediatric cancer patients. The objective of this article was to systematically review the literature regarding DIC in pediatric malignancies. PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant articles on January 31, 2020. In total, 6,070 articles were identified out of which 24 articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria. These were included in the qualitative synthesis. The National Institutes of Health's Quality Assessment Tools was used to assess bias in the included articles. The studies were of only moderate quality mainly based on medical charts and demonstrated high heterogeneity, especially as regards to diagnostic criteria. DIC was reported most frequently in patients with acute leukemia, particularly the subtype acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Standard coagulation parameters were used as diagnostic laboratory tests supporting the diagnosis of DIC. Hemorrhage was the predominant clinical manifestation, whereas thromboembolic events and organ failure were reported less frequently. Unfractionated heparin, platelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma were the most frequently used supportive treatment agents. Hemorrhage accounted for the majority of deaths in children with acute leukemia and solid tumors. In conclusion, only a limited number of studies, being heterogenous and of moderate quality, have investigated DIC in pediatric malignancy. Notably, this entity seems to be complicated mainly by hemorrhage. High quality studies are needed to evaluate diagnosis, clinical manifestations and optimal treatment of DIC in childhood cancers.","['Kongstad, Christine', 'Mikkelsen, Torben Stamm', 'Hvas, Anne-Mette']","['Kongstad C', 'Mikkelsen TS', 'Hvas AM']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7136-7534'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20200323,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Hemorrhage/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Heparin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Plasma', 'Thrombosis/drug therapy/epidemiology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'hemorrhage', 'malignancy', 'pediatrics', 'thrombosis']",2020/03/24 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2020.1733717 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Aug;37(5):390-411. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2020.1733717.

Target occupancy is a measure of covalent binding to BTK and has been applied as a pharmacodynamic parameter in clinical studies of BTK inhibitors. However, the kinetics of de novo BTK synthesis, which determines occupancy, and the relationship between occupancy, pathway inhibition and clinical outcomes remain undefined. This randomized phase 2 study investigated the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of a selective BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib at 100 mg twice daily (BID) or 200 mg once daily (QD) in 48 patients with relapsed/refractory or high-risk treatment-naive CLL. Acalabrutinib was well tolerated and yielded an overall response rate (ORR) of partial response or better of 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.9-99.9) and an estimated progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24 months of 91.5% (95% CI, 70.0-97.8) with BID dosing and an ORR of 79.2% (95% CI, 57.9-92.9) and an estimated PFS rate at 24 months of 87.2% (95% CI, 57.2-96.7) with QD dosing. BTK resynthesis was faster in patients with CLL than in healthy volunteers. BID dosing maintained higher BTK occupancy and achieved more potent pathway inhibition compared with QD dosing. Small increments in occupancy attained by BID dosing relative to QD dosing compounded over time to augment downstream biological effects. The impact of BTK occupancy on long-term clinical outcomes remains to be determined.

In this study, low expression of SETD2 correlated with shortened survival in patients with MDS, and the SETD2 levels in CD34+ bone marrow cells of those patients were increased by decitabine. We knocked out Setd2 in NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) transgenic mice, which phenocopies human MDS, and found that loss of Setd2 accelerated the transformation of MDS into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Loss of Setd2 enhanced the ability of NHD13+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to self-renew, with increased symmetric self-renewal division and decreased differentiation and cell death. The growth of MDS-associated leukemia cells was inhibited though increasing the H3K36me3 level by using epigenetic modifying drugs. Furthermore, Setd2 deficiency upregulated hematopoietic stem cell signaling and downregulated myeloid differentiation pathways in the NHD13+ HSPCs. Our RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq analysis indicated that S100a9, the S100 calcium-binding protein, is a target gene of Setd2 and that the addition of recombinant S100a9 weakens the effect of Setd2 deficiency in the NHD13+ HSPCs. In contrast, downregulation of S100a9 leads to decreases of its downstream targets, including Ikba and Jnk, which influence the self-renewal and differentiation of HSPCs. Therefore, our results demonstrated that SETD2 deficiency predicts poor prognosis in MDS and promotes the transformation of MDS into AML, which provides a potential therapeutic target for MDS-associated acute leukemia.","['Chen, Bing-Yi', 'Song, Junhong', 'Hu, Cheng-Long', 'Chen, Shu-Bei', 'Zhang, Qunling', 'Xu, Chun-Hui', 'Wu, Ji-Chuan', 'Hou, Dan', 'Sun, Ming', 'Zhang, Yuan-Liang', 'Liu, Na', 'Yu, Peng-Cheng', 'Liu, Ping', 'Zong, Li-Juan', 'Zhang, Jia-Ying', 'Dai, Ruo-Fei', 'Lan, Fei', 'Huang, Qiu-Hua', 'Zhang, Su-Jiang', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Sun, Xiao-Jian', 'Wang, Lan']","['Chen BY', 'Song J', 'Hu CL', 'Chen SB', 'Zhang Q', 'Xu CH', 'Wu JC', 'Hou D', 'Sun M', 'Zhang YL', 'Liu N', 'Yu PC', 'Liu P', 'Zong LJ', 'Zhang JY', 'Dai RF', 'Lan F', 'Huang QH', 'Zhang SJ', 'Nimer SD', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ', 'Sun XJ', 'Wang L']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Tissue Microenvironment and Tumor, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China;

This inherited hematological disorder leads to irreversible damage of multiple organs through a wide variety of mechanisms, such as sickling of red cells, oxidative state due to ischemic-reperfusion episodes, inflammation, hypercoagulation state, and platelet activation, among others. In SCD, the endothelium arises as the key entity where most of these processes, which eventually lead to increased morbidly and mortality, interact. This review begins with the already accepted idea that organ-specific vasculopathy precedes clinical manifestation, and briefly explains one of the main triggers of vaso-occlusive episodes, the complex interplay between blood cells and the dysfunctional endothelium. Endothelial protective strategies emerge as a potential tool for the prevention of organ-specific disease in SCD. Actually, this knowledge is currently used for the development of potential pharmacologic interventions to improve the lives of SCD patients.","['Palomo, Marta', 'Diaz-Ricart, Maribel', 'Carreras, Enric']","['Palomo M', 'Diaz-Ricart M', 'Carreras E']","[""Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain; Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.

Epigenome-wide association study.,988-997,10.1080/15592294.2020.1746507 [doi],"DNA methylation is dynamic, varies throughout the life course, and its levels are influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors, as well as by genetic variation. The leading genetic variants at stroke risk loci identified to date explain roughly 1-2% of stroke heritability. Most of these single nucleotide polymorphisms are situated within a regulatory sequence marked by DNase I hypersensitivity sites, which would indicate involvement of an epigenetic mechanism. To detect epigenetic variants associated with stroke occurrence and stroke subtypes. A two-stage case-control epigenome-wide association study was designed. The discovery sample with 401 samples included 218 ischaemic stroke (IS) patients, assessed at Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain) and 183 controls from the REGICOR cohort. In two independent samples (N = 226 and N = 166), we replicated 22 CpG sites differentially methylated in IS in 21 loci, including 2 CpGs in locus ZFHX3, which includes known genetic variants associated with stroke. The pathways associated with these loci are inflammation and angiogenesis. The meta-analysis identified 384 differentially methylated CpGs, including loci of known stroke and vascular risk genetic variants, enriched by loci involved in lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, circadian clock, and glycolysis pathways. We identified a set of 22 CpGs in 21 loci associated with IS. Our analysis suggests that DNA methylation changes may contribute to orchestrating gene expression that contributes to IS.","['Soriano-Tarraga, Carolina', 'Lazcano, Uxue', 'Giralt-Steinhauer, Eva',

METHODS AND RESULTS: Synthetic oligonucleotides based on HTLV-1 genome were customized to use as a standard curve. Twelve anti-HTLV-1-positive samples with known HTLV-1 PVL, previously quantified by qPCR assay using TARL-2 cells as a conventional standard curve, were submitted to the new protocol. The proviral quantification levels had a high concordance with qPCR results using a conventional standard curve. The results demonstrate that the conventional standard curve can be replaced by a synthetic standard curve due to its ability to quantification based on the linearity and qPCR efficiency and similar results with a validated qPCR assay using a conventional standard curve. CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic oligonucleotides standard curves could be a very useful tool on HTLV-1 diagnosis and absolute HTLV-1 PVL quantification. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: HTLV-1 PVL determination using synthetic oligonucleotides standard curve by qPCR could be a helpful alternative for the laboratories that monitor infected patients as an important prognostic factor in HTLV-1-associated diseases progression. Also, it can decrease costs and overcome the biological limitations of the plasmid curve.","['Bandeira, L M', 'Puga, M A M', 'de Paula, V S', 'Demarchi, L H F', 'Lichs, G G C', 'Domingos, J A', 'da Cunha, R V', 'Uehara, S N O', 'Motta-Castro, A R C']","['Bandeira LM', 'Puga MAM', 'de Paula VS', 'Demarchi LHF', 'Lichs GGC', 'Domingos JA', 'da Cunha RV', 'Uehara SNO', 'Motta-Castro ARC']","['Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Central Public Health Laboratory, Lacen/MS, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Central Public Health Laboratory, Lacen/MS, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1015-0187', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6514-537X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6314-754X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8693-7897', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6622-7043', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7006-5876', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3070-1337']",['eng'],"['Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz', 'Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior']",['Journal Article'],20200408,England,J Appl Microbiol,Journal of applied microbiology,9706280,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,"['Adult', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Genome, Viral/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*diagnosis/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotides/chemical synthesis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards', 'Viral Load/*methods/standards']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV', 'HTLV-1', 'HTLV-1 proviral load', 'qPCR', 'quantification', 'synthetic oligonucleotides standard curve']",2020/03/24 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jam.14646 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Microbiol. 2020 Sep;129(3):768-774. doi: 10.1111/jam.14646.

Positive results for BFV infection were consistent between AGID and PCR tests. Additionally, we tested for bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infections at nine farms, primarily those containing BFV-infected cows. At each farm, the infection rate of BFV was lower than that of BLV. Further, cattle that were PCR-positive but antibody-negative, indicating immune tolerance to BFV, were not detected.","['Iwasaki, Ryoji', 'Nakagiri, Yu', 'Yaguchi, Yuji', 'Oguma, Keisuke', 'Ono, Mamiko', 'Horikita, Tetsuya', 'Sentsui, Hiroshi']","['Iwasaki R', 'Nakagiri Y', 'Yaguchi Y', 'Oguma K', 'Ono M', 'Horikita T', 'Sentsui H']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan.', 'Ibaraki Kenhoku Animal Hygiene Service Station, Nakakawauchi 966-1, Mito, Ibaraki 310-0002, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200320,Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/blood/epidemiology/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/*epidemiology', 'Immunodiffusion/veterinary', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Spumavirus/isolation & purification']",PMC7273609,,['NOTNLM'],"['bovine foamy virus', 'bovine leukemia virus', 'cattle', 'epidemiology', 'retrovirus']",2020/03/24 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2020/03/24 06:00'],"['2020/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.19-0592 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2020 May 20;82(5):615-618. doi: 10.1292/jvms.19-0592.

Those who do not achieve a hypoplastic marrow, with cellularity < 20% and blasts < 5%, are recommended to undergo 2-cycle induction (2CI). We performed a retrospective analysis to determine the impact of D14 BM characteristics in predicting for remission, association with overall survival (OS), and the effect of 2CI according to the D14 BM results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 70 years undergoing induction therapy with standard ""7 + 3"" regimens were included. D14 cellularity was determined from BMTB samples and the blast percentage was assessed by morphology on BM aspiration and BMTB samples. The outcomes evaluated included the rates of complete remission (CR) and OS. RESULTS: A total of 486 patients with results from D14 BM evaluation were included in the present study. On multivariate analysis, cytogenetic risk and D14 blasts < 5% were predictive of CR/CR with incomplete count recovery (P < .001). Cytogenetic risk (P < .001), age < 60 years (P = .001), and D14 blasts < 5% (P = .045) predicted for OS. 2CI was performed in 131 patients (27%). Patients with hypocellular D14 BM but residual blasts (n = 106) underwent 2CI in 46% of cases, with improved remission rates (43.9% vs. 72.0%; P = .004) but no difference in OS. CONCLUSIONS: The results from D14 BM evaluations are predictive of subsequent remission and OS. Our findings did not show a survival benefit with D14 BM-driven 2CI.","['England, James T', 'Saini, Lalit', 'Hogge, Donna', 'Forrest, Donna', 'Narayanan, Sujaatha', 'Power, Maryse', 'Nevill, Thomas', 'Kuchenbauer, Florian', 'Hudoba, Monika', 'Szkotak, Artur', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Sanford, David']","['England JT', 'Saini L', 'Hogge D', 'Forrest D', 'Narayanan S', 'Power M', 'Nevill T', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Hudoba M', 'Szkotak A', 'Brandwein J', 'Sanford D']","['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

An unsatisfactory response to AML therapy is determined by the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD). The predominance of LSCs might anticipate sustained MRD results. The present study aimed to demonstrate the effect of LSCs on MRD at induction days 14 and 28 on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) and to compare LSC expression with MRD status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 84 patients with de novo adult AML underwent testing using LSC panels for CD38/CD123/CD34/CD45 and CD90/CD133/CD45/CD33 and different regular MRD panels. RESULTS: At day 14 after induction, the high expression of CD123 and CD133 had adverse effects on both OS and DFS (P = .004 and P </= .001 and P </= .001 and P </= .001, respectively). Greater expression of CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) resulted in unfavorable OS and DFS (P </= .001 for both). Both CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) and CD34(-)/CD38(+)/CD123(+) expression at day 14 after induction had an adverse effect on DFS only (P < .001 and P = .029, respectively). On multivariate analysis, CD133 expression and MRD status were independent prognostic parameters (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-4.4; P = .015; and HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.0-7.9; P = .041). At day 28 after induction, MRD and increased CD123(+)/CD34(-), CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+), CD133(+)/CD33(-) expression were associated with inferior OS (P = .016, P = .0035, P = .0.002, and P = .002, respectively). MRD and high expression of CD34(+)CD123(+), CD133(+)/CD33(-), CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) were associated with inferior DFS (P < .001, P = .002, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). On multivariate analysis, only CD133(+)/CD33(-) expression was the independent prognostic factor (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5-6.7; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Estimation of LSC expression is a sensitive indicator of the response to therapy in adult patients with AML and might be a better prognosticator than the findings from regular MRD panels.","['Kandeel, Eman Z', 'El Sharkawy, Nahla', 'Hanafi, Marwa', 'Samra, Mohamed', 'Kamel, Azza']","['Kandeel EZ', 'El Sharkawy N', 'Hanafi M', 'Samra M', 'Kamel A']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.

In particular, the levels of antigen expression at the cell surface may determine antibody-mediated cell death. This parameter has a clear effect on outcome in patients undergoing immunotherapy. In this context, CD20 which is expressed in the membrane of B cells has received significant attention as target for immunotherapy of leukemia and lymphoma using the monoclonal antibody rituximab. To systematically study the impact of CD20 density on antibody recognition, we designed self-assembled monolayers that display tunable CD20 epitope densities. For this purpose, we developed in situ click chemistry to functionalize SPR sensor chips. We find that the rituximab binding affinity depends sensitively and nonmonotonously on CD20 surface density. Strongest binding, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD = 32 nM) close to values previously reported from in vitro analysis with B cells (apparent KD between 5 and 19 nM), was obtained for an average inter-antigen spacing of 2 nm. This distance is required for improving rituximab recognition, and in agreement with the known requirement of CD20 to form clusters to elicit a biological response.

Thus, there is an unmet need for new treatment strategies to improve outcomes in this setting. Suppression of apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of anticancer drug resistance. Hence, over the past few years, antiapoptotic proteins have become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in several hematologic malignancies. Venetoclax (ABT-199) is a novel, orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), a key regulator of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Recent preclinical studies have suggested that inhibition of BCL-2 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with T-ALL. Herein, we report a case of clinical response to venetoclax in combination with a hypomethylating agent in a patient with relapsed T-ALL after allogeneic stem cell transplant and review the existing literature.","['Farhadfar, Nosha', 'Li, Ying', 'May, William S', 'Adams, Carolyn Brooke']","['Farhadfar N', 'Li Y', 'May WS', 'Adams CB']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.

They are intimately linked to cellular metabolism through the consumption of NAD(+). PARP1/ARTD1 in the nucleus is the major NAD(+) consuming activity and plays a key role in maintaining genomic integrity. SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this review, we discuss how different organelles are linked through NAD(+) metabolism and how PARP1 activation in the nucleus can impact the function of distant organelles. We discuss how differentiated cells tame PARP1 function by upregulating an endogenous inhibitor, the histone variant macroH2A1.1. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The presence of macroH2A1.1, particularly in differentiated cells, raises the threshold for the activation of PARP1 with consequences for DNA repair, gene transcription, and NAD(+) homeostasis.","['Hurtado-Bages, Sarah', 'Knobloch, Gunnar', 'Ladurner, Andreas G', 'Buschbeck, Marcus']","['Hurtado-Bages S', 'Knobloch G', 'Ladurner AG', 'Buschbeck M']","['Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08916, Badalona, Spain; Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Center Munich, Physiological Chemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, 82152, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany.', 'Biomedical Center Munich, Physiological Chemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, 82152, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany; Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, 81377, Munich, Germany; Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (SyNergy), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, 81377, Munich, Germany.

The pathologic features of this hematologic malignancy include myeloproliferation, diffuse bone marrow fibrosis, and overactivation of the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in enhanced inflammatory cytokine release. The common clinical manifestations of MF include systemic symptoms, abnormal peripheral blood count levels, and splenomegaly. However, it has become increasingly appreciated that significant clinical heterogeneity exists among patients with MF. Two distinct MF clinical phenotypes include the myeloproliferative and myelodepletive phenotype, with peripheral blood counts being the main discerning feature. Patients with the myeloproliferative phenotype will present with elevated peripheral blood counts and often experience significant constitutional symptoms and progressive splenomegaly. In contrast, patients with the myelodepletive phenotype will have low peripheral blood counts and will frequently require transfusion support.

Data regarding the outcomes of such patients are sparse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 90 consecutive patients with ALL who presented to Harbor-UCLA between 2003 and 2018. The primary objective was overall survival (OS), whereas secondary objectives included leukemia-free survival, toxicities of therapy, and referral for HCT and incidence of successful HCT. RESULTS: Most patients were male (56.7%) and Hispanic (72.2%). The median age of diagnosis was 36 years (range, 18-63 years). The median OS was 26.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.4-59.0 months). In patients who achieved complete remission with therapy, the median leukemia-free survival was 16.4 months. Fifty percent of patients experienced at least 1 episode of bacteremia, and nearly 25% of patients developed an invasive fungal infection. Thirty-six percent (n = 32) of patients were referred for HCT. The referral rate increased over time, which led to improved OS in patients who underwent evaluation at a tertiary cancer center (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.89; P = .02). Patients who underwent HCT had significantly better OS compared with those who did not (OS not reached vs. 21.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04-0.68; P = .01). CONCLUSION: Risk stratification and evidence-based treatment approaches are important for patients with ALL treated in a resource-limited setting. Most patients can be induced successfully and achieve complete remission with therapy. Partnership with a cancer center with early referral for HCT can facilitate curative HCT to be performed.","['Gupta, Rohan', 'Othman, Tamer', 'Uche, An', 'Amanam, Idoroenyi', 'Chen, Chen', 'Celles, Larissa', 'Lane, Gregorianna', 'Mei, Matthew', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Pullarkat, Vinod', 'Kim, Phyllis', 'Yeh, James']","['Gupta R', 'Othman T', 'Uche A', 'Amanam I', 'Chen C', 'Celles L', 'Lane G', 'Mei M', 'Aldoss I', 'Pullarkat V', 'Kim P', 'Yeh J']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA; Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplant, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA; Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplant, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Center for Informatics, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplant, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplant, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplant, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA.

There is a risk of GVHD other than leukemia relapse after allogeneic HSCT that activation of donor NK cells in the absence of appropriate inhibitory ligands will be one of the reasons. To investigate the impact of donor KIRs and recipient KIR/HLA class I combinations on GVHD and leukemia relapse in patients with acute leukemia after HSCT, 100 patients with acute leukemia who received HSCT from their HLA-matched siblings were included in this study. Genotypes of 16 KIR genes and two 2DS4 variants (full length and deleted alleles), along with HLA-A/B genotypes, were determined by PCR-SSP. HLA-C genotyping was done with the SSO-Luminex method. Chimerism analysis was done using 16 short tandem repeats (STRs) to detect early leukemia relapse. Acute (a)GVHD occurred in 38 patients, and 16 of them died during the study. None of the recipients showed any sign of leukemia relapse after HSCT. Full donor chimerism was observed in all tested patients during the first year after HSCT. Our results also indicated an increased risk of aGVHD in AA recipients with the C2/Cx, Bw4(+) (or A-Bw4(+)) or HLA-A3(-)/A11(-) genotypes who received HSCT from Bx donors. Our results showed that donor selection based on donor-recipient KIR genotypes and recipient HLA class I status can improve the outcome of HSCT.","['Mansouri, Marzieh', 'Villard, Jean', 'Ramzi, Mani', 'Alavianmehr, Ali', 'Farjadian, Shirin']","['Mansouri M', 'Villard J', 'Ramzi M', 'Alavianmehr A', 'Farjadian S']","['Department of Immunology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Immunology and Transplant Unit, National Reference Laboratory for Histocompatibility (LNRH), Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Recurrence of and death associated with ALL remain the main concerns for mothers. Mothers experience guilt and anxiety towards their child's cancer. DESIGN: Descriptive phenomenological study. METHODS: Twelve mothers were recruited from a medical centre in Central Taiwan. The mothers were primary caregivers for their child diagnosed as having ALL in the past 3 months to 1 year. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analysed using Colaizzi's method. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: feeling this world crashing by knowing the diagnosis, feeling the double-edged sword of mothering, worrying about potential risks for their vulnerable child, and passing through difficulties with power of support. CONCLUSIONS: Most mothers felt this world crashing due to potential loss of their child and seeing their child's suffering. The mother was blamed for her child's cancer but was also required to shoulder all caregiving for their child. The mothers needed to compromise their lives to protect their child from potential infection. Perceived power of support helped the mothers overcome difficulties. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Findings support that nurses encouraging mothers to tell their stories, regardless of culture, will facilitate healing. Establishing trust and providing support from nurses, physicians, psychologists and social workers will lead mothers' readiness to deal with care of their sick child. Increasing visiting time for parental support for children hospitalized in the PICU is suggested as well.","['Chen, Chun-Fei', 'Huang, Fang-Liang', 'Chen, Yueh-Chih', 'Wang, I-Fan', 'Huang, Yu-Ping']","['Chen CF', 'Huang FL', 'Chen YC', 'Wang IF', 'Huang YP']","['Department of Nursing, HungKuang University, Taiwan.

Standard of care includes chemotherapy and/or the combination of zidovudine and interferon-alpha. However, most patients experience relapse less than 6 months after diagnosis. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment, but is only feasible in a minority of cases. We previously showed in a mouse model that Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) targets ATL leukemia initiating cells. RESULTS: As2O3 consolidation was given in 9 patients with ATL (lymphoma n = 4; acute n = 2; and indolent n = 3), who were in complete (n = 4) and partial (n = 3) remission, in stable (n = 1) and in progressive (n = 1) disease. Patients received up to 8 weeks of As2O3 at the dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day intravenously in combination with zidovudine and interferon-alpha. One patient in progression died rapidly. Of the remaining eight patients, three with indolent ATL subtype showed overall survivals of 48, 53 and 97 months, and duration of response to As2O3 of 22, 25 and 73 months. The other 5 patients with aggressive ATL subtype had median OS of 36 months and a median duration of response of 10 months. Side effects were mostly hematological and cutaneous (one grade 3) and reversible with dose reduction of AZT/IFN and/or As2O3 discontinuation. The virus integration analysis revealed the regression of the predominant malignant clone in one patient with a chronic subtype. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that consolidation with As2O3 could be an option for patients with ATL in response after induction therapy and who are not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Marcais, Ambroise', 'Cook, Lucy', 'Witkover, Aviva', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Avettand-Fenoel, Veronique', 'Delarue, Richard', 'Cheminant, Morgane', 'Sibon, David', 'Frenzel, Laurent', 'de The, Hugues', 'Bangham, Charles R M', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Suarez, Felipe']","['Marcais A', 'Cook L', 'Witkover A', 'Asnafi V', 'Avettand-Fenoel V', 'Delarue R', 'Cheminant M', 'Sibon D', 'Frenzel L', 'de The H', 'Bangham CRM', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Hermine O', 'Suarez F']","[""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, Institut Imagine, Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, APHP, Universite de Paris, 149-161 rue de Sevres, 75743, Paris Cedex 15, France. ambroise.marcais@aphp.fr."", 'Section of Virology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College, London, UK.', 'Section of Virology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College, London, UK.', ""Laboratoire d'onco-hematologie, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, INSERM U1151, Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, APHP, Universite de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Laboratoire de Microbiologie, Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, APHP, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, Institut Imagine, Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, APHP, Universite de Paris, 149-161 rue de Sevres, 75743, Paris Cedex 15, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, Institut Imagine, Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, APHP, Universite de Paris, 149-161 rue de Sevres, 75743, Paris Cedex 15, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, Institut Imagine, Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, APHP, Universite de Paris, 149-161 rue de Sevres, 75743, Paris Cedex 15, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, Institut Imagine, Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, APHP, Universite de Paris, 149-161 rue de Sevres, 75743, Paris Cedex 15, France."", ""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France."", 'Section of Virology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College, London, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, Institut Imagine, Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, APHP, Universite de Paris, 149-161 rue de Sevres, 75743, Paris Cedex 15, France. ohermine@gmail.com."", ""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, Institut Imagine, Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, APHP, Universite de Paris, 149-161 rue de Sevres, 75743, Paris Cedex 15, France. felipe.suarez@aphp.fr.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2574-3874'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200321,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Adult', 'Arsenic Trioxide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use']",PMC7085150,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL', '*Arsenic trioxide']",2020/03/23 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/03/23 06:00'],"['2019/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-020-0513-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-020-0513-y [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2020 Mar 21;17(1):5. doi: 10.1186/s12977-020-0513-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous study found that sorafenib had inhibitory effects in rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA). The present study investigated the role of sorafenib in the induction of AA FLS apoptosis in vitro. FLSs obtained from AA rats were cultured in vitro and identified. Cell apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) labeling methods. Real-time PCR and Western blotting assays were used to quantify the expression levels of Fas, Caspase-3, Mcl-1, NF-kappaB and C-jun gene products in AA FLSs. Our data revealed that sorafenib (4 mumol/L) induced apoptosis in AA FLSs, and flow cytometry analysis showed that AA FLSs treated with sorafenib (4 mumol/L) in vitro accumulated in early and late apoptosis. There were significant increases in the expression levels of Fas, Caspase-3 and Mcl-1, and significant decreases in NF-kappaB and C-jun expression in AA FLSs treated with sorafenib. In summary, these results demonstrate that sorafenib promotes AA FLS apoptosis, which may be related to the upregulation of Fas and Caspase-3 and downregulation of NF-kappaB and C-jun. All of these findings suggest that sorafenib exerts an inhibitory effect on AA rats in vivo via AA FLS apoptotic induction, which has potential therapeutic implications for RA.","['Wang, Zhen-Zhen', 'Huang, Tian-Yu', 'Gong, Yong-Fang', 'Zhang, Xiao-Ming', 'Feng-Wang', 'Huang, Xue-Ying']","['Wang ZZ', 'Huang TY', 'Gong YF', 'Zhang XM', 'Feng-Wang', 'Huang XY']","['Department of Anatomy, Anhui Medical University, 81 Meishan Road, Hefei 230032, China.', 'Grade 2016, The First Department of Clinical Medicine, Bengbu Medical College, 2600 Donghai Road, Bengbu 233030, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Anhui Medical University, 81 Meishan Road, Hefei 230032, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Anhui Medical University, 81 Meishan Road, Hefei 230032, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Anhui Medical University, 81 Meishan Road, Hefei 230032, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Anhui Medical University, 81 Meishan Road, Hefei 230032, China.

Potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) of FLT3-ITD entered clinical trials and showed a promising, but transient success due to the occurrence of secondary drug-resistant AML clones. A further caveat of drugs targeting FLT3-ITD is the co-targeting of other RTKs which are required for normal hematopoiesis. This is observed quite frequently. Therefore, novel drugs are necessary to treat AML effectively and safely. Recently bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones were found to inhibit FLT3 and PDGFR kinases. In order to optimize these agents we synthesized novel derivatives of these methanones with various substituents. Methanone 16 and its carbamate derivative 17b inhibit FLT3-ITD at least as potently as the TKi AC220 (quizartinib). Models indicate corresponding interactions of 16 and quizartinib with FLT3. The activity of 16 is accompanied by a high selectivity for FLT3-ITD.","['Sellmer, Andreas', 'Pilsl, Bernadette', 'Beyer, Mandy', 'Pongratz, Herwig', 'Wirth, Lukas', 'Elz, Sigurd', 'Dove, Stefan', 'Henninger, Sven Julian', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Polzer, Harald', 'Klaeger, Susan', 'Kuster, Bernhard', 'Bohmer, Frank D', 'Fiebig, Heinz-Herbert', 'Kramer, Oliver H', 'Mahboobi, Siavosh']","['Sellmer A', 'Pilsl B', 'Beyer M', 'Pongratz H', 'Wirth L', 'Elz S', 'Dove S', 'Henninger SJ', 'Spiekermann K', 'Polzer H', 'Klaeger S', 'Kuster B', 'Bohmer FD', 'Fiebig HH', 'Kramer OH', 'Mahboobi S']","['Institute of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Regensburg, 93040, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Regensburg, 93040, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Regensburg, 93040, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Regensburg, 93040, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Regensburg, 93040, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Regensburg, 93040, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Munchen, Wissenschaftszentrum Weihenstephan fur Ernahrung, Landnutzung und Umwelt, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Munchen, Wissenschaftszentrum Weihenstephan fur Ernahrung, Landnutzung und Umwelt, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Jena - Bachstrasse 18 - D-07743 Jena, Germany.', '4HF Biotec GmbH, Am Flughafen 14, 79108, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Regensburg, 93040, Regensburg, Germany.

The incidence is about 3-5% in newly diagnosed MM patients, but has been reported in up to 20% patients in the relapsed MM setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Presence of EMD has been associated with more aggressive phenotype of MM, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme, and high-risk cytogenetics [deletion 17p, translocation (4;14), translocation (14;16)]. There are several hypotheses of how EMD occurs, including factors leading to bone marrow emancipation and hematogenous spread. The treatment schema usually follows that of high-risk MM.

Over the last decade evidence has emerged supporting the positive impact that physical activity has on long-term conditions. Previous concerns were raised about the risks of hypoglycaemia in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) thus limiting participation in sports. Importantly, physical activity improves the metabolic profile, bone mineral density, cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity while lowering mortality risk in children with T1DM. Children with asthma were prevented from doing exercise due to concerns about precipitating an acute asthmatic episode. To the contrary, physical activity interventions have consistently shown an increase in cardiovascular fitness, physical capacity, asthma-free days and quality of life in childhood asthmatics. Children with epilepsy are often excluded from sports due to concerns relating to increased seizure frequency, yet evidence suggests that this is not the case. The evidence supporting physical activity in childhood survivors of cancer is growing but still primarily confined to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Participation in sports and physical activity also reduces mental health problems developing in adolescence. While further research is required to investigate benefits of physical activity on specific aspects of long-term conditions in children, in general this group should be advised to increase participation in sports and exercise as a means of improving long-term physical and mental health.","['Dimitri, Paul', 'Joshi, Kush', 'Jones, Natasha']","['Dimitri P', 'Joshi K', 'Jones N']","[""Paediatric Endocrinology, Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK Paul.Dimitri@sch.nhs.uk."", 'Faculty of Sports and Exercise Medicine, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK.', 'Faculty of Sports and Exercise Medicine, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200320,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asthma/physiopathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease/*therapy', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/physiopathology/therapy', 'Epilepsy/physiopathology/therapy', 'Exercise/*physiology/psychology', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Neoplasms/physiopathology/therapy']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*asthma', '*cancer', '*children', '*diabetes', '*epilepsy', '*mental health', '*physical activity', '*sport']",2020/03/22 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/03/22 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['archdischild-2019-318017 [pii]', '10.1136/archdischild-2019-318017 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2020 Nov;105(11):1035-1040. doi: 10.1136/archdischild-2019-318017.

Patient management following venetoclax discontinuation remains nonstandard and poorly understood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To address this, we conducted a large international study to identify a cohort of 326 patients who discontinued venetoclax and have been subsequently treated. Coprimary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival for the post-venetoclax treatments stratified by treatment type [Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki), and cellular therapies]. RESULTS: We identified patients with CLL who discontinued venetoclax in the first-line (4%) and relapsed/refractory settings (96%). Patients received a median of three therapies prior to venetoclax; 40% were BTKi naive (n = 130), and 81% were idelalisib naive (n = 263). ORR to BTKi was 84% (n = 44) in BTKi-naive patients versus 54% (n = 30) in BTKi-exposed patients. We demonstrate therapy selection following venetoclax requires prior novel agent exposure consideration and discontinuation reasons. CONCLUSIONS: For BTKi-naive patients, selection of covalently binding BTKis results in high ORR and durable remissions. For BTKi-exposed patients, covalent BTK inhibition is not effective in the setting of BTKi resistance. PI3Kis following venetoclax do not appear to result in durable remissions. We conclude that BTKi in naive or previously responsive patients and cellular therapies following venetoclax may be the most effective strategies.See related commentary by Rogers, p. 3501.","['Mato,

The side effect profile of ibrutinib is unique compared with chemoimmunotherapy and includes atrial fibrillation, increased bleeding risk, and arthralgias/myalgias. Although common, arthralgias/myalgias and their management are poorly described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 214 patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib (as a single agent or in combination) from 2011 to 2018 at the University of Pennsylvania. RESULTS: In this cohort, 36% (76/214) of patients developed arthralgias/myalgias during follow-up with a median onset of 34.5 months. Most (79%) events were grade 1 or 2. Risk factors for developing arthralgias/myalgias included younger age at start of ibrutinib, female gender, and ibrutinib use as first treatment. Twenty-eight percent of patients with grade 1 or 2 toxicity continued ibrutinib and had resolution of symptoms. Dose holds were frequently used to manage this toxicity, and this strategy was more successful than dose reduction. Sixty-two percent of patients with grade 3 toxicity ultimately discontinued ibrutinib. Supportive care measures such as discontinuing statins or use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, or corticosteroids were not used frequently enough in this cohort to evaluate their efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies to determine the mechanism of ibrutinib-related arthralgias/myalgias are needed to develop optimal management strategies.","['Rhodes, Joanna M', 'LoRe, Vincent A 3rd', 'Mato, Anthony R', 'Chong, Elise A', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', 'Gerson, James N', 'Barta, Stefan K', 'Landsburg, Daniel J', 'Nasta, Sunita Dwivedy', 'Svoboda, Jakub', 'Loren, Alison W', 'Schuster, Stephen J']","['Rhodes JM', 'LoRe VA 3rd', 'Mato AR', 'Chong EA', 'Barrientos JC', 'Gerson JN', 'Barta SK', 'Landsburg DJ', 'Nasta SD', 'Svoboda J', 'Loren AW', 'Schuster SJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwell Health Cancer Institute, New Hyde Park, NY; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.

Patients with MDS have an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although the molecular basis of MDS is heterogeneous, several studies demonstrated the significant contribution of the dysregulated immune system in accelerating MDS progression. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is shown to induce tolerance of MDS blasts, which may result in a further accumulation of genetic aberrations and lead to the disease progression. Increasing evidence shows an expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a population of inflammation-associated immature cells, in patients with MDS. Interestingly, the increased MDSC populations are shown to be correlated with a risk of disease progression in MDS. In addition, MDS is highly prevalent in aged individuals with non-hematology co-morbidities who are fragile for chemotherapy. Increasing research effort is devoting to identify novel agents to specific targeting of the MDSC population for MDS treatment.","['Syed, Khaja', 'Naguib, Sara', 'Liu, Zhao-Jun', 'Cimmino, Luisa', 'Yang, Feng-Chun']","['Syed K', 'Naguib S', 'Liu ZJ', 'Cimmino L', 'Yang FC']","['University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, 33136, USA. kxs837@med.miami.edu.', 'Janssen Research and Development, Malvern, PA, 19477, USA.', 'University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, 33136, USA.', 'University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, 33136, USA.', 'UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200320,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,,IM,"['Aged', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics', '*Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC7083030,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemic stem cells', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*Myeloid-derived suppressor cells', '*T regulatory cells', '*Therapeutic antibodies', '*Transfusion independent']",2020/03/22 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/03/22 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-020-01647-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-020-01647-1 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2020 Mar 20;11(1):132. doi: 10.1186/s13287-020-01647-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific activation of Notch signaling in CML cells by ponatinib can be considered as the ""on-target effect"" on the tumor and represents a therapeutic approach for CML. Nevertheless, ponatinib-induced vascular toxicity remains a serious concern, with underlying mechanisms being poorly understood. We aimed to determine the mechanisms of ponatinib-induced vascular toxicity, defining associated signaling pathways and identifying potential rescue strategies. We exposed human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) to ponatinib or vehicle in the presence or absence of the neutralizing factor anti-Notch-1 antibody for exposure times of 0-72 h. Label-free proteomics and network analysis showed that protein cargo of HUVECs treated with ponatinib triggered apoptosis and inhibited vasculature development. We validated the proteomic data showing the inhibition of matrigel tube formation, an up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 and a downregulation of phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated eNOS. We delineated the signaling of ponatinib-induced vascular toxicity, demonstrating that ponatinib inhibits endothelial survival, reduces angiogenesis and induces endothelial senescence and apoptosis via the Notch-1 pathway. Ponatinib induced endothelial toxicity in vitro. Hyperactivation of Notch-1 in the vessels can lead to abnormal vascular development and vascular dysfunction. By hyperactivating Notch-1 in the vessels, ponatinib exerts an ""on-target off tumor effect"", which leads to deleterious effects and may explain the drug's vasculotoxicity. Selective blockade of Notch-1 prevented ponatinib-induced vascular toxicity.","['Madonna, Rosalinda', 'Pieragostino, Damiana', 'Cufaro, Maria Concetta', 'Doria, Vanessa', 'Del Boccio, Piero', 'Deidda, Martino', 'Pierdomenico, Sante Donato', 'Dessalvi, Christian Cadeddu', 'De Caterina, Raffaele', 'Mercuro, Giuseppe']","['Madonna R', 'Pieragostino D', 'Cufaro MC', 'Doria V', 'Del Boccio P', 'Deidda M', 'Pierdomenico SD', 'Dessalvi CC', 'De Caterina R', 'Mercuro G']","['Institute of Cardiology, University of Pisa, 56124 Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology Division, McGovern School of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', ""Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, University ''G.

SMARCA5 transcriptionally inhibits the myeloid master regulator PU.1. Upregulation of SMARCA5 was previously observed in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Since high levels of SMARCA5 are necessary for intensive cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of developing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in mice, we reasoned that removal of SMARCA5 enzymatic activity could affect the cycling or undifferentiated state of leukemic progenitor-like clones. Indeed, we observed that CRISPR/cas9-mediated SMARCA5 knockout in AML cell lines (S5KO) inhibited the cell cycle progression. We also observed that the SMARCA5 deletion induced karyorrhexis and nuclear budding as well as increased the ploidy, indicating its role in mitotic division of AML cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 29 patients with HR-ALL in CR1 after treatment according to protocol ALL IC-BFM 2002 (14 with allo-HSCT conditioned with fractionated total body irradiation [FTBI] and 15 without HSCT) and 16 children with newly diagnosed ALL (control group). The median time from therapy completion to evaluation was 5 years. To assess brain status, volumetric T1-weighted sequences of magnetic resonance imaging were used. Neuropsychological assessment based on battery neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Transplanted patients had significantly lower volumes of white and gray matter (P = .048 and P < .001) and also of subcortical structures, including the thalamus (P < .001), the hippocampus (P = .007), the putamen (P = .011), the globus pallidus (P = .001), and the accumbens (P < .001). In addition, these patients had generally lower cognitive performance, especially in vocabulary (P = .011), visuospatial ability (P = .047), executive functions and attention (P = .034; P = .002; P = .048), and processing speed (P = .049 and P = .037). The thalamus volume is correlated with neuropsychological performance in verbal functions (P < .001), executive functions (P < .001 and P = .024), and processing speed (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients treated for ALL, FTBI-based preparative regimen preceding allo-HSCT causes reduction of subcortical structure volumes and decline in cognitive performance. The observed long-term structural and functional CNS sequelae are significantly more pronounced in transplanted HR-ALL patients than in those treated with prophylactic CNS- radiotherapy only.","['Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Pawlak, Mikolaj A', 'Karmelita-Katulska, Katarzyna', 'Pilarczyk, Jakub', 'Jonczyk-Potoczna, Katarzyna', 'Przepiora, Agnieszka', 'Derwich, Katarzyna', 'Pieczonka, Anna', 'Wachowiak, Jacek']","['Zajac-Spychala O', 'Pawlak MA', 'Karmelita-Katulska K', 'Pilarczyk J', 'Jonczyk-Potoczna K', 'Przepiora A', 'Derwich K', 'Pieczonka A', 'Wachowiak J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Neurology and Cerebrovascular Disorders, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Neuroradiology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Radiology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Radiology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8836-8605', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8607-0194']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200320,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*etiology/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CNS prophylaxis', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*brain', '*cognitive functioning', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",2020/03/21 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28224 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Jun;67(6):e28224. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28224.

Unlike leukemia in older children where survival rates are generally favorable, infants with leukemia have a 5-year event-free survival rate of <50%. The majority of infant leukemias are characterized by KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements (~70 to 80% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia), which appear to be drivers of early leukemogenesis. In this report, we describe three cases: a 9-month-old female infant with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), an 8-month-old female presenting with B/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and a 16-month-old male with B-ALL. The first case had a normal karyotype and B-ALL FISH results consistent with an atypical KMT2A rearrangement. The second case had trisomy 10 as the sole chromosomal abnormality and a normal KMT2A FISH result. Case 3 had trisomy 8 and a t(11;15)(q23;q21), an atypical KMT2A rearrangement by FISH studies, and a focal deletion of 15q with a breakpoint within the USP8 gene by chromosomal microarray. Mate pair sequencing was performed on all three cases and identified a KMT2A-USP2 rearrangement (cases 1 and 2) or a KMT2A-USP8 rearrangement (case 3). These recently characterized KMT2A fusions have been described exclusively in infant and pediatric leukemia cases where the incidence varies vary according to leukemia subtype, are considered high-risk, with a high incidence of central nervous system involvement, poor response to initial prednisone treatment, and poor event free survival. Additionally, approximately half of cases are unable to be resolved using standard cytogenetic approaches and are likely under recognized. Therefore, targeted molecular approaches are suggested in genetically unresolved infant leukemia cases to characterize these prognostically relevant clones.","['Blackburn, Patrick R', 'Smadbeck, James B', 'Znoyko, Iya', 'Webley, Matthew R', 'Pitel, Beth A', 'Vasmatzis, George', 'Xu, Xinjie', 'Greipp, Patricia T', 'Hoppman, Nicole L', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Baughn, Linda B', 'Lindsey, Kathryn G', 'Schandl, Cynthia A', 'Wolff, Daynna J', 'Peterson, Jess F']","['Blackburn PR', 'Smadbeck JB', 'Znoyko I', 'Webley MR', 'Pitel BA', 'Vasmatzis G', 'Xu X', 'Greipp PT', 'Hoppman NL', 'Ketterling RP', 'Baughn LB', 'Lindsey KG', 'Schandl CA', 'Wolff DJ', 'Peterson JF']","['Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Center for Individualized Medicine-Biomarker Discovery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Center for Individualized Medicine-Biomarker Discovery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0658-1275', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8902-0950', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2496-8000']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200326,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Endopeptidases/genetics', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Testing/methods', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['* KMT2A', '* USP2', '* USP8', '*B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL)', '*infant leukemia', '*mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL)']",2020/03/21 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22842 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2020 Jul;59(7):422-427. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22842.

Using gene set enrichment analysis and gene ontology, overrepresented pathways in ATL vs AC included angiogenesis, inflammation by cytokines and chemokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6)/JAK/STAT3, and notch signaling. In selecting candidate biomarkers, we focused on soluble tumor necrosis factor 2 (sTNFR2) because of its active role in enriched pathways, extreme significance (Welch's t test P < .00001), high discrimination capacity (area under the curve >0.90), and novelty in ATL research. Quantification of sTNFR2 in 102 plasma samples (AC, n = 30; ATL, n = 68; remission, n = 4) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed remarkable elevations in acute ATL, at least 10 times those of AC samples, and return of sTNFR2 to AC state levels after achieving remission. Flow cytometry and immunostaining validated the expression of TNFR2 in ATL cells. No correlation between sIL-2 and sTNFR2 levels in acute ATL was found, suggesting the possibility of sTNFR2 as an independent biomarker. Our findings represent the first extensive blood-based proteomic analysis of ATL, suggesting the potential clinical utility of sTNFR2 in diagnosing acute ATL.","['Guerrero, Carmina Louise Hugo', 'Yamashita, Yoshiko', 'Miyara, Megumi', 'Imaizumi, Naoki', 'Kato, Megumi', 'Sakihama, Shugo', 'Hayashi, Masaki', 'Miyagi, Takashi', 'Karimata, Kaori', 'Uchihara, Junnosuke', 'Ohshiro, Kazuiku', 'Todoroki, Junpei', 'Nakachi, Sawako', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Masuzaki, Hiroaki', 'Fukushima, Takuya']","['Guerrero CLH', 'Yamashita Y', 'Miyara M', 'Imaizumi N', 'Kato M', 'Sakihama S', 'Hayashi M', 'Miyagi T', 'Karimata K', 'Uchihara J', 'Ohshiro K', 'Todoroki J', 'Nakachi S', 'Morishima S', 'Karube K', 'Tanaka Y', 'Masuzaki H', 'Fukushima T']","['Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'AI Drug Development Division, NEC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Health and Nutrition, Faculty of Health and Nutrition, Okinawa University, Naha, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Health Sciences, and.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nakagami Hospital, Okinawa City, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Heart Life Hospital, Nakagusuku, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Heart Life Hospital, Nakagusuku, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Naha City Hospital, Naha, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Okinawa Prefectural Nambu Medical Center and Children's Medical Center, Haebaru, Japan."", 'Department of Hematology, Chubu Tokushukai Hospital, Nakagami, Japan; and.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, and.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytokines', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis', 'Proteomics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II']",PMC7094015,,,,2020/03/21 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2020/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31428-2 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001429 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 24;4(6):1062-1071. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001429.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,['Blood Adv. 2020 Apr 28;4(8):1647.

No overall survival differences were observed between patients initiating first- and second-generation TKIs in trials; however, real-world safety and cost outcomes are unclear. We evaluated comparative safety and health care expenditures between first-line imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib among patients with CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had one or more fills for imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib in the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016 (earliest fill is the index date), 6 months pre-index continuous enrollment, CML diagnosis, and no TKI use in the pre-index period. Hospitalizations or emergency department visits (safety events) were compared across treatment groups using propensity-score-weighted 1-year relative risks (RRs) and subdistribution hazard ratios (HRs). Inflation-adjusted annual health care expenditures were compared using quantile regression. RESULTS: Eligible patients included 1,417 receiving imatinib, 1,067 receiving dasatinib, and 647 receiving nilotinib. The 1-year risk of safety events was high: imatinib, 37%; dasatinib, 44%; and nilotinib, 40%, with higher risks among patients receiving dasatinib (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.30) and nilotinib (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.23) compared with those receiving imatinib. Over a median of 1.7 years, the cumulative incidence of safety events was higher among patients receiving dasatinib (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.38) and nilotinib (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.24) than among those receiving imatinib. One-year health care expenditures were high (median, $125,987) and were significantly higher among patients initiating second-generation TKIs compared with those receiving imatinib (difference in medians: dasatinib v imatinib, $22,393; 95% CI, $17,068 to $27,718; nilotinib v imatinib, $19,463; 95% CI, $14,689 to $24,236). CONCLUSION: Patients receiving imatinib had the lowest risk of hospitalization or emergency department visits and 1-year health care expenditures. Given a lack of significant differences in overall survival, imatinib may represent the ideal first-line therapy for patients, on average.","['Cole, Ashley L', 'Wood, William A Jr', 'Muluneh, Benyam', 'Lund, Jennifer L', 'Elston Lafata, Jennifer', 'Dusetzina, Stacie B']","['Cole AL', 'Wood WA Jr', 'Muluneh B', 'Lund JL', 'Elston Lafata J', 'Dusetzina SB']","['Division of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of North Carolina (UNC) Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Cecil G.

We previously reported that gefitinib (GEF) and imatinib (IMA) induce autophagy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) knock-out A549 and non-BCR-ABL-expressing leukemia cell lines, respectively. This evidence suggests that TKI-induced autophagy is independent of the original target molecules. The present study compared the autophagy-inducing abilities of various TKIs, regardless of their targets, by quantitative autophagy flux assay. We established stable clones expressing the GFP-LC3-mCherry-LC3DeltaG plasmid in A549, PC-9, and CAL 27 cell lines and assessed autophagy inducibility by monitoring the fluorescent ratios of GFP-LC3 to mCherry-LC3DeltaG using an IncuCyte live cell imaging system during exposure to TKIs viz; GEF, osimertinib (OSI), lapatinib (LAP), lenvatinib (LEN), sorafenib (SOR), IMA, dasatinib (DAS), and tivantinib (TIV). Among these TKIs, DAS, GEF, and SOR exhibited prominent autophagy induction in A549 and PC-9 cells. In CAL 27 cells, IMA, SOR, and LEN, but not GEF, TIV, or OSI, exhibited autophagy induction. In the presence of azithromycin (AZM), which showed an inhibitory effect on autophagy flux, TKIs with prominent autophagy inducibility exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity via non-apoptotic cell death relative to effects of TKI alone. Therefore, autophagy inducibility of TKIs differed in the context of cancer cells. However, once induced, they appeared to have cytoprotective functions. Thus, blocking TKI-induced autophagy with AZM may improve the therapeutic effect of TKIs in cancer cells.","['Tanaka, Hideki', 'Hino, Hirotsugu', 'Moriya, Shota', 'Kazama, Hiromi', 'Miyazaki, Masaya', 'Takano, Naoharu', 'Hiramoto, Masaki', 'Tsukahara, Kiyoaki', 'Miyazawa, Keisuke']","['Tanaka H', 'Hino H', 'Moriya S', 'Kazama H', 'Miyazaki M', 'Takano N', 'Hiramoto M', 'Tsukahara K', 'Miyazawa K']","['Department of Otolaryngology (Head and Neck Surgery), Tokyo Medical University Hospital, 6-7-1, Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0023, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, 6-1-1 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8402, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, 6-1-1 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8402, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, 6-1-1 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8402, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, 6-1-1 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8402, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, 6-1-1 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8402, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, 6-1-1 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8402, Japan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology (Head and Neck Surgery), Tokyo Medical University Hospital, 6-7-1, Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0023, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, 6-1-1 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8402, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200317,Netherlands,Biochem Biophys Rep,Biochemistry and biophysics reports,101660999,,,,PMC7078496,,['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagy', 'Cancer', 'Macrolide antibiotics', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'azithromycin, AZM', 'bafilomycin A1, BAF', 'dasatinib, DAS', 'gefitinib, GEF', 'imatinib, IMA', 'lapatinib, LAP', 'lenvatinib, LEN', 'osimertinib, OSI', 'receptor tyrosine kinase, RTK', 'sorafenib, SOR', 'tivantinib, TIV', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs']",2020/03/21 06:00,2020/03/21 06:01,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.bbrep.2020.100750 [doi]', 'S2405-5808(20)30059-5 [pii]', '100750 [pii]']",epublish,Biochem Biophys Rep. 2020 Mar 17;22:100750. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrep.2020.100750. eCollection 2020 Jul.,,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,['Biochem Biophys Rep. 2021 Jan 06;25:100900.

Moreover, the identification of tumor-specific targets has great importance in T-cell therapies. For decades, T cell activity has been stimulated to improve anti-tumor activity. Bispecific antibodies have attracted strong interest from pharmaceutical companies, for their diagnostic and therapeutic use. Blinatumomab is a first-in-class bispecific T engager antibody for the treatment of relapsed or refractory precursor B- cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. But, it can benefit several cases with CD19(+) malignancies in the future. PhiC31 integrase-based vectors could selectively integrate therapeutic transgenes into pseudo-attP sites in CHO genome. In this study, production of Blinatumomab in CHO cells using this type of vectors was investigated. We evaluated the effects of histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors such as sodium butyrate and valproic acid, on specific productivity and cell viability of antibody expressing cells. Although sodium butyrate increased specific productivity about 1.7-fold and valproic acid about 1.4-fold, valproic acid was found more efficient because of its less cytotoxic effect on cell growth. We examined the efficacy of expressed Blinatumomab at various effector to target (E/T) ratios. A dose-response analyses of calcein-acetoxymethyl release assay illustrated that the effective dose of expressed mAb required for antibody mediated cytotoxicity was 100 ng/ml and the expressed mAb was more effective at E/T ratios of 10:1 and 5:1.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have an essential role in gene expression at post-transcriptional level. The aim of this research was to find more about miRNA-17 and miRNA-146 expression during differentiation of spermatogonial stem cell like cells (SSC like cells) from mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) and retinoic acid (RA) induction. BMSCs were treated with BMP4 to produce primordial germ cell like cells (PGC like cells). The cells were differentiated into SSC like cells by an inducer cocktail including RA, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The PGC like cells and SSC like cells were evaluated for pluripotency (Nanog, Oct-4) and germ cell specific gene (Piwil2, Plzf, Dazl, and Stra8) expression, protein expression (Plzf, Stra8), and miRNA-17 and miRNA-146 mRNA expression. Our results showed that BMP4 leads to Dazl upregulation and Nanog downregulation expression in PGC like cells. RA upregulated Stra8 and Piwil2, and downregulated Nanog and Oct-4. MiRNA-17 and miRNA-146 expression decreased significantly in SSC like cells after RA treatment. This research indicated the aberrant miRNA-17 and miRNA-146 expression in SSC like cells in comparison with SSCs. Downregulation of the two miRNAs using RA in the stimulated undifferentiated state could probably be one of the key factors of SSC like cell arrest.","['Behzadi Fard, Saba', 'Mazaheri, Zohreh', 'Ghorbanmehr, Nasim', 'Movahedin, Mansoureh', 'Behzadi Fard, Mahin', 'Gholampour, Mohammad Ali']","['Behzadi Fard S', 'Mazaheri Z', 'Ghorbanmehr N', 'Movahedin M', 'Behzadi Fard M', 'Gholampour MA']","['Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Biotechnology Department, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Alzahra University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dezful University of Medical Sciences, Dezful, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190723,Iran,Int J Mol Cell Med,International journal of molecular and cellular medicine,101598104,,,,PMC7073265,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells', 'differentiation', 'miRNA-146', 'miRNA-17', 'spermatogonial stem like cells']",2019/01/01 00:00,2019/01/01 00:01,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.22088/IJMCM.BUMS.8.1.14 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Cell Med. 2019 Winter;8(1):14-23. doi: 10.22088/IJMCM.BUMS.8.1.14.

AZD1775 is a small molecule inhibitor of WEE1, currently in early phase clinical trials as a single agent and in combination with more conventional anti-neoplastic agents. As resistance to kinase inhibitors is frequent, we sought to identify mechanisms of resistance to WEE1 inhibition in acute leukemia. We found that AZD1775 resistant cell lines are dependent upon increased HDAC activity for their survival, in part due to increased KDM5A activity. In addition, gene expression analyses demonstrate HDAC dependent increase in MYC expression and c-MYC activity in AZD1775 treated resistant cells. Overexpression of c-MYC confers resistance to AZD1775 in cell lines with low baseline expression. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRD4, and thereby c-MYC, partially abrogated resistance to AZD1775. Thus, acquired resistance to WEE1 inhibition may be reversed by HDAC or BRD4 inhibition in leukemia cells.","['Garcia, Tamara B', 'Uluisik, Rizvan C', 'van Linden, Annemie A', 'Jones, Kenneth L', 'Venkataraman, Sujatha', 'Vibhakar, Rajeev', 'Porter, Christopher C']","['Garcia TB', 'Uluisik RC', 'van Linden AA', 'Jones KL', 'Venkataraman S', 'Vibhakar R', 'Porter CC']","['Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200305,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7066074,,['NOTNLM'],"['AZD1775', 'KDM5A', 'WEE1', 'adavosertib', 'c-MYC', 'histone deacetylase']",2020/03/21 06:00,2020/03/21 06:01,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2019/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00296 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Mar 5;10:296. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00296. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Garcia, Uluisik, van Linden, Jones, Venkataraman, Vibhakar and', 'Porter.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 105 cases of patients with leukemia admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College from August 2016 to November 2018 were selected as research subjects. A total of 49 patients received transfusion of apheresis platelet suspension, and were group A. Fifty-six patients who received mixed multi-person platelet suspension were group B. The percentage plate recovery (PPR) and corrected count increment (CCI), interleukin-11 (IL-11) and soluble glycoprotein 130 (sgp130) levels were compared between the two groups, and the correlation of PPR and CCI with serum IL-11 and sgp130 levels was analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the independent risk factors affecting ineffective transfusion in patients with leukemia. After transfusion, PPR and CCI in both groups were significantly higher than those before transfusion (P<0.05). IL-11 was significantly increased in both groups after transfusion, and sgp130 was significantly decreased in the two groups after transfusion (P<0.05). Serum IL-11 level in leukemia patients was positively correlated with PPR and CCI (r=0.7693, P<0.001), (r=0.7760, P<0.001), and serum sgp130 level in leukemia patients was negatively correlated with PPR and CCI (r=-0.7086, P<0.001), (r=-0.7733, P<0.001).

The selected miRs were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The current study demonstrated that the expression of BM-MSC-derived EV-miR was heterogenous and based on MDS severity, the expression of EV-miR-101 was lower in high-risk group and patients with AML/MRC compared with the control and low-risk groups. This reversibly correlated with BM blast percentage, with which the cellular miR-101 from BM-MSCs or serum EV-miR-101 expression exhibited no association.

Because recent changes in transplant practice have likely changed the survivor population, we sought to assess the survival of a contemporary cohort of patients who were alive and free of disease 2 years after HCT. Data were extracted from first transplants documented between 2002 and 2011 in the Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry on patients who received an allogeneic HCT for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndromes or an autologous HCT for myeloma or lymphoma. Patients were included if they had survived at least 2 years without disease relapse or progression. Mortality rates were compared with standard Australian and New Zealand populations using relative-survival analysis. A total of 1562 allogeneic and 3822 autologous HCT patients were included, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years. Compared with a matched group of patients from our previous study from 1992 to 2001, the contemporary cohort of allogeneic HCT recipients was older and more likely to receive peripheral blood stem cells and from unrelated donors. Allogeneic HCT for AML increased, wheresa transplants for CML fell from 32% to 8%. Increasing use of reduced-intensity conditioning and unrelated donors was also seen. Long-term survival after allogeneic and autologous HCT were very similar to the previous 1992 to 2001 cohort despite changes in practice over time. Recipients of autologous HCT for myeloma demonstrated substantially lower overall survival than HCT for other indications with no clear plateau. Annual relative survival for survivors of allogeneic HCT was 96% to 99% of the general population but only 89% to 96% of the general population for recipients of autologous HCT. Late deaths were primarily due to nonrelapse causes after allogeneic HCT, but relapse or disease progression remained prominent for recipients of autologous HCT, particularly for myeloma. The management of late HCT effects is important to improve long-term survival of transplant recipients but should be tailored to the risks specific to the primary disease and transplant type. Future planning should account for the impact of the expected increase in transplant activity and number of survivors on resource utilization.","['Kliman, David', 'Nivison-Smith, Ian', 'Gottlieb, David', 'Hamad, Nada', 'Kerridge, Ian', 'Purtill, Duncan', 'Szer, Jeff', 'Ma, David']","['Kliman D', 'Nivison-Smith I', 'Gottlieb D', 'Hamad N', 'Kerridge I', 'Purtill D', 'Szer J', 'Ma D']","['Malignant Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Service, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.', ""Department of Haematology and SCT, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Fiona Stanley Hospital, Murdoch, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and BMT, Peter McCallum Cancer Centre and the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', ""Department of Haematology and SCT, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia.

The molar mass of isolated CG was in the order of 10(3)-10(4) g/mol, with small protein traces present. Polymer characterization by NMR identified key signals correlating to galactose, glucose, rhamnose and acid-related groups. Three distinct conformational stages were observed by AFM. The impact of CG on cell morphology and viability with both tumor and non-tumor cell lines was studied by AFM and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazole)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay respectively. Antiproliferative activity was confirmed for HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma), B16F10 (melanoma) and HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia) cancer cell lines. A change in cell morphology was demonstrated as an increased surface roughness for HL60. Considering that a CG does not exhibit cytotoxicity to non-tumor lines, it can be seen that the CG shows selectivity for tumor cells and can be a promising biomaterial for future studies.","['de Oliveira Silva Ribeiro, Fabio', 'de Franca Dourado, Flaviane', 'Silva, Maria Francilene Souza', 'Brito, Lucas Moreira', 'Pessoa, Claudia', 'de Lima, Lais Ramos Monteiro', 'de Paula, Regina Celia Monteiro', 'de Souza de Almeida Leite, Jose Roberto', 'de Araujo, Alyne Rodrigues', 'da Silva, Durcilene Alves']","['de Oliveira Silva Ribeiro F', 'de Franca Dourado F', 'Silva MFS', 'Brito LM', 'Pessoa C', 'de Lima LRM', 'de Paula RCM', 'de Souza de Almeida Leite JR', 'de Araujo AR', 'da Silva DA']","['Research Center on Biodiversity and Biotechnology, BIOTEC, Federal University of Delta of Parnaiba, UFDPar, Parnaiba, PI, Brazil.', 'Research Center on Biodiversity and Biotechnology, BIOTEC, Federal University of Delta of Parnaiba, UFDPar, Parnaiba, PI, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, UFC, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, UFC, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, UFC, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil.', 'Department of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry, Federal University of Ceara, UFC, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil.', 'Department of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry, Federal University of Ceara, UFC, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil.', 'Center for Research in Applied Morphology and Immunology, NuPMIA, University of Brasilia, Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Research Center on Biodiversity and Biotechnology, BIOTEC, Federal University of Delta of Parnaiba, UFDPar, Parnaiba, PI, Brazil.', 'Research Center on Biodiversity and Biotechnology, BIOTEC, Federal University of Delta of Parnaiba, UFDPar, Parnaiba, PI, Brazil.

Methods: A total of 56 patients with MPA treated with surgery, the expression of Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in mRNA level, and by Western blotting in protein level, respectively. The correlation between clinicopathological parameters (gender, age, site, habits, size, node, metastasis, recurrence) was done using the chi-square test. Kaplan-Merier curve was used to analyze the survival in all patients, Log Rank test was performed to observe the difference between groups. Cox's proportional hazard test was used to identify the factors that were independent predictors of survival. Results: qPCR showed overexpression of Mcl-1L in 66.1%MPA patients (37/56), with significant difference in terms of tumor site, significantly higher expression of Mcl-1L in MPA (parotid gland: 2.21+/-1.07, sublingual gland: 2.12+/-1.08, other sites: 1.83+/-0.81) than benign pleomorphic adenoma tissue (1.00+/-0.19) (P<0.01). Western blotting analysis showed significantly higher expression of Mcl-1L in MPA (parotid gland: 1.02+/-0.43, sublingual gland: 0.71+/-0.29, other sites: 0.70+/-0.30) than benign pleomorphic adenoma tissue (0.39+/-0.08) (P<0.01). In malignant pleomorphic adenoma patients, high Mcl-1L expression was significantly associated with node positivity (P=0.045), advanced tumor size (P=0.002). Kaplan-Meier survival line analysis indicated a significantly lower survival time in Mcl-1L higher-expression patients (24.79+/-9.71) than lower-expression patients (30.59+/-9.01) (P=0.017). Multivariate analysis indicated Mcl-1L to be an independent prognostic factor for MPA (P=0.002). Conclusions: The studies suggest that overexpression of Mcl-1L is associated with poor prognosis in MPA. Mcl-1L is an independent prognostic factor in malignant pleomorphic adenoma.","['Hao, J Q', 'Fan, X H', 'Li, J Y']","['Hao JQ', 'Fan XH', 'Li JY']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kailuan General Hospital, Tangshan 063000, China.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kailuan General Hospital, Tangshan 063000, China.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, College of Stomatology, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063000, China.']",,['chi'],['20150849/The Key Medical Research Project of Hebei Province'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,8711066,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",IM,"['Adenoma, Pleomorphic/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adenoma, pleomorphic', ""Cox's proportional hazard test"", 'Prognosis', 'RNA, messenger']",2020/03/21 06:00,2020/07/17 06:00,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.1002-0098.2020.03.002 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 9;55(3):153-158. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1002-0098.2020.03.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analyzed the incidence of extrahepatic DNM following living donor LT according to the status of pretransplant hepatic malignancy. We selected 2,076 adult patients who underwent primary LDLT during 7 years from January 2010 to December 2016. RESULTS: The pretransplant hepatic malignancy group (n = 1,012) showed 45 cases (4.4%) of the following extrahepatic DNMs: posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in 10; lung cancer in 10; stomach cancer in 6; colorectal cancer in 5; urinary bladder cancer in 3; and other cancers in 11. The pretransplant no hepatic malignancy group (n = 1,064) showed 25 cases (2.3%) of the following extrahepatic DNMs: colorectal cancer in 3; stomach cancer in 3; leukemia in 3; lung cancer in 3; PTLD in 2; prostate cancer in 2; and other cancers in 9. Incidences of extrahepatic DNM in the pretransplant hepatic malignancy and no hepatic malignancy groups were as follows: 1.1% and 0.5% at 1 year, 3.2% and 2.0% at 3 years, 4.6% and 2.5% at 5 years, and 5.4% and 2.8% at 8 years, respectively (P = 0.006). Their overall patient survival rates were as follows: 97.3% and 97.2% at 1 year, 91.6% and 95.9% at 3 years, 89.8% and 95.4% at 5 years, and 89.2% and 95.4% at 8 years, respectively (P < 0.001). Pretransplant hepatic malignancy was the only significant risk factor for posttransplant extrahepatic DNM. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patients who had pretransplant hepatic malignancy be followed up more strictly because they have a potential risk of primary hepatic malignancy recurrence as well as a higher risk of extrahepatic DNM than patients without pretransplant hepatic malignancy.","['Park, Gil Chun', 'Hwang, Shin', 'Ahn, Chul Soo', 'Kim, Ki Hun', 'Moon, Deok Bog', 'Ha, Tae Yong',

In this retrospective analysis, we reviewed altogether 371 ACTH stimulation tests of 352 children after a uniform NOPHO (Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology) ALL induction. Both low- and standard-dose ACTH tests were used. Full recovery of adrenal function was defined by both normal basal and stimulated cortisol levels. Sixty-two percent of patients were detected with normal adrenal function in median of 15 days after tapering of prednisolone. Both low basal and stimulated cortisol levels were detected in 13% of patients. The median time to normal adrenal function was 31 days (95% CI 28-34), 24 days (95% CI 18-30), and 12 days (95% CI 10-14) for those with basal cortisol <107, 107-183, and >183 nmol/L at first ACTH testing, respectively. Patients with fluconazole prophylaxis had higher median baseline cortisol levels compared to patients without prophylaxis (207 nmol/L, range 21-839 nmol/L vs. 153 nmol/L, range 22-832 nmol/L, P = 0.003).Conclusion: These data can be used to reduce unnecessary substitution or testing, but also to guarantee hydrocortisone substitution for those at risk. What is Known: *These data can be used to reduce unnecessary hydrocortisone substitution or ACTH testing. *Our data helps to guarantee hydrocortisone substitution for those at risk of adrenal insufficiency. What is New: *Full recovery of adrenal function after ALL induction is detected in 62% of patients already at 15 days after tapering of prednisolone. *Both basal and stimulated cortisol testing are required for detection of full adrenal recovery. *Recovery time of adrenal function is extended over 3-4 weeks after tapering of prednisolone in patients with low basal cortisol levels (<107 nmol/L) at first testing.","['Loimijoki, Tiia', 'Lapatto, Risto', 'Taskinen, Mervi']","['Loimijoki T', 'Lapatto R', 'Taskinen M']","[""New Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Stenbackinkatu 9, P.O.

However, its effectiveness in the second-line setting-in relation to previous rituximab exposure in first-line-has hardly been evaluated in a population-based setting. Therefore, in this comprehensive, population-based study, we assessed the impact of first-line treatment with rituximab-containing chemotherapy on the effectiveness of second-line treatment with rituximab-containing chemotherapy. We selected all 1735 patients diagnosed with CLL between 2004 and 2010 from the Dutch Population-based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies (PHAROS). The primary endpoint was treatment-free survival (TFS). First- and second-line treatment was instituted in 663 (38%) and 284 (43%) patients, respectively. In first line, the median TFS was 19.7 and 67.1 months for chemotherapy without (n = 445; 67%) and with rituximab (n = 218; 33%), respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadjusted], 0.83; P = 0.031). The median TFS among recipients of second-line chemotherapy without (n = 165; 57%) and with rituximab (n = 121; 42%) was 15.0 and 15.3 months, respectively (HRadjusted, 0.93; P = 0.614). Of the 121 patients who received rituximab-containing chemotherapy in second-line, 89 (74%) and 32 (26%) received first-line chemotherapy without and with rituximab, respectively. Median TFS in these two treatment groups was 18.3 and 12.1 months, respectively (HRadjusted, 1.71; P = 0.060). Collectively, in this population-based study, the effectiveness of first-line treatment with rituximab-containing chemotherapy was less pronounced in second-line treatment. The hampered effectiveness of rituximab-containing chemotherapy in second-line could not be explained by previous rituximab exposure.","['van der Straten, Lina', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Doorduijn, Jeanette K', 'van den Broek, Esther C', 'Posthuma, Eduardus F M', 'Dinmohamed, Avinash G', 'Levin, Mark-David']","['van der Straten L', 'Kater AP', 'Doorduijn JK', 'van den Broek EC', 'Posthuma EFM', 'Dinmohamed AG', 'Levin MD']","['Department of Research and Development, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, The Netherlands. l.vanderstraten@iknl.nl.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands. l.vanderstraten@iknl.nl.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'PALGA Foundation, Houten, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Reinier de Graaf Hospital, Delft, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research and Development, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9359-1203'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20200319,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer epidemiology', 'Chemotherapy', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Population-based', 'Registry', 'Rituximab']",2020/03/21 06:00,2020/05/13 06:00,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03994-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03994-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 May;99(5):1081-1091. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03994-8.

Nonetheless, developing nations might be lagging behind, highlighting the need to assess real-world outcomes in such regions. METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective study, which included patients with AML diagnosed between January 2013 and December 2017 from 13 centers in Mexico. RESULTS: A total of 525 patients with AML met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Median age for the entire cohort was 47 years. The patients were classified according to cytogenetic risk: favorable 16.0%, intermediate 55.6%, and unfavorable 28.4%. Most patients received intensive chemotherapy (80.2%), and among these 74.1% underwent a 7 + 3 induction regimen. A complete remission was achieved in 71.3% of patients. Induction-related mortality occurred in 17.8% and we identify the following as independent risk factors: >60 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.09 [1.09-4.02]), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group >2 (OR 4.82 [2.46-9.43]), prior solid tumor (OR 3.8 [1.24-11.59]) and active infection (OR 1.82 [1.06-3.12]). Further, allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AlloHSCT) was performed in 8.2% in CR1. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 34.8%. In a multivariate analysis, several factors were independently associated with a worse OS, including secondary AML (hazard ratio [HR] 2.14 [1.15-4.01]) and unfavorable cytogenetic risk (HR 1.81 [1.16-2.82]), whereas maintenance therapy (HR 0.53 [0.32-0.86]) and AlloHSCT (HR 0.40 [0.17-0.94]) were associated with better OS. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multicenter report analyzing AML survival in Mexico. Challenges in this setting include a high induction-related mortality and low AlloHSCT rate, which should be addressed to improve outcomes.","['Demichelis-Gomez, Roberta', 'Zapata-Canto, Nidia', 'Leyto-Cruz, Faustino', 'Terreros-Munoz, Eduardo', 'Carrillo, Angel', 'Montano-Figueroa, Efreen', 'Solis-Poblano, Juan Carlos', 'Colunga-Pedraza, Perla', 'Diaz-Vargas, Guillermo', 'Amador-Medina, Lauro Fabian', 'Martinez-Hernandez, Ramon', 'Turrubiates, Francisco', 'Cabrera-Garcia, Alvaro', 'Zaragoza, Alva', 'Espinoza, Ramiro', 'Gutierrez-Serdan, Ruth', 'Apodaca, Elia', 'Moreira, Carolina', 'Garcia-Castillo, Carolina', 'Garcia-Stivalet, Lilia', 'Limon, Alejandro', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David', 'Rozen-Fuller, Etta', 'Espinosa-Bautista, Karla Adriana', 'Crespo-Solis, Erick', 'Meillon, Luis']","['Demichelis-Gomez R', 'Zapata-Canto N', 'Leyto-Cruz F', 'Terreros-Munoz E', 'Carrillo A', 'Montano-Figueroa E', 'Solis-Poblano JC', 'Colunga-Pedraza P', 'Diaz-Vargas G', 'Amador-Medina LF', 'Martinez-Hernandez R', 'Turrubiates F', 'Cabrera-Garcia A', 'Zaragoza A', 'Espinoza R', 'Gutierrez-Serdan R', 'Apodaca E', 'Moreira C', 'Garcia-Castillo C', 'Garcia-Stivalet L', 'Limon A', 'Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Rozen-Fuller E', 'Espinosa-Bautista KA', 'Crespo-Solis E', 'Meillon L']","['Hematology and Oncology Department, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.

The objective of this study was to analyze the mortality in the Russian cohort of patients with newly diagnosed CML in the EUTOS PBS observational study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analyzed cohort consisted of 197 patients (>18 years) with Ph+/BCR-ABL1+ CML diagnosed in the period from October 1, 2009 through December 31, 2012 from 6 regions of Russia. The distribution of the phases of CML were: chronic phase (CP), 93.4% and accelerated phase (AP) + blast crisis (BC), 6% + 0.6%. The median age was 50 years (range, 18-82 years); the male/female ratio was equal. RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) at 5, 6, and 7 years was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72%-86%), 78% (95% CI, 65%-80%), and 73% (95% CI, 65%-80%), respectively (P < .001). The 5-year OS in patients with AP and BC was 39%. In Russia, the study was prolonged, with a median follow-up of 77 months (range, 0.7-108 months): 141 (71.5%) patients were alive, 47 (24%) patients died, and the status of 9 (4.5%) patients is was unknown. Forty-seven (23.8%) patients died during the follow-up period. The largest number of deaths was observed in the first year after the CML diagnosis: 17 (36%) of 47 cases, 3 of 17 died refusing the CML treatment. At the seventh year of CML therapy, 1 patient died after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The causes of death were: (1) progression of CML to AP/BC in 20 (43%) patients; (2) death in remission in 5 (11%) patients with complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and/or major molecular response; and (3) death without progression to AP/BC but with signs of leukemia in 22 (46%) patients. The 5-year cumulative incidence of death from all reasons was 20%; the cumulative incidence of CML-related and non-CML-related death at the fifth year was 18% and 11%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In general, the results of treatment in the Russian population sample of non-selected patients with CML were comparable with the data of the total European cohort. The CML-related deaths prevailed in the first year of CML therapy. The appropriate monitoring and therapy interventions during the first year of CML treatment are apparently important for the long-term treatment results.","['Lazareva, Olga V', 'Turkina, Anna G', 'Chelysheva, Ekatarina Yu', 'Kulikovsky, Anton A', 'Galayko, Maria V', 'Senderova, Olga M', 'Pepeliaeva, Valentina M', 'Meresiy, Sergey V', 'Luchinin, Alexandr S', 'Milutina, Galina I', 'Gavrilova, Lyubov V', 'Avdeeva, Lyudmila B', 'Dasheeva, Elena B', 'Vinogradova, Olga Yu', 'Julhakyan, Hunan L', 'Kulikov, Sergey M']","['Lazareva OV', 'Turkina AG', 'Chelysheva EY', 'Kulikovsky AA', 'Galayko MV', 'Senderova OM', 'Pepeliaeva VM', 'Meresiy SV', 'Luchinin AS', 'Milutina GI', 'Gavrilova LV', 'Avdeeva LB', 'Dasheeva EB', 'Vinogradova OY', 'Julhakyan HL', 'Kulikov SM']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation, Russia.', 'Central Clinical Hospital No. 2 them.

Although complete remission (CR) is achieved for the majority of the patients after induction and consolidation therapies, nearly two-thirds relapse within a short interval. Understanding biological factors that determine relapse has become of major clinical interest in AML. We utilized liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the protein changes and protein phosphorylation events associated with AML relapse in primary cells from 41 AML patients at time of diagnosis. Patients were defined as relapse-free if they had not relapsed within a five-year clinical follow-up after AML diagnosis. Relapse was associated with increased expression of RNA processing proteins and decreased expression of V-ATPase proteins. We also observed an increase in phosphorylation events catalyzed by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and casein kinase 2 (CSK2). The biological relevance of the proteome findings was supported by cell proliferation assays using inhibitors of V-ATPase (bafilomycin), CSK2 (CX-4945), CDK4/6 (abemaciclib) and CDK2/7/9 (SNS-032). While bafilomycin preferentially inhibited the cells from relapse patients, the kinase inhibitors were less efficient in these cells. This suggests that therapy against the upregulated kinases could also target the factors inducing their upregulation rather than their activity. This study, therefore, presents markers that could help predict AML relapse and direct therapeutic strategies.","['Aasebo, Elise', 'Berven, Frode S', 'Bartaula-Brevik, Sushma', 'Stokowy, Tomasz', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Vaudel, Marc', 'Doskeland, Stein Ove', 'McCormack, Emmet', 'Batth, Tanveer S', 'Olsen, Jesper V', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Hernandez-Valladares, Maria']","['Aasebo E', 'Berven FS', 'Bartaula-Brevik S', 'Stokowy T', 'Hovland R', 'Vaudel M', 'Doskeland SO', 'McCormack E', 'Batth TS', 'Olsen JV', 'Bruserud O', 'Selheim F', 'Hernandez-Valladares M']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department for Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department for Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen, 5006 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6939-8059', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0017-8338']",['eng'],"['100933/Kreftforeningen', 'NNF14CC0001/Novo Nordisk', '245979/F50/Norges Forskningsrad']",['Journal Article'],20200317,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7140113,,['NOTNLM'],"['V-ATPase', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'kinase', 'markers', 'mass spectrometry', 'patient relapse', 'phosphoproteome', 'proteome']",2020/03/21 06:00,2020/03/21 06:01,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2020/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12030709 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12030709 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Mar 17;12(3). pii: cancers12030709. doi: 10.3390/cancers12030709.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measurement of treatment adherence can be done via objective (e.g., electronic monitoring (EM), pharmacological assays) or subjective methods (patient, parent, or physician reports). This paper provides an illustration of recommended strategies for comparing discrepancies between two objective measures of medication adherence (e.g., behavioral adherence using electronic monitoring versus pharmacological adherence using 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) metabolite data) within a relatively large cohort of pediatric patients with ALL or LBL (N = 139) who had longitudinal data for both measures of medication adherence over a 15-month period. Additionally, individual- and family-level factors such as gender, socioeconomic status, household environment, and dose intensity will be examined to identify possible sources of discrepancies between adherence measures. This information will provide practical advice for physicians, healthcare providers, and psychologists in identifying nonadherence and the caveats therein so patients achieve the best possible health outcomes.","['Cain, Caitlin J', 'Meisman, Andrea R', 'Drucker, Kirstin', 'Isaac, Evrosina I', 'Verma, Tanvi', 'Griffin, Jordyn', 'Rohan, Jennifer M']","['Cain CJ', 'Meisman AR', 'Drucker K', 'Isaac EI', 'Verma T', 'Griffin J', 'Rohan JM']","[""Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23219, USA."", 'Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC 20007, USA.', ""Division of Adolescent and Transition Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23219, USA."", 'Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA 23219, USA.', ""Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23219, USA."", 'Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA 23219, USA.', ""Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23219, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23219, USA."", 'Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA 23219, USA.', 'Massey Cancer Center Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23219, USA.', ""Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23219, USA."", 'Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA 23219, USA.', 'Massey Cancer Center Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23219, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4141-275X'],['eng'],"['F31 CA168307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA119162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200317,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",PMC7142654,,['NOTNLM'],"['*adherence', '*cancer', '*electronic monitoring', '*metabolites', '*pharmacology']",2020/03/21 06:00,2020/09/24 06:00,['2020/03/21 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph17061956 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph17061956 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 Mar 17;17(6). pii: ijerph17061956. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17061956.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AH-MCL can arise de novo (AH-DN) or transform from prior classic variant MCL (AH-t). This study is the first integrated analysis of clinical and genomic characteristics of AH-MCL. Patient characteristics were collected from diagnosis (AH-DN) and at transformation (AH-t). Survival after initial diagnosis (AH-DN) and after transformation (AH-t) was calculated. Regression tree analysis was performed to evaluate prognostic variables and in univariate and multivariate analyses for survival. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in evaluable biopsy specimens. We identified 183 patients with AH-MCL (108 were AH-DN, and 75 were AH-t; 152 were blastoid, and 31 were pleomorphic). Median survival was 33 months (48 and 14 months for AH-DN and AH-t, respectively; P = .001). Factors associated with inferior survival were age (>/=72 years), AH-t category, Ki-67 >/=50% and poor performance status. AH-t had a significantly higher degree of aneuploidy compared with AH-DN. Transformed MCL patients exhibited KMT2B mutations. AH-MCL patients with Ki-67 >/=50% had exclusive mutations in CCND1, NOTCH1, TP53, SPEN, SMARCA4, RANBP2, KMT2C, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and NSD2 compared with low Ki-67 (<50%). AH-t patients have poor outcomes and distinct genomic profile. This is the first study to report that AH-MCL patients with high Ki-67 (>/=50%) exhibit a distinct mutation profile and very poor survival.","['Jain, Preetesh', 'Zhang, Shaojun', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Ok, Chi Young', 'Nomie, Krystle', 'Gonzalez, Graciela Nogueras', 'Gonzalez-Pagan, Omarya', 'Hill, Holly A', 'Lee, Hun Ju', 'Fayad, Luis', 'Westin, Jason', 'Nastoupil, Loretta', 'Hagemeister, Frederick', 'Chen, Wendy', 'Oriabure, Onyeka', 'Badillo, Maria', 'Jiang, Changying', 'Yixin, Yao', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Medeiros, Leonard Jeffrey', 'Nair, Ranjit', 'Ahmed, Sairah', 'Iyer, Swaminathan P', 'Thirumurthi, Selvi', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Xu, Guofan', 'Tinsu, Pan', 'Santos, David', 'Wang, Ruiping', 'Han, Guangchun', 'Zhang, Jianhua', 'Song, Xingzhi', 'Neelapu, Sattva', 'Romaguera, Jorge', 'Futreal, Andy', 'Flowers, Christopher', 'Fowler, Nathan', 'Wang, Linghua', 'Wang, Michael L']","['Jain P', 'Zhang S', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Ok CY', 'Nomie K', 'Gonzalez GN', 'Gonzalez-Pagan O', 'Hill HA', 'Lee HJ', 'Fayad L', 'Westin J', 'Nastoupil L', 'Hagemeister F', 'Chen W', 'Oriabure O', 'Badillo M', 'Jiang C', 'Yixin Y', 'Li S', 'Tang G', 'Yin CC', 'Patel KP', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Nair R', 'Ahmed S', 'Iyer SP', 'Thirumurthi S', 'Champlin R', 'Xu G', 'Tinsu P', 'Santos D', 'Wang R', 'Han G', 'Zhang J', 'Song X', 'Neelapu S', 'Romaguera J', 'Futreal A', 'Flowers C', 'Fowler N', 'Wang L', 'Wang ML']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Biostatistics.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Gastroenterology.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine.', 'Department of Imaging Physics, and.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.']",,['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA202104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Helicases', 'Genomics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Mast-Cell', '*Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors']",PMC7094021,,,,2020/03/20 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31426-9 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001396 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 24;4(6):1038-1050. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001396.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The utility of CMV prophylaxis with letermovir has been reported; however, the specific applications remain unclear. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed large-scale registry data (N = 10 480) to clarify the risk factors for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in connection with CMV reactivation. First, we identified risk factors for CMV reactivation using multivariate analysis and developed a scoring model. Although the model effectively stratified reactivation risk into 3 groups (43.7% vs 60.9% vs 71.5%; P < .001), the 3-year NRM was significantly higher in patients with CMV reactivation, even in the low (20.9% vs 13.0%, P < .001), intermediate (21.4% vs 15.6%; P < .001), and high (29.3% vs 18.0%; P < .001) reactivation risk groups. Next, survival analysis considering competing risks, time-dependent covariates, and interaction terms for exploring the heterogeneous impact of CMV reactivation on NRM in the training cohort revealed that chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.96; P = .033), good performance status (PS) (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.94; P = .028), HLA-matched donor (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06-1.70; P = .013), and standard-risk disease (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04-1.58; P = .022) were associated with increased NRM. In the test cohort, CMV reactivation was significantly associated with increased 3-year NRM among patients with 2 to 4 factors (22.1% vs 13.1%; P < .001) but was comparable among patients with 0 or 1 factor (23.2% vs 20.4%; P = .62).

Ph-like ALL is driven by genetic alterations that activate constitutive cytokine receptor and kinase signaling, and early-phase trials are investigating the potential of the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to chemotherapy to improve clinical outcomes. However, preclinical studies have shown that JAK or PI3K pathway inhibition is insufficient to eradicate the most common cytokine receptor-like factor 2-rearranged (CRLF2-rearranged) Ph-like ALL subset. We thus sought to define additional essential signaling pathways required in Ph-like leukemogenesis for improved therapeutic targeting. Herein, we describe an adaptive signaling plasticity of CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like ALL following selective TKI pressure, which occurs in the absence of genetic mutations. Interestingly, we observed that Ph-like ALL cells have activated SRC, ERK, and PI3K signaling consistent with activated B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, although they do not express cell surface mu-heavy chain (muHC). Combinatorial targeting of JAK/STAT, PI3K, and ""BCR-like"" signaling with multiple TKIs and/or dexamethasone prevented this signaling plasticity and induced complete cell death, demonstrating a more optimal and clinically pragmatic therapeutic strategy for CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like ALL.","['Hurtz, Christian', 'Wertheim, Gerald B', 'Loftus, Joseph P', 'Blumenthal, Daniel', 'Lehman, Anne', 'Li, Yong', 'Bagashev, Asen', 'Manning, Bryan', 'Cummins, Katherine D', 'Burkhardt, Janis K', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Tasian, Sarah K']","['Hurtz C', 'Wertheim GB', 'Loftus JP', 'Blumenthal D', 'Lehman A', 'Li Y', 'Bagashev A', 'Manning B', 'Cummins KD', 'Burkhardt JK', 'Perl AE', 'Carroll M', 'Tasian SK']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology.', 'Division of Oncology, and.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Oncology, and.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Division of Oncology, and.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology and.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Oncology, and.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R21 CA198621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024134/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA243072/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA198089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA232486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC7324172,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology', '*Protein kinases', '*Signal transduction']",2020/03/20 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['134424 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI134424 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2020 Jul 1;130(7):3637-3653. doi: 10.1172/JCI134424.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on recent observations that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and arginine methylation are upregulated in activated memory T cells, we hypothesized that PRMT5 is involved in the pathogenesis of aGVHD. Here, we show that PRMT5 expression and enzymatic activity were upregulated in activated T cells in vitro and in T cells from mice developing aGVHD after allogeneic transplant. PRMT5 expression was also upregulated in T cells of patients who developed aGVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant compared with those who did not develop aGVHD. PRMT5 inhibition using a selective small-molecule inhibitor (C220) substantially reduced mouse and human allogeneic T cell proliferation and inflammatory IFN-gamma and IL-17 cytokine production. Administration of PRMT5 small-molecule inhibitors substantially improves survival, reducing disease incidence and clinical severity in mouse models of aGVHD without adversely affecting engraftment. Importantly, we show that PRMT5 inhibition retained the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect by maintaining cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. Mechanistically, we show that PRMT5 inhibition potently reduced STAT1 phosphorylation as well as transcription of proinflammatory genes, including interferon-stimulated genes and IL-17. Additionally, PRMT5 inhibition deregulates the cell cycle in activated T cells and disrupts signaling by affecting ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Thus, we have identified PRMT5 as a regulator of T cell responses and as a therapeutic target in aGVHD.","['Snyder, Katiri J', 'Zitzer, Nina C', 'Gao, Yandi', 'Choe, Hannah K', 'Sell, Natalie E', 'Neidemire-Colley, Lotus', 'Ignaci, Anora', 'Kale, Charuta', 'Devine, Raymond D', 'Abad, Maria G', 'Pietrzak, Maciej', 'Wang, Min', 'Lin, Hong', 'Zhang, Yang W', 'Behbehani, Gregory K', 'Jackman, Jane E', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Vaddi, Kris', 'Baiocchi, Robert A', 'Ranganathan, Parvathi']","['Snyder KJ', 'Zitzer NC', 'Gao Y', 'Choe HK', 'Sell NE', 'Neidemire-Colley L', 'Ignaci A', 'Kale C', 'Devine RD', 'Abad MG', 'Pietrzak M', 'Wang M', 'Lin H', 'Zhang YW', 'Behbehani GK', 'Jackman JE', 'Garzon R', 'Vaddi K', 'Baiocchi RA', 'Ranganathan P']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Prelude Therapeutics, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.', 'Prelude Therapeutics, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.', 'Prelude Therapeutics, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Prelude Therapeutics, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.']",,['eng'],"['K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM130135/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200423,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,"['9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Prmt5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC7205431,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow transplantation', '*Immunology', '*T cells', '*Tolerance', '*Transplantation']",2020/03/20 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['131099 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.131099 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2020 Apr 23;5(8). pii: 131099. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.131099.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials & methods: From a series of 71 new chalcones, we selected the two most cytotoxic. Results: JA3 and JA7 were cytotoxic not only against hematological malignancies but also against solid tumor and cancer stem cells, yet with no toxicity to normal cells. Moreover, they induced immunogenic apoptotic-like cell death independently of promyelocytic leukemia protein, with extensive mitochondrial damages downstream of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Preventing endoplasmic reticulum stress and the upregulation of proapoptotic machinery inhibited JA3- and JA7-induced cell death. Likewise, blocking receptor Fas protected cells from killing. They increased the antileukemic effect of cytarabine and vincristine and killed leukemic cells collected from patients with different acute leukemia subtypes.

However, the identity of the factor that can regulate NFIL3 directly during the NK-cell development is not known. Here, we reveal that pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) can upregulate the NFIL3 expression directly. We used conditional knockout mice in which PBX1 in hematopoietic cells was specifically absent. The number of NK-committed progenitor pre-NKP cells and rNKP cells was reduced significantly in the absence of PBX1, which was consistent with NFIL3 deficiency. Also, the NFIL3 expression in NK cells was decreased if PBX1 was absent. We demonstrated that PBX1 was bound directly to the promoter of Nfil3 and facilitated transcription. Upon knockout of the binding site of PBX1 in the Nfil3 promoter, mice showed fewer NK-precursor cells and NK cells, just like that observed in Nfil3 knockout mice. Furthermore, asparagine N286 in the homeodomain of PBX1 controlled the binding of PBX1 to the Nfil3 promoter. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the transcription factor PBX1 promotes the early development of NK cells by upregulating the Nfil3 expression directly.","['Xu, Xiuxiu', 'Zhou, Yonggang', 'Fu, Binqing', 'Zhang, Jinghe', 'Dong, Zhongjun', 'Zhang, Xiaoren', 'Shen, Nan', 'Sun, Rui', 'Tian, Zhigang', 'Wei, Haiming']","['Xu X', 'Zhou Y', 'Fu B', 'Zhang J', 'Dong Z', 'Zhang X', 'Shen N', 'Sun R', 'Tian Z', 'Wei H']","['Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Division of Molecular Medicine, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institue of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Division of Molecular Medicine, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institue of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'First Affiliated Hospital, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Division of Molecular Medicine, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institue of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Division of Molecular Medicine, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institue of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Rheumatology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Division of Molecular Medicine, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institue of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Division of Molecular Medicine, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institue of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Division of Molecular Medicine, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institue of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200319,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nfil3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*physiology', '*Cell Lineage', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*NK cells', '*homeodomain', '*pre-NKP', '*rNKP']",2020/03/20 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fj.202000121R [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2020 May;34(5):6479-6492. doi: 10.1096/fj.202000121R.

However, no direct clinical trials have been carried out to compare the two agents. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were performed to indirectly compare the efficacy and safety of decitabine and azacitidine in elderly AML patients. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library through May 14, 2019. Randomized controlled trials on elderly AML patients comparing the efficacy and safety between decitabine and azacitidine, or comparing one of HMAs to standard supportive care or placebo were selected. The major outcomes of interest were performed with methods of adjusted indirect comparison and the fixed effect model. Results: Only three RCTs including a total number of 1086 patients were identified. Direct comparisons showed that azacitidine significantly reduced mortality (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97) while decitabine was not significantly associated with lower mortality (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02) compared to the conventional care regimen (CCR). In addition, for the indirect method, azacitidine significantly reduced mortality compared to decitabine (RR = 0.83 95% CI 0.77-0.90) and was more likely to improve complete response (CR) (RR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.17-2.35, low-certainty evidence). No statistical significance was found for the other studied outcomes. Conclusions: Compared to CCR, decitabine and azacitidine can promote studied outcomes in elderly AML patients. Indirect evidence with low certainty was used to compare these two agents. The superiority of either agent cannot be confirmed, and head-to-head clinical trials are still required.","['Wen, Bingbing', 'You, Weiwen', 'Yang, Sitian', 'Du, Xin']","['Wen B', 'You W', 'Yang S', 'Du X']","[""1Department of Internal Medicine, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518000 China.grid.263488.30000 0001 0472 9649"", ""2Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, 3002 Sungang West Road, Futian District, Shenzhen, 518000 China.grid.263488.30000 0001 0472 9649"", ""2Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, 3002 Sungang West Road, Futian District, Shenzhen, 518000 China.grid.263488.30000 0001 0472 9649"", ""2Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, 3002 Sungang West Road, Futian District, Shenzhen, 518000 China.grid.263488.30000 0001 0472 9649""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200316,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC7075015,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Azacitidine', 'Decitabine', 'Elderly patients', 'Network meta-analysis']",2020/03/20 06:00,2020/03/20 06:01,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-020-00160-8 [doi]', '160 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2020 Mar 16;9:3. doi: 10.1186/s40164-020-00160-8. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 1971, numerous cases of DCL have been reported, but the detailed mechanisms of DCL are still unclear. A patient with jumping translocations (JTs) of 1q in umbilical cord blood donor cell-derived myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which likely occurred due to genetic alterations of TET2 and ASXL1 after cord blood transplantation (CBT), was examined in this study. Previously reported DCL cases after CBT that focused on the cytogenetic and molecular characteristics of these patients and patient outcome were reviewed. A total of 30 cases of DCL after CBT were identified between 2005 and 2018. The median time from CBT to the development of DCL was 16 months. The number of patients with DCL who were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and MDS was 19 and 8, respectively. JTs were frequently observed in 5 of 27 DCL patients who had cytogenetic abnormalities, including our patient. Molecular abnormalities were described in 7 of the cases, and the most frequent abnormality was an NPM1 mutation.

Background: SET has been first identified as a component of a fusion protein produced by chromosomal rearrangement in a patient with acute undifferentiated leukemia. Subsequently, multiple functions have been attributed to this gene in different disorders such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The expression of SET is regulated by ZFX, a transcription factor which has a potential role in gastric cancer. Methods: In this case-control study, we evaluated the expression of SET and ZFX in gastric cancer tissues (n=28) and their corresponding ANCTs (n=28) via quantitative real-time PCR. Results: SET1 gene was down-regulated in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (expression ratio=0.25, P=0.015). However, the expression of ZFX was similar between tumoral tissues and ANCTs (expression ratio=0.97, P=0.945). We detected a significant association between the site of primary tumor and SET1 relative expression in tumoral tissues versus ANCTs, where this gene was down-regulated in all tumors originating from cardia. Based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the diagnostic power of transcription levels of SET1 in gastric cancer was 0.68. Finally, we observed remarkable correlations between expression levels of SET1 and ZFX both in tumoral tissues (R(2)=0.38, P<0.05) and in ANCTs (R(2)=0.23, P<0.05). Conclusion: Overall, our results imply the role of SET1 in gastric cancer and potentially functional associations between this gene and ZFX in gastric tissues.","['Soleimani, Shiva', 'Nasim, Negin', 'Esfandi, Farbod', 'Karimipoor, Morteza', 'Kholghi-Oskooei, Vahid', 'Naby Gol, Maryam', 'Taheri, Mohammad', 'Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh']","['Soleimani S', 'Nasim N', 'Esfandi F', 'Karimipoor M', 'Kholghi-Oskooei V', 'Naby Gol M', 'Taheri M', 'Ghafouri-Fard S']","['GenIran Lab, Tashkhis Gene Pajohesh, Tehran, Iran.', 'GenIran Lab, Tashkhis Gene Pajohesh, Tehran, Iran.', 'GenIran Lab, Tashkhis Gene Pajohesh, Tehran, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Department, Biotechnology Research Center, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran.', 'Health Sciences Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Qom University of Medical Sciences, Qom, Iran.', 'Urogenital Stem Cell Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sickness, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,101525875,,,,PMC7069543,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gastric cancer', 'SE Translocation', 'SET', 'ZFX', 'Zinc finger and X-linked factor']",2020/03/20 06:00,2020/03/20 06:01,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench. 2020 Winter;13(1):8-13.,,"['(c)2020 RIGLD, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In this study, we took a multi-pronged approach to screen UCP1 activators, including in silico predictions, in vitro assays, as well as in vivo experiments. Results: Base on Connectivity MAP (CMAP) screening, we obtained multiple drugs that possess a remarkably correlating gene expression pattern to that of enhancing activity in BAT and (or) sWAT signature. Particularly, we focused on a previously unreported drug-indirubin, a compound obtained from the Indigo plant, which is now mainly used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In the current study, our results shown that indirubin could enhance the BAT activity, as evidenced by up-regulated Ucp1 expression and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function in vitro cellular model. Furthermore, indirubin treatment restrained high-fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain, improved glucose homeostasis and ameliorated hepatic steatosis which were associated with the increase of energy expenditure in the mice model. Moreover, we revealed that indirubin treatment increased BAT activity by promoting thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in BAT and induced browning of subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (sWAT) of mice under HFD. Besides, our results indicated that indirubin induced UCP1 expression in brown adipocytes, at least in part, via activation of PKA and p38MAPK signaling pathways. Conclusions: Our results clearly show that as an effective BAT (as well as beige cells) activator, indirubin may have a protective effect on the prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications.","['Wei, Gang', 'Sun, Honglin', 'Liu, Jun-Li', 'Dong, Kai', 'Liu, Junli', 'Zhang, Min']","['Wei G', 'Sun H', 'Liu JL', 'Dong K', 'Liu J', 'Zhang M']","[""Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Shanghai Diabetes Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200032 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Shanghai Diabetes Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200032 People's Republic of China."", ""2Henan Key Laboratory of Neurorestoratology, Henan International Joint Laboratory of Neurorestoratology for Senile Dementia, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui, 453100 Henan Province People's Republic of China.grid.493088.e"", ""3Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003 People's Republic of China.grid.73113.370000 0004 0369 1660"", ""Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Shanghai Diabetes Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200032 People's Republic of China."", ""4Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, 200030 People's Republic of China.grid.16821.3c0000 0004 0368 8293""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200316,England,Nutr Metab (Lond),Nutrition & metabolism,101231644,,,,PMC7076951,,['NOTNLM'],"['Brown adipose tissue', 'Connectivity MAP', 'Energy expenditure', 'Indirubin', 'Obesity']",2020/03/20 06:00,2020/03/20 06:01,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12986-020-00440-4 [doi]', '440 [pii]']",epublish,Nutr Metab (Lond). 2020 Mar 16;17:21. doi: 10.1186/s12986-020-00440-4. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric chemical structures have been established as an important trend on medicinal chemistry in the last years. Thiazacridines are hybrid molecules composed of a thiazolidine and acridine nucleus, both pharmacophores that act on important biological targets for cancer. By the fact it is a serious disease, seven new 3-acridin-9-ylmethyl-thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives were synthesized, characterized, analyzed by computer simulation and tested in tumor cells. In order to find out if the compounds have therapeutic potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven new 3-acridin-9-ylmethyl-thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives were synthesized through Michael addition and Knoevenagel condensation strategies. Characterization was performed by NMR and Infrared spectroscopy techniques. Regarding biological activity, thiazacridines were tested against solid and hematopoietic tumoral cell lines, namely Jurkat (acute T-cell leukemia); HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia); DU 145 (prostate cancer); MOLT-4 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia); RAJI (Burkitt's lymphoma); K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and normal cells PBMC (healthy volunteers). Molecular docking analysis was also performed in order to assess major targets of these new compounds. Cell cycle and clonogenic assay were also performed. RESULTS: Compound LPSF/AA-62 (9f) exhibited the most potent anticancer activity against HL-60 (IC50 3,7+/-1,7 muM), MOLT-4 (IC50 5,7+/-1,1 muM), Jurkat (IC50 18,6 muM), Du-145 (IC50 20+/-5 muM) and Raji (IC50 52,3+/-9,2 muM). While the compound LPSF/AA-57 (9b) exhibited anticancer activity against the K562 cell line (IC50 51,8+/-7,8 muM). Derivative LPSF/AA-62 (9f) did not interfere in the cell cycle phases of the Molt-4 lineage. However, the LPSF/AA-62 (9f) derivative significantly reduced the formation of prostate cancer cell clones. The compound LPSF/AA-62 (9f) has shown strong anchorage stability with enzymes topoisomerases 1 and 2, in particular due the presence of chlorine favored hydrogen bonds with topoisomerase 1. CONCLUSION: The 3-(acridin-9-ylmethyl)-5-((10-chloroanthracen-9-yl)methylene)thiazolidine-2,4-dio ne (LPSF/AA-62) presented the most promising results, showing anti-tumor activity in 5 of the 6 cell types tested, especially inhibiting the formation of colonies of prostate tumor cells (DU-145).","['Almeida, Marcel L', 'Viana, Douglas C F', 'da Costa, Valecia C M', 'Dos Santos, Flaviana A', 'Pereira, Michelly C', 'Pitta, Maira G R', 'de Melo Rego, Moacyr J B', 'Pitta, Ivan R', 'Pitta, Marina G R']","['Almeida ML', 'Viana DCF', 'da Costa VCM', 'Dos Santos FA', 'Pereira MC', 'Pitta MGR', 'de Melo Rego MJB', 'Pitta IR', 'Pitta MGR']","['Laboratory of Design and Drug Synthesis (LPSF), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Biosciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Design and Drug Synthesis (LPSF), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Biosciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Biosciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Biosciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Biosciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Biosciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunomodulation and New Therapeutic Approaches (LINAT), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Biosciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Design and Drug Synthesis (LPSF), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Biosciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Design and Drug Synthesis (LPSF), Nucleus of Research in Therapeutical Innovation Suely Galdino (NUPIT SG), Biosciences Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,9810948,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Acridines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', '*Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acridine', '*cancer', '*cytotoxicity', '*medicinal chemistry', '*therapeutic innovation', '*thiazolidine']",2020/03/20 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCHTS-EPUB-105368 [pii]', '10.2174/1386207323666200319105239 [doi]']",ppublish,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2020;23(5):359-368. doi: 10.2174/1386207323666200319105239.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disease progression or relapse following frontline chemoimmunotherapy, largely in the form of standard R-CHOP, occurs in 30-40% patients. Relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL represents a major unmet medical need. In particular, patients with primary refractory disease or those whose lymphoma relapses after autologous stem cell transplantation have historically had poor outcomes.Material and methods: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy is a promising novel treatment with curative potential in this setting. CART is based on ex vivo genetic modification of autologous T-cells to express chimeric receptors targeting antigens highly expressed in tumors such as CD19 in DLBCL. After lymphocyte-depleting therapy, patients are infused with CARTs that expand in vivo and target CD19-positive lymphoma cells.Results: In initial phase I-II trials, investigators have demonstrated complete responses in 40-50% of patients with R/R DLBCL, resulting in durable remission approaching 3 years of follow-up in most of these patients without further treatment. The logistics of delivery are complex as cell products require timely long-distance transfer between hospitals and production facilities. The unique toxicity profile of CARTs, including the risk of fatal immunological and neurologic events, also requires specific hospital wide management approaches and education. The substantial direct and indirect costs of CART will limit access even in countries with well resourced health care systems.Conclusions: While only two products are commercially available at present, further approvals in coming years appear likely. Future directions include CARTs with reactivity to tumor antigens other than CD19 and products targeting multiple tumor antigens to overcome resistance. The availability of CART has altered the current treatment algorithm for R/R DLBCL, and indications will likely expand to earlier lines of therapy and other hematologic malignancies.","['El-Galaly, Tarec Christoffer', 'Cheah, Chan Yoon', 'Kristensen, Daniel', 'Hutchison, Andrew', 'Hay, Kevin', 'Callreus, Torbjorn', 'Villa, Diego']","['El-Galaly TC', 'Cheah CY', 'Kristensen D', 'Hutchison A', 'Hay K', 'Callreus T', 'Villa D']","['Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Clinical Cancer Research Centre, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Sir Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Pathwest Laboratory Medicine, Nedlands, Australia.', 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Fiona Stanley Hospital, Murdoch, Australia.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of BC and BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'BC Cancer Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, Vancouver, Canada.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4625-3009'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200319,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)', 'U2I8T43Y7R (axicabtagene ciloleucel)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Products', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/economics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Failure']",,,,,2020/03/20 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2020.1741680 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2020 Jul;59(7):766-774. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2020.1741680.

Differently located MSCs differ in growth potential, differentiation ability and gene expression when cultured in vitro, and studies show different healing abilities for different MSC subgroups. In this study, bone marrow derived MSCs (BMSCs) and adipose tissue derived MSCs (ADSCs) from six human donors with coronary artery disease were compared for growth potential and expression of target genes (Angpt1, LIF, HGF, TGF-beta1 and VEGF-A) in response to exposure to 1% and 5% O2, for up to 48 h. We found greater growth of ADSCs compared to BMSCs. ADSCs expressed higher levels of Angpt1, LIF and TGF-beta1 and equal levels of VEGF-A and HGF as BMSCs. In BMSCs, exposure to low oxygen resulted in upregulation of TGF-beta1, whereas other target genes were unaffected. Upregulation was only present at 1% O2.

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) are considered major inhibitory immune checkpoints expressed on T cells. In this study, we investigated mRNA expression of CTLA-4 and LAG-3, as well as their diagnostic and prognostic value in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The study involved 60 AML patients and 15 controls. Significantly up-regulated CTLA-4 (P = .005) and LAG-3 (P = .02) mRNA expressions were found in AML patients as compared with the healthy control group. AML patients with unfavorable prognosis also showed significant up-regulation of CTLA-4 (P = .006) and LAG-3 (P = .001) mRNA expressions as compared with those with favorable prognosis. Moreover, multiple stepwise linear regression analysis confirmed that patients prognosis was an independent predictor of both CTLA-4 (P = .003) and LAG-3 (P < .001) expression levels. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve using combined CTLA-4 and LAG-3 expression showed good diagnostic value for AML (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.80, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 80% for a cut-off probability >.619) as well as moderate predictive value for unfavorable prognosis (AUC = 0.760, sensitivity = 70%, specificity =100% for a cut-off probability >.617).

Numerous studies have shown that ITCs exhibit anticancer activity by affecting multiple pathways including apoptosis and oxidative stress, and are expected to be developed into novel anticancer drugs. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that ITCs effectively inhibit the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, also induce apoptosis and autophagy. In the present study, we found that phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) had significant synergistic effects with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gefitinib in NSCLC cell lines NCI-H1299 and SK-MES-1; and the degradation of antiapoptotic factor myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) caused by PEITC treatment played key roles in the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to Gefitinib. We further illustrated that PEITC regulated the expression of Mcl-1 through protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha-CHOP-Noxa pathway by a posttranscriptional modulation. Pretreatment with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid and knockdown of PERK expression attenuated the degradation of Mcl-1 caused by PEITC. In in vivo study, nude mice bearing NCI-H1299 xenograft were administrated with PEITC (50 mg/kg, ip) and Gefitinib (50 mg/kg, ig) for 15 days, the PEITC-Gefitinib combination treatment resulted in a significant synergistic reduction in tumor growth, and significantly induced both ER stress and Mcl-1 degradation in tumor tissues. In conclusion, we explored the prospect of PEITC in improving the efficacy of targeted drug therapy and demonstrated the synergistic effects and underlined mechanisms of PEITC combined with Gefitinib in NSCLC cells treatment. This study provided useful information for developing novel therapy strategies by combination treatment of PEITC with targeted drugs.","['Zhang, Qicheng', 'Chen, Mengmeng', 'Cao, Limin', 'Ren, Yinghui', 'Guo, Xueru', 'Wu, Xiang', 'Xu, Ke']","['Zhang Q', 'Chen M', 'Cao L', 'Ren Y', 'Guo X', 'Wu X', 'Xu K']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenvironment, Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenvironment, Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenvironment, Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenvironment, Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenvironment, Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Core Facility Center, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenvironment, Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7277-0280', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8158-3399']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200318,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', '*Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gefitinib/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/administration & dosage', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Gefitinib', '*Mcl-1', '*non-small cell lung cancer', '*phenethyl isothiocyanate', '*synergistic effect']",2020/03/20 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.23184 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2020 Jun;59(6):590-603. doi: 10.1002/mc.23184.

It is known that Bcl-x splicing is deregulated and is involved in multiple malignant cancer initiation and chemotherapy resistance, including CML. The aim of the present study was to correct the abnormal splicing of Bcl-x in CML and investigate the subsequent malignant phenotype changes, especially response to IM. The aberrant Bcl-x splicing in CML cells was effectively restored using vivo-Morpholino Antisense Oligomer (vMO). CCK-8 cell viability assay and flow cytometry showed that restoring of Bcl-x splicing increases IM-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of K562 cells. Moreover, a more significant similar phenomenon was observed in imatinib-resistant CML cell lines K562/G01. Finally, establishment of CML xenograft model had also proved that correcting Bcl-x splicing in vivo can also enhance the anti-tumor effect of IM. Our findings suggest that vMO co-operating with IM can effectively increase the sensitivity of CML cells to IM both in vitro and in vivo, and Bcl-x splicing could become good candidates for chemotherapy-sensitized target in IM-resistant CML.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Wang, Yan', 'Li, Shu-Qi', 'Fang, Le', 'Wang, Xiao-Zhong', 'Li, Jing', 'Zhang, Hai-Bin', 'Huang, Bo', 'Xu, Yan-Mei', 'Yang, Wei-Ming', 'Lin, Jin', 'Min, Qing-Hua', 'Liao, Zhi-Hua', 'Wu, Yan', 'Liu, Jing']","['Zhang J', 'Wang Y', 'Li SQ', 'Fang L', 'Wang XZ', 'Li J', 'Zhang HB', 'Huang B', 'Xu YM', 'Yang WM', 'Lin J', 'Min QH', 'Liao ZH', 'Wu Y', 'Liu J']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic, Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, 521 Hospital of Ordnance Industry, Xi'an, China."", 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jiangxi Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, Nanchang, China.', 'Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Donghu District, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Nanchang, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2172-4708'],['eng'],"['81560033/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '81660029/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '81860034/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', 'GJJ170158/Ministry of Education of Jiangxi Province/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200319,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Morpholinos)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Morpholinos/*pharmacology', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing/*drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', '*bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-x', '*IMATINIB', '*chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*splicing']",2020/03/20 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16472 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jun;189(6):1141-1150. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16472.

The outcome improved dramatically and was well quantified for early stage breast cancer (EBC). However, progress in the treatment of metastatic disease has been less convincingly demonstrated. We have studied survival data of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) from a large academic cancer center over a period of 20 years. METHODS: Data from 1033 consecutive MBC patients who were treated at the Department of Medical Oncology of the West German Cancer Center from January 1990 to December 2009 were retrospectively analyzed for overall survival (OS) and risk factors. Patients were grouped in 5-year cohorts, and survival parameters of each cohort were compared before and after adjustment for risk factors. RESULTS: Overall survival of patients with MBC treated at specialized center has significantly improved from 1990 to 2010 (hazard ratio 0.7, 95%CI 0.58-0.84). The increments in OS have become less profound over time (median OS 1990-1994: 24.2 months, 1995-1999: 29.6 months, 2000-2004: 36.5 months, 2005-2009: 37.8 months). CONCLUSION: Survival of patients with MBC has improved between 1990 and 2004, but less from 2005 to 2009. Either this suggests an unnoticed shift in the patient population, or a lesser impact of therapeutic innovations introduced in the most recent period.","['Welt, Anja', 'Bogner, Simon', 'Arendt, Marina', 'Kossow, Josef', 'Huffziger, Antonia', 'Pohlkamp, Christian', 'Steiniger, Heike', 'Becker, Ute', 'Alashkar, Ferras', 'Kohl, Marzena', 'Wiesweg, Marcel', 'Richly, Heike', 'Hense, Jorg', 'Scheulen, Max E', 'Schuler, Martin', 'Seeber, Siegfried', 'Tewes, Mitra']","['Welt A', 'Bogner S', 'Arendt M', 'Kossow J', 'Huffziger A', 'Pohlkamp C', 'Steiniger H', 'Becker U', 'Alashkar F', 'Kohl M', 'Wiesweg M', 'Richly H', 'Hense J', 'Scheulen ME', 'Schuler M', 'Seeber S', 'Tewes M']","['Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany. anja.welt@uk-essen.de.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Dortmund, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery, Herz-Jesu-Krankenhaus, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Augusta Krankenhaus, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL), Munchen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Practice for Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Oberhausen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, St. Bernhard Hospital, Kamp-Lintfort, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Practice for General Medicine, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Practice for General Medicine, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Practice for Internal Medicine, Preventicum, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200318,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', '*Cancer Care Facilities', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm Metastasis', '*Survival Analysis']",PMC7230039,,['NOTNLM'],"['Long-term survival', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'New drugs']",2020/03/20 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-020-03184-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-020-03184-z [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2020 Jun;146(6):1559-1566. doi: 10.1007/s00432-020-03184-z.

These new group of quantum dots have been shown to possess some therapeutic action against cancer cell lines but not significant enough to be referred to as an ideal therapeutic agent. In this report, we address this problem by conjugating red emitting CuInS/ZnS QDs to a 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin -photosensitizer for improved bioactivities. The glutathione capped CuInS/ZnS QDs were synthesized in an aqueous medium using a kitchen pressure cooker at different Cu: In ratios (1:4 and 1:8) and at varied temperatures (95 degrees C, 190 degrees C and 235 degrees C). Optical properties show that the as-synthesized CuInS/ZnS QDs become red-shifted compared to the core (CuInS) after passivation with emission in the red region while the cytotoxicity study revealed excellent cell viability against normal kidney fibroblasts (BHK21). The highly fluorescent, water-soluble QDs were conjugated to 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin (mTHPP) via esterification reactions at room temperature. The resultant water-soluble conjugate was then used for the cytotoxicity, fluorescent imaging and gene expression study against human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1). Our result showed that the conjugate possessed high cytotoxicity against THP-1 cells with enhanced localized cell uptake compared to the bare QDs. In addition, the gene expression study revealed that the conjugate induced inflammation compared to the QDs as NFKB gene was over-expressed upon cell inflammation while the singlet oxygen ((1)O2) study showed the conjugate possessed large amount of (1)O2, three times than the bare porphyrin. Thus, the as-synthesized conjugate looks promising as a therapeutic agent for cancer therapy.","['Tsolekile, Ncediwe', 'Nahle, Sara', 'Zikalala, Nkosingiphile', 'Parani, Sundararajan', 'Sakho, El Hadji Mamour', 'Joubert, Olivier', 'Matoetoe, Mangaka C', 'Songca, Sandile P', 'Oluwafemi, Oluwatobi S']","['Tsolekile N', 'Nahle S', 'Zikalala N', 'Parani S', 'Sakho EHM', 'Joubert O', 'Matoetoe MC', 'Songca SP', 'Oluwafemi OS']","['Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Johannesburg, P.

We present FLAIR (Full-Length Alternative Isoform analysis of RNA), a computational workflow to identify high-confidence transcripts, perform differential splicing event analysis, and differential isoform analysis. Using nanopore reads, we demonstrate differential 3' splice site changes associated with SF3B1 mutation, agreeing with previous studies. We also observe a strong downregulation of intron retention events associated with SF3B1 mutation. Full-length transcript analysis links multiple alternative splicing events together and allows for better estimates of the abundance of productive versus unproductive isoforms.

Here, we developed an integrative approach to systematically identify and characterize noncoding regulatory variants with functional consequences in human hematopoietic malignancies. Combining targeted resequencing of hematopoietic lineage-associated CREs and mutation discovery, we uncovered 1,836 recurrently mutated CREs containing leukemia-associated noncoding variants. By enhanced CRISPR/dCas9-based CRE perturbation screening and functional analyses, we identified 218 variant-associated oncogenic or tumor-suppressive CREs in human leukemia. Noncoding variants at KRAS and PER2 enhancers reside in proximity to nuclear receptor (NR) binding regions and modulate transcriptional activities in response to NR signaling in leukemia cells. NR binding sites frequently colocalize with noncoding variants across cancer types. Hence, recurrent noncoding variants connect enhancer dysregulation with nuclear receptor signaling in hematopoietic malignancies. SIGNIFICANCE: We describe an integrative approach to identify noncoding variants in human leukemia, and reveal cohorts of variant-associated oncogenic and tumor-suppressive cis-regulatory elements including KRAS and PER2 enhancers. Our findings support a model in which noncoding regulatory variants connect enhancer dysregulation with nuclear receptor signaling to modulate gene programs in hematopoietic malignancies.See related commentary by van Galen, p. 646.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 627.","['Li, Kailong', 'Zhang, Yuannyu', 'Liu, Xin', 'Liu, Yuxuan', 'Gu, Zhimin', 'Cao, Hui', 'Dickerson, Kathryn E', 'Chen, Mingyi', 'Chen, Weina', 'Shao, Zhen', 'Ni, Min', 'Xu, Jian']","['Li K', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu X', 'Liu Y', 'Gu Z', 'Cao H', 'Dickerson KE', 'Chen M', 'Chen W', 'Shao Z', 'Ni M', 'Xu J']","[""Children's Medical Center Research Institute, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Harold C.

Here, we characterize 98 tumors and 12 isogenic cell lines harboring SF3B1 hotspot mutations, identifying hundreds of cryptic 3' splice sites common and specific to different cancer types. Regulatory network analysis revealed that the most common SF3B1 mutation activates MYC via effects conserved across human and mouse cells. SF3B1 mutations promote decay of transcripts encoding the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunit PPP2R5A, increasing MYC S62 and BCL2 S70 phosphorylation which, in turn, promotes MYC protein stability and impair apoptosis, respectively. Genetic PPP2R5A restoration or pharmacologic PP2A activation impaired SF3B1-mutant tumorigenesis, elucidating a therapeutic approach to aberrant splicing by mutant SF3B1. SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we identify that mutations in SF3B1, the most commonly mutated splicing factor gene across cancers, alter splicing of a specific subunit of the PP2A serine/threonine phosphatase complex to confer post-translational MYC and BCL2 activation, which is therapeutically intervenable using an FDA-approved drug.See related commentary by O'Connor and Narla, p. 765.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 747.","['Liu, Zhaoqi', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Wang, Jiguang', 'Cho, Hana', 'Chun-Wei Lee, Stanley', 'Ki, Michelle', 'Bitner, Lillian', 'Chu, Timothy', 'Shah, Harshal', 'Liu, Bo', 'Mato, Anthony R', 'Ruvolo, Peter', 'Fabbri, Giulia', 'Pasqualucci, Laura', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Rabadan, Raul']","['Liu Z', 'Yoshimi A', 'Wang J', 'Cho H', 'Chun-Wei Lee S', 'Ki M', 'Bitner L', 'Chu T', 'Shah H', 'Liu B', 'Mato AR', 'Ruvolo P', 'Fabbri G', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Rabadan R']","['Program for Mathematical Genomics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Departments of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York. rr2579@cumc.columbia.edu yoshimia@mskcc.org.', 'Division of Life Science, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Center for Systems Biology and Human Health and State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Program for Mathematical Genomics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Departments of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Program for Mathematical Genomics, Columbia University, New York, New York. rr2579@cumc.columbia.edu yoshimia@mskcc.org.', 'Departments of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0664-7281', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6923-4097', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7556-0422']",['eng'],"['R01 CA185486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA179044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL128239/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA193313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA087497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 CA218896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200318,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics']",PMC8188517,['NIHMS1578078'],,,2020/03/20 06:00,2021/10/01 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-19-1330 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-1330 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2020 Jun;10(6):806-821. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-1330.

Mutations in the SHP2 gene have been linked to many different types of human diseases, including developmental disorders, leukemia, and solid tumors. Unlike most SHP2-activating mutations, the T507K substitution in SHP2 is unique in that it exhibits oncogenic Ras-like transforming activity. However, the biochemical basis of how the SHP2/T507K variant elicits transformation remains unclear. By combining kinetic and biophysical methods, X-ray crystallography, and molecular modeling, as well as using cell biology approaches, here we uncovered that the T507K substitution alters both SHP2 substrate specificity and its allosteric regulatory mechanism. We found that although SHP2/T507K exists in the closed, autoinhibited conformation similar to the WT enzyme, the interactions between its N-SH2 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase domains are weakened such that SHP2/T507K possesses a higher affinity for the scaffolding protein Grb2-associated binding protein 1 (Gab1). We also discovered that the T507K substitution alters the structure of the SHP2 active site, resulting in a change in SHP2 substrate preference for Sprouty1, a known negative regulator of Ras signaling and a potential tumor suppressor. Our results suggest that SHP2/T507K's shift in substrate specificity coupled with its preferential association of SHP2/T507K with Gab1 enable the mutant SHP2 to more efficiently dephosphorylate Sprouty1 at pTyr-53. This dephosphorylation hyperactivates Ras signaling, which is likely responsible for SHP2/T507K's Ras-like transforming activity.","['Zhang, Ruo-Yu', 'Yu, Zhi-Hong', 'Chen, Lan', 'Walls, Chad D', 'Zhang, Sheng', 'Wu, Li', 'Zhang, Zhong-Yin']","['Zhang RY', 'Yu ZH', 'Chen L', 'Walls CD', 'Zhang S', 'Wu L', 'Zhang ZY']","['Departments of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and of Chemistry, Center for Cancer Research, and Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907.', 'Departments of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and of Chemistry, Center for Cancer Research, and Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907.', 'Departments of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and of Chemistry, Center for Cancer Research, and Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907.', 'Departments of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and of Chemistry, Center for Cancer Research, and Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907.', 'Departments of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and of Chemistry, Center for Cancer Research, and Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907.', 'Departments of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and of Chemistry, Center for Cancer Research, and Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907.', 'Departments of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and of Chemistry, Center for Cancer Research, and Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907.

Type A LA due to anaerobic glycolysis is frequently seen during management of haematological malignancies. A rare form of LA known as type B LA, which occurs as a result of metabolic dysregulation at cellular level has been described recently. This has been reported to be because of Warburg effect (WE) or aerobic glycolysis, which is seen in cancerous cells as they rely on aerobic glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy generation. Presence of type B LA at initial presentation of haematological malignancies is a poor prognosticating factor and has rarely been reported in children. We present a child with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with mild phenotype of type B LA due to WE.

The cancer epigenome is composed of the epigenetic patterns present in the tumor-initiating cell at the time of transformation, and the tumor-specific epigenetic alterations that are acquired during tumor initiation and progression. The precise dissection of these two components of the tumor epigenome will facilitate a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying malignant transformation. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) originates from differentiating B cells, which undergo extensive epigenetic programming. This poses the challenge to precisely determine the epigenomic ground state of the cell-of-origin in order to identify CLL-specific epigenetic aberrations. METHODS: We developed a linear regression model, methylome-based cell-of-origin modeling (Methyl-COOM), to map the cell-of-origin for individual CLL patients based on the continuum of epigenomic changes during normal B cell differentiation. RESULTS: Methyl-COOM accurately maps the cell-of-origin of CLL and identifies CLL-specific aberrant DNA methylation events that are not confounded by physiologic epigenetic B cell programming. Furthermore, Methyl-COOM unmasks abnormal action of transcription factors, altered super-enhancer activities, and aberrant transcript expression in CLL. Among the aberrantly regulated transcripts were many genes that have previously been implicated in T cell biology. Flow cytometry analysis of these markers confirmed their aberrant expression on malignant B cells at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: Methyl-COOM analysis of CLL identified disease-specific aberrant gene regulation. The aberrantly expressed genes identified in this study might play a role in immune-evasion in CLL and might serve as novel targets for immunotherapy approaches. In summary, we propose a novel framework for in silico modeling of reference DNA methylomes and for the identification of cancer-specific epigenetic changes, a concept that can be broadly applied to other human malignancies.","['Wierzbinska, Justyna A', 'Toth, Reka', 'Ishaque, Naveed', 'Rippe, Karsten', 'Mallm, Jan-Philipp', 'Klett, Lara C', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Hielscher, Thomas', 'Seifert, Marc', 'Kuppers, Ralf', 'Assenov, Yassen', 'Lutsik, Pavlo', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Roessner, Philipp M', 'Seiffert, Martina', 'Byrd, John', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Lipka, Daniel B']","['Wierzbinska JA', 'Toth R', 'Ishaque N', 'Rippe K', 'Mallm JP', 'Klett LC', 'Mertens D', 'Zenz T', 'Hielscher T', 'Seifert M', 'Kuppers R', 'Assenov Y', 'Lutsik P', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Roessner PM', 'Seiffert M', 'Byrd J', 'Oakes CC', 'Plass C', 'Lipka DB']","['Division of Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'The German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'The German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'The German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Chromatin Networks, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'The German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Chromatin Networks, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Chromatin Networks, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'The German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Experimental Hematology Lab, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Biostatistics, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Group Molecular Genetics, Essen University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Group Molecular Genetics, Essen University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. c.plass@dkfz.de.', 'The German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany. c.plass@dkfz.de.', 'The German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany. d.lipka@dkfz.de.', 'Section Translational Cancer Epigenomics, Division of Translational Medical Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 581, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. d.lipka@dkfz.de.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany. d.lipka@dkfz.de.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Medical Center, Otto-von-Guericke-University, 39120, Magdeburg, Germany. d.lipka@dkfz.de.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5081-7869'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200318,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Clonal Hematopoiesis', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Epigenome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptome']",PMC7081711,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell-of-origin', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*DNA methylation', '*T cell antigens']",2020/03/20 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13073-020-00724-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13073-020-00724-7 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2020 Mar 18;12(1):29. doi: 10.1186/s13073-020-00724-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have described the characteristics of vanB VRE infection. We sought to describe the epidemiology, treatment and outcomes of VRE bloodstream infections (BSI) in a vanB predominant setting in malignant hematology and oncology patients. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed at two large Australian centres and spanning a 6-year period (2008-2014). Evaluable outcomes were intensive care admission (ICU) within 48 h of BSI, all-cause mortality (7 and 30 days) and length of admission. RESULTS: Overall, 106 BSI episodes were observed in 96 patients, predominantly Enterococcus faecium vanB (105/106, 99%). Antibiotics were administered for a median of 17 days prior to BSI, and 76/96 (79%) were neutropenic at BSI onset. Of patients screened before BSI onset, 49/72 (68%) were found to be colonised. Treatment included teicoplanin (59), linezolid (6), daptomycin (2) and sequential/multiple agents (21). Mortality at 30-days was 31%. On multivariable analysis, teicoplanin was not associated with mortality at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: VRE BSI in a vanB endemic setting occurred in the context of substantive prior antibiotic use and was associated with high 30-day mortality. Targeted screening identified 68% to be colonised prior to BSI. Teicoplanin therapy was not associated with poorer outcomes and warrants further study for vanB VRE BSI in cancer populations.","['Xie, Ouli', 'Slavin, Monica A', 'Teh, Benjamin W', 'Bajel, Ashish', 'Douglas, Abby P', 'Worth, Leon J']","['Xie O', 'Slavin MA', 'Teh BW', 'Bajel A', 'Douglas AP', 'Worth LJ']","['Victorian Infectious Disease Service, Royal Melbourne Hospital, 300 Grattan St, Parkville, 3050, Australia.

It has been evidently found for its effectiveness in ethanomedicinal usage, which can also emerge as one of the most promising sources for nutraceuticals. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the phytochemistry of the whole crude extract of T. coadunata for the first time with evaluation of antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer activity. METHODS: High Resolution Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry analysis (HR-LCMS) was performed for confirming the presence of biologically active constituents in the extract of T. coadunata followed by antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer activity. RESULTS: With the detailed Mass spectra data, absorbance spectra and retention times, chemical composition of T. coadunata holds a diverse group of bioactive/chemical components such as sugars, sugar alcohol, flavonoids, terpenoids and phenolics. The results for antioxidant activity showed that T. coadunata crude extract had higher scavenging potential against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals than H2O2 molecules, which was followed by positive antibacterial activity against several pathogenic bacteria like Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi. DISCUSSION: The ethanolic extract of T. coadunata showed favorable antiproliferation activity against three leukemic (KG1, MOLT-3 and K-562) cells in a dose dependent manner, especially for KG1 42.850+/-1.24mug/ml. CONCLUSION: This study has provided a better understanding of the presence of biologically active phytochemical constituents in the extract of T. coadunata, which can be the reason for its bioactive potential. Moreover, T. coadunata has significant anticancer activities against human leukemic cancer cell lines, indicating it as a potential anticancer agent.","['Reddy, Mandadi N', 'Adnan, Mohd', 'Alreshidi, Mousa M', 'Saeed, Mohd', 'Patel, Mitesh']","['Reddy MN', 'Adnan M', 'Alreshidi MM', 'Saeed M', 'Patel M']","['Bapalal Vaidya Botanical Research Centre, Department of Biosciences, Veer Narmad South Gujarat University, Surat, Gujarat, India.', ""Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, PO Box 2440, Saudi Arabia."", ""Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, PO Box 2440, Saudi Arabia."", ""Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, PO Box 2440, Saudi Arabia."", 'Bapalal Vaidya Botanical Research Centre, Department of Biosciences, Veer Narmad South Gujarat University, Surat, Gujarat, India.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Phytochemicals)', '0 (Picrates)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'DFD3H4VGDH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ferns/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phytochemicals/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Picrates/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Salmonella typhi/drug effects', 'Shigella flexneri/drug effects', 'Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HR-LCMS', '*Tectaria coadunata', '*antibacterial', '*anticancer', '*antioxidant', '*ethanomedicinal plants', '*leukemia', '*phytochemical analysis']",2020/03/20 06:00,2021/06/03 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-105336 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200318101938 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(15):1845-1856. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200318101938.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a phase 3 study (NCT01696084), CPX-351 (Vyxeos) showed significant benefits to overall survival and complete remission versus conventional 7 + 3 cytarabine/daunorubicin. This analysis evaluated HRU in patients aged 60-75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary AML treated with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 in the phase 3 study.Materials and methods: Patients were randomized to receive up to two induction cycles with CPX-351 or 7 + 3. Responders could receive up to two cycles of consolidation. To normalize HRU to length of treatment, patients were assessed on a per patient-year (PPY) basis. HRU analyses included hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stays, anti-infective use, transfusions, and white blood cell colony-stimulating factor (CSF).Results: The median (range) total duration of hospitalization was 39 (3-110) days with CPX-351 (n = 153) and 32 (2-83) days with 7 + 3 (n = 151); the estimated durations of hospitalization PPY were 198.4 and 240.5 days, respectively. The median (range) total duration of ICU stays was 0 (0-45) days with CPX-351 and 0 (0-17) days with 7 + 3; the estimated durations of ICU stays PPY were 6.7 and 10.5 days, respectively.

Beside intrinsic genetic and epigenetic alterations within the neoplastic population, abnormal function of the bone marrow stroma promotes the neoplastic process. To overcome the supportive action of the microenvironment, recent research focuses on the development of targeted therapies, inhibiting the interaction of malignant cells and niche cells.Areas covered: This review covers regulatory networks and potential druggable pathways within the hematopoietic stem cell niche. Recent insights into the cell-to-cell interactions in the bone marrow microenvironment are presented. We performed literature searches using PubMed Database from 2000 to the present.Expert opinion: Future therapy of myeloid malignancies must focus on targeted, personalized treatment addressing specific alterations within the malignant and the supporting niche cells. This includes treatments to overcome resistance mechanisms against chemotherapeutic agents mediated by supporting microenvironment. Novel techniques employing sequencing approaches, Crisp/Cas9, or transgenic mouse models are required to elucidate specific interactions between components of the bone marrow niche to identify new therapeutic targets.","['Behrmann, Lena', 'Wellbrock, Jasmin', 'Fiedler, Walter']","['Behrmann L', 'Wellbrock J', 'Fiedler W']","['Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200326,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/pathology/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Niche/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*bone marrow microenvironment', '*myelodysplastic syndrome', '*myeloid malignancies', '*myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*niche']",2020/03/20 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728222.2020.1744850 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2020 May;24(5):451-462. doi: 10.1080/14728222.2020.1744850.

Next-generation sequencing has significantly improved the ability of diagnostic research to molecularly characterize and stratify patients. This detailed outcome allowed the discovery of new therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers, which led to develop novel compounds (e.g., IDH 1 and 2 inhibitors), nowadays commonly used for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory AML. In this review we summarize the most relevant mutations affecting tumor suppressor genes that contribute to the onset and progression of AML pathology. Epigenetic modifications (TET2, IDH1 and IDH2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, WT1, EZH2), DNA repair dysregulation (TP53, NPM1), cell cycle inhibition and deficiency in differentiation (NPM1, CEBPA, TP53 and GATA2) as a consequence of somatic mutations come out as key elements in acute myeloid leukemia and may contribute to relapse and resistance to therapies. Moreover, spliceosomal machinery mutations identified in the last years, even if in a small cohort of acute myeloid leukemia patients, suggested a new opportunity to exploit therapeutically. Targeting these cellular markers will be the main challenge in the near future in an attempt to eradicate leukemia stem cells.","['Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Signorino, Elisabetta', 'Calabrese, Chiara', 'Ali, Muhammad Shahzad', 'Petiti, Jessica', 'Bracco, Enrico', 'Cilloni, Daniela']","['Panuzzo C', 'Signorino E', 'Calabrese C', 'Ali MS', 'Petiti J', 'Bracco E', 'Cilloni D']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8640-2462', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3170-2817', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6346-4791']",['eng'],['10005/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200316,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC7141302,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA repair', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell cycle', 'epigenetic', 'mutations', 'overall survival', 'relapse', 'tumor suppressors']",2020/03/20 06:00,2020/03/20 06:01,['2020/03/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9030802 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9030802 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Mar 16;9(3). pii: jcm9030802. doi: 10.3390/jcm9030802.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, oncolytic virus which arms the therapeutic gene to enhance antitumor activity is a prevalent approach. In this study, a newly developed oncolytic vaccinia virus (OVV) that expresses Beclin-1 (OVV-BECN1) was tested for its in vitro and in vivo oncolytic activity in blood cancer. Results showed that the OVV exhibited higher infectivity for leukemia cells. OVV-BECN1 induced significant apoptosis-independent cell death either in wild-type leukemia and multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines or caspase-3 shRNA leukemia cell lines, and had a superior antitumor activity compared to the parent OVV. Autophagic cell death induced by OVV-BECN1 was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo experiments. Finally, upregulation of SIRT-1, a member of class III histone deacetylases, by OVV-BECN1 resulted in the deacetylation of LC3 and its distribution from the nucleus toward the cytoplasm, which might contribute to induction of autophagy. Overall, our data showed a favorable therapeutic effect of the oncolytic vaccinia virus on blood cancers through oncolytic and autophagic mechanisms, and may therefore constitute a promising and effective therapeutic strategy for treating human leukemia and MM.

Results: For the 10 cases of MS, the mean and median age was 33.8 and 31 years (range 23 to 47 years) respectively. All patients presented with breast masses; six presented with B symptoms (6/10); and LDH level was elevated in four patients. The largest tumor dimension was 1.0 to 5.3 cm (mean 2.7 cm). All 10 patients had history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and in one patient, the AML occurred after chemotherapy for hydatidiform mole. One case was classified as M0, four were M2, two were M4 and three were M5. For the AML, all patients received chemotherapy and nine were treated by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) and the breast masses occurred4 months to 2 years post-transplant. Using Ann Arbor staging, five cases were stage , three were stage , and 2 were stage . The MS was found in the left breast (two cases); right breast (three cases) and both breasts (five cases). Lymphocyte in peripheral blood, B symptom and site of lesion had statistical significance between myeloid sarcoma and DLBCL(P<0.05). The tumor cells were primitive, expressing MPO, CD43, CD117, etc. All ten patients had follow-up information, and the median survival period was 14.4 months (range 1 to 50 months). Seven patients died. The prognosis of patients with MS was worse than DLBCL(P=0.002). Conclusions: The clinical history, pathologic morphology, immunophenotyping and molecular studies are very important for diagnosing MS tumors in the breast, and MS may occur after allo-HSCT for AML. Tumor resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion are recommended for treatment. The prognosis is poor.","['Chen, D B', 'Zhang, H', 'Kong, F Z', 'Jiang, Q', 'Fang, X Z', 'Shen, D H', 'Kan, X']","['Chen DB', 'Zhang H', 'Kong FZ', 'Jiang Q', 'Fang XZ', 'Shen DH', 'Kan X']","[""Department of Pathology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", 'Department of Pathology, Xinjiang Medical University Cancer Hospital, Urumqi 830000, China.', ""Department of Pathology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", 'Department of Pathology, Xinjiang Medical University Cancer Hospital, Urumqi 830000, China.', ""Department of Pathology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",,['chi'],['2014211C107/Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Breast neoplasms', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, large B-cell, diffuse', 'Lymphoma, non-Hodgkin']",2020/03/20 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2020.03.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 8;49(3):250-255. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2020.03.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this phase 2 study, we treated 18- to 65-year-old AML patients refractory to first-line 3 + 7 daunorubicin/cytarabine induction or relapsing after 3 + 7 induction and high-dose cytarabine consolidation, with clofarabine (30 mg/m(2) /d, Days 1-5), cytarabine (750 mg/m(2) /d, Days 1-5), and mitoxantrone (12 mg/m(2) /d, Days 3-5) (CLAM). Patients achieving remission received up to two consolidation cycles of 50% CLAM, with eligible cases bridged to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The mutational profile of a 69-gene panel was evaluated. Twenty-six men and 26 women at a median age of 46 (22-65) years were treated. The overall response rate after the first cycle of CLAM was 90.4% (complete remission, CR: 69.2%; CR with incomplete hematologic recovery, CRi: 21.2%). Twenty-two CR/CRi patients underwent allo-HSCT. The 2-year overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and event-free survival (EFS) were 65.8%, 45.7%, and 40.2%, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that superior OS was associated with CR after CLAM (P = .005) and allo-HSCT (P = .005), and superior RFS and EFS were associated with allo-HSCT (P < .001). Remarkably, CR after CLAM and allo-HSCT resulted in 2-year OS of 84.3% and 90%, respectively. Karyotypic aberrations and genetic mutations did not influence responses or survivals. Grade 3/4 neutropenia/thrombocytopenia and grade 3 febrile neutropenia occurred in all cases. Other nonhematologic toxicities were mild and uncommon. There was no treatment-related mortality and the performance of allo-HSCT was not compromised. Clofarabine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone was highly effective and safe in refractory/relapsed AML.

Based on these findings, a linear developmental model was proposed and subsequently used by all studies investigating the specific role of factors that control NKT cell development. More recently, based on intracellular staining patterns of lineage-specific transcription factors such as T-bet, GATA-3, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger and RORgammat, a lineage differentiation model was proposed for NKT cell development. Currently, studies on NKT cells development present lineage differentiation model data in addition to the linear maturation model. In the perspective presented here, we discuss current knowledge relating to NKT cell developmental models and particularly focus on the approaches and strategies, some of which appear nebulous, used to define NKT cell developmental stages and subsets.","['Klibi, Jihene', 'Amable, Ludivine', 'Benlagha, Kamel']","['Klibi J', 'Amable L', 'Benlagha K']","['INSERM, UMR-1160, Institut de Recherche St-Louis (IRSL), Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, UMR-1160, Institut de Recherche St-Louis (IRSL), Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, UMR-1160, Institut de Recherche St-Louis (IRSL), Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200318,United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Natural Killer T-Cells/immunology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'T-Box Domain Proteins', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Developmental stages', '*NKT cell subsets', '*NKT1', '*NKT17', '*NKT2', '*natural killer T cells']",2020/03/19 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/imcb.12322 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2020 May;98(5):358-368. doi: 10.1111/imcb.12322.

Of 209 patients, 131 (74%) had unmutated IGHV, 38 (20%) had TP53 disruption, and 47 (22%) were previously untreated.

This study aims to describe the epidemiology of and the risk factors for mortality in these patients. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study including all consecutive PICU oncology admissions from 2011 to 2017. Demographic and clinical risk factors between survivors and nonsurvivors were compared. Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to quantify the association between 60-day mortality and admission categories, accounting for other covariates (Pediatric Risk Of Mortality [PRISM] III score and previous bacteremia). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 60-day mortality. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) age and PRISM III scores of pediatric oncology patients admitted to the PICU were 7 (3, 12) years and 3 (0, 5), respectively. The most common underlying oncological diagnoses were brain tumors (73/200 [36.5%]) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36/200 [18.0%]). Emergency admissions accounted for approximately half of all admissions (108/200 [54.0%]), including cardiovascular (24/108 [22.2%]), neurology (24/108 [22.2%]), respiratory (22/108 [20.4%]), and ""other"" indications (38/108 [35.2%]). The overall 60-day mortality was 35 of 200 (17.5%). Independent risk factors for mortality were emergency respiratory and neurology categories of admission (adjusted hazard ratio[aHR]: 5.62, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.57, 20.19; P = .008 and aHR: 6.96, 95% CI: 2.04, 23.75; P = .002, respectively) and previous bacteremia (aHR: 3.37, 95% CI: 1.57, 7.20; P = .002).

We analyzed an administrative database containing the registration of all hospitalizations occurring in Portuguese public hospitals in 2013-2015. ADEs were identified using the codes E850-858.9 and E930-949.9 from ICD-9-CM. We identified all episodes with registration of in-hospital ADE and we compared them with a random sample of an equal number of episodes with no events recorded. A total of 3,041,443 cases were analyzed, 60,521 presented at least one ADE from which 17,213 occurred in hospital context. The most frequent drug classes associated with ADE were the antineoplastics/immunosuppressant drugs, antibiotics and steroids. Patient characteristics associated with a greater occurrence of in-hospital ADEs (all with p < 0.001) were medical admissions (OR = 1.29), the diagnosis - myeloid leukaemia (OR = 18.63), nephrotic syndrome (OR = 15.75), pneumonia (OR = 1.33) -, a higher number of secondary diagnoses (OR = 1.27), and increased duration of hospital stay (OR = 1.06). Hospitalizations with records of in-hospital ADEs presented a significantly higher mortality (9.6% vs. 4.5) and duration of hospitalization (22.6 vs. 6.4 days). ADEs were shown to be directly associated with an increase in the duration of hospital stay of 8.18 days. This study adds some interesting insights related to the most frequent drug classes and patient characteristics that can influence the frequency of ADEs in Portuguese public hospitals and also the burden of injury resulting from them.","['Vitorino, Mavilde', 'Aguiar, Pedro', 'Sousa, Paulo']","['Vitorino M', 'Aguiar P', 'Sousa P']","['Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidenta, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Escola Nacional de Saude Publica, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Escola Nacional de Saude Publica, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200313,Brazil,Cad Saude Publica,Cadernos de saude publica,8901573,,IM,"['Brazil', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals, Public', 'Humans', 'Portugal']",,,,,2020/03/19 06:00,2020/08/08 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0102-311X2020000305006 [pii]', '10.1590/0102-311x00056519 [doi]']",ppublish,Cad Saude Publica. 2020;36(3):e00056519. doi: 10.1590/0102-311x00056519.

The targeted alpha therapy with 212Pb-NNV003 presented in this study combines cytotoxic alpha-particles from 212Pb, with the anti-CD37 antibody NNV003, targeting B-cell malignancies. The goal of this study was to explore 212Pb-NNV003 for treatment of CD37 positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in preclinical mouse models.An anti-proliferative effect of 212Pb-NNV003 was observed in both chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (MEC-2) and Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi) cells in vitro. In biodistribution experiments, accumulation of 212Pb-NNV003 was 23%ID/g and 16%ID/g in Daudi and MEC-2 tumours 24 h post injection. In two intravenous animal models 90% of the mice treated with a single injection of 212Pb-NNV003 were alive 28 weeks post cell injection. Median survival times of control groups were 5-9 weeks. There was no significant difference between different specific activities of 212Pb-NNV003 with regards to therapeutic effect or toxicity. For therapeutically effective activities, a transient haematological toxicity was observed. This study shows that 212Pb-NNV003 is effective and safe in preclinical models of CD37 positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, warranting future clinical testing.","['Maaland, Astri Fjelde', 'Saidi, Amal', 'Torgue, Julien', 'Heyerdahl, Helen', 'Stallons, Tania A Rozgaja', 'Kolstad, Arne', 'Dahle, Jostein']","['Maaland AF', 'Saidi A', 'Torgue J', 'Heyerdahl H', 'Stallons TAR', 'Kolstad A', 'Dahle J']","['Nordic Nanovector ASA, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Orano Med SAS, Courbevoie, France.', 'Orano Med LLC, Plano, Texas, United States of America.', 'Nordic Nanovector ASA, Oslo, Norway.', 'Orano Med LLC, Plano, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Nordic Nanovector ASA, Oslo, Norway.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5282-6571'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200318,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CD37 protein, human)', '0 (Lead Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lead-212)', '0 (Tetraspanins)', 'PQX0D8J21J (Cetuximab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cetuximab/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lead Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Radiometry', 'Tetraspanins/antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC7080250,,,,2020/03/19 06:00,2020/06/27 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0230526 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-29794 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Mar 18;15(3):e0230526. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0230526. eCollection 2020.,,,,"[""I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the"", 'following competing interests: JD and HH are employees and shareholders of Nordic', 'Nanovector ASA.

For glioma, this has helped to identify two diagnostic groups of tumors (oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma IDHmt) with distinct clinical characteristics and that are now diagnosed by the presence of the IDH mutations. The metabolic changes occurring as the consequence of the altered substrate affinity of the mutant IDH protein results in a cascade of intracellular changes, also inducing a relative sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared with IDHwt tumors. Pharmacologic blockade of the mutant enzyme with first-in-class inhibitors has been efficacious for the treatment of IDH-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is currently being evaluated in phase III trials for IDH-mutant glioma (INDIGO) and cholangiocarcinoma (ClarIDHy). It seems likely that acquired resistance to mutant IDH inhibitors will eventually emerge, and combination therapies to augment the antitumor activity of mutant IDH inhibitors have already been initiated. Approaches to exploit, rather than inhibit, the unique metabolism of IDH-mutant cancer cells have emerged from laboratory studies and are now also being tested in the clinic. Results of these clinical trials are eagerly awaited and will likely provide new key insights and direction of the treatment of IDH-mutant human cancer.","['van den Bent, Martin J', 'Mellinghoff, Ingo K', 'Bindra, Ranjit S']","['van den Bent MJ', 'Mellinghoff IK', 'Bindra RS']","['Department of Neurology, Brain Tumor Center at Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Departments of Therapeutic Radiology and Pathology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Brain Tumor Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.']",,['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA215453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 NS105109/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

For example, the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) may be treated with arsenic trioxide. Angiogenesis in APL is a multistep dynamic equilibrium process coordinated by various angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors, which play key roles in the occurrence, progression and chemosensitivity of this disease. Our research group previously synthesized 7difluoromethyl5,4'dimethoxygenistein (DFMG), and found that it inhibits angiogenesis during atherosclerotic plaque formation. In the present study, the effect and mechanism of DFMG in angiogenesis induced by APL HL60 cells was investigated using a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model and Matrigel tubule formation assays. The results obtained revealed an antiangiogenesis effect of DFMG towards HL60 cells. When the Tolllike receptor 4/nuclear factorkappaB (TLR4/NFkappaB) signaling pathway was inhibited, the antiangiogenic effect of DFMG was further enhanced. However, when the TLR4/NFkappaB signaling pathway was activated, the antiangiogenic effect of DFMG was attenuated. These results demonstrated that DFMG inhibits angiogenesis induced by APL HL60 cells, and provides insights into the mechanism by which DFMG inhibits the TLR4/NFkappaB signaling pathway. In conclusion, in the present study, the antiangiogenesis effect of DFMG on APL has been reported, and the mechanism by which DFMG induced the antiangiogenesis effect was explored. These findings have provided a potential new drug candidate for the treatment of patients with APL.","['Xiang, Xueping', 'Li, Lesai', 'Bo, Pingjuan', 'Kuang, Ting', 'Liu, Sujuan', 'Xie, Xiaolin', 'Guo, Sihui', 'Fu, Xiaohua', 'Zhang, Yong']","['Xiang X', 'Li L', 'Bo P', 'Kuang T', 'Liu S', 'Xie X', 'Guo S', 'Fu X', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Medical College of Hunan Normal University, Changsha, Hunan 410013, P.R.

We reported that BPDCN-like phenotype (CD123+ and either CD56+ or CD4+ or both) confers poor prognosis to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients with mutated NPM1. Here, we evaluated the incidence and the prognostic relevance of BPDCN-like phenotype in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients. From 2006 to 2016, 83 young (age <60 yrs), consecutive, CN-AML patients underwent intensive treatment. Fifteen patients (18%) showed a BPDCN-like phenotype with no difference between NPM1-mutated (mut) and NPM1-wt patients. It did not significantly affect survival neither in the whole cohort, nor in NPM1-wt patients. However, as reported, it conferred a dismal prognosis in NPM1-mut AML (p < 0.001), irrespectively of the mutational status for FLT3-ITD. In conclusion we show that BPDCN-like phenotype displays a negative prognostic relevance only in NPM1-mutated AML.","['Guolo, Fabio', 'Minetto, Paola', 'Clavio, Marino', 'Marcolin, Riccardo', 'Miglino, Maurizio', 'Passannante, Monica', 'Caviglia, Fabrizio', 'Ballerini, Filippo', 'Tedone, Elisabetta', 'Kunkl, Annalisa', 'Mangerini, Rosa', 'Contini, Paola', 'Colombo, Nicoletta', 'Cagnetta, Antonia', 'Cea, Michele', 'Carminati, Enrico', 'Pugliese, Girolamo', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Lemoli, Roberto Massimo']","['Guolo F', 'Minetto P', 'Clavio M', 'Marcolin R', 'Miglino M', 'Passannante M', 'Caviglia F', 'Ballerini F', 'Tedone E', 'Kunkl A', 'Mangerini R', 'Contini P', 'Colombo N', 'Cagnetta A', 'Cea M', 'Carminati E', 'Pugliese G', 'Gobbi M', 'Lemoli RM']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinical Flow Cytometry Unit, Department of Pathology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinical Flow Cytometry Unit, Department of Pathology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinical Flow Cytometry Unit, Department of Pathology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinical Flow Cytometry Unit, Department of Pathology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinical Flow Cytometry Unit, Department of Pathology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200318,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['*Dendritic Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*NPM1-mutation', '*blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms', '*immunophenotype', '*prognosis']",2020/03/19 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1737685 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Jul;61(7):1695-1701. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1737685.

Female mice exposed neonatally to the phytoestrogen genistein (GEN) at doses similar to those in infants consuming soy-based infant formulas are infertile due in part to uterine implantation defects. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine the mechanisms by which neonatal GEN exposure causes implantation defects. METHODS: Female mice were exposed to GEN on postnatal days (PND)1-5 and uterine tissues collected on PND5, PND22-26, and during pregnancy. Analysis of tissue weights, morphology, and gene expression was performed using standard histology, confocal imaging with three-dimensional analysis, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), and microarrays. The response of ovariectomized adults to 17beta-estradiol (E2) and artificial decidualization were measured. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) injections were given intraperitoneally and implantation sites visualized. Gene expression patterns were compared with curated data sets to identify upstream regulators. RESULTS: GEN-exposed mice exhibited reduced uterine weight gain in response to E2 treatment or artificial decidualization compared with controls; however, expression of select hormone responsive genes remained similar between the two groups. Uteri from pregnant GEN-exposed mice were posteriorized and had reduced glandular epithelium. Implantation failure was not rescued by LIF administration. Microarray analysis of GEN-exposed uteri during early pregnancy revealed significant overlap with several conditional uterine knockout mouse models, including Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17. These models exhibit reduced endometrial glands, features of posteriorization and implantation failure. Expression of Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17, as well as genes important for neonatal uterine differentiation (Wnt7a, Hoxa10, and Msx2), were severely disrupted on PND5 in GEN-exposed mice. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that neonatal GEN exposure in mice disrupts expression of genes important for uterine development, causing posteriorization and diminished gland function during pregnancy that contribute to implantation failure. These findings could have implications for women who consumed soy-based formulas as infants. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6336.","['Jefferson, Wendy N', 'Padilla-Banks, Elizabeth', 'Suen, Alisa A', 'Royer, Lindsey J', 'Zeldin, Sharon M', 'Arora, Ripla', 'Williams, Carmen J']","['Jefferson WN', 'Padilla-Banks E', 'Suen AA', 'Royer LJ', 'Zeldin SM', 'Arora R', 'Williams CJ']","['Reproductive and Developmental Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.', 'Reproductive and Developmental Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.', 'Reproductive and Developmental Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology, Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.', 'Reproductive and Developmental Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology, Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.', 'Reproductive and Developmental Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20200318,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Phytoestrogens)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Genistein/*adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Phytoestrogens/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Uterus/*drug effects/growth & development/physiopathology']",PMC7138129,,,,2020/03/19 06:00,2020/10/31 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/EHP6336 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2020 Mar;128(3):37001. doi: 10.1289/EHP6336.

We examined the effect of PL, RG, and PF (PRP), a most effective herbal formula deduced from constitutive ingredient herbs of Antai Yin which is composed of PRP, on the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression and endometrial receptivity. RESULTS: The combination of the extracts from PRP induced the LIF expression in Ishikawa cells and increased the adhesion between Ishikawa and JAr cells. In addition, PRP-induced attachment of JAr cells onto Ishikawa cells and expression of adhesion molecules, ITGAV, ITGB5, CD44s, and L-selectin, are significantly reduced by knock-down of LIF expression. CONCLUSION: Induced by the combination of the PRP extracts, the adhesion between trophoblast and endometrial cells are mediated by expression of LIF and adhesion molecules. Thus, we suggest the combination of the PRP extracts may be a novel therapy for enhancing embryo implantation rate.","['Eun-Yeong, Kim', 'Tae-Wook, Chung', 'Hee-Jung, Choi', 'Ki-Tae, Ha', 'Yeon-Seop, Jung', 'Syng-Ook, Lee', 'Jun-Yong, Choi', 'Hyung Sik, Kim', 'Sooseong, You', 'Myeong Soo, Lee']","['Eun-Yeong K', 'Tae-Wook C', 'Hee-Jung C', 'Ki-Tae H', 'Yeon-Seop J', 'Syng-Ook L', 'Jun-Yong C', 'Hyung Sik K', 'Sooseong Y', 'Myeong Soo L']","['School of Korean Medicine and Korean Medical Research Center for Healthy Aging, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate Training Program of Korean Medicine for Healthy-aging, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Korean Medicine and Korean Medical Research Center for Healthy Aging, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Korean Medicine and Korean Medical Research Center for Healthy Aging, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Korean Medicine and Korean Medical Research Center for Healthy Aging, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate Training Program of Korean Medicine for Healthy-aging, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Korean Medicine, Korean Medicine Hospital of Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Food Science and Technology, Keimyung University, Daegu 42601, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Food Science and Technology, Keimyung University, Daegu 42601, Republic of Korea.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Korean Medicine, Korean Medicine Hospital of Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Toxicology,School of Pharmacy, SungKyunKwan University, Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea.', 'Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, Republic of Korea.', 'Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,J Tradit Chin Med,Journal of traditional Chinese medicine = Chung i tsa chih ying wen pan,8211546,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Densitometry', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Paeonia/*chemistry', 'Perilla frutescens/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Rehmannia/*chemistry', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell adhesion molecules', '*Embryo implantation', '*Endometrium', '*Leukemia inhibitory factor', '*Paeonia', '*Perilla', '*Rehmannia']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['2871 [pii]'],ppublish,J Tradit Chin Med. 2019 Feb;39(1):15-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to preserve viability and function, cell growth cannot progress unchecked and must be adjusted according to the availability of nutrients. Nutrient-sensing proteins such as AMPK antagonize mTORC1 activity in response to starvation. If pro-anabolic signaling pathways are aberrantly activated, B cells may lack the metabolic capacity to accommodate their energetic needs, which can lead to cell death. On the other hand, metabolic hyperactivation is a salient feature of cancer cells, suggesting that mechanisms exist, which allow B cells to cope with metabolic stress. The aim of this review is to discuss how B cells respond to a mismatch between energy supply and demand and what the consequences are of metabolic dysregulation in normal and malignant B cells.","['Jellusova, Julia']",['Jellusova J'],"['Research Centres BIOSS and CIBSS, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Biology III at the Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5234-2104'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200317,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Survival', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/immunology', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Germinal Center/immunology/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/*immunology', 'Plasma Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cells', '*anabolism', '*autophagy', '*mTORC1', '*metabolic stress', '*senescence']",2020/03/19 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/imr.12855 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2020 May;295(1):39-53. doi: 10.1111/imr.12855.

For this reason, eligible patients receive consolidation therapy with early allogenic transplantation, but the recurrence rate remains high, even after transplantation. Moreover, the optimal therapy for patients with FLT3-ITD AML who relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains unclear. Here, we report a case in which graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects were induced by gilteritinib administration after a second transplant from the same donor, resulting in sustained remission of early FLT3-ITD AML relapse after allogeneic transplantation. Several studies suggest that the benefits of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FLT3-TKI) after allogeneic transplantation are attributable to GVL induction, as well as direct effects on FLT3 mutation-positive leukemia cells. With this in mind, we induced lymphodepletion using L-PAM to further enhance GVL induction by donor lymphocytes and FLT3-TKI. We believe that enhancement of GVL induction by lymphodepletion should be considered before FLT3-TKI use, if the prognosis is very poor, such as in patients with recurrence following allogeneic transplantation.","['Ando, Toshihiko', 'Sano, Haruna', 'Yokoo, Masako', 'Kusaba, Kana', 'Kidoguchi, Keisuke', 'Yamaguchi, Kyosuke', 'Katsuya, Hiroo', 'Yoshihara, Satoshi', 'Kubota, Yasushi', 'Kojima, Kensuke', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Ando T', 'Sano H', 'Yokoo M', 'Kusaba K', 'Kidoguchi K', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Katsuya H', 'Yoshihara S', 'Kubota Y', 'Kojima K', 'Kimura S']","['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan. ando1013@cc.saga-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200317,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/*surgery', 'Mutation', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reoperation', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', '*Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD AML', 'Gilteritinib', 'Graft-versus-leukemia effect', 'Lymphodepletion']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02858-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02858-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Aug;112(2):249-253. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02858-1.

Frontline treatment encompass high intensity combination chemotherapy with good overall survival; however, relapsing/refractory patients have very limited options. In the last years, the understanding of molecular physiopathology of this disease, lead to the identification of a subset of patients with peculiar genetic profile, namely ""early T-cell precursors"" lymphoblastic leukemia, characterized by dismal outcome and indication to frontline allogeneic bone marrow transplant. In general, the most common mutations occur in the NOTCH1/FBXW7 pathway (60% of adult patients), with a positive prognostic impact. Other pathogenic steps encompass transcriptional deregulation of oncogenes/oncosuppressors, cell cycle deregulation, kinase signaling (including IL7R-JAK-STAT pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, ABL1 signaling pathway), epigenetic deregulation, ribosomal dysfunction, and altered expression of oncogenic miRNAs or long non-coding RNA. The insight in the genomic landscape of the disease paves the way to the use of novel targeted drugs that might improve the outcome, particularly in relapse/refractory patients.

However, relapse after CAR T cell therapy is still a challenge. In addition, preclinical and early clinical studies targeting acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been as successful. This can be attributed in part to the presence of an AML microenvironment that has a dampening effect on the antitumor activity of CAR T cells. The AML microenvironment includes cellular interactions, soluble environmental factors, and structural components. Suppressive immune cells including myeloid derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells are known to inhibit T cell function. Environmental factors contributing to T cell exhaustion, including immune checkpoints, anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and metabolic alterations, impact T cell activity, persistence, and localization. Lastly, structural factors of the bone marrow niche, secondary lymphoid organs, and extramedullary sites provide opportunities for CAR T cell evasion by AML blasts, contributing to treatment resistance and relapse. In this review we discuss the effect of the AML microenvironment on CAR T cell function. We highlight opportunities to enhance CAR T cell efficacy for AML through manipulating, targeting, and evading the anti-inflammatory leukemic microenvironment.","['Epperly, Rebecca', 'Gottschalk, Stephen', 'Velasquez, M Paulina']","['Epperly R', 'Gottschalk S', 'Velasquez MP']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200228,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7058784,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cellular therapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'immunotherapy', 'microenvironment']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/03/19 06:01,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00262 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Feb 28;10:262. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00262. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Epperly, Gottschalk and Velasquez.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrated that the extract of Mangifera indica L increased cytotoxicity and caspase 3 activation through mitochondria pathway only in CLL B lymphocytes and also the extract of Juglans regia did not show cytotoxicity and caspase 3 activation on CLL and healthy B lymphocytes. Our in-vitro findings on isolated mitochondria indicated that mitochondrial ROS formation, MMP collapse, and mitochondrial swelling and cytochrome c release were significantly (p < 0.05) increased after addition of Mangifera indica only in cancerous mitochondria.

However, the role of SALL4 in the biological behavior of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and its relationship with multidrug resistance and relapse has remained largely unknown. Patients and Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to characterize the expression pattern of SALL4 in the bone marrow samples of 43 patients with Philadelphia negative ALL and 18 children in the non-cancer control group. The presence of minimal residual disease was measured a year after the initial therapy using SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism). In addition, the correlation between the expression of SALL4 and ABCA3 in relapsed patients was analyzed statistically. Results: Results showed an overexpression of SALL4 in de novo patients compared with the control group (P=0.0001, AUC= 0.93), indicating the importance of this gene in the induction of leukemia. A significant increase in the ABCA3 expression levels was revealed in the relapsed patients, in comparison with the drug-sensitive group (P = 0.0005). The leukemogenetic effect of SALL4 can be related to the effect of this gene on the maintenance of pluripotency in cancer stem cells. Results also suggest that the expression of SALL4 can be considered as a diagnostic marker for pediatric ALL. Moreover, SALL4 expression levels in the minimal residual disease positive (mrd+) ALL group was significantly higher than those in the mrd- group (p=0.0001, AUC= 0.92). Conclusion: These data demonstrate the prognostic impact of SALL4 in childhood ALL. Our findings also indicated a direct correlation between the mRNA expression levels of SALL4 and ABCA3 transporter in the relapsed group of ALL patients (r=0.7). These results describe a possible mechanism by which SALL4 may lead to the development of multidrug resistance.","['Ohadi, Farzaneh', 'Rahgozar, Soheila', 'Ghodousi, Elaheh Sadat']","['Ohadi F', 'Rahgozar S', 'Ghodousi ES']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology & Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology & Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology & Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1376-255X'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200304,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC7061427,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABC transporters', 'ABCA3', 'SALL4', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'multidrug resistance', 'relapse']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/03/19 06:01,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S240469 [doi]', '240469 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Mar 4;12:1611-1619. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S240469. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Ohadi et al.'],,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Examinations of CLL patients with late relapses while on ibrutinib, which inhibits BTK's catalytic activity, revealed several mutations in BTK, most frequently resulting in the C481S substitution, and disclosed many mutations in PLCG2, encoding phospholipase C-gamma2 (PLCgamma2). The PLCgamma2 variants typically do not exhibit constitutive activity in cell-free systems, leading to the suggestion that in intact cells they are hypersensitive to Rac family small GTPases or to the upstream kinases spleen-associated tyrosine kinase (SYK) and Lck/Yes-related novel tyrosine kinase (LYN). The sensitivity of the PLCgamma2 variants to BTK itself has remained unknown. Here, using genetically-modified DT40 B lymphocytes, along with various biochemical assays, including analysis of PLCgamma2-mediated inositol phosphate formation, inositol phospholipid assessments, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) static laser microscopy, and determination of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)] i ), we show that various CLL-specific PLCgamma2 variants such as PLCgamma2S707Y are hyper-responsive to activated BTK, even in the absence of BTK's catalytic activity and independently of enhanced PLCgamma2 phospholipid substrate supply. At high levels of B-cell receptor (BCR) activation, which may occur in individual CLL patients, catalytically-inactive BTK restored the ability of the BCR to mediate increases in [Ca(2+)] i Because catalytically-inactive BTK is insensitive to active-site BTK inhibitors, the mechanism involving the noncatalytic BTK uncovered here may contribute to preexisting reduced sensitivity or even primary resistance of CLL to these drugs.","['Wist, Martin', 'Meier, Laura', 'Gutman, Orit', 'Haas, Jennifer', 'Endres, Sascha', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Rosler, Reinhild', 'Wiese, Sebastian', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Hobeika, Elias', 'Henis, Yoav I', 'Gierschik, Peter', 'Walliser, Claudia']","['Wist M', 'Meier L', 'Gutman O', 'Haas J', 'Endres S', 'Zhou Y', 'Rosler R', 'Wiese S', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Hobeika E', 'Henis YI', 'Gierschik P', 'Walliser C']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Neurobiology, George S.

Host cells repress incoming viral genomes through a network of transcriptional regulators that normally control cellular homeostasis. The nuclear domains involved are promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), interferon-inducible, dot-like nuclear structures and hot spots of SUMO posttranslational modification (PTM). In HAdV-infected cells, such SUMO factories are found in close proximity to newly established viral replication centers (RCs) marked by the adenoviral DNA binding protein (DBP) E2A. Here, we show that E2A is a novel target of host SUMOylation, leading to PTMs supporting E2A function in promoting productive infection. Our data show that SUMOylated E2A interacts with PML. Decreasing SUMO-E2A protein levels by generating HAdV variants mutated in the three main SUMO conjugation motifs (SCMs) led to lower numbers of viral RCs and PML-NBs, and these two structures were no longer next to each other. Our data further indicate that SUMOylated E2A binds the host transcription factor Sp100A, promoting HAdV gene expression, and represents the molecular bridge between PML tracks and adjacent viral RCs. Consequently, E2A SCM mutations repressed late viral gene expression and progeny production. These data highlight a novel mechanism used by the virus to benefit from host antiviral responses by exploiting the cellular SUMO conjugation machinery.IMPORTANCE PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are implicated in general antiviral defense based on recruiting host restriction factors; however, it is not understood so far why viruses would establish viral replication centers (RCs) juxtaposed to such ""antiviral"" compartments. To understand this enigma, we investigate the cross talk between PML-NB components and viral RCs to find the missing link connecting both compartments to promote efficient viral replication and gene expression. Taken together, the current concept is more intricate than originally believed, since viruses apparently take advantage of several specific PML-NB-associated proteins to promote productive infection. Simultaneously, they efficiently inhibit antiviral measures to maintain the viral infectious program. Our data provide evidence that SUMOylation of the viral RC marker protein E2A represents the basis of this virus-host interface and regulates various downstream events to support HAdV productive infection. These results are the basis of our current attempts to generate and screen for specific E2A SUMOylation inhibitors to constitute novel therapeutic approaches to limit and prevent HAdV-mediated diseases and mortality of immunosuppressed patients.","['Stubbe, Miona', 'Mai, Julia', 'Paulus, Christina', 'Stubbe, Hans Christian', 'Berscheminski, Julia', 'Karimi, Maryam', 'Hofmann, Samuel', 'Weber, Elisabeth', 'Hadian, Kamyar', 'Hay, Ron', 'Groitl, Peter', 'Nevels, Michael', 'Dobner, Thomas', 'Schreiner, Sabrina']","['Stubbe M', 'Mai J', 'Paulus C', 'Stubbe HC', 'Berscheminski J', 'Karimi M', 'Hofmann S', 'Weber E', 'Hadian K', 'Hay R', 'Groitl P', 'Nevels M', 'Dobner T', 'Schreiner S']","['Institute of Virology, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Biomedical Sciences Research Complex, University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine II, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Assay Development and Screening Platform, Institute of Molecular Toxicology and Pharmacology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Assay Development and Screening Platform, Institute of Molecular Toxicology and Pharmacology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Virology, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Biomedical Sciences Research Complex, University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, United Kingdom.', 'Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Neuherberg, Germany sabrina.schreiner@tum.de.', 'Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Institute of Virology, Neuherberg, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7115-407X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5744-7159']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200317,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,"['0 (Adenovirus E2 Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E2 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adenoviruses, Human/physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Sumoylation', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",PMC7078464,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA binding protein', '*E2A/DBP', '*HAdV', '*PML-NB', '*SUMO', '*Sp100', '*human adenovirus', '*replication centers', '*transcription', '*virus']",2020/03/19 06:00,2021/03/12 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.00049-20 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00049-20 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2020 Mar 17;11(2). pii: mBio.00049-20. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00049-20.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Stubbe et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distal muscular atrophy is one of side effects of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) for acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy. We hypothesized that arsenic may be a potential risk factor for skeletal muscle atrophy. Here, we investigated the action and molecular mechanism of low-dose arsenic on the induction of skeletal muscle atrophy in a skeletal muscle cell model. The differentiated C2C12 myotubes were treated with As2O3 (0.25-1 muM) for 48 h without apparent effects on cell viability. The signaling molecules for myotube atrophy were assessed. Submicromolar-concentration As2O3 dose-dependently triggered C2C12 myotube atrophy and increased the protein expressions of atrogenes Atrogin1 and MuRF1 and inhibited the upstream phosphorylated proteins Akt and FoxO1, while As2O3 dose-dependently increased AMPK phosphorylation in myotubes. Akt activator SC79 could significantly reverse the As2O3-induced myotube atrophy. These results suggest that arsenic is capable of inducing myotube atrophy by inhibiting an Akt signaling pathway.","['Chiu, Chen-Yuan', 'Chung, Min-Ni', 'Lan, Kuo-Cheng', 'Yang, Rong-Sen', 'Liu, Shing-Hwa']","['Chiu CY', 'Chung MN', 'Lan KC', 'Yang RS', 'Liu SH']","['Department of Botanicals, Medical and Pharmaceutical Industry Technology and Development Center, New Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

We examined the mechanism of PNT-induced cytotoxicity against a T315I(+) Ph + ALL cell line, TccY/Sr. PNT induced apoptosis (increased sub G1 cells, and cleaved caspase3 and PARP), and suppressed protein expression of MCL1, cyclin D2 and c-myc, which were reversed by a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, suggesting enhanced proteasomal degradation by PNT. Among BCL2 family inhibitors, MCL1 inhibitors (maritoclax and AZD5991) robustly induced cell death, showing the MCL1-dependent survival of TccY/Sr cells. Decreased MCL1 and c-myc expression by PNT was also observed in T315I(+) MEGA2/STIR cells. PNT suppressed PI3K activation followed by AKT inhibition and GSK3 dephosphorylation. PI3K/AKT inhibitors mimicked PNT, suggesting that PI3K/AKT signaling is important for survival of TccY/Sr cells. Moreover, GSK3 inhibitor (SB216763) reduced PNT-induced cytotoxicity and degradation of c-myc and MCL1. AZD5991 exhibited the synergistic action with PNT, anti-cancer drugs and venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor), suggesting the utility of MCL1 inhibitor alone or in combination as a future clinical option for Ph + leukemia patients.","['Inoue, Chisato', 'Sobue, Sayaka', 'Kawamoto, Yoshiyuki', 'Nishizawa, Yuji', 'Ichihara, Masatoshi', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Suzuki, Motoshi', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori', 'Murate, Takahsi']","['Inoue C', 'Sobue S', 'Kawamoto Y', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Ichihara M', 'Abe A', 'Hayakawa F', 'Suzuki M', 'Nozawa Y', 'Murate T']","['College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, 487-8501, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, 487-8501, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, 487-8501, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, 487-8501, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, 487-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Nagoya, 461-8673, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Tokai Gakuin University, Kakamigahara, 504-8511, Japan.', 'College of Life and Health Sciences, Chubu University, Kasugai, 487-8501, Japan.

However, the effects and precise mechanisms of kindlin-3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been well clarified. Our study aimed to explore the interaction between kindlin-3 and miR-4792 in AML. In our study, we found that the expression of kindlin-3 was dramatically increased in AML samples and cell lines, and the miR-4792 level was significantly downregulated. Interestingly, the low miR-4792 level was closely associated with upregulated kindlin-3 expression in AML samples. Moreover, introduction of miR-4792 dramatically suppressed proliferation and invasion and induced apoptosis of AML cells. We demonstrated that miR-4792 could directly target kindlin-3 by using both bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. In addition, kindlin-3 silencing had similar effects with miR-4792 overexpression on AML cells. Overexpression of kindlin-3 in AML cells partially reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-4792 mimic. miR-4792 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and induced apoptosis of AML cells by directly downregulating kindlin-3 expression, and miR-4792 targeting kindlin-3 was responsible for the regulation of the proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of AML cells.","['Qin, Yun', 'Wang, Yu', 'Liu, Dongbo']","['Qin Y', 'Wang Y', 'Liu D']","['Second Clinical College, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyWuhanP.

Little is known about their incidence, potential relationships, risk factors and clinical impact in non-transplant leukemia patients. This study investigated prospectively incidence, risk factors, clinical impact and possible association of HHVs-(1-7) infections in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. METHODS: Study design involved longitudinal sampling before chemotherapy and in different phases of chemotherapy: post-induction, post-remission, and post-salvage during 2016-2018. A total of 734 plasma samples from 95 patients were analyzed by a qualitative, multiplex PCR for HHVs detection and a quantitative real-time PCR was used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) quantification. HHVs-(1-6) IgG and IgM antibodies were tested using immunoassays. Risk factors were analyzed by binary logistic regression and relationships between viruses were analyzed using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalences of HHV-(1-6) IgG were high (> 80%). At least one herpes viral agent was detected in 60 patients (63.3%). CMV was the most commonly detected virus in the different phases of chemotherapy (19.4%), followed by HHV-6 (9.7%), HHV-7 (5.2%) and EBV (2.7%). HSV-1/2 and VZV DNA were not detected. Twenty-seven patients (28.4%) had more than one virus detected in the follow-up, with 23 who were co-infected. CMV/HHV-6 was the most frequent co-infection (69.5%, 16/23). HHV-6 infection (p = 0.008) was identified as a risk factor for CMV infection while salvage treatment (p = 0.04) and CMV infection (p = 0.007) were found to be independent risk factors for HHV-6 infection. CMV co-infection was associated with severe lymphopenia with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (< 500/muL) (p = 0.009), rash (p = 0.011), pneumonia (p = 0.016) and opportunistic infections [bacteremia, p < 0.001 and invasive fungal infection, (p = 0.024)] more frequently than CMV mono-viral infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that co-infection with HHVs, especially CMV and HHV-6, may contribute to the development of serious clinical manifestations with profound lymphopenia, pneumonia rash and increased risk for bacterial and fungal co-infections. These findings may suggest the synergistic effect of HHVs associated infection.","['Handous, Imene', 'Achour, Bechir', 'Marzouk, Manel', 'Rouis, Sana', 'Hazgui, Olfa', 'Brini, Ines', 'Khelif, Abderrahim', 'Hannachi, Naila', 'Boukadida, Jalel']","['Handous I', 'Achour B', 'Marzouk M', 'Rouis S', 'Hazgui O', 'Brini I', 'Khelif A', 'Hannachi N', 'Boukadida J']","['Laboratoire de Microbiologie, UR12SP34, Hopital Farhat Hached, Universite de Sousse, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Sousse, 4000, Tunisie. imene.handous@enis.tn.', ""Universite de Sfax, Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs de Sfax, Sfax, 3038, Tunisie. imene.handous@enis.tn."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Farhat Hached, Universite de Sousse, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Sousse, 4000, Tunisie."", 'Laboratoire de Microbiologie, UR12SP34, Hopital Farhat Hached, Universite de Sousse, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Sousse, 4000, Tunisie.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Farhat Hached, Universite de Sousse, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Sousse, 4000, Tunisie."", 'Laboratoire de Microbiologie, UR12SP34, Hopital Farhat Hached, Universite de Sousse, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Sousse, 4000, Tunisie.', 'Laboratoire de Microbiologie, UR12SP34, Hopital Farhat Hached, Universite de Sousse, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Sousse, 4000, Tunisie.', 'Universite de Monastir, Faculte de Pharmacie de Monastir, Monastir, 5000, Tunisie.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Farhat Hached, Universite de Sousse, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Sousse, 4000, Tunisie."", 'Laboratoire de Microbiologie, UR12SP34, Hopital Farhat Hached, Universite de Sousse, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Sousse, 4000, Tunisie.', 'Laboratoire de Microbiologie, UR12SP34, Hopital Farhat Hached, Universite de Sousse, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Sousse, 4000, Tunisie.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200317,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coinfection/*blood/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Drug Therapy', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae/classification/*isolation & purification', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*virology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy/*virology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Transplantation', 'Tunisia/epidemiology', 'Viral Load', 'Young Adult']",PMC7079388,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*Chemotherapy', '*Co-infection', '*Herpesviruses']",2020/03/19 06:00,2021/02/11 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-020-01302-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-020-01302-4 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2020 Mar 17;17(1):37. doi: 10.1186/s12985-020-01302-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In advanced atherosclerotic plaque, macrophage apoptosis coupled with inflammatory cytokine secretion promotes the formation of necrotic cores. It has also been demonstrated that the long-noncoding Ribonucleic Acid (lnc RNA) metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), with its potent function on gene transcription modulation, maintains oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)- induced macrophage autophagy (i.e., helps with cholesterol efflux). It also showed that MALAT1 activated Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which subsequently inhibited the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways. ox-LDL has been used to incubate human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells (THP-1)-derived macrophages to establish an in vitro foam cell model. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses confirmed the increased expression level of MALAT1 and the autophagy-related protein Microtubuleassociated protein light chain 3 (LC-3), beclin-1. The small interfering RNA study showed a significant decrease in autophagy activity and an increase in apoptotic rate when knocking down MALAT1. Further study demonstrated that MALAT1 inhibited the expression of MAPK and NF-kappaB (p65) by upregulating SIRT1.","['Yang, Jiaqi', 'Lin, Xuze', 'Wang, Liangshan', 'Sun, Tienan', 'Zhao, Qi', 'Ma, Qian', 'Zhou, Yujie']","['Yang J', 'Lin X', 'Wang L', 'Sun T', 'Zhao Q', 'Ma Q', 'Zhou Y']","['Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China.', 'Center for Cardiac Intensive Care, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Vasc Pharmacol,Current vascular pharmacology,101157208,"['0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (MALAT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Beclin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Foam Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*toxicity', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirtuin 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autophagy', '*LC-3', '*MALAT1', '*MAPK', '*NF-kappaB', '*SIRT1', '*macrophages']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['CVP-EPUB-105326 [pii]', '10.2174/1570161118666200317153124 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Vasc Pharmacol. 2020;18(6):652-662. doi: 10.2174/1570161118666200317153124.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitochondrial apoptosis is governed by the B-cell lymphoma (BCL-2) family, including anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins. Apoptosis evasion by dysregulation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members (BCL-2, MCL-1, BCL-XL) is a common hallmark in cancers. To divert this dysregulation into vulnerability, researchers have developed BH3 mimetics, which are small molecules that restore effective apoptosis in neoplastic cells by interfering with anti-apoptotic proteins. Among them, venetoclax is a potent and selective BCL-2 inhibitor, which has demonstrated the strongest clinical activity in mature B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphoid leukemia, mantle-cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Nevertheless, mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance have been recently described and several features such as cytogenetic abnormalities, BCL-2 family expression, and ex vivo drug testing have to be considered for predicting sensitivity to BH3 mimetics and helping in the identification of patients able to respond. The medical need to overcome resistance to BH3 mimetics supports the evaluation of innovative combination strategies. Novel agents including MCL-1 targeting BH3 mimetics are currently evaluated and may represent new therapeutic options in the field. The present review summarizes the current knowledge regarding venetoclax and other BH3 mimetics for the treatment of mature B-cell malignancies.","['Jullien, Maxime', 'Gomez-Bougie, Patricia', 'Chiron, David', 'Touzeau, Cyrille']","['Jullien M', 'Gomez-Bougie P', 'Chiron D', 'Touzeau C']","['Clinical Hematology, Nantes University Hospital, 1 place A.

IL-17A concentrations were measured by ELISA in sera collected from MRL/lpr Fli-1-heterozygotes (Fli-1(+/-)) and MRL/lpr Fli-1(+/+) control littermates. Expression of IL-17A and related proinflammatory mediators was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunofluorescence staining was performed on renal tissue from MRL/lpr Fli-1(+/)(-) and control littermates using anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-IL-17A antibodies to detect Th17 cells and anti-CCL20 and anti-CD11b antibodies to identify CCL20(+) monocytes. The expression of IL-17A in renal tissue was significantly reduced; this was accompanied by decreases in expression of IL-6, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and IL-1beta. Likewise, we detected fewer CD3(+)IL-17(+) and CD4(+)IL-17(+) cells in renal tissue of MLR/lpr Fli-1(+/)(-) mice and significantly fewer CCL20(+)CD11b(+) monocytes.

This study investigated the mechanism of leukaemogenic effects of n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea (ENU) in a mouse model. A total of 14 3-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR)-mice were used for the study. The mice were divided into groups A and B with seven mice each. Group A served as the control while group B received intraperitoneal (IP) injections of 80 mg/kg ENU twice with a one-week interval and were monitored monthly for 3 months for the development of leukaemia via blood smear examination. The mice were sacrificed humanely using a CO2 chamber. Blood, spleen, lymph nodes, liver, kidney and lung samples were collected for blood smear examination and histopathological evaluation. The expression of angiogenic protein (VEGF), and pro and anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL2 and BAX), was detected and quantified using Western blot technique. Leukaemia was confirmed by the presence of numerous blast cells in the peripheral blood smear in group B. Similarly, the VEGF and BCL2 proteins were significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated in group B compared to A. It is concluded that IP administration of 80 mg/kg ENU induced leukaemia in ICR-mice 12 weeks post administration through upregulation of angiogenic and anti-apoptotic proteins: VEGF and BCL2.","['Aliyu, Abdullahi', 'Shaari, Mohd Rosly', 'Ahmad Sayuti, Nurul Syahirah', 'Reduan, Mohd Farhan Hanif', 'Sithambaram, Shanmugavelu', 'Noordin, Mustapha Mohamed', 'Shaari, Khozirah', 'Hamzah, Hazilawati']","['Aliyu A', 'Shaari MR', 'Ahmad Sayuti NS', 'Reduan MFH', 'Sithambaram S', 'Noordin MM', 'Shaari K', 'Hamzah H']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia UPM, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, City Campus Complex, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, 840212 Sokoto, Sokoto State, Nigeria.', 'Animal Science Research Centre, Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute Headquarter, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia UPM, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia UPM, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Animal Science Research Centre, Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute Headquarter, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia UPM, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia UPM, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia UPM, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1093-5622', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5309-2055']",['eng'],['IPS/2018/9594600/Universiti Putra Malaysia'],['Journal Article'],20200313,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7140055,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2', 'VEGF', 'angiogenesis', 'apoptosis', 'blast cells', 'leukaemia', 'n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/03/19 06:01,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12030678 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12030678 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Mar 13;12(3). pii: cancers12030678. doi: 10.3390/cancers12030678.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been proposed that these genes can be used as diagnosis and/or prognosis biomarkers in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To know if lncRNAs are associated with early relapse and early mortality, a microarray-based gene expression analysis in children with B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) was conducted. Cox regression analyses were performed. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. LINC00152 and LINC01013 were among the most differentially expressed genes in patients with early relapse and early mortality. For LINC00152 high expression, the risks of relapse and death were HR: 4.16 (95% CI: 1.46-11.86) and HR: 1.99 (95% CI: 0.66-6.02), respectively; for LINC01013 low expression, the risks of relapse and death were HR: 3.03 (95% CI: 1.14-8.05) and HR: 6.87 (95% CI: 1.50-31.48), respectively. These results were adjusted by NCI risk criteria and chemotherapy regimen. The lncRNA-mRNA co-expression analysis showed that LINC00152 potentially regulates genes involved in cell substrate adhesion and peptidyl-tyrosine autophosphorylation biological processes. The results of the present study point out that LINC00152 could be a potential biomarker of relapse in children with B-ALL.","['Barcenas-Lopez, Diego Alberto', 'Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos', 'Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo', 'Beltran-Anaya, Fredy Omar', 'May-Hau, Didier Ismael', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Bekker-Mendez, Vilma Carolina', 'Flores-Lujano, Janet', 'Medina-Sanson, Aurora', 'Tamez-Gomez, Edna Liliana', 'Lopez-Garcia, Victor Hugo', 'Lara-Ramos, Jose Ramon', 'Nunez-Villegas, Nora Nancy', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez, Jose Gabriel', 'Flores-Villegas, Luz Victoria', 'Amador-Sanchez, Raquel', 'Espinosa-Elizondo, Rosa Martha', 'Martin-Trejo, Jorge Alfonso', 'Velazquez-Avina, Martha Margarita', 'Merino-Pasaye, Laura Elizabeth', 'Perez-Saldivar, Maria Luisa', 'Duarte-Rodriguez, David Aldebaran', 'Torres-Nava, Jose Refugio', 'Cortes-Herrera, Beatriz', 'Solis-Labastida, Karina Anastacia', 'Gonzalez-Avila, Ana Itamar', 'Santillan-Juarez, Jessica Denisse', 'Garcia-Velazquez, Alejandra Jimena', 'Rosas-Vargas, Haydee', 'Mata-Rocha, Minerva', 'Sepulveda-Robles, Omar Alejandro', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel', 'Jimenez-Morales, Silvia']","['Barcenas-Lopez DA', 'Nunez-Enriquez JC', 'Hidalgo-Miranda A', 'Beltran-Anaya FO', 'May-Hau DI', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Bekker-Mendez VC', 'Flores-Lujano J', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Tamez-Gomez EL', 'Lopez-Garcia VH', 'Lara-Ramos JR', 'Nunez-Villegas NN', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez JG', 'Flores-Villegas LV', 'Amador-Sanchez R', 'Espinosa-Elizondo RM', 'Martin-Trejo JA', 'Velazquez-Avina MM', 'Merino-Pasaye LE', 'Perez-Saldivar ML', 'Duarte-Rodriguez DA', 'Torres-Nava JR', 'Cortes-Herrera B', 'Solis-Labastida KA', 'Gonzalez-Avila AI', 'Santillan-Juarez JD', 'Garcia-Velazquez AJ', 'Rosas-Vargas H', 'Mata-Rocha M', 'Sepulveda-Robles OA', 'Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Jimenez-Morales S']","['Programa de Doctorado, Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City 04510, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, UMAE Hospital de Pediatria ""Dr. Silvestre Frenk Freund"", Centro Medico Nacional ""Siglo XXI"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City 06720, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genomica del Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Mexico City 14610, Mexico.', 'Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City 04510, Mexico.', 'Programa de Maestria en Investigacion Clinica Experimental en Salud, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City 04510, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia Pediatrica, Hospital General ""Gaudencio Gonzalez Garza"", Centro Medico Nacional ""La Raza"", IMSS, Mexico City 02990, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunologia e Infectologia, Hospital de Infectologia ""Dr. Daniel Mendez Hernandez"", Centro Medico Nacional ""La Raza"", IMSS, Mexico City 02990, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, UMAE Hospital de Pediatria ""Dr. Silvestre Frenk Freund"", Centro Medico Nacional ""Siglo XXI"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City 06720, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hemato-Oncologia, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Secretaria de Salud (SS), Mexico City 06720, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hemato-Oncologia Hospital Infantil de Tamaulipas.

The telomeric G-quadruplex (G4) ligand RHPS4 is known for its potent antiproliferative effect, as shown in telomerase-positive cancer models. Moreover, RHPS4 is also able to reduce cell proliferation in ALT cells, although the influence of G4 stabilization on the ALT mechanism has so far been poorly investigated. Here we show that sensitivity to RHPS4 is comparable in ALT-positive (U2OS; SAOS-2) and telomerase-positive (HOS) osteosarcoma cell lines, unlinking the telomere maintenance mechanism and RHPS4 responsiveness. To investigate the impact of G4 stabilization on ALT, the cardinal ALT hallmarks were analyzed. A significant induction of telomeric doublets, telomeric clusterized DNA damage, ALT-associated Promyelocytic Leukaemia-bodies (APBs), telomere sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE) and c-circles was found exclusively in RHPS4-treated ALT cells. We surmise that RHPS4 affects ALT mechanisms through the induction of replicative stress that in turn is converted in DNA damage at telomeres, fueling recombination.

Herein, we investigated the significance of the lncRNA NEAT1 in CLL. We examined NEAT1 expression in 310 newly diagnosed Binet A patients, in normal CD19+ B-cells, and other types of B-cell malignancies. Although global NEAT1 expression level was not statistically different in CLL cells compared to normal B cells, the median ratio of NEAT1_2 long isoform and global NEAT1 expression in CLL samples was significantly higher than in other groups. NEAT1_2 was more expressed in patients carrying mutated IGHV genes. Concerning cytogenetic aberrations, NEAT1_2 expression in CLL with trisomy 12 was lower with respect to patients without alterations. Although global NEAT1 expression appeared not to be associated with clinical outcome, patients with the lowest NEAT1_2 expression displayed the shortest time to first treatment; however, a multivariate regression analysis showed that the NEAT1_2 risk model was not independent from other known prognostic factors, particularly the IGHV mutational status. Overall, our data prompt future studies to investigate whether the increased amount of the long NEAT1_2 isoform detected in CLL cells may have a specific role in the pathology of the disease.","['Ronchetti, Domenica', 'Favasuli, Vanessa', 'Monti, Paola', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Silvestris, Ilaria', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Menichini, Paola', 'Matis, Serena', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Nurtdinov, Ramil', 'Guigo, Roderic', 'Baldini, Luca', 'Fronza, Gilberto', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Taiana, Elisa']","['Ronchetti D', 'Favasuli V', 'Monti P', 'Cutrona G', 'Fabris S', 'Silvestris I', 'Agnelli L', 'Colombo M', 'Menichini P', 'Matis S', 'Gentile M', 'Nurtdinov R', 'Guigo R', 'Baldini L', 'Fronza G', 'Ferrarini M', 'Morabito F', 'Neri A', 'Taiana E']","['Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology A.O. of Cosenza, 87100 Cosenza, Italy.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Dr. Aiguader 88, 08003 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Dr. Aiguader 88, 08003 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16126 Genoa, Italy.', 'Unita di Ricerca Biotecnologica, Azienda Sanitaria Provinciale di Cosenza, 87051 Aprigliano (CS), Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Augusta Victoria Hospital, 97300 Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, 20122 Milan, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4824-3445', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6466-7961', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3335-1101', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0582-6170', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1978-4998', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9753-6287', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5738-4477', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3722-553X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2585-7073', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4940-1318']",['eng'],"['IG16722/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'IG10136/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'Special Program Molecular Clinical Oncology-5 per mille"" #9980,', '2010/15/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', '5x1000 funds 2014, 2015, 2016/Ministero della Salute', '2017.0526/Compagnia di San Paolo', 'IG14326/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'Regional Grant 2014 n.16695/Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Calabria e Lucania', '#19370/Fondazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro']",['Journal Article'],20200313,Switzerland,Noncoding RNA,Non-coding RNA,101652294,,,,PMC7151605,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'NEAT1', 'lncRNA']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/03/19 06:01,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:01 [medline]']","['ncrna6010011 [pii]', '10.3390/ncrna6010011 [doi]']",epublish,Noncoding RNA. 2020 Mar 13;6(1). pii: ncrna6010011. doi: 10.3390/ncrna6010011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard treatment for OC includes maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. However, relapse due to chemoresistance is common in advanced OC patients. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new anticancer drugs to suppress OC progression. Recently, the anticancer effects of laminarin, a beta-1,3-glucan derived from brown algae, have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma, colon cancer, leukemia, and melanoma. However, its effects in OC are not reported. We confirmed that laminarin decreases cell growth and cell cycle progression of OC cells through the regulation of intracellular signaling. Moreover, laminarin induced cell death through DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species generation, induction of apoptotic signals and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, regulation of calcium levels, and alteration of the ER-mitochondria axis. Laminarin was not cytotoxic in a zebrafish model, while in a zebrafish xenograft model, it inhibited OC cell growth. These results suggest that laminarin may be successfully used as a novel OC suppressor.","['Bae, Hyocheol', 'Song, Gwonhwa', 'Lee, Jin-Young', 'Hong, Taeyeon', 'Chang, Moon-Jeong', 'Lim, Whasun']","['Bae H', 'Song G', 'Lee JY', 'Hong T', 'Chang MJ', 'Lim W']","['Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.', 'Department of Food and Nutrition, College of Science and Technology, Kookmin University, Seoul 02707, Korea.', 'Department of Food and Nutrition, College of Science and Technology, Kookmin University, Seoul 02707, Korea.', 'Department of Food and Nutrition, College of Science and Technology, Kookmin University, Seoul 02707, Korea.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2817-5323', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1328-0465']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200309,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucans)', '9008-22-4 (laminaran)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Female', 'Glucans/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Phaeophyta', 'Phytotherapy']",PMC7143329,,['NOTNLM'],"['ER stress', 'cell death', 'laminarin', 'mitochondria', 'ovarian cancer']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['md18030152 [pii]', '10.3390/md18030152 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2020 Mar 9;18(3). pii: md18030152. doi: 10.3390/md18030152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the effects of oil from Iranian T. ammi plants on the viability of spermatogonial stem cells in vitro. The essential oil of T. ammi fruits was extracted by hydrodistillation, and the amount of thymol was calculated by a gas-chromatography method. Spermatogonial stem cells were isolated from the testes of mice using enzyme digestion. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to assess the gene expressions of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (Plzf), DNA-binding protein inhibitor (ID-4), tyrosine-protein kinase (c-Kit), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX). The number and diameter of colonies were also measured in the treated cells. The amount of thymol in the oil was 130.7 +/- 7.6 microg/mL. Flow cytometry analysis showed that 92.8% of all cells expressed stimulated by retinoic acid 8 (Stra8), a spermatogonial stem cell marker. Expression of Plzf and ID-4 genes significantly increased in the treatment groups, while c-Kit and BAX decreased, and Bcl2 increased in the presence of essential oil. The numbers and diameters of cells were also improved by the application of the plant oil. These data indicated that monoterpenes from the oil of T. ammi improved the quality and viability of spermatogonia cells in the cell culture.","['Omidpanah, Sahar', 'Aliakbari, Fereshte', 'Nabavi, Seyed Mohammad', 'Vazirian, Mahdi', 'Hadjiakhoondi, Abbas', 'Kurepaz-Mahmoodabadi, Mahdieh', 'Manayi, Azadeh']","['Omidpanah S', 'Aliakbari F', 'Nabavi SM', 'Vazirian M', 'Hadjiakhoondi A', 'Kurepaz-Mahmoodabadi M', 'Manayi A']","['Medicinal Plants Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.', 'Infertility & Reproductive Health Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.', 'Applied Biotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 1417614411 Tehran, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0420-5930'],['eng'],['98-01-56-41734/Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services'],['Journal Article'],20200309,Switzerland,Plants (Basel),"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",101596181,,,,PMC7154887,,['NOTNLM'],"['T. ammi', 'apiaceae', 'stem cells', 'thymol']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/03/19 06:01,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:01 [medline]']","['plants9030343 [pii]', '10.3390/plants9030343 [doi]']",epublish,Plants (Basel). 2020 Mar 9;9(3). pii: plants9030343. doi: 10.3390/plants9030343.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

APL is defined by the PML-RARA rearrangement as a consequence of the translocation t(15;17)(q24;q21). However, this abnormality alone is not able to trigger the whole leukemic phenotype and secondary cooperating events might contribute to APL pathogenesis. Additional somatic mutations are known to occur recurrently in several genes, such as FLT3, WT1, NRAS and KRAS, whereas mutations in other common AML genes are rarely detected, resulting in a different molecular profile compared to other AML subtypes. How this mutational spectrum, including point mutations in the PML-RARA fusion gene, could contribute to the 10%-15% of relapsed or resistant APL patients is still unknown. Moreover, due to the uncertain impact of additional mutations on prognosis, the identification of the APL-specific genetic lesion is still the only method recommended in the routine evaluation/screening at diagnosis and for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment. However, the gene expression profile of genes, such as ID1, BAALC, ERG, and KMT2E, once combined with the molecular events, might improve future prognostic models, allowing us to predict clinical outcomes and to categorize APL patients in different risk subsets, as recently reported. In this review, we will focus on the molecular characterization of APL patients at diagnosis, relapse and resistance, in both children and adults. We will also describe different standardized molecular approaches to study MRD, including those recently developed. Finally, we will discuss how novel molecular findings can improve the management of this disease.","['Liquori, Alessandro', 'Ibanez, Mariam', 'Sargas, Claudia', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Cervera, Jose']","['Liquori A', 'Ibanez M', 'Sargas C', 'Sanz MA', 'Barragan E', 'Cervera J']","['Accredited Research Group in Hematology and Hemotherapy, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Accredited Research Group in Hematology and Hemotherapy, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6735-0038'],['eng'],"['GVA/2018/004; GV/2019/084/Generalitat Valenciana', 'CB16/12/00284/European Regional Development Fund', 'PI16/01113, PI16/00665, PI18/1472, PI19/00812/Instituto de Salud Carlos III']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200308,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7139833,,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'MRD', 'NGS', 'PML-RARA', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'isoform', 'minimal residual disease', 'relapse', 'splicing']",2020/03/19 06:00,2020/03/19 06:01,['2020/03/19 06:00'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12030624 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12030624 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Mar 8;12(3). pii: cancers12030624. doi: 10.3390/cancers12030624.,,,,,['Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 09;13(14):.

The PD-1 pathway is implicated in the progression of multiple myeloma. Several properties of lenalidomide are potentially synergistic with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.Areas covered: Preclinical data related to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and the results of early clinical trials of pembrolizumab single-agent and in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone are discussed. Despite promising preliminary data, the pivotal phase III trial evaluating lenalidomide and dexamethasone in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma presented unexpected safety findings and was discontinued. Differences with previous results and the findings of other trials involving pomalidomide as an immunomodulatory agent or nivolumab as anti-PD-1 antibody are discussed.Expert opinion: Disappointing efficacy outcomes of the combination of checkpoint blockade antibodies and immunomodulating agents in multiple myeloma along with toxicity issues make the combination unattractive in comparison with available alternatives. It is essential to critically review preclinical and clinical datha to understand the pitfalls of lenalidomide with pembrolizumab and similar combinations in multiple myeloma to gain insight on the future role of anti-PD-1 agents in emerging therapeutic scenarios.","['Oriol, Albert']",['Oriol A'],"[""Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Hematology Service and Hemato-Oncology Clinical Trial Unit, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain.""]",,['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Video-Audio Media']",20200321,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'DPT0O3T46P (pembrolizumab)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Checkpoint inhibitors', '*PD-1/PD-L1 blockade', '*immune checkpoint targeting', '*immunomodulation', '*lenalidomide', '*monoclonal antibodies', '*multiple myeloma', '*pembrolizumab']",2020/03/18 06:00,2021/05/06 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1744432 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 May;13(5):435-445. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1744432.

Finding the value of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.,447-460,10.1080/17474086.2020.1744433 [doi],"Introduction: The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) vary in their risk of disease progression; progression includes increasingly severe bone marrow failure, reclassification as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and death. Prognostic tools guide recommendations for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), the only curative option. AlloSCT is typically reserved for patients with higher-risk MDS as defined by existing prognostic tools, although additional clinical and biological factors in lower-risk patients may influence this dogma.Areas covered: This review discusses the current understanding of MDS risk stratification as it pertains to the use of alloSCT in subpopulations of MDS patients with a particular focus on the use of alloSCT in patients with lower-risk disease.Expert commentary: Though high-quality data are lacking, some lower-risk MDS patients may benefit from alloSCT, which offers the only prospect of cure. Understanding the etiologic role and prognostic impact of recurring genetic events may improve existing risk stratification and become integral facets of prognostic schemata. The identification of additional factors influencing the prognoses of patients currently lumped together as 'lower-risk' will likewise improve the selection of MDS patients for early intervention or aggressive therapies such as alloSCT.","['Shallis, Rory M', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai A', 'Gowda, Lohith', 'Zeidan, Amer M', 'Gore, Steven D']","['Shallis RM', 'Podoltsev NA', 'Gowda L', 'Zeidan AM', 'Gore SD']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8542-2944'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Video-Audio Media']",20200329,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Allografts', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ASCT', '*Allogeneic', '*MDS', '*alloSCT', '*low', '*lower', '*myelodysplastic', '*transplant']",2020/03/18 06:00,2021/05/06 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1744433 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 May;13(5):447-460. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1744433.

Total RNA was isolated from cells or tissues using TRIzol reagent. Cell viability was assessed with the tetrazolium assay. MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a), which acts on cell death regulation pathways, was noticeably downregulated in non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia stem cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-34a-mediated suppression in leukemia stem cells was associated with poor clinical outcomes and impaired treatment efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia. Transfection with a miR-34a mimic triggered leukemia stem cell death and prevented leukemia. Bioinformatics analysis and a dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-34a targeted the 3'-untranslated region of histone deacetylase 2, and the reinforced expression of miR-34a remarkably stimulated the expression of histone deacetylase 2 in leukemia stem cells. Ectopic miR-34a expression triggered death of leukemia stem cells via pathways involving the Janus kinase 1-signal transducer and activator of transcription 2-p53 axis. Targeting leukemia stem cells to trigger cell death through upregulation of miR-34a expression could be used to diagnose and treat acute myeloid leukemia.","['Hu, Yanning', 'Ma, Xiaotang', 'Wu, Zhimei', 'Nong, Qingwei', 'Liu, Feng', 'Wang, Yue', 'Dong, Min']","['Hu Y', 'Ma X', 'Wu Z', 'Nong Q', 'Liu F', 'Wang Y', 'Dong M']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Institute of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College, Zhanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9433-683X'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200317,England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Exosomes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Deacetylase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HDAC2', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*apoptosis', '*exosome', '*leukemia stem cells', '*miR-34a']",2020/03/18 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/iub.2273 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 2020 Jul;72(7):1481-1490. doi: 10.1002/iub.2273.

It has been suggested that Lmo2 exerts these effects by functioning as component of a multi-subunit transcription complex that includes the ubiquitous adapter Ldb1 along with b-HLH and/or GATA family transcription factors; however, direct experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking. In this study, we investigated the importance of Ldb1 for Lmo2-induced T-ALL by conditional deletion of Ldb1 in thymocytes in an Lmo2 transgenic mouse model of T-ALL. Our results identify a critical requirement for Ldb1 in Lmo2-induced thymocyte self-renewal and thymocyte radiation resistance and for the transition of preleukemic thymocytes to overt T-ALL. Moreover, Ldb1 was also required for acquisition of the aberrant preleukemic ETP gene expression signature in immature Lmo2 transgenic thymocytes. Co-binding of Ldb1 and Lmo2 was detected at the promoters of key upregulated T-ALL driver genes (Hhex, Lyl1, and Nfe2) in preleukemic Lmo2 transgenic thymocytes, and binding of both Ldb1 and Lmo2 at these sites was reduced following Cre-mediated deletion of Ldb1. Together, these results identify a key role for Ldb1, a nonproto-oncogene, in T-ALL and support a model in which Lmo2-induced T-ALL results from failure to downregulate Ldb1/Lmo2-nucleated transcription complexes which normally function to enforce self-renewal in bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors.","['Li, LiQi', 'Mitra, Apratim', 'Cui, Kairong', 'Zhao, Bin', 'Choi, Seeyoung', 'Lee, Jan Y', 'Stamos, Daniel B', 'El-Khoury, Dalal', 'Warzecha, Claude', 'Pfeifer, Karl', 'Hardwick, Joyce', 'Zhao, Keji', 'Venters, Bryan', 'Dave, Utpal P', 'Love, Paul E']","['Li L', 'Mitra A', 'Cui K', 'Zhao B', 'Choi S', 'Lee JY', 'Stamos DB', 'El-Khoury D', 'Warzecha C', 'Pfeifer K', 'Hardwick J', 'Zhao K', 'Venters B', 'Dave UP', 'Love PE']","['Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology and.', 'Section on Genomic Imprinting, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Epigenome Biology, Systems Biology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology and.', 'Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology and.', 'Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology and.', 'Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology and.', 'Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology and.', 'Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology and.', 'Section on Genomic Imprinting, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, R.L.

Histological confirmation of NHL was available for 76.2% and cytological confirmation for another 17.3%. NHL subclassification was determined in 42.1%. Of these, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and Burkitt lymphoma were the most common subtypes identified (48.8%, 18.4% and 6.0%, respectively). We traced 293 patients, for whom recorded data were amended using clinical records. For these, information on stage, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) was available for 60.8%, 52.6% and 45.1%, respectively. Stage at diagnosis was advanced for 130 of 178 (73.0%) patients, HIV status was positive for 97 of 154 (63.0%) and ECOG PS was >/=2 for 81 of 132 (61.4%).

We evaluated the clinical diagnostic value of miRNA-181a-3p in predicting prognosis and outcomes in patients with AML. Methods: A total of 119 newly diagnosed adult patients with AML and 60 healthy controls were recruited. Blood specimens were obtained from all AML patients at diagnosis, and 10 blood specimens were obtained on day 28 after induction chemotherapy. The controls also provided blood samples. Relative gene expression was quantified by PCR and determined using the comparative Ct method. Publicly available clinical data and gene expressions for 188 patients with AML were downloaded from TCGA data portal. Results: Compared with healthy controls, the expression of miRNA-181a-3p was significantly increased in patients with AML. MiR-181a-3p expression could be used to discriminate AML patients from controls, with up-regulated expression correlating with favorable prognosis. Moreover, miRNA-181a-3p expression was significantly decreased in patients who achieved a complete response after induction chemotherapy. The multivariate Cox analysis highlighted the prognostic value of miR-181a-3p for patients with AML. Finally, we found that miR-181a-3p expression was negatively correlated with the expression of the NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO/IKBKG).

Methods: Transgenic mice with a tamoxifen-dependent beta-catenin deficiency in Muller cells were injected with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) into the vitreous cavity of one eye to induce excitotoxic damage of the RGCs, while the contralateral eye received PBS only. Retinal damage was quantified by counting the total number of RGC axons in cross sections of optic nerves and measuring the thickness of the retinal layers on meridional sections. Then, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to identify apoptotic cells in retinas of both genotypes. Western blot analyses to assess the level of retinal beta-catenin and real-time RT-PCR to quantify the retinal expression of neuroprotective factors were performed. Results: Following NMDA injection of wild-type mice, a statistically significant increase in retinal beta-catenin protein levels was observed compared to PBS-injected controls, an effect that was blocked in mice with a Muller cell-specific beta-catenin deficiency. Furthermore, in mice with a beta-catenin deficiency in Muller cells, NMDA injection led to a statistically significant decrease in RGC axons as well as a substantial increase in TUNEL-positive cells in the RGC layer compared to the NMDA-treated controls. Moreover, in the retinas of the control mice a NMDA-mediated statistically significant induction of leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) mRNA was detected, an effect that was substantially reduced in mice with a beta-catenin deficiency in Muller cells. Conclusions: Endogenous Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in Muller cells protects RGCs against excitotoxic damage, an effect that is most likely mediated via the induction of neuroprotective factors, such as Lif.","['Boesl, Fabian', 'Drexler, Konstantin', 'Muller, Birgit', 'Seitz, Roswitha', 'Weber, Gregor R', 'Priglinger, Siegfried G', 'Fuchshofer, Rudolf', 'Tamm, Ernst R', 'Ohlmann, Andreas']","['Boesl F', 'Drexler K', 'Muller B', 'Seitz R', 'Weber GR', 'Priglinger SG', 'Fuchshofer R', 'Tamm ER', 'Ohlmann A']","['Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Anatomy and Embryology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200305,United States,Mol Vis,Molecular vision,9605351,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '6384-92-5 (N-Methylaspartate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Axons/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ependymoglial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'N-Methylaspartate/toxicity', 'Optic Nerve/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Retina/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/*pharmacology', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*drug effects/genetics', 'beta Catenin/deficiency/*metabolism']",PMC7058433,,,,2020/03/18 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Mol Vis. 2020 Mar 5;26:135-149. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Molecular Vision.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated extracts of a native Iranian plant, Satureja bachtiarica, for possible anti-leukemia activity by induction of apoptosis and changes to the cell cycle. Growth inhibition caused by aqueous, butanol, dichloromethane and hexane extracts of S. bachtiarica on K562 and Jurkat leukemia cells was assessed using a colorimetric assay. Extracts were analyzed for induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest using flow cytometry and measurement of caspase-3 activity. Dichloromethane and hexane extracts inhibited leukemia cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values of these extracts were 22-33 microg/ml. Flow cytometric determination of annexinV/propidium iodide positive cells verified a significantly increased percentage of apoptotic cells compared to negative controls. Both 50 mug/ml dichloromethane and hexane extracts induced apoptosis in 89-97% of K562 and 94-97% of Jurkat cells 48 h after treatment. The effects of extracts on the cell cycle included significantly increased numbers of K562 and Jurkat cells in the subG1 phase and decreased numbers of cells in the G1, S and G2/M phases. After 24 h, we found increased levels of caspase-3 activation in cells treated with 25 mug/ml dichloromethane and hexane extracts compared to untreated cells.

The classification of white blood cell images is crucial for leukemia diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to classify white blood cells by extracting discriminative information from cell segmentation and combining it with the fine-grained features. We propose a hybrid adversarial residual network with support vector machine (SVM), which utilizes the extracted features to improve the classification accuracy for human peripheral white cells. METHODS: Firstly, we segment the cell and nucleus by utilizing an adversarial residual network, which contains a segmentation network and a discriminator network. To extract features that can handle the inter-class consistency problem effectively, we introduce the adversarial residual network. Then, we utilize convolutional neural network (CNN) features and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features, which can extract discriminative features from images of segmented cell nuclei. To utilize the representative features fully, a discriminative network is introduced to deal with neighboring information at different scales. Finally, we combine the vectors of HOG features with those of CNN features and feed them into a linear SVM to classify white blood cells into six types. RESULTS: We used three methods to evaluate the effect of leukocyte classification based on 5000 leukocyte images acquired from a local hospital. The first approach is to use the CNN features as the input of SVM to classify leukocytes, which achieved 94.23% specificity, 95.10% sensitivity, and 94.41% accuracy. The use of the HOG features for SVM achieved 83.50% specificity, 87.50% sensitivity, and 85.00% accuracy. The use of combined CNN and HOG features achieved 94.57% specificity, 96.11% sensitivity, and 95.93% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel hybrid adversarial-discriminative network for the classification of microscopic leukocyte images. It improves the accuracy of cell classification, reduces the difficulty and time pressure of doctors' work, and economizes the valuable time of doctors in daily clinical diagnosis.","['Zhang, Chuanhao', 'Wu, Shangshang', 'Lu, Zhiming', 'Shen, Yajuan', 'Wang, Jing', 'Huang, Pu', 'Lou, Jingjiao', 'Liu, Cong', 'Xing, Lei', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Xue, Jie', 'Li, Dengwang']","['Zhang C', 'Wu S', 'Lu Z', 'Shen Y', 'Wang J', 'Huang P', 'Lou J', 'Liu C', 'Xing L', 'Zhang J', 'Xue J', 'Li D']","['Shandong Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Image Processing, Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine, School of Physics and Electronics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, 250358, China.', 'Shandong Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Image Processing, Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine, School of Physics and Electronics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, 250358, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 250014, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 250014, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 250014, China.', 'Shandong Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Image Processing, Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine, School of Physics and Electronics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, 250358, China.', 'Shandong Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Image Processing, Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine, School of Physics and Electronics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, 250358, China.', 'Shandong Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Image Processing, Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine, School of Physics and Electronics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, 250358, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94304, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 250014, China.', 'Business School, Shandong Normal University, 250014, China.', 'Shandong Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Image Processing, Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine, School of Physics and Electronics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, 250358, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200624,United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia/diagnostic imaging', 'Leukocytes', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Support Vector Machine']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['adversarial residual network', 'deep learning', 'feature selection', 'leukocyte']",2020/03/18 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mp.14144 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Phys. 2020 Aug;47(8):3732-3744. doi: 10.1002/mp.14144.

However, previous studies using Kasumi-1 show discrepancies in the genome profile. The wide use of leukemia cell lines is limited to lines that are well-characterized. The use of additional cell lines extends research to various types of leukemia, and to further explore leukemia pathogenesis, which can be achieved by uncovering the fundamental features of each cell line with accurate data. In this study, ten Kasumi cell lines established in Japan, including five that were previously unknown, have been characterized by SNP microarray and targeted sequencing. SNP genotyping suggested that the genetic ancestry in four of the ten Kasumi cell lines was not classified as Japanese but covered several different east-Asian ethnicities, suggesting that patients in Japan are genetically diverse. TP53 mutations were detected in two cell lines with complex array profiles, indicating chromosomal instability (CIN). A quantitative assessment of tumor genomes at the chromosomal level was newly introduced to reveal total DNA sizes and Scales of Genomic Alterations (SGA) for each cell line. Kasumi-1 and 6 derived from relapsed phases demonstrated high levels of SGA, implying that the level of SGA would reflect on the tumor progression and could serve as an index of CIN. Our results extend the leukemia cellular resources with an additional five cell lines and provide reference genome data with ethnic identities for the ten Kasumi cell lines.","['Kasai, Fumio', 'Asou, Hiroya', 'Ozawa, Midori', 'Kobayashi, Kazuhiko', 'Kuramitsu, Hiroyuki', 'Satoh, Motonobu', 'Kohara, Arihiro', 'Kaneko, Yasuhiko', 'Kawamura, Machiko']","['Kasai F', 'Asou H', 'Ozawa M', 'Kobayashi K', 'Kuramitsu H', 'Satoh M', 'Kohara A', 'Kaneko Y', 'Kawamura M']","['Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Saito-Asagi 7-6-8, Ibaraki, Osaka, 567-0085, Japan. k-230@umin.ac.jp.', 'Medicine Development Unit, Eli Lilly, Kobe, 651-0086, Japan.', 'Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Saito-Asagi 7-6-8, Ibaraki, Osaka, 567-0085, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan.', 'Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Saito-Asagi 7-6-8, Ibaraki, Osaka, 567-0085, Japan.', 'Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Saito-Asagi 7-6-8, Ibaraki, Osaka, 567-0085, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200316,Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ethnology', '*Genome, Human', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",PMC7324421,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ancestry information', 'Chromosome instability', 'Fusion gene', 'TP53 alteration', 'Tumor genome size']",2020/03/18 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2020/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13577-020-00347-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s13577-020-00347-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 2020 Jul;33(3):868-876. doi: 10.1007/s13577-020-00347-5.

Here, we analyzed potential function of HOTAIRM1 in glioma and asked whether it participates in long-range chromatin interactions. We monitored expression of HOTAIRM1 in glioma tissues and correlated levels with patient survival using the TCGA dataset. HOTAIRM1 was highly expressed in glioma tissue, with high levels associated with shortened patient survival time. We then suppressed HOTAIRM1 activity in the human glioblastoma U251 line using CRISPR-cas9 to knock in a truncating polyA fragment. Reporter analysis of these and control cells confirmed that the HOTAIRM1 locus serves as an active enhancer. We then performed Capture-C analysis to identify target genes of that locus and applied RNA antisense purification to assess chromatin interactions between the HOTAIRM1 locus and HOXA cluster genes. HOTAIRM1 knockdown in glioma cells decreased proliferation and reduced expression of HOXA cluster genes. HOTAIRM1 regulates long-range interactions between the HOTAIRM1 locus and HOXA genes. Our work suggests a new mechanism by which HOTAIRM1 regulates glioma progression by regulating high-order chromatin structure and could suggest novel therapeutic targets to treat an intractable cancer.","['Shi, Tengfei', 'Guo, Dianhao', 'Xu, Heming', 'Su, Guangsong', 'Chen, Jun', 'Zhao, Zhongfang', 'Shi, Jiandang', 'Wedemeyer, Michelle', 'Attenello, Frank', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Lu, Wange']","['Shi T', 'Guo D', 'Xu H', 'Su G', 'Chen J', 'Zhao Z', 'Shi J', 'Wedemeyer M', 'Attenello F', 'Zhang L', 'Lu W']","['State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90033, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90033, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China. joyleizhang@nankai.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China. wangelv@gmail.com.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5848-3189'],['eng'],"['31530027/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '31701129/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81772687/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '18JCQNJC10100/Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City']",['Journal Article'],20200316,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1, human)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)']",IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glioma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Multigene Family', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Enhancer lncRNA', 'Glioma', 'HOTAIRM1', 'HOXA cluster genes', 'Long-range chromatin interaction']",2020/03/18 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2019/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-020-05371-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-020-05371-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2020 Apr;47(4):2723-2733. doi: 10.1007/s11033-020-05371-0.

While the genetic aberrations underlying CAKUT pathogenesis are increasingly being elucidated, their consequences on a cellular and molecular level commonly remain unclear. Recently, we reported rare heterozygous deleterious LIFR variants in 3.3% of CAKUT patients, including a novel de novo frameshift variant, identified by whole-exome sequencing, in a patient with severe bilateral CAKUT. We also demonstrated CAKUT phenotypes in Lifr-/- and Lifr+/- mice, including a narrowed ureteric lumen due to muscular hypertrophy and a thickened urothelium. Here, we show that both in the ureter and bladder of Lifr-/- and Lifr+/- embryos, differentiation of the three urothelial cell types (basal, intermediate and superficial cells) occurs normally but that the turnover of superficial cells is elevated due to increased proliferation, enhanced differentiation from their progenitor cells (intermediate cells) and, importantly, shedding into the ureteric lumen. Microarray-based analysis of genome-wide transcriptional changes in Lifr-/- versus Lifr+/+ ureters identified gene networks associated with an antimicrobial inflammatory response. Finally, in a reverse phenotyping effort, significantly more superficial cells were detected in the urine of CAKUT patients with versus without LIFR variants indicating conserved LIFR-dependent urinary tract changes in the murine and human context. Our data suggest that LIFR signaling is required in the epithelium of the urinary tract to suppress an antimicrobial response under homeostatic conditions and that genetically induced inflammation-like changes underlie CAKUT pathogenesis in Lifr deficiency and LIFR haploinsufficiency.","['Christians, Anne', 'Weiss, Anna-Carina', 'Martens, Helge', 'Klopf, Maximilian Georg', 'Hennies, Imke', 'Haffner, Dieter', 'Kispert, Andreas', 'Weber, Ruthild G']","['Christians A', 'Weiss AC', 'Martens H', 'Klopf MG', 'Hennies I', 'Haffner D', 'Kispert A', 'Weber RG']","['Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Kidney, Liver and Metabolic Diseases, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Kidney, Liver and Metabolic Diseases, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', 'Genitourinary Tract Anomalies']",IM,"['Animals', 'Exome/genetics', 'Haploinsufficiency/genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*genetics/pathology', 'Kidney/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/deficiency/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Urinary Tract/metabolism/pathology', 'Urogenital Abnormalities/*genetics/pathology', 'Urothelium/pathology', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",,,,,2020/03/18 06:00,2021/08/05 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['5807717 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddaa048 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2020 May 8;29(7):1192-1204. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddaa048.,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Here, we report that the chromatin accessibility regulator HMGN1, a target of recurrent DNA copy gains in leukemia, controls myeloid differentiation. HMGN1 amplification is associated with increased accessibility, expression, and histone H3K27 acetylation of loci important for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and leukemia, such as HoxA cluster genes. In vivo, HMGN1 overexpression is linked to decreased quiescence and increased HSC activity in bone marrow transplantation. HMGN1 overexpression also cooperates with the AML-ETO9a fusion oncoprotein to impair myeloid differentiation and enhance leukemia stem cell (LSC) activity. Inhibition of histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300 relieves the HMGN1-associated differentiation block. These data nominate factors that modulate chromatin accessibility as regulators of HSCs and LSCs, and suggest that targeting HMGN1 or its downstream effects on histone acetylation could be therapeutically active in AML.","['Cabal-Hierro, Lucia', 'van Galen, Peter', 'Prado, Miguel A', 'Higby, Kelly J', 'Togami, Katsuhiro', 'Mowery, Cody T', 'Paulo, Joao A', 'Xie, Yingtian', 'Cejas, Paloma', 'Furusawa, Takashi', 'Bustin, Michael', 'Long, Henry W', 'Sykes, David B', 'Gygi, Steven P', 'Finley, Daniel', 'Bernstein, Bradley E', 'Lane, Andrew A']","['Cabal-Hierro L', 'van Galen P', 'Prado MA', 'Higby KJ', 'Togami K', 'Mowery CT', 'Paulo JA', 'Xie Y', 'Cejas P', 'Furusawa T', 'Bustin M', 'Long HW', 'Sykes DB', 'Gygi SP', 'Finley D', 'Bernstein BE', 'Lane AA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Laboratory of Metabolism, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Metabolism, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. andrew_lane@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA. andrew_lane@dfci.harvard.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0735-1570', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4914-1619', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2939-013X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4291-413X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5147-7242', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6849-6629', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5726-6278', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7380-0226']",['eng'],"['R00 CA218832/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM132129/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA225191/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200316,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (HMGN1 Protein)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Female', 'HMGN1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7076002,,,,2020/03/18 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-020-15221-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-020-15221-z [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Mar 16;11(1):1406. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-15221-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated MDS patients' bone marrow CD56(+)/CD56(-) monocytes and their in vitro-derived dendritic cell populations in comparison with cells obtained from disease-free subjects. We found that monocytes from MDS patients, irrespective of CD56 expression, have reduced phagocytosis activity and low expression of genes involved in triggering immune responses, regulation of immune and inflammatory response signaling pathways, and in the response to LPS. Dendritic cells derived in vitro from MDS monocytes failed to develop dendritic projections and had reduced expression of HLA-DR and CD86, suggesting that Ag processing and T cell activation capabilities are impaired.

Previous work has shown that Notch can induce transcriptional responses by binding to promoters but more often by binding to enhancers, with HES4 and DTX1 as representative mammalian examples of promoter and enhancer responsiveness, respectively. Here, we show that mastermind dependence of the Notch response at these loci is differentially encoded in Jurkat T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. Knockout of Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) eliminates Notch-responsive activation of both these genes, and reduced target gene expression is accompanied by a decrease in H3K27 acetylation, consistent with the importance of MAML1 for p300 activity. Add-back of MAML1 variants in knockout cells identifies residues 151 to 350 of MAML1 as essential for expression of either Notch-responsive gene. Fusion of the Notch-binding region of MAML1 to the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of p300 rescues expression of HES4 but not DTX1, suggesting that an additional activity of MAML1 is needed for gene induction at a distance. Together, these studies establish the functional importance of the MAML1 region from residues 151 to 350 for Notch-dependent transcriptional induction and reveal differential requirements for MAML1-dependent recruitment activities at different Notch-responsive loci, highlighting the molecular complexity of Notch-stimulated transcription.","['Rogers, Julia M', 'Guo, Bingqian', 'Egan, Emily D', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Adelman, Karen', 'Blacklow, Stephen C']","['Rogers JM', 'Guo B', 'Egan ED', 'Aster JC', 'Adelman K', 'Blacklow SC']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA stephen_blacklow@hms.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6518-5470', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9819-8403', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1957-9070', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5364-334X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6904-1981']",['eng'],"['R35 CA220340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007748/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HG002295/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200514,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MAML1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC7225564,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Notch signaling', '*transcriptional activation']",2020/03/18 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00014-20 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00014-20 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2020 May 14;40(11). pii: MCB.00014-20. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00014-20.

However, few studies have assessed the association between socioeconomic parameters and prognosis in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and these report conflicting results. Our monocentric study assessed the impact of socioeconomic deprivation using the validated EPICES (Evaluation of Deprivation and Inequalities in Health Examination Centers) score in a prospective cohort of intensively treated AML patients. METHODS: EPICES questionnaires were given to patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML at the Paoli Calmettes Institute between July 2012 and December 2014. Study participants were categorized as non-deprived (score <30.17), deprived (score 30.17-48.51), or very-deprived (score >/= 48.52). The primary endpoint was Overall Survival (OS). The independence of EPICES score effects was analyzed via Cox regression with adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS: 209 AML patients received the questionnaire, 149 (71.3 %) patients responded. The median EPICES score was 23.6; 26.8 % and 10.1 % of patients were deprived and very deprived, respectively. OS was 23.16 months (95 %CI [17.15-33.31]). According to multivariate analysis, a very-deprived EPICES score, European Leukemia Net categories, age, smoking, and the absence of allogeneic stem cell transplantation were independent factors associated with decreased OS. CONCLUSION: Our results underscore the importance of integrating nonbiological factors in the prognostic stratification of AML patients. The very deprived population exhibited worse OS, confirming that socioeconomic parameters play a role in patient outcomes in AML. Very deprived patients with AML should receive specific attention and adapted clinical management.","['Le Floch, Anne-Charlotte', 'Eisinger, Francois', ""D'Incan, Evelyne"", 'Rey, Jerome', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Caymaris, Laurence', 'Stoler, Marion', 'Julien, Mancini', 'Boher, Jean-Marie', 'Patrick, Sfumato', 'Norbert, Vey']","['Le Floch AC', 'Eisinger F', ""D'Incan E"", 'Rey J', 'Charbonnier A', 'Caymaris L', 'Stoler M', 'Julien M', 'Boher JM', 'Patrick S', 'Norbert V']","['Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', ""Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France; Departement d'Anticipation et de Suivi du Cancer DASC, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France."", 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, APHM, INSERM, IRD, SESSTIM, ""Cancer, Biomedicine & Society"" Group, Hop Timone, BIOSTIC, Marseille, France.', 'Clinical Trial Office and Biostatistics Unit, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille University, INSERM, IRD, SESSTIM, Marseille, France.', 'Clinical Trial Office and Biostatistics Unit, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.

METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected for monocyte separation. qRT-PCR assay was performed to investigate the expression patterns of NEAT1 and miR-194-5p in AML. CCK-8, soft agar colony formation, flow cytometry and transwell assays were employed to explore the biological functions of NEAT1 or miR-194-5p. Methylation PCR was performed to monitor the methylation of NEAT1. Luciferase reporter assay was subjected to verify the relationship between miR-194-5p and DNMT3A. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were performed to detect the alterations of protein expression. RESULTS: NEAT1 and miR-194-5p were both down-regulated in AML. Overexpression of either NEAT1 or miR-194-5p repressed proliferation, induced apoptosis and restrained migration and invasion of AML cells. There was a negative correlation between NEAT1 and DNMT3A in AML. Knockdown of DNMT3A dramatically decreased the methylation of NEAT1. Moreover, DNMT3A was identified as a downstream target of miR-194-5p. Furthermore, down-regulation of DNMT3A rescued the impacts on the malignant phenotypes of NEAT1 inhibition by miR-194-5p inhibitor. CONCLUSION: Altogether, down-regulation of NEAT1 mediated by miR-194-5p/DNMT3A axis promotes AML progression, which might provide therapeutic targets in AML treatment.","['Duan, Ming-Yue', 'Li, Ming', 'Tian, Hui', 'Tang, Gen', 'Yang, Yu-Cong', 'Peng, Nian-Cai']","['Duan MY', 'Li M', 'Tian H', 'Tang G', 'Yang YC', 'Peng NC']","[""State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710054, PR China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710054, PR China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710054, PR China."", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen 528038, PR China."", ""Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, PR China."", ""State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710054, PR China.

While the disruption of several IEC death regulating factors result in intestinal inflammation, the loss of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members BCL2 and BCL2L1 has no effect on intestinal homeostasis in mice. We investigated the functions of the antiapoptotic protein MCL1, another member of the BCL2 family, in intestinal homeostasis in mice. METHODS: We generated mice with IEC-specific disruption of Mcl1 (Mcl1(DeltaIEC) mice) or tamoxifen-inducible IEC-specific disruption of Mcl1 (i-Mcl1(DeltaIEC) mice); these mice and mice with full-length Mcl1 (controls) were raised under normal or germ-free conditions. Mice were analyzed by endoscopy and for intestinal epithelial barrier permeability. Intestinal tissues were analyzed by histology, in situ hybridization, proliferation assays, and immunoblots. Levels of calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation, were measured in intestinal tissues and feces. RESULTS: Mcl1(DeltaIEC) mice spontaneously developed apoptotic enterocolopathy, characterized by increased IEC apoptosis, hyperproliferative crypts, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and chronic inflammation. Loss of MCL1 retained intestinal crypts in a hyperproliferated state and prevented the differentiation of intestinal stem cells. Proliferation of intestinal stem cells in MCL1-deficient mice required WNT signaling and was associated with DNA damage accumulation. By 1 year of age, Mcl1(DeltaIEC) mice developed intestinal tumors with morphologic and genetic features of human adenomas and carcinomas. Germ-free housing of Mcl1(DeltaIEC) mice reduced markers of microbiota-induced intestinal inflammation but not tumor development. CONCLUSION: The antiapoptotic protein MCL1, a member of the BCL2 family, is required for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and prevention of carcinogenesis in mice. Loss of MCL1 results in development of intestinal carcinomas, even under germ-free conditions, and therefore does not involve microbe-induced chronic inflammation. Mcl1(DeltaIEC) mice might be used to study apoptotic enterocolopathy and inflammatory bowel diseases.","['Healy, Marc E', 'Boege, Yannick', 'Hodder, Michael C', 'Bohm, Friederike', 'Malehmir, Mohsen', 'Scherr, Anna-Lena', 'Jetzer, Jasna', 'Chan, Lap Kwan', 'Parrotta, Rossella', 'Jacobs, Kurt', 'Clerbaux, Laure-Alix', 'Kreutzer, Susanne', 'Campbell, Andrew', 'Gilchrist, Ella', 'Gilroy, Kathryn', 'Rodewald, Ann-Katrin', 'Honcharova-Biletska, Hanna', 'Schimmer, Roman', 'Velez, Karelia', 'Bueler, Simone', 'Cammareri, Patrizia', 'Kalna, Gabriela', 'Wenning, Anna S', 'McCoy, Kathy D', 'Gomez de Aguero, Mercedes', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning', 'Klose, Christoph S N', 'Unger, Kristian', 'Macpherson, Andrew J', 'Moor, Andreas E', 'Kohler, Bruno', 'Sansom, Owen J', 'Heikenwalder, Mathias', 'Weber, Achim']","['Healy ME', 'Boege Y', 'Hodder MC', 'Bohm F', 'Malehmir M', 'Scherr AL', 'Jetzer J', 'Chan LK', 'Parrotta R', 'Jacobs K', 'Clerbaux LA', 'Kreutzer S', 'Campbell A', 'Gilchrist E', 'Gilroy K', 'Rodewald AK', 'Honcharova-Biletska H', 'Schimmer R', 'Velez K', 'Bueler S', 'Cammareri P', 'Kalna G', 'Wenning AS', 'McCoy KD', 'Gomez de Aguero M', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H', 'Klose CSN', 'Unger K', 'Macpherson AJ', 'Moor AE', 'Kohler B', 'Sansom OJ', 'Heikenwalder M', 'Weber A']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Molecular Cancer Research, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Garscube Estate, Bearsden, Glasgow, UK; Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Glasgow, UK.

However, acquired resistance to this inhibitor, which is especially conferred by the T315I point mutation in BCR-ABL, impedes the efficacy of imatinib therapy. Therefore, the discovery and development of novel agents to overcome imatinib resistance is urgently needed. Pseudolaric acid B (PAB), a small molecule isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Cortex pseudolaricis, has been reported to be a potential candidate for immune disorders and cancer treatment. However, its effects on CML and the involved molecular mechanism have not been reported. In the current study, by performing both in vitro and in vivo experiments in CML cells, we showed that PAB blocked the cell cycle at G2/M phase and subsequently activated the caspase pathway, cleaved the BCR-ABL protein and inhibited the BCR-ABL downstream pathways, ultimately leading to cell proliferation inhibition, cytotoxicity and apoptosis. These events were observed in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-insensitive CML cell lines. Moreover, PAB decreased the viability of primary blood mononuclear cells from CML patients and induced apoptosis in these cells. Our findings suggest that PAB could be used as a novel agent to sensitize imatinib-resistant CML.","['Jiang, Liling', 'Wen, Chuangyu', 'He, Qingyan', 'Sun, Yuening', 'Wang, Jinxiang', 'Lan, Xiaoying', 'Rohondia, Sagar', 'Dou, Q Ping', 'Shi, Xianping', 'Liu, Jinbao']","['Jiang L', 'Wen C', 'He Q', 'Sun Y', 'Wang J', 'Lan X', 'Rohondia S', 'Dou QP', 'Shi X', 'Liu J']","['Guangzhou Municiple and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Dongguan Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University, Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangzhou Municiple and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangzhou Municiple and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangzhou Municiple and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangzhou Municiple and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'The Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Departments of Oncology, Pharmacology and Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Guangzhou Municiple and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China; The Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Departments of Oncology, Pharmacology and Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Guangzhou Municiple and Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.

After the demonstration of graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect in a leukemic murine model following allo-HSCT from other strains of mice, graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect in a solid tumor after allo-HSCT has also been reported in a murine model in 1984. Several trials have reported the presence of a GvT effect in patients with various refractory solid tumors, including renal, ovarian and colon cancers, as well as soft tissue sarcomas [1]. The growing data on haploidentical transplants also indicate GvT effect in some pediatric refractory solid tumors. Novel immunotherapy-based treatment modalities aim at inducing an allo-reactivity against the metastatic solid tumor via a GvT effect. Recipient derived immune effector cells (RDICs) in the antitumor reactivity following allo-HSCT have also been considered as an emerging therapy for advanced refractory solid tumors. Conclusion: This review summarizes the background, rationale, and clinical results of immune-based strategies using GvT effect for the treatment of various metastatic and refractory solid tumors, as well as innovative approaches such as haploidentical HSCT, CAR-T cell therapies and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL).","['Sahin, Ugur', 'Demirer, Taner']","['Sahin U', 'Demirer T']","['Hematology Unit, Yenimahalle Education and Research Hospital, Yildirim Beyazit University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8198-0068', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2214-5927']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201103,Turkey,Turk J Med Sci,Turkish journal of medical sciences,9441758,,IM,"['Animals', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Neoplasms/physiopathology/therapy', '*Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7672351,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Graft-versus-tumor effect', '*recipient derived immune effector cells', '*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*solid tumors']",2020/03/18 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3906/sag-1911-112 [doi]'],epublish,Turk J Med Sci. 2020 Nov 3;50(SI-2):1697-1706. doi: 10.3906/sag-1911-112.,,"['This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International', 'License.']",,['Authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study explores antileukemic effects of the extracts and purified active compounds from the leaves. The antileukemic activity was investigated via inhibition of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1), which is a protein that involves in leukemic cell proliferation. In addition, the compounds were investigated for their effects on WT1 gene expression using real time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cell cycle arrest and total cell number were investigated using flow cytometry and trypan blue exclusion method, respectively. The results demonstrated that the hexane fractionated extract had the greatest inhibitory effect on WT1 gene expression of many leukemic cell lines and significantly decreased WT1 protein levels of K562 cells (representative of the leukemic cells), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Subfraction No. 9 (F9) after partial purification of hexane fractioned extract showed the highest suppression on WT1 protein and suppressed cell cycle at G2/M. The organic compounds were isolated from F9 and identified as phytol and lupeol. The bioassays confirmed antiproliferative activities of natural products phytol and lupeol. The results demonstrated anticancer activity of the isolated phytol and lupeol to decrease leukemic cell proliferation.","['Anuchapreeda, Songyot', 'Chueahongthong, Fah', 'Viriyaadhammaa, Natsima', 'Panyajai, Pawaret', 'Anzawa, Riki', 'Tima, Singkome', 'Ampasavate, Chadarat', 'Saiai, Aroonchai', 'Rungrojsakul, Methee', 'Usuki, Toyonobu', 'Okonogi, Siriporn']","['Anuchapreeda S', 'Chueahongthong F', 'Viriyaadhammaa N', 'Panyajai P', 'Anzawa R', 'Tima S', 'Ampasavate C', 'Saiai A', 'Rungrojsakul M', 'Usuki T', 'Okonogi S']","['Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Materials and Life Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Sophia University, Tokyo 102-8554, Japan.', 'Cancer Research Unit of Associated Medical Sciences (AMS CRU), Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Research Center of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Materials and Life Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Sophia University, Tokyo 102-8554, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Cancer Research Unit of Associated Medical Sciences (AMS CRU), Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Research Center of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'College of Alternative Medicine, Chandrakasem Rajabhat University, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.', 'Department of Materials and Life Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Sophia University, Tokyo 102-8554, Japan.', 'Research Center of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7259-4694', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1464-0685', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0212-5371']",['eng'],['RSA6280034/The Thailand Research Fund (TRF)'],['Journal Article'],20200312,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Citrus/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry']",PMC7144100,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Wilms' tumor 1"", 'antiproliferation', 'kaffir lime', 'leukemia', 'lupeol', 'phytol']",2020/03/18 06:00,2020/12/18 06:00,['2020/03/18 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25061300 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25061300 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Mar 12;25(6). pii: molecules25061300. doi: 10.3390/molecules25061300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the numerous advancements in cancer treatment, there is still abundant scope to mitigate recurrence, adverse side effects and toxicities caused by existing pharmaceutical drugs. To achieve this, many phytochemicals from plants and natural products have been tested against cancer cell lines in vivo and in vitro. Likewise, casticin, a flavonoid extracted from the Vitex species, has been isolated from the leaves and seeds of V. trifolia and V. agnus-castus. Casticin possesses a wide range of therapeutic properties, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, antiasthmatic and antineoplastic activities. Several studies have been conducted on the anticancer effects of casticin against cancers, including breast, bladder, oral, lung, leukemia and hepatocellular carcinomas. The compound inhibits invasion, migration and proliferation and induces apoptosis (casticin-induced, ROS-mediated and mitochondrial-dependent) and cell cycle arrest (G0/G1, G2/M, etc.) through different signaling pathways, namely the PI3K/Akt, NF-kappaB, STAT3 and FOXO3a/FoxM1 pathways.

Plasma exosome-derived microRNA-532 is aberrantly expressed in a variety of human cancers and has the prognostic value in many solid tumors. However, the prognostic impact of the expression value on AML remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic value of exosome-derived microRNA-532 in AML patients. METHODS: We performed the real-time PCR to quantify exosome-derived microRNA-532 in plasma of 198 AML patients. To assess the prognostic value, we performed Cox regression analyses in the context of well-established clinical and molecular markers. Cellular metabolic profile was conducted to help us understand the biological insight of its expression. RESULTS: The expression level was not associated with white blood cell counts, age, FAB subtypes, cytogenetic risk groups and genes of FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA and DNMT3A mutations. Interestingly, high expressers had a favorable overall survival in the univariate analysis. This prognostic value was testified in the multivariate analysis. Moreover, up-regulation of miR-532 was negatively associated with cellular energy like fructose and glutamine.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to compare direct medical costs of childhood cancer by phase of care in British Columbia (BC) and Ontario (ON). METHODS: For cancer patients diagnosed at <15 years of age and propensity-score-matched non-cancer controls, we applied standard costing methodology using population-based healthcare administrative data to estimate and compare phase-based costs by province. RESULTS: Phase-specific cancer-attributable costs were 2%-39% higher for ON than for BC. Leukemia pre-diagnosis costs and annual lymphoma continuing care costs were >50% higher in ON. Phase-specific in-patient hospital costs (the major cost category) represented 63%-82% of ON costs, versus 43%-73% of BC costs. Phase-specific diagnostic tests and procedures accounted for 1.0%-3.4% of ON costs and 2.8%-13.0% of BC costs.

Several studies have examined weight status in either pediatric patients or survivors with acute leukemia, but few have compared these data across various diagnoses. Objectives: We examined BMI from oncology diagnosis or presentation, through treatment, and into survivorship across the most common cancer types seen in pediatric oncology. Methods: Patients were categorized into three oncologic diagnoses: leukemia and lymphoma (n = 69), neural tumors (n = 80), and non-neural solid tumors (n = 80) at yearly intervals over the course of 11 years. To allow for comparisons across age groups, BMI percentiles were calculated with <5th percentile classified as underweight (n = 11), the 5th-84th percentile classified as a healthy weight (n = 129), and above the 85th percentile classified as overweight and obese (n = 87). Results: At presentation, 45.6% of leukemia and lymphoma patients were overweight or obese, and 44.3% of neural tumor patients were overweight or obese. These high obesity rates persisted into survivorship. Compared to the non-neural tumor group, the leukemia and lymphoma group had a significant increase in BMI percentile over time, while the neural tumor group did not. Conclusions: Pediatric patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and neural tumors and who are overweight or obese at presentation continue this trend into survivorship, indicating a need for management of overweight and obesity through lifestyle interventions concurrent with therapy.","['Murphy, Brianna R', 'Raber, Margaret P', 'Crawford, Karla D', 'Grasse, Leslie', 'Wartenberg, Lisa', 'Wu, Jimin', 'Dibaj, Seyedeh S', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Murphy BR', 'Raber MP', 'Crawford KD', 'Grasse L', 'Wartenberg L', 'Wu J', 'Dibaj SS', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Fellowship Program, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Energy Balance in Cancer Prevention and Survivorship, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Energy Balance in Cancer Prevention and Survivorship, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Energy Balance in Cancer Prevention and Survivorship, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Energy Balance in Cancer Prevention and Survivorship, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",,['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA203650/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA057730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200313,United States,Child Obes,Childhood obesity (Print),101542497,,IM,"['Body Mass Index', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology', '*Pediatric Obesity/complications/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7262646,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BMI', '*pediatric oncology', '*weight']",2020/03/17 06:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/chi.2019.0180 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Obes. 2020 Jun;16(4):250-257. doi: 10.1089/chi.2019.0180.

Discovery chemistry for the ENL YEATS domain is highly motivated by its significance in acute leukemia pathophysiology, but cell-based assays able to support large-scale screening or hit validation efforts do not presently exist. Here, we report on the discovery of a target engagement assay that allows for high-throughput ligand discovery in living cells. This assay is based on the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) but does not require exposing cells to elevated temperatures, as small-molecule ligands are able to stabilize the ENL YEATS domain at 37 degrees C. By eliminating temperature shifts, we developed a simplified target engagement assay that requires just two steps: drug treatment and luminescence detection. To demonstrate its value for higher throughput applications, we miniaturized the assay to a 1536-well format and screened 37120 small molecules, ultimately identifying an acyl-lysine-competitive ENL/AF9 YEATS domain inhibitor.","['Asiaban, Joshua N', 'Milosevich, Natalia', 'Chen, Emily', 'Bishop, Timothy R', 'Wang, Justin', 'Zhang, Yuxiang', 'Ackerman, Christopher J', 'Hampton, Eric N', 'Young, Travis S', 'Hull, Mitchell V', 'Cravatt, Benjamin F', 'Erb, Michael A']","['Asiaban JN', 'Milosevich N', 'Chen E', 'Bishop TR', 'Wang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Ackerman CJ', 'Hampton EN', 'Young TS', 'Hull MV', 'Cravatt BF', 'Erb MA']","['Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Calibr at Scripps Research, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Calibr at Scripps Research, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Calibr at Scripps Research, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Calibr at Scripps Research, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Calibr at Scripps Research, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5330-3492', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9993-3481']",['eng'],"['DP5 OD026380/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA231991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA033760/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200319,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)']",IM,"['Biological Assay/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Discovery', 'HEK293 Cells', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC7384521,['NIHMS1607627'],,,2020/03/17 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.0c00124 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2020 Apr 17;15(4):895-903. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.0c00124.

In the current study, the effect of iron in response to methotrexate and its underlying mechanisms were investigated in pALL cells. CCRF-CEM and Nalm6 cell lines were selected as T and B-ALL subtypes. Cells were pretreated with ferric ammonium citrate, exposed to the IC50 concentration of MTX and cell viability was assessed using MTT, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays. Iron-loaded cells were strongly resistant to MTX cytotoxicity. The inhibitory effect of N-acetyl cysteine to reverse the acquired MTX resistance was greater than that of the iron chelator, deferasirox, highlighting the importance of iron-mediated ROS in MTX resistance. Subsequently, the upregulation of BCL2, SOD2, NRF2, and MRP1 was confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, a positive correlation was demonstrated between the MRP1 expression levels and bone marrow iron storage in pALL patients. Further supporting our findings were the hematoxylin and eosin-stained histological sections showing that iron-treated nude mice xenografts demonstrated significantly more liver damage than those unexposed to iron. Overall, iron is introduced as a player with a novel role contributing to methotrexate resistance in pALL. Our findings suggest that the patients' bone marrow iron stores are necessary to be assessed during the chemotherapy, and transfusions should be carefully administrated.","['Abedi, Marjan', 'Rahgozar, Soheila', 'Esmaeili, Abolghasem']","['Abedi M', 'Rahgozar S', 'Esmaeili A']","['Department of Cell and Molecular biology & Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular biology & Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular biology & Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1376-255X'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200316,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (superoxide dismutase 2)', 'UVP74NG1C5 (ferric ammonium citrate)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Deferasirox/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Ferric Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC7221302,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*drug resistance', '*iron', '*methotrexate']",2020/03/17 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2019/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2982 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 May;9(10):3537-3550. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2982.

We examined three monocyte subgroups: classical (CD14++CD16-), intermediate (CD14++CD16+) and non-classical (CD14+CD16++) monocytes. As these subpopulations can be also characterized by different levels of HLA-DR and CD163, we evaluated their expression on monocyte subpopulations of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and healthy individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The monocyte subsets in peripheral blood of CLL patients (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 10) were evaluated by flow cytometry. The monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD14 FITC, anti-CD16 PE-Cy5, anti-CD163 PE, anti-HLA-DR PE were used. RESULTS: The percentage of CD16-positive monocytes was significantly higher in CLL patients than in healthy donors. The highest percentage of CD163+ monocytes is in the 'classical' (CD14++CD16-) population. In turn, the non-classical monocytes constituted the majority of cells lacking HLA-DR expression. In CLL patients, there was no statistically significant relationship between the percentage of each monocyte subpopulation and the stage according to Rai Staging of CLL. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CD163 on classical monocytes suggests that these cells have anti-inflammatory properties. Besides, the low expression of HLA-DR on non-classical monocytes may result in impaired ability to stimulate the immune system.","['Kowalska, Wioleta']",['Kowalska W'],"['Chair and Department of Clinical Immunology Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland. w.kowalska.lub@gmail.com.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0930-5874'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200316,Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD163', '*HLA-DR', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*monocyte', '*subpopulations']",2020/03/17 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2019/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['VM/OJS/J/66328 [pii]', '10.5603/FHC.a2020.0002 [doi]']",ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2020;58(1):17-24. doi: 10.5603/FHC.a2020.0002.

Se deficiency has a significant impact on the livestock and poultry industries. Previous studies have confirmed that Se deficiency causes serious injury to the swine liver; however, it is unclear whether this liver damage is the result of necroptosis and apoptosis. To understand the damage induced by Se deficiency, swine were divided into a control group and Se-deficient group. The results showed that in the liver of swine, Se deficiency initiated apoptosis by increasing the expression of cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (caspase-3), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 9 (caspase-9) and BCL-2 antagonist/killer (BAK) at both the mRNA and protein levels and by decreasing the B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (BCL-2) levels compared with the levels in the control group. Meanwhile, compared with the control group, necroptosis was confirmed in the liver of Se-deficient swine through increased the expression of mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL) and receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) at both the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, the activities of catalase (CAT), nitric oxide (NO), and total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) were clearly increased (P < 0.05), and the activities of OH- and total nitric oxide synthase (TNOS) were obviously decreased (P < 0.05), whereas in the Se-deficient group, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were obviously increased (P < 0.05) compared with those in the control group. Moreover, the number of apoptotic cells was increased significantly in the Se-deficient group, and the liver tissues showed obvious necroptosis damage. These results show that Se deficiency induces apoptosis and necroptosis through the oxidative stress pathway in the swine liver.","['Zhang, Yuan', 'Yu, Dahai', 'Zhang, Jiuli', 'Bao, Jun', 'Tang, Chaohua', 'Zhang, Ziwei']","['Zhang Y', 'Yu D', 'Zhang J', 'Bao J', 'Tang C', 'Zhang Z']","['Institute of Animal Sciences of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Scientific Observing and Experiment Station of Animal Genetic Resources and Nutrition in North China, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100193, China. tangchaohua@caas.cn.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200316,England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Diet', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Necroptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Selenium/*deficiency', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Swine']",,,,,2020/03/17 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9mt00295b [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2020 Apr 1;12(4):607-616. doi: 10.1039/c9mt00295b.

A haploidentical donor (HID) is readily available to almost all children. Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with HID-SCT had similar outcomes compared to ISD-SCT for pediatric and adult AML. However, the role of HID-SCT in high-risk pediatric AML is unclear. METHODS: To compare the overall survival of high-risk AML children who underwent either HID-SCT or ISD-SCT, we analyzed 179 cases of high-risk AML patients under 18 years of age treated with either ISD-SCT (n = 23) or HID-SCT (n = 156). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus anti-thymocyte globulin-based regimens were used for HID-SCT. We also analyzed the subgroup data of AML patients at first complete remission (CR1) before SCT with known cytogenetic risk. RESULTS: The numbers of adverse cytogenetic risk recipients were 8 (34.8%) and 13 (18.8%) in the ISD-SCT group and the HID-SCT group, and the number of patients with disease status beyond CR1 were 6 (26.1%) and 14 (20.3%) in the two groups. The cumulative rates of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 13.0% in the ISD-SCT group and 34.8% in the HID-SCT group (P = 0.062), with a three-year cumulative rates of chronic GVHD at 14.1% and 34.9%, respectively (P = 0.091). The relapse rate in the ISD-SCT group was significantly higher than that in the HID-SCT group (39.1% vs. 16.4%, P = 0.027); with non-relapse mortality at 0.0% and 10.6% (P = 0.113), respectively. The three-year overall survival rates were 73.0% for the ISD-SCT group and 74.6% for the HID-SCT group (P = 0.689). In subgroup analysis, the three-year relapse rate in the ISD-SCT group was higher than that in the HID-SCT group (50.0% vs. 9.2%, P = 0.001) and the three-year DFS in the ISD-SCT group (50.0%) was lower than that in the HID-SCT group (81.2%) (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Unmanipulated HID-SCT achieved DFS and OS outcomes comparable to those of ISD-SCT for high-risk pediatric AML patients with potentially higher rate but manageable GVHD.","['Zheng, Feng-Mei', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Li, Chun-Fu', 'Cheng, Yi-Fei', 'Gao, Li', 'He, Yue-Lin', 'Wang, Yu', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Zheng FM', 'Zhang X', 'Li CF', 'Cheng YF', 'Gao L', 'He YL', 'Wang Y', 'Huang XJ']","[""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, 100044, P.

In the last few years, secondary hypertension due to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, from the vascular endothelial growth factor class, has been recognized to be an important cause of hypertension, as well as proteinuria, and occasionally kidney dysfunction in some cases. Less well-recognized is that BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors also have adverse vascular effects. These manifest as vascular stenoses in large vessels, which may sometimes cause renal artery stenosis and subsequent hypertension. We describe a case report which presented as classical bilateral renal artery stenosis, and responded to revascularization. Increased awareness of these effects, as well as research into the pathogenesis, may provide more insight into vascular biology.","['Amin, Syed O', 'Ruzicka, Marcel', 'Burns, Kevin D', 'Bence-Bruckler, Isabelle A', 'Ryan, Stephen E', 'Hadziomerovic, Adnan', 'Hiremath, Swapnil']","['Amin SO', 'Ruzicka M', 'Burns KD', 'Bence-Bruckler IA', 'Ryan SE', 'Hadziomerovic A', 'Hiremath S']","['Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Vascular/Interventional Radiology, Department of Medical Imaging, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Vascular/Interventional Radiology, Department of Medical Imaging, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0010-3416'],['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200316,United States,J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),"Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)",100888554,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', '*Hypertension, Renovascular/chemically induced/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Imidazoles/*adverse effects', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Pyridazines/*adverse effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A']",PMC8029973,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL mutation', '*drug-induced hypertension', '*hypertension', '*renovascular hypertension', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/03/17 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2020/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jch.13843 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich). 2020 Apr;22(4):678-682. doi: 10.1111/jch.13843.

We investigated the kinetics and prognostic impact of recurrent fusion transcripts (RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, KMT2A-MLLT3 or KMT2A-ELL) in 774 post-induction samples from bone marrow (BM, 347) and peripheral blood (PB, 427) from 75 children with AML. BM MRD persistence during consolidation did not increase the risk of relapse, and MRD at therapy completion did not correlate to outcome (HR = 0.64/MRD log reduction (CI: 0.32-1.26), P = 0.19). In contrast, 8/8 patients with detectable MRD in PB after first consolidation relapsed. Persistence (n = 4) and shifting from negative to positive (n = 10) in PB during follow-up predicted relapse in 14/14 patients. All 253 PB samples collected during follow-up from 36 patients in continuous complete remission were MRD negative. In core-binding factor AML, persistent low-level MRD positivity in BM during follow-up was frequent but an increment to above 5 x 10(-4) heralded subsequent haematological relapse in 12/12 patients. We demonstrate that MRD monitoring in PB after induction therapy is highly informative and propose an MRD increment above 5 x 10(-4) in PB and BM as a definition of molecular relapse since it always leads to haematological relapse.","['Juul-Dam, Kristian Lovvik', 'Ommen, Hans B', 'Nyvold, Charlotte G', 'Walter, Christiane', 'Valerhaugen, Helen', 'Kairisto, Veli', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Alm, Sofie J', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Fogelstrand, Linda', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Juul-Dam KL', 'Ommen HB', 'Nyvold CG', 'Walter C', 'Valerhaugen H', 'Kairisto V', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Alm SJ', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Lausen B', 'Reinhardt D', 'Zeller B', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Haematology-Pathology Research Laboratory, Department of Haematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', ""Department of Paediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."", 'Department of Pathology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematology and Pathology, Turku University Central Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Department of Paediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."", 'Division of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', ""Department of Paediatrics III, University Children's Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."", 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0028-8115', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9008-4495']",['eng'],['Danish Childhood Cancer Foundation/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200316,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/*diagnosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*fusion transcripts', '*measurable residual disease', '*paediatric haematology', '*relapse']",2020/03/17 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2019/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16560 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jul;190(2):198-208. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16560.

GPX1 differential expression is closely correlated with carcinogenesis and disease progression. In this study, we used bioinformatics analysis to investigate GPX1 expression level and explore the prognostic information in different human cancers. Methods: Expression was analyzed via the Oncomine database and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis tool, and potential prognostic analysis was evaluated using the UALCAN, GEPIA, and DriverDBv3 databases. Then, the UALCAN database was used to find the promoter methylation of GPX1 in defied cancer types. While GPX1 related functional networks were found within the GeneMANIA interactive tool and Cytoscape software. Moreover, Metascape online website was used to analyze Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Results: We found that GPX1 was commonly overexpressed in most human cancers. High expression of GPX1 could lead to poor outcomes in Brain Lower Grade Glioma, while GPX1 over expression was correlated with better prognosis in Kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIPP). High GPX1 expression was marginally associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Gene regulation network suggested that GPX1 mainly involved in pathways including the glutathione metabolism, ferroptosis, TP53 regulates metabolic genes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic process, and several other signaling pathways. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that GPX1 showed significant expression differences among cancers and served as a prognostic biomarker for defined cancer types. The data mining effectively revealed useful information about GPX1 expression, prognostic values, and potential functional networks in cancers, thus providing researchers with an available way to further explore the mechanism underlying carcinogenesis of genes of interest in different cancers.","['Wei, Ruqiong', 'Qiu, Hongtu', 'Xu, Jianwen', 'Mo, Juanmei', 'Liu, Ying', 'Gui, Yuchang', 'Huang, Guangyou', 'Zhang, Shunrong', 'Yao, Hongfang', 'Huang, Xiaoxiao', 'Gan, Zhichuan']","['Wei R', 'Qiu H', 'Xu J', 'Mo J', 'Liu Y', 'Gui Y', 'Huang G', 'Zhang S', 'Yao H', 'Huang X', 'Gan Z']","['Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Guangxi International Zhuang Medicine Hospital, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Guangxi International Zhuang Medicine Hospital, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Guangxi International Zhuang Medicine Hospital, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Guangxi International Zhuang Medicine Hospital, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Guangxi International Zhuang Medicine Hospital, Nanning 530021, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,PMC7049064,,['NOTNLM'],"['Glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1)', 'carcinogenensis', 'methylation', 'prognostic biomarker']",2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:01,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm.2020.02.36 [doi]', 'atm-08-04-124 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2020 Feb;8(4):124. doi: 10.21037/atm.2020.02.36.,,['2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Methods: Twenty-one mice were randomly divided to five groups, including a normal pregnancy (NP) group, an embryo implantation dysfunction (EID) group, an EID with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) group, an EID with PBMCs group, and an EID with hCG co-cultured with PBMCs group. The endometrium in the implantation window from mice were collected and determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), and the expression of significantly different genes with high degree of coincidence was recommended and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: There were totally 1,366 up-regulated and 1,374 down-regulated genes in the EID mice compared with the normal pregnant mice. We selected (fold change >/=2, P<0.05) and verified the candidate genes associated with embryo implantation, immune response and other reproductive processes in previous reports by qRT-PCR. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), solute carrier family 15 member 2 (SLC15A2), retinoic acid receptor responder 1 (RARRES1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) were down-regulated and musculin (MSC), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14) were up-regulated significantly in EID group (P<0.05), and the synergistic effects of hCG were seen. In addition, the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-beta in PBMCs of NP mice was higher than that of EID mice, and up-regulated GR-beta in EID mice could significantly increase the expression of LIF, SLC15A2, RARRES1 and VCAM1, and decrease the expression of CXCL14 and MSC, which indicated GR-beta might be a transcriptional factor of the six genes above. Conclusions: Intrauterine PBMCs perfusion might improve the performance of impaired endometrial receptivity by regulating LIF, SLC15A2, RARRES1, VCAM1, MSC as well as CXCL14, and hCG could enhance the effect of PBMCs. In addition, GR-beta, as a transcriptional factor, could regulate the six genes in PBMCs.","['Chen, Jiao', 'Zhao, Xuehan', 'Ao, Liangfei', 'Yin, Tailang', 'Yang, Jing']","['Chen J', 'Zhao X', 'Ao L', 'Yin T', 'Yang J']","['Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Research Center for Assisted Reproductive and Embryonic Development, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Research Center for Assisted Reproductive and Embryonic Development, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Research Center for Assisted Reproductive and Embryonic Development, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Research Center for Assisted Reproductive and Embryonic Development, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Hubei Clinical Research Center for Assisted Reproductive and Embryonic Development, Wuhan 430060, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,PMC7049043,,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)', 'embryo implantation dysfunction (EID)', 'endometrial receptivity', 'intrauterine administration', 'peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)']",2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:01,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm.2019.12.109 [doi]', 'atm-08-04-99 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2020 Feb;8(4):99. doi: 10.21037/atm.2019.12.109.,,['2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

We determined mRNA levels of SPRED1 in the bone marrow mononuclear cells from adult patients, including 113 AMLs and 22 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs), as well as in 37 healthy control subjects. Significantly decreased SPRED1 mRNA expression was found in AML patients comparing to those in ALL patients and healthy controls, which was confirmed by immunocytochemistry analysis of SPRED1 protein and ELISA measurement of serum SPRED1 level. Further analysis demonstrated that SPRED1 expression was significantly higher for most patients at complete remission after induction treatment than at diagnosis. Moreover, SPRED1 expression was significantly downregulated in M2 and M3 types. Non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (non-APL) patients with decreased SPRED1 had significantly lower 2-year progression-free survival and event-free survival rates. In vitro, ectopic overexpression of SPRED1 leads to a decrease of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, induction of apoptosis and reduction of proliferation of THP-1 cells. Our findings suggest SPRED1 is not only a predictor of treatment response, but also an independent prognostic factor for non-APL, and targeting Ras- Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling may be a promising strategy for the treatment of AML with downregulation of SPRED1.","['Zhang, Rui', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Lu, Xianglan', 'Xu, Weihong', 'Wang, He', 'Mo, Wenbin', 'Pang, Hui', 'Tang, Rurong', 'Li, Shibo', 'Yan, Xiaojing', 'Li, Yan']","['Zhang R', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu X', 'Xu W', 'Wang H', 'Mo W', 'Pang H', 'Tang R', 'Li S', 'Yan X', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200227,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7056905,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'MAPK', 'MIR126', 'SPRED1', 'non-APL']",2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:01,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2019/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00204 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Feb 27;10:204. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00204. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhang, Zhang, Lu, Xu, Wang, Mo, Pang, Tang, Li, Yan and Li.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten FBXW proteins have been identified in humans. The functions of FBXW proteins, like FBXW7, have been well-established in many human cancers. However, little is known about their transcriptional expression profiles and relationship with prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we investigated the roles of FBXW proteins in AML by analyzing their mRNA expression profiles and association with clinical features using data from EMBL-EBI, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, and cBioPortal databases. Our results showed that the mRNA level of FBXW proteins were highly detected by microarray in 14 AML cell lines, although there were no obvious differences. The expression of FBXW4 was significantly higher in AML patients compared with that in normal controls (P < 0.01). Patients whose age was >/=60 years old had a higher FBXW4 expression when compared with those who were <60 years old (P < 0.05). Cytogenetic favorable-risk group patients had a much lower FBXW4 expression than the intermediate- and poor-risk group patients (P < 0.0001). Moreover, patients with high FBXW4 expression exhibited significantly shorter event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with low FBXW4 expression (median EFS: 5.3 vs. 10.0 months, P = 0.025; median OS: 8.1 vs. 19.0 months, P= 0.015). A multivariate analysis indicated that high FBXW4 expression was an independent risk factor for poor EFS in AML patients who received intensive chemotherapy followed by allo-SCT. In summary, our data suggested that FBXW4 is aberrantly expressed in AML and high FBXW4 expression might be a poor prognostic biomarker; future functional and mechanistic studies will further illuminate the roles of FBXW4 in AML.","['Han, Qi', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Song, Huihui', 'Bamme, Yevgeniya', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Han Q', 'Zhang Q', 'Song H', 'Bamme Y', 'Song C', 'Ge Z']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'International Cooperative Leukemia Group and International Cooperative Laboratory of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'International Cooperative Leukemia Group and International Cooperative Laboratory of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'International Cooperative Leukemia Group and International Cooperative Laboratory of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA, United States.', 'International Cooperative Leukemia Group and International Cooperative Laboratory of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'International Cooperative Leukemia Group and International Cooperative Laboratory of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200227,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7056870,,['NOTNLM'],"['FBXW4', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical feature', 'expression', 'survival']",2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:01,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00149 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Feb 27;10:149. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00149. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Han, Zhang, Song, Bamme, Song and Ge.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the applications are limited due to the peptide's instability and high cost of synthesis. Recombinant PP7 bacteriophage-like particles (VLPs) can protect the peptides from degradation by proteases, based on their ability to display foreign peptides. Methods: Here, we evaluated the feasibility of PP7 VLPs carrying Pep2 and (KLAKLAK)2 (2PP7-Pep2-KLAK VLPs) expressed in E. coli. We further investigated the characteristics including size, toxicity, thermal stability, penetrating ability, anti-tumor activity, and potential anti-tumor mechanism of 2PP7-Pep2-KLAK VLPs. Results: 2PP7-Pep2-KLAK VLPs was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) successfully with high yield and thermal stability. They penetrated the AML cells THP-1 rapidly after 30 min of incubation. Moreover, 2PP7-Pep2-KLAK VLPs were non-replicative, non-infectious, and non-toxic against normal cells, but inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 cells by inducing cell apoptosis after 24 h of exposure. This effect extends through 120 h of exposure, indicating their anti-proliferation effect was superior to that of synthetic peptides. In addition to the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, the anti-tumor activity of 2PP7-Pep2-KLAK VLPs was also correlated with down-regulation of expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and trimethylation of histone H3K27. Conclusions: We identified the feasibility to prepare the stable, active Pep2-KLAK peptide by using PP7 bacteriophage as the vehicle. We revealed this peptide was an inhibitor of EZH2. 2PP7-Pep2-KLAK VLPs may have significant clinical implications in the treatment of MLL-AF9 AML as an epigenetic modulator.","['Sun, Yanli', 'Li, Jiaqiu', 'Sun, Yanhua', 'Zhao, Ronglan', 'Wang, Lujuan', 'Song, Wei', 'Wang, Zhanzhao', 'Wang, Jialing', 'Wei, Liuya', 'Zhao, Yao', 'Song, Yang', 'Hu, Zhenbo']","['Sun Y', 'Li J', 'Sun Y', 'Zhao R', 'Wang L', 'Song W', 'Wang Z', 'Wang J', 'Wei L', 'Zhao Y', 'Song Y', 'Hu Z']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.grid.268079.20000 0004 1790 6079', 'Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.grid.268079.20000 0004 1790 6079', ""Department of Hematology, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, China.grid.416966.a0000 0004 1758 1470"", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.grid.268079.20000 0004 1790 6079', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.grid.268079.20000 0004 1790 6079', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.grid.268079.20000 0004 1790 6079', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, China.grid.416966.a0000 0004 1758 1470"", 'School of Bioscience and Technology, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.grid.268079.20000 0004 1790 6079', 'School of Pharmacy, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.grid.268079.20000 0004 1790 6079', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, China.grid.416966.a0000 0004 1758 1470"", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.grid.268079.20000 0004 1790 6079', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, China.grid.268079.20000 0004 1790 6079']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8883-5226'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191204,United States,Cell Mol Bioeng,Cellular and molecular bioengineering,101468590,,,,PMC7048892,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)', 'PP7 bacteriophage', 'Proapoptotic peptide', 'Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)', 'Virus-like particle (VLP)']",2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:01,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12195-019-00605-z [doi]', '605 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Mol Bioeng. 2019 Dec 4;13(2):165-177. doi: 10.1007/s12195-019-00605-z. eCollection 2020 Apr.,,['(c) Biomedical Engineering Society 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of the patients had IFI at the time of initiation of the chemotherapy. Patients were monitored for the occurrence of IFI using high-resolution computerized tomography of the chest or para-nasal sinus and test for galactomannan antigen on serum or broncho-alveolar lavage and were followed up for 90 days.

Toxicity due to HDMTX was assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.5.0. A total of 244 HDMTX infusions were delivered to 62 ALL patients. From the total of 244 cycles, serum methotrexate level in 35 cycles after the start of 48 h HDMTX infusion was found to be >/= 1.0 mumol/L with reported toxicities among 31 cycles (88.6%). In 209 cycles MTX level was found to be less than 1.0 is statistically significant as compared to other cycles (p < 0.0001). Highest toxicities reported were in cycle I (38.8%). The toxicities such as oral mucositis, neutropenia, the elevation of liver enzymes, dermatological toxicities were found more in cycles whose methotrexate level are greater than 1.0 mumol/L. Dose reduction, increased the length of stay and treatment delay occurred in patients with severe toxicities. Severe toxicities of methotrexate can be interrelated with serum methotrexate levels at 48 h after the start of HDMTX infusion.","['Sajith, Manjusha', 'Pawar, Atmaram', 'Bafna, Vibha', 'Bartakke, Sandip', 'Subramanian, Kannan', 'Vaidya, Neela']","['Sajith M', 'Pawar A', 'Bafna V', 'Bartakke S', 'Subramanian K', 'Vaidya N']","['1Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, Poona College of Pharmacy, Pune, Maharashtra India.grid.411681.b0000 0004 0503 0903', '1Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, Poona College of Pharmacy, Pune, Maharashtra India.grid.411681.b0000 0004 0503 0903', 'Department of Pediatrics, Paediatric Hemato Oncologist, Bharati Hospital and Research Center, Pune, Maharashtra India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Paediatric Hemato Oncologist, Bharati Hospital and Research Center, Pune, Maharashtra India.', '3Consultant Hematologist, KEM Hospital and Research Centre, Pune, Maharashtra India.grid.46534.300000 0004 1793 8046', '4Department of Biochemistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College and Research Center, Pune, Maharashtra India.grid.411681.b0000 0004 0503 0903']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0248-6318'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190606,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7042471,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia', 'High dose methotrexate', 'Serum methotrexate level', 'Toxicities']",2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:01,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01144-3 [doi]', '1144 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Jan;36(1):51-58. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01144-3.

However, Western literature suggests that use of TKI alleviate the adverse impact of age in outcomes of CML. This study was carried out to analyze the clinical profile and outcome of elderly, in comparison with younger patients with CML. We retrospectively analyzed CML patients treated at our department from January 2008 to December 2017. The data cutoff date was December 2018. The cohorts of 712 patients were divided into two groups. Patients belonging to the age group of >/= 60 years were classified as the study group and those who were 18-60 years were used as controls. Patient's clinical history, examination and milestones in terms of achieving hematological, molecular responses and toxicity profile were also recorded. The total of 712 patients, 52 patients in the study group and 660 patients in the control group were treated during the study period. The study group was having more co-morbidities than the control group (15.3% vs. 4.5%). Patients having high-risk EUTOS score were similar in both groups (38.4% vs. 37.6%). The patients presented in blast phase were higher in the study group as compared to control group (9.6% vs. 6.36%) but the differences were not statistically significant. Rates of achieving a hematological response at 3 months (85.1% vs. 86.89%) and the major molecular response at 18 months (54.3% vs. 60.16%) were almost similar in both groups. However, hematological toxicity, muscle cramps and gastritis were reported more in elderly patients. The outcome of CML patients in TKI era do not differ in elderly patients. However, toxicity profile was not significantly inferior in elderly patients.","['Lokesh, Kadabur Nagendrappa', 'Pehalajani, Jitendra Kumar', 'Loknatha, Dassappa', 'Jacob, Linu Abraham', 'Babu, M C Suresh', 'Rudresha, A H', 'Rajeev, Lakkavalli Krishnappa', 'Smitha, S C', 'Ashok, Khandare Pravin', 'Madhumathi, D S']","['Lokesh KN', 'Pehalajani JK', 'Loknatha D', 'Jacob LA', 'Babu MCS', 'Rudresha AH', 'Rajeev LK', 'Smitha SC', 'Ashok KP', 'Madhumathi DS']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.', 'Department of Pathology, Kidwai Cancer Institute, Marigowda Road, Bangalore, 560029 India.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8922-2544'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190606,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7042472,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'Major molecular response']",2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:01,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01143-4 [doi]', '1143 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Jan;36(1):47-50. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01143-4.

MFC identifies the MRD based on characteristic 'leukemia-associated immunophenotypes' on the residual leukemia cells. MRD analysis by MFC is most frequently done at the post-induction stage of treatment and often can achieve a sensitivity of detecting one leukemic cell in 10,000 normal cells, or even higher at times.

However, the current classification system is inadequate to elucidate the molecular heterogeneity of the disease, and therapy failures frequently occur. Leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) initiate and maintain the clonal hierarchy of AML and exhibit properties of self-renewal remaining recalcitrant to conventional chemotherapy. In this study, we identified a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MAGI2 antisense RNA 3 (MAGI2-AS3) in AML and investigated its functional role in regulating LSCs self-renewal. LSCs were identified by immunoprofiling of CD34(+) CD123(+) in AML patients' marrow. MAGI2-AS3 exhibited a poor expression level in LSCs than the normal human haematopoietic stem cells. Lentivirus-mediated upregulation of MAGI2-AS3 or leucine-rich repeats and Ig-like domains 1 (LRIG1) impaired LSCs self-renewal. MAGI2-AS3-overexpressed LSCs acquired the ability of self-renewal following lentivirus-mediated knockdown of LRIG1. Methylation-dependent inhibition of LRIG1 was evident in LSCs. MAGI2-AS3 was found to induce occupancy of TET2 at the LRIG1 promoter. Lentivirus-mediated downregulation of TET2 could impair MAGI2-AS3-mediated elevation of LRIG1 and neutralize the inhibitory effect of MAGI2-AS3 on LSCs self-renewal. In vivo analysis indicated an elevated overall survival of NOD/SCID mice injected with LSCs in the presence of MAGI2-AS3. Altogether, the key findings support the potential of lncRNA MAGI2-AS3 to serve as a novel candidate for the improvement of AML treatment.","['Chen, Lijuan', 'Fan, Xu', 'Zhu, Jianhua', 'Chen, Xuexin', 'Liu, Yiling', 'Zhou, Hao']","['Chen L', 'Fan X', 'Zhu J', 'Chen X', 'Liu Y', 'Zhou H']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan, China.', 'Liver Research Center, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University , Beijing Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine in Liver Cirrhosis & National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Immunology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200315,United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LRIG1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.8 (Guanylate Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.4.8 (MAGI2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Self Renewal/*genetics', '*DNA Demethylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Guanylate Kinases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Antisense', '*RNA, Long Noncoding']",PMC7549675,,['NOTNLM'],"['*LRIG1', '*Long Non-Coding RNA', '*Magi2-AS3', '*TET2', '*acute Myeloid Leukaemia', '*demethylation', '*leukaemic Stem Cells', '*self-renewal']",2020/03/17 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/17 06:00'],"['2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15476286.2020.1726637 [doi]'],ppublish,RNA Biol. 2020 Jun;17(6):784-793. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1726637.

Low and high birthweight have been inconsistently associated with mortality in children with leukemia.Material and methods: In a cohort of childhood and adolescent leukemia (0-19 years) patients from registries in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Washington State in the United States (1967-2015), five-year all-cause mortality was assessed by birthweight and other measures of fetal growth using the cumulative incidence function and Cox regression with adjustment for sex, diagnosis year, country, the presence of Down's syndrome or other malformations, and type of leukemia.Results: Among 7148 children and adolescents with leukemia (55% male), 4.6% were low (<2500 g) and 19% were high (>/=4000 g) birthweight. Compared with average weight, hazard ratios (HRs) of death associated with low birthweight varied by age at leukemia diagnosis: 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7, 3.2) for patients 0-1 year old, 1.6 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.6) for >1-2 years old; 1.0 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.5) for 3-8 years old; 1.0 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.8) for 9-13 years old; and 1.2 (95% CI: 0.7, 2.1) for 14-19 years old, and were similar for size for gestational age and Ponderal index.

FLT3 aberrations have been detected in a smaller fraction of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and their prognostic value is not well established. We therefore assessed the FLT3 mutation in Chinese adolescent and adult ALL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have examined a cohort of 117 Chinese de novo adolescent and adult ALL patients enrolled between June 2016 and June 2017 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. Prognostic factors for the ALL patient population were estimated by the Cox regression method. FLT3 mutation was detected by PCR, and its clinical effect was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves. Differences in FLT3 mutation rate between subgroups were tested by chi-square test. RESULTS: FLT3 mutations accounted for 6.8% (8/117) in our cohort, including 3 internal tandem duplications (2.6%) and 5 tyrosine kinase domains (4.3%, 3 D835Y mutations, 1 M664I mutation, and 1 I867S mutation), which had no clinical significance on either overall survival (OS) or event-free survival. Alterations in FLT3 occurred more often in early thymic precursor (ETP)-ALL compared to non-ETP T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P = .028). However, the age at onset (P = .004), initial platelet counts (P = .018), and transplantation status (P = .007) were independent prognostic factors of OS for ALL in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The FLT3 mutation was not common in Chinese ALL patients. Age at onset, platelet counts, and transplantation status rather than the presence of the FLT3 mutation were independent prognostic variables for ALL on OS in our cohort. Despite our small sample size, ETP-ALL may indicate a comparable higher FLT3-mutant rate. Because ETP-ALL has been identified as high-risk subgroup, these data warrant clinical studies with the implementation of FLT3 inhibitors in addition to early allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for FLT3-mutant ETP-ALL.","['Shen, Zhen', 'Chu, Xiao-Ling', 'Wang, Rong-Xian', 'Li, Jin-Li', 'Liu, Meng-Yao', 'Xie, Yi-Yu', 'Wang, Chao', 'Han, Rong', 'Yu, Jing-Qiu', 'Wang, Jun', 'Tao, Tao', 'Shen, Hong-Jie', 'Chen, Su-Ning', 'Wu, De-Pei', 'Qiu, Qiao-Cheng', 'Liu, Song-Bai', 'Xue, Sheng-Li']","['Shen Z', 'Chu XL', 'Wang RX', 'Li JL', 'Liu MY', 'Xie YY', 'Wang C', 'Han R', 'Yu JQ', 'Wang J', 'Tao T', 'Shen HJ', 'Chen SN', 'Wu DP', 'Qiu QC', 'Liu SB', 'Xue SL']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', ""Department of Internal Medicine, The Fifth People's Hospital of Suzhou, Suzhou, China."", 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.

A systematic review of the literature.,100673,S0268-960X(20)30023-0 [pii] 10.1016/j.blre.2020.100673 [doi],"Chimerism analysis following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for leukemia is routinely applied in parallel with quantification of minimal residual disease (MRD) to identify imminent relapse. In the past decades, new methods with a lower limit of detection compared to standard methods have been developed, so-called microchimerism analysis. Microchimerism analysis is fast, simple, applicable across pre-HSCT disease-type and can be applied on peripheral blood allowing frequent testing during follow-up. Monitoring of microchimerism in blood could replace repeated bone marrow analysis for MRD and allow earlier detection of imminent relapse or graft failure. Clinical studies in single center cohorts have shown conflicting but promising results. There is currently no consensus on the interpretation of microchimerism analysis and heterogeneity of studies remains a major obstacle for inter-study comparisons and meta-analysis in this field. We have conducted a systematic review of studies investigating associations between microchimerism and relapse of leukemia post-HSCT. We summarize current evidence and provide suggestions for future research.","['Haugaard, Anna Karen', 'Kofoed, Josefine', 'Masmas, Tania Nicole', 'Madsen, Hans Ole', 'Marquart, Hanne Vibeke', 'Heilmann, Carsten', 'Muller, Klaus Gottlob', 'Ifversen, Marianne']","['Haugaard AK', 'Kofoed J', 'Masmas TN', 'Madsen HO', 'Marquart HV', 'Heilmann C', 'Muller KG', 'Ifversen M']","['Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant and Immune Deficiency, Department for Children and Adolescents, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Hematologic malignancies are ideally suited to targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT) due to easy accessibility of malignant cells in blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen as well as their radiosensitivity. Most clinical trials using alpha-particle therapy for hematologic malignancies have focused on acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, preclinical studies have shown activity against other diseases such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma. To date, the short-lived radionuclide bismuth-213 ((213)Bi) and its parent actinium-225 ((225)Ac) have been used clinically, but trials with astatinie-211 ((211)At) have recently begun, and thorium-227 ((227)Th) has shown promising preclinical results. Lintuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the cell surface antigen CD33, which is expressed on the vast majority of AML cells. Initial studies showed that (213)Bi-labeled lintuzumab had antileukemic activity and could produce remissions after partial cytoreduction with cytarabine. An initial phase I trial demonstrated that a single infusion of (225)Ac-lintuzumab could be given safely at doses upto 111 kBq/kg with antileukemic activity across all dose levels. A second phase I study showed that fractionated-dose (225)Ac-lintuzumab could be safely combined with low-dose cytarabine and produced objective responses in 28% of older patients with untreated AML. In a phase II study, treatment with (225)Ac-lintuzumab monotherapy for a similar patient population resulted in remission in 69% of patients receiving two fractions of 74 kBq/kg and 22% of patients receiving two 55.5-kBq/kg fractions. Additionally, TAT may be useful in intensifying antileukemic therapy prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation, and pretargeting strategies offer the possibility for improved tumor-to-normal organ dose ratios.","['Jurcic, Joseph G']",['Jurcic JG'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.

Here we summarise the way it is currently stratified according to genetic risk and patient characteristics and the treatment approaches used for these different subgroups. RECENT FINDINGS: Certain patients appear to sustain MRD negativity after combination chemoimmunotherapy, leading to the suggestion that their CLL may be cured. However, 17p-deleted, p53-mutated or IGHV-UM subgroups are generally resistant to FCR, and much better responses are seen with ibrutinib and venetoclax, frequently inducing MRD negativity that hopefully will be translated into durable remissions. Small molecule inhibitors have already revolutionised CLL treatment.

Compound 3b demonstrated modulation of HDAC targets in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. It has good in vitro ADME profile that translated into a greatly improved pharmacokinetic profile. 3b also demonstrated modulation of HDACs in tumors in a PC-3 xenograft model. It was further evaluated in combination therapies in vitro.

The host-directed therapy is a promising strategy for TB treatment that synergize with anti-TB treatment drugs. In this study, we found that the anti-chronic lymphocytic leukemia drug, ibrutinib, inhibited the growth of intracellular Mtb in human macrophages. Mechanisms studies showed that ibrutinib treatment significantly decreased p62 and increased LC3b proteins in Mtb infected macrophages. In addition, ibrutinib increased LC3b colocalization with intracellular Mtb and auto-lysosome fusion. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by using siRNA targeting ATG7 abolished the effect of ibrutinib-mediated suppression of intracellular Mtb. Next, we found that ibrutinib induced autophagy was through inhibition of BTK/Akt/mTOR pathway. Finally, we confirmed that ibrutinib treatment significantly reduced Mtb load in mediastinal node and spleen of Mtb infected mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that ibrutinib is a potential host-directed therapy candidate against TB.","['Hu, Yunlong', 'Wen, Zhihua', 'Liu, Song', 'Cai, Yi', 'Guo, Jiubiao', 'Xu, Yuzhong', 'Lin, Dachuan', 'Zhu, Jialou', 'Li, Dechang', 'Chen, Xinchun']","['Hu Y', 'Wen Z', 'Liu S', 'Cai Y', 'Guo J', 'Xu Y', 'Lin D', 'Zhu J', 'Li D', 'Chen X']","['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Regional Immunity and Diseases, Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518055, China.', ""Yuebei Second People's Hospital, Shaoguan 512028, China."", ""Clinical Medical Research Center, The Second Clinical Medical College of Jinan University (Shenzhen People's Hospital), Shenzhen 518020, China."", 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Regional Immunity and Diseases, Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Regional Immunity and Diseases, Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Regional Immunity and Diseases, Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Regional Immunity and Diseases, Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Regional Immunity and Diseases, Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518055, China.', ""Yuebei Second People's Hospital, Shaoguan 512028, China."", 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Regional Immunity and Diseases, Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518055, China.

However, it remains unclear whether the quantification is predictive of HBVr in leukemia patients undergoing immunosuppression. METHODS: and patients: Clinical and laboratory data of the leukemia patients with resolved HBV infection diagnosed between January 2013 and March 2018 were retrospectively collected. Data series of HBV seromarkers and HBV DNA levels before the patients receiving chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and during follow-up duration were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 533 leukemia patients with resolved HBV infection were included. The incidences of HBVr were 5.7% (25/441) and 2.2% (2/92) in patients receiving HSCT and chemotherapy, respectively. In patients receiving HSCT, acute lymphoid leukemia had a significantly higher incidence of HBVr than acute myeloid leukemia (8.9% vs 3.9%, P < 0.05). The incidence varied almost zero to 40% due to the differences in the profiles of HBV antibodies. High anti-HBs (cut-off of 79.2 IU/L) or low anti-HBc levels (cut-off of 4.475, S/CO) at baseline were associated with a low risk of HBVr. Anti-HBe status did not affect the incidence of HBVr. However, the cut-offs were only predictive of HBVr in the patients who had negative anti-HBe. CONCLUSION: The baseline profiles of HBV antibodies are predictive of the risk of HBVr in leukemia patients undergoing immunosuppression. However, seronegative anti-HBe is a prerequisite for using baseline anti-HBs and anti-HBc quantification to predict HBVr risk.","['Wu, Tian', 'Wu, Nan', 'Ma, Yan-Xiu', 'Wu, Jing', 'Gao, Yan', 'Pan, Xiao-Ben']","['Wu T', 'Wu N', 'Ma YX', 'Wu J', 'Gao Y', 'Pan XB']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Hepatology Institute, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hepatitis C and Immunotherapy for Liver Diseases, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Hepatology Institute, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hepatitis C and Immunotherapy for Liver Diseases, Beijing, China."", 'Hangzhou Normal University, School of Medicine, Department of Basic Medical Science, Key Laboratory of Aging and Cancer Biology of Zhejiang Province, Key Laboratory of Inflammation and Immunoregulation of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Hangzhou Normal University, School of Medicine, Department of Basic Medical Science, Key Laboratory of Aging and Cancer Biology of Zhejiang Province, Key Laboratory of Inflammation and Immunoregulation of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Department of Infectious Disease, Beijing, China.

Many stem cell-based applications rely on the ability to activate several endogenous genes simultaneously to modify cell fate. However, genetic intervention of these cells remains challenging. Several catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) proteins fused to distinct activation domains can modulate gene expression when directed to their regulatory regions by a specific single-guide RNA (sgRNA). In this study, we have compared the ability of the first-generation dCas9-VP64 activator and the second-generation systems, dCas9-SAM and dCas9-SunTag, to induce gene expression in hPSCs and hMSCs. Several stem cell lines were tested for single and multiplexed gene activation. When the activation of several genes was compared, all three systems induced specific and potent gene expression in both single and multiplexed settings, but the dCas9-SAM and dCas9-SunTag systems resulted in the highest and most consistent level of gene expression. Simultaneous targeting of the same gene with multiple sgRNAs did not result in additive levels of gene expression in hPSCs nor hMSCs. We demonstrate the robustness and specificity of second-generation dCas9 activators as tools to simultaneously activate several endogenous genes in clinically relevant human stem cells.","['Petazzi, Paolo', 'Torres-Ruiz, Raul', 'Fidanza, Antonella', 'Roca-Ho, Heleia', 'Gutierrez-Aguera, Francisco', 'Castano, Julio', 'Rodriguez-Perales, Sandra', 'Diaz de la Guardia, Rafael', 'Lopez-Millan, Belen', 'Bigas, Anna', 'Forrester, Lesley M', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Petazzi P', 'Torres-Ruiz R', 'Fidanza A', 'Roca-Ho H', 'Gutierrez-Aguera F', 'Castano J', 'Rodriguez-Perales S', 'Diaz de la Guardia R', 'Lopez-Millan B', 'Bigas A', 'Forrester LM', 'Bueno C', 'Menendez P']","['Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

The BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, has shown promising activity in combination with hypomethylating agents and low-dose cytarabine in older adults for whom chemotherapy is not suitable with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia. We aimed to determine the safety and explore the activity of venetoclax in combination with standard and high-dose chemotherapy in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: We did a phase 1, dose-escalation study at three research hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients were aged 2-22 years with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia or acute leukaemia of ambiguous lineage with adequate organ function and performance status. During dose escalation, participants received venetoclax orally once per day in continuous 28-day cycles at either 240 mg/m(2) or 360 mg/m(2), in combination with cytarabine received intravenously every 12 h at either 100 mg/m(2) for 20 doses or 1000 mg/m(2) for eight doses, with or without intravenous idarubicin (12 mg/m(2)) as a single dose, using a rolling-6 accrual strategy. The primary endpoint was the recommended phase 2 dose of venetoclax plus chemotherapy and the secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose who achieved complete remission or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery. Analyses were done on patients who received combination therapy. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03194932) and is now enrolling to address secondary and exploratory objectives. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2017, and July 2, 2019, 38 patients were enrolled (aged 3-22 years; median 10 [IQR 7-13]), 36 of whom received combination therapy with dose escalation, with a median follow-up of 7.1 months (IQR 5.1-11.2). The recommended phase 2 dose of venetoclax was found to be 360 mg/m(2) (maximum 600 mg) combined with cytarabine (1000 mg/m(2) per dose for eight doses), with or without idarubicin (12 mg/m(2) as a single dose). Overall responses were observed in 24 (69%) of the 35 patients who were evaluable after cycle 1. Among the 20 patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, 14 (70%, 95% CI 46-88) showed complete response with or without complete haematological recovery, and two (10%) showed partial response. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (22 [66%]), bloodstream infections (six [16%]), and invasive fungal infections (six [16%]). Treatment-related death occurred in one patient due to colitis and sepsis. INTERPRETATION: The safety and activity of venetoclax plus chemotherapy in paediatric patients with heavily relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukaemia suggests that this combination should be tested in newly diagnosed paediatric patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia.

Factors Influencing Duration of Therapy and Future Questions.,685-692,10.1093/cid/ciz1195 [doi],"Treatment duration for invasive mold disease (IMD) in patients with hematological malignancy is not standardized and is a challenging subject in antifungal stewardship. Concerns for IMD relapse during subsequent reinduction or consolidation chemotherapy or graft versus host disease treatment in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients often results in prolonged or indefinite antifungal treatment. There are no validated criteria that predict when it is safe to stop antifungals. Decisions are individualized and depend on the offending fungus, site and extent of IMD, comorbidities, hematologic disease prognosis, and future plans for chemotherapy or transplantation. Recent studies suggest that FDG-PET/CT could help discriminate between active and residual fungal lesions to support decisions for safely stopping antifungals. Validation of noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring treatment response, tests for quantifying the ""net state of immunosuppression,"" and genetic polymorphisms associated with poor fungal immunity could lead to a personalized assessment for the continued need for antifungal therapy.","['Fernandez-Cruz, Ana', 'Lewis, Russell E', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Fernandez-Cruz A', 'Lewis RE', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Infectious Diseases Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro-Segovia de Arana, Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, S.

Our aim was to evaluate the response rate, toxicities, and outcome of adults with newly diagnosed ALL who received liposomal vincristine, rather than regular vincristine in combination with intensive chemotherapy (Hyper-CMAD). In a single-center, phase 2 study, patients >/=18 years with newly-diagnosed B-cell ALL were eligible to receive hyper-CMAD alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine. Rituximab was administered in CD20 positive ALL. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib or dasatinib) were added in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) ALL. Thirty-one patients were enrolled, median follow-up of 59 months (0.3-70). Thirteen patients (42%) had CD20 positive ALL, and 21 (68%) had Ph-positive ALL. Thirty (97%) achieved complete remission (CR). All 26 patients with abnormal karyotype achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and 27/30 (90%) achieved negative minimal residual disease status by multicolor flow cytometry. Of 20 evaluable Ph-positive ALL patients, major molecular response (MMR) was achieved in 19 patients (95%); complete molecular response (CMR) in 14 (70%). Grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy was observed in five (16%) with all grade peripheral neuropathy in 21 (68%). With a median follow-up of 59 months, 21 (68%) patients are alive.

Several FLT3 inhibitors have been used in clinical trials, but their efficacy in extramedullary disease remains unclear. In the present case, a 56-year-old man was diagnosed with FLT3-ITD mutated AML. Due to bone marrow relapse during consolidation therapy, he underwent salvage therapy and a myeloablative conditioning regimen, followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from a HLA-matched related donor. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) did not develop, and complete donor chimerism was confirmed on days 27 and 96 after PBSCT. On day 180, he experienced extensive chronic GVHD and had several subcutaneous tumors in his body, which were diagnosed as myeloid sarcoma by pathological examination. We considered this to be a case of isolated extramedullary relapse, as his bone marrow had maintained complete donor chimerism. Treatment with etoposide and ranimustine produced no effect, and tumor progression continued. We started administration of gilteritinib, a FLT3/AXL inhibitor, after identifying the FLT3-ITD mutation in the tumor. Subsequently, there has been a remarkable regression of the tumors. Gilteritinib can be effective in isolated extramedullary relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Kida, Michiko', 'Kuroda, Yoshiaki', 'Kido, Miki', 'Chishaki, Ren', 'Kuraoka, Kazuya', 'Ito, Takuo']","['Kida M', 'Kuroda Y', 'Kido M', 'Chishaki R', 'Kuraoka K', 'Ito T']","['Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Kure Medical Center and Chugoku Cancer Center, 3-1 Aoyama-chou, Kure, Hiroshima, 737-0023, Japan. kida.michiko.fd@mail.hosp.go.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Hiroshima-Nishi Medical Center, Otake, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Kure Medical Center and Chugoku Cancer Center, 3-1 Aoyama-chou, Kure, Hiroshima, 737-0023, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Kure Medical Center and Chugoku Cancer Center, 3-1 Aoyama-chou, Kure, Hiroshima, 737-0023, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, National Hospital Organization, Kure Medical Center and Chugoku Cancer Center, Kure, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Kure Medical Center and Chugoku Cancer Center, 3-1 Aoyama-chou, Kure, Hiroshima, 737-0023, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200313,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3-ITD', 'Gilteritinib', 'Isolated extramedullary relapse']",2020/03/15 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2020/03/15 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02855-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02855-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Aug;112(2):243-248. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02855-4.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) develops as a consequence of a series of genetic changes in hematopoietic precursor cells, including mutations in epigenetic factors. Here, we set out to study the gene regulatory role of TEs in AML. We first explored the epigenetic landscape of TEs in AML patients using ATAC-seq data. We show that a large number of TEs in general, and more specifically mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs), are more enriched in AML cells than in normal blood cells. We obtained a similar finding when analyzing histone modification data in AML patients. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that genes near MIRs in open chromatin regions are involved in leukemogenesis. To functionally validate their regulatory role, we selected 19 MIR regions in AML cells, and tested them for enhancer activity in an AML cell line (Kasumi-1) and a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line (K562); the results revealed several MIRs to be functional enhancers. Taken together, our results suggest that TEs are potentially involved in myeloid leukemogenesis and highlight these sequences as potential candidates harboring AML-associated variation.","['Zeng, Yingying', 'Cao, Yaqiang', 'Halevy, Rivka Sukenik', 'Nguyen, Picard', 'Liu, Denghui', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Ahituv, Nadav', 'Han, Jing-Dong J']","['Zeng Y', 'Cao Y', 'Halevy RS', 'Nguyen P', 'Liu D', 'Zhang X', 'Ahituv N', 'Han JJ']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Developmental Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Developmental Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, China.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, 94158, USA.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, 94143, USA.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 6997801, Israel.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, 94158, USA.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, 94143, USA.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Developmental Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Developmental Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, China.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, 94158, USA.

The expression of PBX1 is abnormally high in a broad range of human tissues, and this gene plays a key role in tumour proliferation. This research intended to explore the radiosensitization of OSCC by silencing PBX1. The OSCC cell lines KYSE450 and KYSE150 were subjected to PBX1 silencing and/or irradiation (IR). Cell proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis were tested to evaluate the radiosensitization ability of PBX1 silencing. The levels of STAT3 and p-STAT3 in the OSCC cells were tested by Western blotting. Furthermore, KYSE150 cells with or without PBX1 silencing were xenografted into nude mice with or without radiation exposure. Concomitant PBX1 silencing and IR can obviously suppress growth and enhance radiosensitivity in OSCC cells and xenografts. Moreover, the downregulation of PBX1 inhibits the expression of STAT3 and p-STAT3. The downregulation of PBX1 may increase radiosensitivity in OSCC cells and xenografts via the PBX1/STAT3 pathway. Our findings demonstrate that PBX1 may be a potential target for promoting the effect of radiation therapy in OSCC patients.","['Yu, Dingyue', 'Ma, Yuanyuan', 'Feng, Chen', 'Ma, Zhiyu', 'Guo, Jiayou', 'Chen, Hui', 'He, Tianli', 'Guo, Jiayi', 'Sun, Xingbang', 'Qin, Qin', 'Sun, Xinchen', 'Ma, Jianxin']","['Yu D', 'Ma Y', 'Feng C', 'Ma Z', 'Guo J', 'Chen H', 'He T', 'Guo J', 'Sun X', 'Qin Q', 'Sun X', 'Ma J']","['Department of radiotherapy, The Lianyungang municipal oriental Hospital Affiliated to Bengbu Medical College, 57 Zhonghua West Road, Lianyungang, 222042, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of radiotherapy, The Lianyungang municipal oriental Hospital Affiliated to Bengbu Medical College, 57 Zhonghua West Road, Lianyungang, 222042, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Oncology Department, First Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233000, AnHui, China.', 'Department of radiotherapy, The Lianyungang municipal oriental Hospital Affiliated to Bengbu Medical College, 57 Zhonghua West Road, Lianyungang, 222042, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of radiotherapy, The Lianyungang municipal oriental Hospital Affiliated to Bengbu Medical College, 57 Zhonghua West Road, Lianyungang, 222042, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of radiotherapy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210000, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Respiratory, Changxing People's Hospital, Huzhou, 313000, Zhejiang, China."", 'Department of radiotherapy, The Lianyungang municipal oriental Hospital Affiliated to Bengbu Medical College, 57 Zhonghua West Road, Lianyungang, 222042, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of radiotherapy, The Lianyungang municipal oriental Hospital Affiliated to Bengbu Medical College, 57 Zhonghua West Road, Lianyungang, 222042, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of radiotherapy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210000, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of radiotherapy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210000, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of radiotherapy, The Lianyungang municipal oriental Hospital Affiliated to Bengbu Medical College, 57 Zhonghua West Road, Lianyungang, 222042, Jiangsu Province, China. mjx3416@163.com.']",,['eng'],['H201671/Jiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning project'],['Journal Article'],20200313,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Oesophageal squamous cancer', 'PBX1', 'Radiosensitivity', 'STAT3']",2020/03/15 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/03/15 06:00'],"['2018/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12253-020-00803-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-020-00803-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2020 Oct;26(4):2161-2168. doi: 10.1007/s12253-020-00803-5.

In 2019, novel agents were upgraded from being a ""great treatment option"" to the ""preferred choice"" for all lines of treatment after number of randomized clinical trials proved their superiority compared to conventional chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) regimens. A growing number of next-generation molecules are in clinical trials with a promise of improved efficacy and less toxicity. This includes agents with expected better safety profile (zanubrutinib, umbralisib, etc.) or more importantly with a potential to overcome the resistance mechanism to early generation agents (ARQ-531, LOXO-305, or vecabrutinib). Early intervention has once again become an active topic of research and, if proven to provide an overall survival benefit, will eliminate the ""watch and wait"" strategy for asymptomatic CLL patients. Until then, treatment should only be offered to patients who meet the standard treatment indication in standard practice. With our upgraded therapeutic toolbox, there are and will be many unanswered questions. CLL field will need to define the optimal treatment sequence and most effective combinations with a goal of having a time-limited and chemotherapy-free regimen that provides longest remissions and potentially cure. Cellular immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) may become available for high-risk CLL along with allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). Financial toxicity of novel agents especially when used in combination will need to be an important aspect of research in coming years to avoid unnecessary overtreatment of patients. As current prognostic models (CLL-IPI, etc.) were developed and validated in the CIT era, there is ongoing effort to develop new models using clinical and molecular characteristics to accurately define high-risk CLL in the era of novel agents. We all need to keep in mind that access to the novel agents is currently limited to certain developed countries and every effort should be made to make sure patients around the world also benefit from these outstanding drugs.","['Iovino, Lorenzo', 'Shadman, Mazyar']","['Iovino L', 'Shadman M']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'UO Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. mshadman@fredhutch.org.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical Oncology Division, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. mshadman@fredhutch.org.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200313,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Time-to-Treatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acalabrutinib', '*CLL', '*Duvelisib', '*Ibrutinib', '*Idelalisib', '*SLL', '*Treatment', '*Venetoclax']",2020/03/15 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/03/15 06:00'],"['2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-020-0715-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-020-0715-5 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2020 Mar 13;21(4):24. doi: 10.1007/s11864-020-0715-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recurrent inactivating somatic mutations in the NFKBIE gene, which encodes IkappaBepsilon, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB-inducible activity, are reported in several B-cell malignancies with highest frequencies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and account for a fraction of NF-kappaB pathway activation. The impact of NFKBIE deficiency on B-cell development and function remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we show that Nfkbie-deficient mice exhibit an amplification of marginal zone B cells and an expansion of B1 B-cell subsets. In germinal center (GC)-dependent immune response, Nfkbie deficiency triggers expansion of GC B-cells through increasing cell proliferation in a B-cell autonomous manner. We also show that Nfkbie deficiency results in hyperproliferation of a B1 B-cell subset and leads to increased NF-kappaB activation in these cells upon Toll-like receptor stimulation.

Gene knockout studies revealed that different pro-survival BCL-2 proteins are critical for the survival of distinct cell types, although overlapping functions amongst such proteins have also been identified. In the process of studying mice lacking single alleles of Mcl-1 (Mcl-1(+/-)), Bcl-2 (Bcl-2(+/-)), or both in combination (Mcl-1(+/-)Bcl-2(+/-)), we observed that Mcl-1(+/-)Bcl-2(+/-) mice weighed less when compared with their wild-type littermates as they aged. Body composition analysis demonstrated that while fat mass was similar to wild-type controls, lean mass was significantly reduced in Mcl-1(+/-), Bcl-2(+/-), and, most strikingly in Mcl-1(+/-)Bcl-2(+/-) mice. The weights of several tissues including the heart, tibialis anterior, and kidney were likewise reduced in Mcl-1(+/-)Bcl-2(+/-) mice. When lean mass and specific tissue weights were expressed relative to body weight, these differences were no longer significant, indicating that that Mcl-1(+/-)Bcl-2(+/-) mice, and to a lesser extent Mcl-1(+/-) and Bcl-2(+/-) mice, are smaller than their wild-type counterparts. Consistently, the anal-naso length was reduced in Mcl-1(+/-)Bcl-2(+/-) mice. While minor reductions in size were observed in female Mcl-1(+/-)Bcl-2(+/-) mice, these effects were most prominent in males. Notably, Mcl-1(+/-)Bcl-2(+/-) males had markedly smaller testes even after accounting for differences in body weight. Collectively, these data reveal that combined loss of a single allele of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, while not overtly impairing organismal development, leads to a reduction in animal size.","['Ke, Francine', 'Lancaster, Graeme I', 'Grabow, Stephanie', 'Murphy, Andrew J', 'Strasser, Andreas']","['Ke F', 'Lancaster GI', 'Grabow S', 'Murphy AJ', 'Strasser A']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, 3004, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, 3004, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Blueprint Medicines, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, 3004, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, 3004, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia. strasser@wehi.edu.au.', 'The Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia. strasser@wehi.edu.au.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200313,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Weight Gain/genetics']",PMC7070015,,,,2020/03/15 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2020/03/15 06:00'],"['2019/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2376-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2376-5 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Mar 13;11(3):185. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2376-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hereditary disorders of chromatin regulation are a group of conditions caused by abnormalities of the various components of the epigenetic machinery, namely writers, erasers, readers, and chromatin remodelers. Although neurological dysfunction is almost ubiquitous in these disorders, the constellation of additional features characterizing many of these genes and the emerging clinical overlap among them indicate the existence of a community of syndromes. The introduction of high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) methods for testing multiple genes simultaneously is a logical step for the implementation of diagnostics of these disorders. METHODS: We screened a heterogeneous cohort of 263 index patients by an NGS-targeted panel, containing 68 genes associated with more than 40 OMIM entries affecting chromatin function. RESULTS: This strategy allowed us to identify clinically relevant variants in 87 patients (32%), including 30 for which an alternative clinical diagnosis was proposed after sequencing analysis and clinical re-evaluation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that this approach is effective not only in disorders with locus heterogeneity, but also in order to anticipate unexpected misdiagnoses due to clinical overlap among cognate disorders. Finally, this work highlights the utility of a prompt diagnosis in such a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that we propose to group under the umbrella term of chromatinopathies.","['Squeo, Gabriella Maria', 'Augello, Bartolomeo', 'Massa, Valentina', 'Milani, Donatella', 'Colombo, Elisa Adele', 'Mazza, Tommaso', 'Castellana, Stefano', 'Piccione, Maria', 'Maitz, Silvia', 'Petracca, Antonio', 'Prontera, Paolo', 'Accadia, Maria', 'Della Monica, Matteo', 'Di Giacomo, Marilena Carmela', 'Melis, Daniela', 'Selicorni, Angelo', 'Giglio, Sabrina', 'Fischetto, Rita', 'Di Fede, Elisabetta', 'Malerba, Natascia', 'Russo, Matteo', 'Castori, Marco', 'Gervasini, Cristina', 'Merla, Giuseppe']","['Squeo GM', 'Augello B', 'Massa V', 'Milani D', 'Colombo EA', 'Mazza T', 'Castellana S', 'Piccione M', 'Maitz S', 'Petracca A', 'Prontera P', 'Accadia M', 'Della Monica M', 'Di Giacomo MC', 'Melis D', 'Selicorni A', 'Giglio S', 'Fischetto R', 'Di Fede E', 'Malerba N', 'Russo M', 'Castori M', 'Gervasini C', 'Merla G']","['Division of Medical Genetics, IRCCS Ospedale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, IRCCS Ospedale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Milano, Italy.', 'UOSD Pediatria ad alta intensita di cura, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Milano, Italy.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Department of Health Promotion, Mother and Child Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Clinical Pediatric Genetics Unit, Pediatrics Clinics, MBBM Foundation, Hospital San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, IRCCS Ospedale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, University of Perugia Hospital SM della Misericordia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Service, Hospital ""Cardinale G.

Methods: Serial whole-body scintigraphic images (4 time points) were obtained after infusion of the (111)In-DOTA-BC8 (176-406 MBq) into 52 adult patients with hematologic malignancies (lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome). Counts were obtained for the regions of interest for spleen, liver, kidneys, testicles (in men), and 2 marrow sites (acetabulum and sacrum), and correction for attenuation and background was made. Bone marrow biopsies were obtained 14-24 h after infusion, and the percentage of administered activity was determined. Absorbed radiation doses were calculated. Results: Initial uptake in liver averaged 32% +/- 8.4% (SD) of administered activity (52 patients), which cleared monoexponentially with a biologic half-time of 293 +/- 157 h (33 patients) or did not clear (19 patients). Initial uptake in spleen averaged 22% +/- 12% and cleared with a biologic half-time of 271 +/- 185 h (36 patients) or longer (6 patients). Initial uptake in kidney averaged 2.4% +/- 2.0% and cleared with a biologic half-time of 243 +/- 144 h (27 patients) or longer (9 patients). Initial uptake in red marrow averaged 23% +/- 11% and cleared with a biologic half-time of 215 +/- 107 h (43 patients) or longer (5 patients). Whole-body retention half-time averaged 198 +/- 75 h. Splenic uptake was higher in the AML/MDS group than in the lymphoma group (P </= 0.05) or the multiple myeloma group (P </= 0.10). Liver represented the dose-limiting organ. For liver uptake, no significant differences were observed among the 3 malignancy groups. Average calculated radiation absorbed doses per unit of administered activity for a therapy infusion of (90)Y-DOTA-BC8 were 0.35 +/- 0.20 cGy/MBq for red marrow, 0.80 +/- 0.24 cGy/MBq for liver, 3.0 +/- 1.4 cGy/MBq for spleen, 0.055 +/- 0.014 cGy/MBq for total body, 0.21 +/- 0.15 cGy/MBq for osteogenic cells, and 0.17 +/- 0.15 cGy/MBq for kidneys. Conclusion: (111)In-DOTA-BC8 had a long retention time in liver, spleen, kidneys, and red marrow, and the highest absorbed doses were in spleen and liver. Few differences were observed by malignancy type.

In this study, we assessed the feasibility of using (18)F-SKI for PET imaging in patients with malignancies. Methods: Five patients with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, renal cell cancer, or leukemia underwent whole-body PET/CT imaging 90 min after injection of (18)F-SKI (mean, 241.24 +/- 116.36 MBq) as part of a prospective study. In addition, patients underwent either a 30-min dynamic scan of the upper abdomen including, at least partly, cardiac left ventricle, liver, spleen, and kidney (n = 2) or three 10-min whole-body PET/CT scans (n = 3) immediately after injection and blood-based radioactivity measurements to determine the time course of tracer distribution and facilitate radiation dose estimates. A subset of 3 patients had a delayed whole-body PET/CT scan at 180 min. Biodistribution, dosimetry, and tumor uptake were quantified. Absorbed doses were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0. Results: No adverse events occurred after injection of (18)F-SKI. In total, 27 tumor lesions were analyzed, with a median SUVpeak of 1.4 (range, 0.7-2.3) and tumor-to-blood ratios of 1.6 (range, 0.8-2.5) at 90 min after injection. The intratumoral drug concentrations calculated for 4 reference lesions ranged from 0.03 to 0.07 nM. In all reference lesions, constant tracer accumulation was observed between 30 and 90 min after injection. A blood radioassay indicated that radiotracer clearance from blood and plasma was initially rapid (blood half-time, 1.31 +/- 0.81 min; plasma, 1.07 +/- 0.66 min; n = 4), followed variably by either a prolonged terminal phase (blood half-time, 285 +/- 148.49 min; plasma, 240 +/- 84.85 min; n = 2) or a small rise to a plateau (n = 2). Like dasatinib, (18)F-SKI underwent extensive metabolism after administration, as evidenced by metabolite analysis. Radioactivity was predominantly cleared via the hepatobiliary route.

Generation of pDCs from bone marrow dendritic cell (DC) progenitors and their maintenance is driven by the transcription factor E2-2 and inhibited by its repressor Id2. In this study, we find that mouse pDCs selectively express the receptor for LIF that signals through STAT3. Stimulation of pDCs with LIF inhibited IFN-I, TNF, and IL-6 responses to CpG and induced expression of the STAT3 targets SOCS3 and Bcl3, which inhibit IFN-I and NF-kappaB signaling. Moreover, although STAT3 has been also reported to induce E2-2, LIF paradoxically induced its repressor Id2. A late-stage bone marrow DC progenitor expressed low amounts of LIFR and developed into pDCs less efficiently after being exposed to LIF, consistent with the induction of Id2. Conversely, pDC development and serum IFN-I responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection were augmented in newly generated mice lacking LIFR in either CD11c(+) or hematopoietic cells. Thus, an LIF-driven STAT3 pathway induces SOCS3, Bcl3, and Id2, which render pDCs and late DC progenitors refractory to physiological stimuli controlling pDC functions and development. This pathway can be potentially exploited to prevent inappropriate secretion of IFN-I in autoimmune diseases or promote IFN-I secretion during viral infections.","['Sesti-Costa, Renata', 'Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa', 'Swiecki, Melissa K', 'Fachi, Jose Luis', 'Cella, Marina', 'Gilfillan, Susan', 'Silva, Joao Santana', 'Colonna, Marco']","['Sesti-Costa R', 'Cervantes-Barragan L', 'Swiecki MK', 'Fachi JL', 'Cella M', 'Gilfillan S', 'Silva JS', 'Colonna M']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil 14049-900.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil 14049-900.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110; and mcolonna@wustl.edu.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7098-2850', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1035-5193', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1230-1313', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1672-0996']",['eng'],"['P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK103039/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200313,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*immunology', 'Interferon Type I/immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",PMC7453765,['NIHMS1599932'],,,2020/03/15 06:00,2020/12/31 06:00,['2020/03/15 06:00'],"['2019/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1900604 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1900604 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 Apr 15;204(8):2257-2268. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900604.

METHODS: A thematic synthesis of all published qualitative studies examining adults with chronic myeloid leukaemia, receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Eligible publications were identified by searching five electronic databases using defined criteria. The synthesis involved complete coding of extracted data and inductive theme development. RESULTS: Nine studies were included and three overarching themes defined. Overarching themes were: 1) Disease impacts whole life; 2) Disease management strategies; and 3) Valued aspects of care. Side-effects often required physical and psychological adaptation. Patients developed individual decision-making processes to promote adherence and manage side effects. Unintentional non-adherence occurred due to forgetfulness and system failures. Intentional omission also occurred, which together with side effects, was unlikely to be reported to healthcare professionals (HCPs). HCP reassurance about missed doses could reinforce non-adherence. Information needs varied over time and between individuals. Knowledge among patients about treatment was often lacking and could lead to misunderstandings. Patients valued psychological support from HCPs and suggested an individualised approach, facilitating discussion of symptoms, adherence and their perspectives about living with chronic myeloid leukaemia, would improve care. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia experienced significant side-effects from treatment and changes to their psychological and physical well-being. They developed their own strategies to manage their disease and treatment. This should be recognised in interventions to improve education, support and the delivery of care that is compassionate and adequately resourced.","['Hewison, Ann', 'Atkin, Karl', 'McCaughan, Dorothy', 'Roman, Eve', 'Smith, Alex', 'Smith, Graeme', 'Howell, Debra']","['Hewison A', 'Atkin K', 'McCaughan D', 'Roman E', 'Smith A', 'Smith G', 'Howell D']",,,['eng'],['RP-PG-0613-20002/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],['Journal Article'],20200211,Scotland,Eur J Oncol Nurs,European journal of oncology nursing : the official journal of European Oncology Nursing Society,100885136,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Decision Making', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Qualitative Research', 'Young Adult']",PMC7167512,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adherence', 'Chronic cancer', 'Chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'Qualitative synthesis', 'Survivorship', 'Treatment', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/03/15 06:00,2020/09/29 06:00,['2020/03/15 06:00'],"['2019/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1462-3889(20)30010-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejon.2020.101730 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Oncol Nurs. 2020 Apr;45:101730. doi: 10.1016/j.ejon.2020.101730.

However, the intrusion of unfavorable side effects had put an unanswered question on the way of the application of this agent; whether the benefits of ATO may outweigh its drawbacks. In this study, we found that when ATO is accompanied by an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARgamma), even the lower concentrations could induce significant inhibitory effects on the survival of NB4 through diminishing the ability of the cells to replicate DNA in the S phase of cell cycle. We also found that through suppression of the PI3K pathway, the combination of pioglitazone and ATO provided a signal through which the induction of apoptotic cell death was enhanced probably via the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). With respect to the tight connection between PI3K pathway and autophagy system and given to the inhibitory effect of pioglitazone-plus-ATO on PI3K, we found that the combination of these agents not only suppressed the expression of autophagy-related genes, but also their efficacy was augmented when autophagy was inhibited in NB4; clarifying the encouraging role of autophagy in the survival maintenance of APL cells. In conclusion, given the significant efficacy as well as the safety profile of pioglitazone in potentiating the anticancer effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, the present study suggests it as a promising agent to be used in adjuvant strategy for the treatment of APL.","['Esmaeili, Shadi', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh', 'Salari, Sina', 'Gharehbaghian, Ahmad', 'Hamidpour, Mohsen', 'Bashash, Davood']","['Esmaeili S', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi A', 'Salari S', 'Gharehbaghian A', 'Hamidpour M', 'Bashash D']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

With 36% of patients >80 years-old at diagnosis, it is important to understand if older patients are receiving similar benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 2155 patients diagnosed with myeloma at age 80 or older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)-Medicare database from 2007 to 2013. A cohort of 2933 similar patients diagnosed with myeloma at age 70-79 was used for comparison using a difference-in-differences design. RESULTS: Only 51% of patients >80 years-old at diagnosis received systemic anti-myeloma treatment. Treatment was associated with a 26% decrease in hazard for death, independent of age, race, gender, poverty, comorbidities, and proxy measures of performance status. In the 70-79 cohort, treatment was associated with a 22% decrease in hazard for death. Based on the difference-in-differences design, there is no statistically significant difference in treatment benefit based on age cohort (p = .610). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-myeloma treatment produces a similar survival benefit among the oldest patients. The population over 80, when myeloma incidence peaks, is projected to triple over the next few decades. It is imperative that we continue to advance our understanding of the needs of this vulnerable subgroup of patients with myeloma.","['Fiala, Mark A', 'Foley, Nicole C', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Wildes, Tanya M']","['Fiala MA', 'Foley NC', 'Zweegman S', 'Vij R', 'Wildes TM']","['Division of Oncology, Section of Bone Marrow Transplant & Leukemia, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, United States of America.

Patients with Down syndrome are highly prone to respiratory tract infections, which might be fatal to them. However, there are only few available data on patients diagnosed with Down syndrome and agammaglobulinemia. In this report, we describe a case of successful prevention of post-dental treatment complications (e.g., pneumonia and other bacterial infections) in a patient with Down syndrome and agammaglobulinemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old man with Down syndrome, untreated agammaglobulinemia, and a history of recurrent pneumonia, was referred to our clinic for tooth mobility. To reduce the risk of post-operative infections, gammaglobulin treatment and prophylactic administration of antibiotics was scheduled before the dental procedure. Furthermore, the dental treatment, which included a filling and extractions, was conducted under general anesthesia and with the supervision of a hematologist. The dental procedures were successfully performed without any post-operative infection, and the patient is undergoing follow-up care. CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of this case report was to recommend a close liaison between physicians and dentists who may encounter a similar case, and to emphasize the importance of improving oral health of immunodeficient patients to prevent infections caused by oral microbial flora.","['Kusumoto, Yasuka', 'Imai, Kohsuke', 'Ohyama, Yoshio', 'Fukayama, Haruhisa', 'Shinozuka, Osamu']","['Kusumoto Y', 'Imai K', 'Ohyama Y', 'Fukayama H', 'Shinozuka O']","['Department of Dentistry for Persons with Disabilities, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45, Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. yasu.dpd@tmd.ac.jp.', 'Department of Community Pediatrics, Perinatal and Maternal Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Shizuoka City Shizuoka Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Clinical Physiology, Graduate School of Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dentistry for Persons with Disabilities, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45, Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200313,England,BMC Oral Health,BMC oral health,101088684,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (gamma-Globulins)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinemia/*complications', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/*administration & dosage', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Male', 'Pneumonia/*complications', 'Tooth Extraction/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'gamma-Globulins/*administration & dosage']",PMC7069031,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Case report', '*Down syndrome', '*Immunodeficiency', '*Oral management']",2020/03/15 06:00,2020/08/14 06:00,['2020/03/15 06:00'],"['2019/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12903-020-1056-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12903-020-1056-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Oral Health. 2020 Mar 13;20(1):71. doi: 10.1186/s12903-020-1056-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, there are little data available to explain the success of the ATRA and ATO combination treatment in molecular terms. We showed that ATRA- and ATO-treated cells had the same capacity for superoxide production, which was reduced by two-thirds in the combined treatment. Secreted inflammatory biomarkers (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1beta] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) were significantly decreased and were further reduced in a transglutaminase 2 (TG2) expression-dependent manner. The amount of secreted TNF-alpha in the supernatant of NB4 TG2 knockout cells was close to 50 times lower than in ATRA-treated differentiated wild-type NB4 cells. The irreversible inhibitor of TG2 NC9 not only decreased reactive oxygen species production 28-fold, but decreased the concentration of MCP-1, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha 8-, 15- and 61-fold, respectively in the combined ATRA + ATO-treated wild-type NB4 cell culture. We propose that atypical expression of TG2 leads to the generation of inflammation, which thereby serves as a potential target for the prevention of differentiation syndrome.","['Jambrovics, Karoly', 'Uray, Ivan P', 'Keillor, Jeffrey W', 'Fesus, Laszlo', 'Balajthy, Zoltan']","['Jambrovics K', 'Uray IP', 'Keillor JW', 'Fesus L', 'Balajthy Z']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'MTA DE Apoptosis, Genomics and Stem Cell Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.']",,['eng'],"['NKFI129139K/Nemzeti Kutatasi, Fejlesztesi es Innovacios Alap', 'K129218/Nemzeti Kutatasi, Fejlesztesi es Innovacios Alap', '05893/Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada', 'GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00020 | 2.3.2-15-2016-00020/MolMedEx TUMORDNS']",['Journal Article'],20200311,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7139906,,['NOTNLM'],"['NB4', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)', 'arsenic trioxide (ATO), ATRA and ATO combination treatment']",2020/03/15 06:00,2020/03/15 06:01,['2020/03/15 06:00'],"['2020/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/15 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12030648 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12030648 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Mar 11;12(3). pii: cancers12030648. doi: 10.3390/cancers12030648.,,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we measured mitochondrial respiration rates in primary CLL cells using respirometry to evaluate mitochondrial function. We found significant increases in mitochondrial respiration rates in CLL versus control B lymphocytes. We also observed amongst CLL patients that advanced age, female sex, zeta-chain-associated protein of 70 kD (ZAP-70(+)), cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38(+)), and elevated beta2-microglobulin (beta2-M) predicted increased maximal respiration rates. ZAP-70(+) CLL cells exhibited significantly higher bioenergetics than B lymphocytes or ZAP-70(-) CLL cells and were more sensitive to the uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoro-methoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). Univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that ZAP-70(+) predicted increased maximal respiration. ZAP-70(+) is a surrogate for B cell receptor (BCR) activation and can be targeted by ibrutinib, which is a clinically approved Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. Therefore, we evaluated the oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of CLL cells and plasma chemokine (C-C motif) ligands 3 and 4 (CCL3/CCL4) levels from ibrutinib-treated patients and demonstrated decreased OCR similar to control B lymphocytes, suggesting that ibrutinib treatment resets the mitochondrial bioenergetics, while diminished CCL3/CCL4 levels indicate the down regulation of the BCR signaling pathway in CLL. Our data support evaluation of mitochondrial respiration as a preclinical tool for the response assessment of CLL cells.","['Roy Chowdhury, Subir', 'Bouchard, Eric D J', 'Saleh, Ryan', 'Nugent,

We evaluated late effects and survival in 826 1-year disease-free survivors of MAC HCT for AYA AML, with an additional focus on comparing late effects based upon MAC type (total body irradiation [TBI] vs high-dose chemotherapy only). The estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of subsequent neoplasms was 4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-6%); 10-year cumulative incidence of nonmalignant late effects included gonadal dysfunction (10%; 95% CI, 8%-13%), cataracts (10%; 95% CI, 7%-13%), avascular necrosis (8%; 95% CI, 5%-10%), diabetes mellitus (5%; 95% CI, 3%-7%), and hypothyroidism (3%; 95% CI, 2%-5%). Receipt of TBI was independently associated with a higher risk of cataracts only (hazard ratio [HR], 4.98; P < .0001) whereas chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) was associated with an increased risk of cataracts (HR, 3.22; P = .0006), avascular necrosis (HR, 2.49; P = .006), and diabetes mellitus (HR, 3.36; P = .03). Estimated 10-year overall survival and leukemia-free survival were 73% and 70%, respectively, and did not differ on the basis of conditioning type. In conclusion, late effects among survivors of MAC HCT for AYA AML are frequent and are more closely linked to cGVHD than type of conditioning.","['Lee, Catherine J', 'Kim, Soyoung', 'Tecca, Heather R', 'Bo-Subait, Stephanie', 'Phelan, Rachel', 'Brazauskas, Ruta', 'Buchbinder, David', 'Hamilton, Betty K', 'Battiwalla, Minoo', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Shaw, Peter J', 'Marks, David I', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Chhabra, Saurabh', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'DeFilipp, Zachariah', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C', 'Olsson, Richard F', 'Kasow, Kimberly A', 'Liesveld, Jane L', 'Rotz, Seth J', 'Badawy, Sherif M', 'Bhatt, Neel S', 'Yared, Jean A', 'Page, Kristin M', 'Arellano, Martha L', 'Kent, Michael', 'Farhadfar, Nosha', 'Seo, Sachiko', 'Hematti, Peiman', 'Freytes, Cesar O', 'Rovo, Alicia', 'Ganguly, Siddhartha', 'Nathan, Sunita', 'Burns, Linda', 'Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Muffly, Lori S']","['Lee CJ', 'Kim S', 'Tecca HR', 'Bo-Subait S', 'Phelan R', 'Brazauskas R', 'Buchbinder D', 'Hamilton BK', 'Battiwalla M', 'Majhail NS', 'Lazarus HM', 'Shaw PJ', 'Marks DI', 'Litzow MR', 'Chhabra S', 'Inamoto Y', 'DeFilipp Z', 'Hildebrandt GC', 'Olsson RF', 'Kasow KA', 'Liesveld JL', 'Rotz SJ', 'Badawy SM', 'Bhatt NS', 'Yared JA', 'Page KM', 'Arellano ML', 'Kent M', 'Farhadfar N', 'Seo S', 'Hematti P', 'Freytes CO', 'Rovo A', 'Ganguly S', 'Nathan S', 'Burns L', 'Shaw BE', 'Muffly LS']","['Utah Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Biostatics, Institute for Heath and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), Department of Medicine, and.', 'CIBMTR, National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), Department of Medicine, and.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Biostatics, Institute for Heath and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Children's Hospital of Orange County, Orange, CA."", 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.', 'Hematology Branch, Sarah Cannon Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Nashville, TN.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', ""The Children's Hospital of Westmead, Westmead, Australia."", 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant, University Hospitals Bristol National Health Service Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Hematology and Transplant Center, Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, MN.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Clinical Research Sormland, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology and Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation Program, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, Cleveland, OH."", ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant, Ann and Robert H.

METHODS: We linked participants in the prospective Agricultural Health Study to permitted animal feeding operations in Iowa. We created metrics reflecting the intensity of animal exposures within 2 and 5 km of participants' residences, enumerating both total and inverse distance-weighted animal units (AUs), standardized by animal size and manure production. We estimated risk of lymphohematopoietic malignancies and subtypes [hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI)], adjusting for demographic and farming-related factors, including occupational pesticide exposure. We stratified associations by animal type and animal-related work activities. RESULTS: We observed 519 cases (1993-2015) among 32,635 pesticide applicators and 211 cases among 19,743 spouses. Among applicators, no associations were evident within 2 km, but risk of any lymphohematopoietic cancer was elevated across quintiles of weighted AUs within 5 km. Risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was elevated for the second (HR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1, 2.1), third (HR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1, 2.2), and fourth (HR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3, 2.4) highest quintiles of weighted AUs within 5 km (Ptrend = 0.52) and increased with dairy cattle AUs (Ptrend = 0.04). We found positive trends for leukemia and some NHL subtypes with increasing numbers of both beef and dairy cattle. Risks did not vary by animal-related work (Pinteraction = 0.61). Associations were similar using the total exposure metric and inconsistent among spouses. CONCLUSION: Residential proximity to intensive animal agriculture was positively associated with risk of NHL and leukemia, even after consideration of occupational animal and pesticide exposures.","['Fisher, Jared A', 'Freeman, Laura E Beane', 'Hofmann, Jonathan N', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Parks, Christine G', 'Thorne, Peter S', 'Ward, Mary H', 'Jones, Rena R']","['Fisher JA', 'Freeman LEB', 'Hofmann JN', 'Blair A', 'Parks CG', 'Thorne PS', 'Ward MH', 'Jones RR']","['From the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'From the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'From the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'From the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'Chronic Disease Epidemiology Group, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, University of Iowa College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA.', 'From the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'From the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.']",,['eng'],"['P30 ES005605/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 CP010119/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 ES049030/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,,IM,"['Adult', '*Agriculture', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iowa/epidemiology', '*Leukemia/epidemiology', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', '*Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment']",PMC7889404,['NIHMS1669743'],,,2020/03/14 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/EDE.0000000000001186 [doi]', '00001648-202007000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Epidemiology. 2020 Jul;31(4):478-489. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the past few decades, advances in ancillary studies and review of prior UPS diagnoses have narrowed the category of UPS by excluding more-specific malignancies. However, few of those studies have specifically targeted pleomorphic hematolymphoid neoplasms. OBJECTIVE.-: To determine what fraction of UPS cases are misclassified pleomorphic hematolymphoid neoplasms, such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, histiocytic sarcoma (HS), myeloid sarcoma, and follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. DESIGN.-: Sixty-one UPS cases were screened by tissue microarray and an immunostain panel with subsequent analysis on whole block sections for suspicious cases. RESULTS.-: Five of 61 tumors (8%) were suggestive of HS based on the screening panel and were further evaluated with additional immunostains (PU.1, CD45, CD163) using whole sections. The 5 candidate HS cases were only focally positive for at most one stain with most staining in smaller, less-pleomorphic cells. Ultimately, no UPS met criteria for anaplastic large cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, myeloid sarcoma, follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, or HS. CONCLUSIONS.-: Our results suggest that a UPS of somatic soft tissue is unlikely to represent a misclassified hematopoietic malignancy. Exclusion of HS is most challenging, but immunostaining for PU.1, a nuclear transcription factor, may be easier to interpret in this context.","['Cannatella, John', 'Ganapathi, Karthik', 'Horvai, Andrew']","['Cannatella J', 'Ganapathi K', 'Horvai A']","['From the Department of Pathology (Cannatella, Horvai), University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.', 'Cannatella is now with the Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine (Ganapathi), University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.', 'From the Department of Pathology (Cannatella, Horvai), University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Dendritic Cell Sarcoma, Follicular/*classification/pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*classification/pathology', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/classification/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*classification/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*classification/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma/*classification/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/classification/pathology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*classification/pathology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",,,,,2020/03/14 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['442278 [pii]', '10.5858/arpa.2019-0580-OA [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2020 Dec 1;144(12):1547-1552. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2019-0580-OA.,,['(c) 2020 College of American Pathologists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While BMP2 and BMP4 promote HSC differentiation, only BMP4 maintains HSC pool and favors interactions with their niche. In myeloid leukemia, we have identified intrinsic and extrinsic dysregulations of the BMP pathway in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and Acute Myeloid leukemia (AML) responsible for leukemic stem cells (LSC) survival. In AML, BMP pathway alterations sustain and promote resistant immature-like leukemic cells by activating a new signaling cascade. Binding of BMP4 to BMPR1A leads to DeltaNp73 expression, which in turn induces NANOG, altogether associated with a poor patient's prognosis. Despite efficient targeted therapies, like Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) in CML, many patients retain LSCs. Our laboratory demonstrated that the BMP pathway sustains a permanent pool of LSCs expressing high levels of BMPR1B receptor, that evolve upon treatment to progressively implement a BMP4 autocrine loop, leading to TKI-resistant cells. Single cell RNA-Seq analysis of TKI-persisting LSCs showed a co-enrichment of BMP with Jak2-signaling, quiescence and stem cell (SC) signatures. Using a new model of persisting LSCs, we recently demonstrated that BMPR1B+ cells display co-activated Smad1/5/8 and Stat3 pathways and could be targeted by blocking BMPR1B/Jak2 signal. Lastly, a specific BMPR1B inhibitor impaired BMP4-mediated LSC protection against TKIs. Altogether, data based on various studies including ours, indicate that BMP targeting could eliminate leukemic cells within a protective bone marrow microenvironment to efficiently impact residual resistance or persistence of LSCs in myeloid leukemia.","['Lefort, Sylvain', 'Maguer-Satta, Veronique']","['Lefort S', 'Maguer-Satta V']","['CNRS UMR5286, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, 69000 Lyon, France.', 'Inserm U1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, 69000 Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, 69000 Lyon, France.', 'CRCL, Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, Lyon, France.', 'CNRS UMR5286, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, 69000 Lyon, France.', 'Inserm U1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, 69000 Lyon, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, 69000 Lyon, France.', 'CRCL, Department of Signaling of Tumor Escape, Lyon, France.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (BMP4 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA-Seq', 'Signal Transduction', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BMP', '*leukemia', '*microenvironment']",2020/03/14 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['222353 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20190223 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2020 Apr 29;48(2):411-418. doi: 10.1042/BST20190223.,,"['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

Trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine (2-PCPA)-based inhibitors featuring substitutions on the amino group have emerged, with sub-micromolar affinities toward LSD1 and high selectivities over monoamine oxidases (MAOs). We synthesized two N-alkylated 2-PCPA-based LSD1 inhibitors, S2116 and S2157, based on the previously developed S2101. S2116 and S2157 exhibited enhanced potency for LSD1 by 2.0- to 2.6-fold, as compared with S2101. In addition, they exhibited improved selectivity over MAOs. Structural analyses of LSD1 co-crystallized with S2101, S2116, S2157, or another N-alkylated inhibitor (FCPA-MPE) confirmed that the N-substituents enhance the potency of a 2-PCPA-based inhibitor of LSD1, without constituting the adduct formed with FAD.","['Niwa, Hideaki', 'Sato, Shin', 'Handa, Noriko', 'Sengoku, Toru', 'Umehara, Takashi', 'Yokoyama, Shigeyuki']","['Niwa H', 'Sato S', 'Handa N', 'Sengoku T', 'Umehara T', 'Yokoyama S']","['RIKEN Systems and Structural Biology Center, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Systems and Structural Biology Center, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Systems and Structural Biology Center, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Systems and Structural Biology Center, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Structural Biology Laboratory, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Systems and Structural Biology Center, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Systems and Structural Biology Center, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Structural Biology Laboratory, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.', 'RIKEN Yokoyama Laboratory, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9544-9350', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9461-8714', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3464-2960', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3133-7338']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200330,Germany,ChemMedChem,ChemMedChem,101259013,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '3E3V44J4Z9 (Tranylcypromine)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Alkylation', '*Drug Development', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Histone Demethylases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Tranylcypromine/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*X-ray crystallography', '*chromatin', '*epigenetics', '*histone demethylase', '*inhibitors', '*nucleosomes', '*protein structures']",2020/03/14 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cmdc.202000014 [doi]'],ppublish,ChemMedChem. 2020 May 6;15(9):787-793. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.202000014.

Infection at presentation if any was documented. Induction mortality was defined as death happening within 28 days of starting induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Among a total of 315 cases of AML, 96 (30%) patients underwent induction chemotherapy with 7 + 3 regimen. Documented infection at baseline was present in 30 (31%) of patients. Another 10 patients had fever at the time of presentation but without any documented infection focus. Fifteen patients died within 4 weeks of induction amounting to induction mortality of 15.6%. Induction mortality was 28% among patients with infection at baseline compared with 7% without baseline infections (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Around 40% of patients had fever at the time of presentation, and 31% had documented infections. Baseline infections led to increase in induction mortality. We would like to propose that infection at baseline is to be considered as one of the potential variables in the predictive scoring system for induction mortality in developing countries.","['Pandian, Jesu', 'Raghavan, Vineetha', 'Manuprasad, A', 'Shenoy, Praveen Kumar', 'Nair, Chandran K']","['Pandian J', 'Raghavan V', 'Manuprasad A', 'Shenoy PK', 'Nair CK']","['Department of Clinical Hematology & Medical Oncology, Malabar Cancer Centre, Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology & Medical Oncology, Malabar Cancer Centre, Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology & Medical Oncology, Malabar Cancer Centre, Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology & Medical Oncology, Malabar Cancer Centre, Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology & Medical Oncology, Malabar Cancer Centre, Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala, India. cknair09@gmail.com.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3051-4112'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200312,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever/drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infections/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*microbiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Baseline infection', 'Induction', 'Mortality']",2020/03/14 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-020-05379-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-020-05379-z [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2020 Nov;28(11):5449-5454. doi: 10.1007/s00520-020-05379-z.

Design: Case report. Setting: PICU. Patients: A 14-year-old boy with refractory B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia given chimeric antigen receptor cells developed severe cytokine release syndrome 7 days after the drug product infusion with progressive respiratory failure. He was admitted to PICU with a clinical picture of acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation, and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Interventions: Hemoadsorption with cartridge column (Cytosorb) in combination with continuous renal replacement therapy was associated to the anti-cytokine therapy (tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-6 receptor). Measurements and Main Results: Decrease of the inflammatory biomarkers (ferritin, interleukin-6, interleukin-10) in the first 96 hours associated with a progressive improvement of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Pao2/Fio2 ratio) 7 day after the start of the multimodal treatment. Conclusions: This case suggests that hemoadsorption with cartridge column in combination with continuous renal replacement therapy and tocilizumab is safe and potentially effective in pediatric patients with severe cytokine release syndrome.","['Bottari, Gabriella', 'Merli, Pietro', 'Guzzo, Isabella', 'Stoppa, Francesca', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Di Nardo, Matteo', 'Del Bufalo, Francesca', 'Galaverna, Federica', 'Corrado, Cecchetti', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Bottari G', 'Merli P', 'Guzzo I', 'Stoppa F', 'Ruggeri A', 'Di Nardo M', 'Del Bufalo F', 'Galaverna F', 'Corrado C', 'Locatelli F']","[""Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatric Anesthesia and Critical Care, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy."", ""Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Pediatrics, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy."", ""Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatric Anesthesia and Critical Care, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy."", ""Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatric Anesthesia and Critical Care, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy."", ""Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatric Anesthesia and Critical Care, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bambino Gesu, Children's Hospital, IRCSS, Rome, Italy.""]",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200129,United States,Crit Care Explor,Critical care explorations,101746347,,,,PMC7063902,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytosorb', 'acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'blood purification', 'chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'cytokines']",2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:01,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCE.0000000000000071 [doi]'],epublish,Crit Care Explor. 2020 Jan 29;2(1):e0071. doi: 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000071. eCollection 2020 Jan.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Previous research has implicated multifunctional proinflammatory cytokines in CML development. It has been reported that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) as well as ADP-ribosyltransferase and deacetylase may influence CML cell viability and inflammation. Methods: This study was directed toward exploring the SIRT1-involved in the mechanism of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered inflammation in CML k562 cells. Results: In our study, the LPS-induced inflammation in k562 cells was reflected by increases in levels of diverse inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1beta, IL-6, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and TNF-beta. LPS also decreased SIRT1 expression and nuclear location in k562 cells. Furthermore, SIRT1 overexpression inhibited the release of the above mentioned cytokines in LPS-treated cells. We also determined that LPS stimulation could activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) subunit, and p65 and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in k562 cells. Nevertheless, SIRT1 overexpression decreased TLR4 expression, thereby repressing the phosphorylation of the NFkappaB subunit and p65 and decreasing ROS production. Conclusions: These findings suggest that SIRT1 is a latent therapeutic target for mitigating LPS-induced inflammation via the TLR4-NFkappaB-ROS signaling axis.","['Wang, Lei', 'Wang, Mingming', 'Dou, Hongju', 'Lin, Wenjie', 'Zou, Lifang']","['Wang L', 'Wang M', 'Dou H', 'Lin W', 'Zou L']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No. 639, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Shanghai, 200011 China.grid.412523.3"", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No. 639, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Shanghai, 200011 China.grid.412523.3"", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No. 639, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Shanghai, 200011 China.grid.412523.3"", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No. 639, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Shanghai, 200011 China.grid.412523.3"", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No. 639, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Shanghai, 200011 China.grid.412523.3""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5998-1793'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200306,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC7059700,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Inflammation', 'NFkappaB', 'ROS', 'SIRT1', 'TLR4']",2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:01,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-020-1152-z [doi]', '1152 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2020 Mar 6;20:73. doi: 10.1186/s12935-020-1152-z. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

While less studied in the pediatric population, data exist demonstrating disparities of care and survival in pediatric oncology patients based on socioeconomic and racial/ethnic factors. Brain cancers recently overtook leukemia as the number one cause of childhood cancer fatalities, but demographic and socioeconomic disparities in these tumors have not been adequately studied. We obtained data from the SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We selected patients under 19 years of age with central nervous system (CNS) cancers diagnosed between 2000 and 2015. We included patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and socioeconomic characteristics as covariates in the analysis. We measured overall survival and extent of disease at diagnosis. We saw that Black and Hispanic patients overall had a higher risk of death than non-Hispanic White patients on multivariable analysis. On stratified analysis, Black and Hispanic patients with both metastatic and localized disease at diagnosis had a higher risk of death compared to White, non-Hispanic patients, although the difference in Black patients was not significant after adjusting for mediating factors. However, our findings on extent of disease at diagnosis demonstrated that neither Black race nor Hispanic ethnicity increased the chance of metastatic disease at presentation when controlling for mediating variables. In summary, racial and ethnic disparities in childhood CNS tumor survival appear to have their roots at least partially in post-diagnosis factors, potentially due to the lack of access to high quality care, leading to poorer overall outcomes.","['Fineberg, Robert', 'Zahedi, Shadi', 'Eguchi, Megan', 'Hart, Muriel', 'Cockburn, Myles', 'Green, Adam L']","['Fineberg R', 'Zahedi S', 'Eguchi M', 'Hart M', 'Cockburn M', 'Green AL']","['University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Morgan Adams Foundation Pediatric Brain Tumor Research Program, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA. adam.green@cuanschutz.edu.', 'Morgan Adams Foundation Pediatric Brain Tumor Research Program, Aurora, CO, USA. adam.green@cuanschutz.edu.', 'University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center, Aurora, CO, USA. adam.green@cuanschutz.edu.', ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA. adam.green@cuanschutz.edu.""]",,['eng'],['P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200312,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/ethnology/*mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'SEER Program', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC7067886,,,,2020/03/14 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2019/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-61237-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-61237-2 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Mar 12;10(1):4588. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-61237-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mcl-1 downregulation, Bim upregulation, and DNA damage have been identified as potential ways to enhance venetoclax activity. In this study, we combine venetoclax with the dual PI3K and histone deacetylase inhibitor CUDC-907, which can downregulate Mcl-1, upregulate Bim, and induce DNA damage, as well as downregulate c-Myc. We establish that CUDC-907 and venetoclax synergistically induce apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia patient samples ex vivo. CUDC-907 downregulates CHK1, Wee1, RRM1, and c-Myc, which were found to play a role in venetoclax-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that venetoclax treatment enhances CUDC-907-induced DNA damage potentially through inhibition of DNA repair.

Abnormal purinergic signaling plays important roles in malignant progression. P2X7, which belongs to the P2X family of purinergic receptors, is abnormally expressed in various types of malignancies including leukemia. However, its role and molecular mechanism in leukemia have not been elucidated. Here, we analyzed the correlation between P2X7 expression and AML clinical outcome; explored the role and mechanism of P2X7 in AML progression by using mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML), nude mouse xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models. High levels of P2X7 expression were correlated with worse survival in AML. P2X7 was highly expressed in MLL-rearranged AML. Furthermore, P2X7 accelerated the progression of MLL-rearranged AML by both promoting cell proliferation and increasing leukemia stem cell (LSC) levels. Moreover, P2X7 caused upregulation of Pbx3 accounts for its pro-leukemic effects. The P2X7-Pbx3 pathway might also contribute to the progression of other types of leukemia as well as solid tumors with high levels of P2X7 expression.

Allo-HLA-reactive T cells are commonly present in the donor T cell repertoire, and thus a very profound alloreactive immune response can be provoked in the HLA-DP-mismatched setting.

To understand the nature of the allo-HLA-DP-specific immune response provoked under different stimulatory conditions, immune responses were induced from both the naive and memory T cell compartments using either HLA-DP-mismatched professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (monocyte-derived dendritic cells [allo-DCs]) or HLA-DP-mismatched nonprofessional APCs (skin-derived fibroblasts [allo-fibroblasts]) as stimulator cells. In this study, we observed that allo-HLA-DP-reactive T cells could be provoked from both the naive and memory compartments by both types of APCs. However, the magnitude of the allo-HLA-DP-specific immune response was greater when stimulation was performed with allo-DCs. Moreover, we found that the frequency of allo-HLA-DP-reactive T cells was greater in the naive T cell compartment compared with the memory T cell compartment, but we observed a comparable lineage specificity of these allo-HLA-DP-specific reactivities. Overall, the data from this study illustrate that the presence of professional APCs of recipient origin will mostly dictate the magnitude of the allo-HLA-DP-specific immune response derived from both the naive and memory T cell compartments, but does not exclusively mediate the induction of these immune responses.","['Laghmouchi, Aicha', 'Hoogstraten, Conny', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Jedema, Inge']","['Laghmouchi A', 'Hoogstraten C', 'Falkenburg JHF', 'Jedema I']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.

We have previously demonstrated that 2.5 mg/kg ATG in conditioning can reduce the incidence of GVHD in unrelated donor transplants. Recent literature has suggested that ATG dosing based on absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) could lead to more optimum exposure of the drug. We sought to determine if ALC at the time of transplant could impact clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective single-center study analyzing all consecutive patients at The Ottawa Hospital who received a matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant with ATG between 2009 and 2014. Patients received rabbit ATG (thymoglobulin) at 0.5 mg/kg on day -2 and 2.0 mg/kg on day -1. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine if any patient- or transplant-related factors, including weight, ALC, and total ATG dose given, impacted GVHD, relapse, or mortality. In total, 111 patients met inclusion, with a median age of 50 years (range, 19 to 70). The most common diagnoses were acute myelogenous leukemia (43%), Myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative neoplasms (13%), and lymphoma (12%). The median weight at time of conditioning was 80.3 kg (range, 45 to 216). The median ALC on the first day of ATG administration was 0.1 x 10(9)/L (range, 0 to 190). The median total dose of ATG received was 201 mg (range, 112 to 540 mg). The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was 35.1% and 21.6%, respectively. In the multivariate model, the actual dose of ATG given to patients was not associated with GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99 to 1.25; P = .07), relapse (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.30; P = .1), or mortality (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.28; P = .32). Similarly, the pretransplant ALC was not associated with GVHD (HR, 1; P = .82), relapse (HR, 1; P = .90), or mortality (HR, 1; P = .39). If patients had received ALC-based dosing according to previously published work (Admiraal et al., Lancet Haematol 2017), the mean total dose of ATG received would have been 1205 mg, more than 5 times the mean dose that was actually given based on weight. With GVHD outcomes being similar to that published by Admiraal et al. and ALC not independently associated with outcomes in our study, further studies are still needed to compare standard weight-based dosing to ALC-based dosing of ATG in matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant.","['Heelan, Francine', 'Mallick, Ranjeeta', 'Bryant, Adam', 'Radhwi, Osman', 'Atkins, Harold', 'Huebsch, Lothar', 'Bredeson, Chris', 'Allan, David', 'Kekre, Natasha']","['Heelan F', 'Mallick R', 'Bryant A', 'Radhwi O', 'Atkins H', 'Huebsch L', 'Bredeson C', 'Allan D', 'Kekre N']","['University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'The Ottawa Hospital Department of Biostatistics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.

In this study, we compared the outcomes of HID with MSD for refractory acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study population came from two prospective multicenter trials (NCT01883180, NCT02673008). Two hundred and seventy-eight patients with refractory acute leukemia were enrolled in this study, including 119 in HID group and 132 in MSD group. Sequential intensified conditioning was employed in all patients, and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was administered in patients in the absence of active GVHD and according to minimal residual disease (MRD) from day + 60 post-transplantation for preventing relapse. RESULTS: The complete remission of leukemia by day + 30 post-transplant were 94% and 93%, respectively, in HID and MSD groups (p = .802). The 1-year incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD was 62% and 54% (p = .025), and 3-year incidence of chronic GVHD was 55% and 55% (p = .789), respectively, in two groups. HID transplant had lower incidence of first episode of MRD positivity and relapse than MSD transplant (28% vs 45%, p = .006; 26% vs 38%, p = .034). There was higher infection-related mortality in HID than MSD (8% vs 2%, p = .049) within the first 100 days' post-transplant. The 5-year overall survival was 46% and 42% (p = .832), respectively; the 5-year disease-free survival was 43% and 39% (p = .665), in HID and MSD groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HID transplant has lower relapse, but higher infection-related mortality and similar survival rates in refractory acute leukemia by the strategy of sequential intensified conditioning followed by DLI compared with MSD transplant.","['Yu, Sijian', 'Huang, Fen', 'Fan, Zhiping', 'Xuan, Li', 'Nie, Danian', 'Xu, Yajing', 'Yang, Ting', 'Wang, Shunqing', 'Jiang, Zujun', 'Xu, Na', 'Lin, Ren', 'Ye, Jieyu', 'Lin, Dongjun', 'Sun, Jing', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Wang, Yu', 'Liu, Qifa']","['Yu S', 'Huang F', 'Fan Z', 'Xuan L', 'Nie D', 'Xu Y', 'Yang T', 'Wang S', 'Jiang Z', 'Xu N', 'Lin R', 'Ye J', 'Lin D', 'Sun J', 'Huang X', 'Wang Y', 'Liu Q']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanhai Hospital, Southern Medical University, Foshan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, No.107 Yanjiang West Road, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, No.87 Xiangya Road, Changsha, 410008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No.29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, No.1 Fupan Road, Guangzhou, 510180, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, No.111 Liuhua Road, Guangzhou, 510010, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, No.600 Tianhe Road, Guangzhou, 510000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No.11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No.11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China. ywyw3172@sina.com."", 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No.1838 North Guangzhou Avenue, Guangzhou, 510515, China. liuqifa628@163.com.']",,['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200312,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/adverse effects/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC7068952,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HLA-matched sibling', '*Haploidentical', '*Refractory acute leukemia', '*Similar survival', '*Transplantation']",2020/03/14 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00859-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00859-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Mar 12;13(1):18. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00859-5.,"['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01883180', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02673008']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(TFDM) can inhibit myocardial ischemia by inhibiting oxidative stress. However, the effects of TFDM on astrocytes have not been investigated in vitro. The current study aimed to explore whether TFDM protects astrocytes against H2O2-induced apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway. METHODS: The human glioma cell line U87 was used to investigate the ability of TFDM to protect astrocytes against H2O2-induced apoptosis. The cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry were used to detect cell viability, apoptosis, MMP, Ca(2+) influx and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malonic dialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured by ELISA. In addition, protein and mRNA expression changes were detected by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: TFDM (0.78~200 mug/ml) had limited cytotoxic effects on the viability of U87 cells. Compared with the model group (treated with H2O2 only), cells treated with medium- and high-dose TFDM exhibited reduced MDA concentrations (P < 0.05) and ROS production (P < 0.05) and decreased MMP (P < 0.05) and reduced apoptosis (P < 0.05). The percentage of annexin V-FITC-stained cells was markedly suppressed by TFDM, confirming its anti-apoptotic properties. WB results showed that protein expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Caspase-12, and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) was reduced in the TFDM group compared with that in the model group (P < 0.05) and that expression of these proteins was normalized by TFDM treatment in a dose-dependent manner. According to RT-qPCR results, TFDM pretreatment resulted in reduced mRNA expression of BAX, Caspase-9, Caspase-12, p38MAPK, and CaMKII and increased mRNA expression of mTOR compared with the model group. CONCLUSIONS: The current study revealed the protective effects of TFDM on U87 cells under oxidative stress conditions through the inhibition of a mitochondria-dependent pathway that is associated with the CaMKII/P38MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways.","['Zheng, Rui-Fang', 'Du, Yan-Wen', 'Zeng, Cheng', 'Wang, Hui-Fang', 'Xing, Jian-Guo', 'Xu, Ming']","['Zheng RF', 'Du YW', 'Zeng C', 'Wang HF', 'Xing JG', 'Xu M']","['Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Uighur Medicines, Xinjiang Institute of Materia Medica, 140 Xinhua South Road, Urumchi, 830004, Xinjiang, China.', 'Xinjiang Medical University, Urumchi, 830000, Xinjiang, China.', 'Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Uighur Medicines, Xinjiang Institute of Materia Medica, 140 Xinhua South Road, Urumchi, 830004, Xinjiang, China.', 'Xinjiang Medical University, Urumchi, 830000, Xinjiang, China.', 'Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Uighur Medicines, Xinjiang Institute of Materia Medica, 140 Xinhua South Road, Urumchi, 830004, Xinjiang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tong jia Lane, P.O.

However, the genetic mechanisms that give rise to ALL remain poorly understood. METHODS: Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in matched germline and tumor samples from 140 pediatric Chinese patients with ALL, we landscaped the gene mutations and estimated the mutation frequencies in this disease. RESULTS: Our results showed that the top driver oncogenes having a mutation prevalence over 5% in childhood ALL included KRAS (8.76%), NRAS (6.4%), FLT3 (5.7%) and KMT2D (5.0%). While the most frequently mutated genes were KRAS, NRAS and FLT3 in B cell ALL (B-ALL), the most common mutations were enriched in NOTCH1 (23.1%), FBXW7 (23.1%) and PHF6 (11.5%) in T cell ALL (T-ALL). These mutant genes are involved in key molecular processes, including the Ras pathway, the Notch pathway, epigenetic modification, and cell-cycle regulation. Strikingly, more than 50% of mutations occurred in the high-hyperdiploid (HeH) ALL existed in Ras pathway, especially FLT3 (20%). We also found that the epigenetic regulator gene KMT2D, which is frequently mutated in ALL, may be involved in driving leukemia transformation, as evidenced by an in vitro functional assay. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study provides further insights into the genetic basis of ALL and shows that Ras mutations are predominant in childhood ALL, especially in the high-hyperdiploid subtype in our research.","['Zhang, Honghong', 'Wang, Hongsheng', 'Qian, Xiaowen', 'Gao, Shuai', 'Xia, Jieqi', 'Liu, Junwen', 'Cheng, Yanqin', 'Man, Jie', 'Zhai, Xiaowen']","['Zhang H', 'Wang H', 'Qian X', 'Gao S', 'Xia J', 'Liu J', 'Cheng Y', 'Man J', 'Zhai X']","[""Department of Hematology oncology, Children's hospital of Fudan university, 399 Wanyuan Road, Shanghai, China."", ""Clinical laboratory center, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology oncology, Children's hospital of Fudan university, 399 Wanyuan Road, Shanghai, China."", ""Clinical laboratory center, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology oncology, Children's hospital of Fudan university, 399 Wanyuan Road, Shanghai, China."", ""Clinical laboratory center, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Clinical laboratory center, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Clinical laboratory center, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Clinical laboratory center, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology oncology, Children's hospital of Fudan university, 399 Wanyuan Road, Shanghai, China."", ""Clinical laboratory center, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology oncology, Children's hospital of Fudan university, 399 Wanyuan Road, Shanghai, China."", ""Clinical laboratory center, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology oncology, Children's hospital of Fudan university, 399 Wanyuan Road, Shanghai, China. zhaixiaowendy@163.com."", ""Clinical laboratory center, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. zhaixiaowendy@163.com.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8127-3232'],['eng'],"['No.14411950603/Research Programs of the Shanghai Science and Technology', 'Commission Foundation', 'No. 201740011/Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning']",['Journal Article'],20200312,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PHF6 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'China', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Exons', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7/genetics', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mutation Rate', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC7068927,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Genomics', 'KMT2D', 'Molecular pathogenesis', 'Pediatrics']",2020/03/14 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2019/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-6709-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-6709-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Mar 12;20(1):211. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-6709-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Timely diagnosis is obligatory to ensure appropriate management and positive outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the mutational profile, clinical characteristics and outcome of ET and PMF patients in Pakistani population. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted between 2012 and 2017 at NIBD. Patients were diagnosed and risk stratified according to international recommendations. Response to treatment was assessed by IWG criteria. RESULTS: Of the total 137 patients analysed, 75 were ET and 62 were PMF. JAK2 positivity was seen in 51 cases (37.2%), CALR in 41 cases (29.9%), while triple-negative in 17 (12.4%) cases. None of the patients in the present study were MPL positive. Overall survival for patients with ET and PMF was 92.5 and 86.0% respectively and leukaemia free survival was 100 and 91.6% respectively, at a median follow-up of 12 months. Leukaemic transformation occurred in 6.5% of MF patients; among them, JAK2 mutation was frequently found. Molecular mutations did not influence the OS in ET whereas in PMF, OS was shortest in the triple-negative PMF group as compared to the JAK2 and CALR positive patient groups. CONCLUSION: This study shows a different spectrum of molecular mutations in ET and PMF patients in Pakistani population as compared to other Asian countries. Similarly, the risk of leukaemic transformation in ET and PMF is relatively lower in our population of patients. The factors responsible for these phenotypic and genotypic differences need to be analysed in large scale studies with longer follow-up of patients.","['Zaidi, Uzma', 'Sufaida, Gul', 'Rashid, Munazza', 'Kaleem, Bushra', 'Maqsood, Sidra', 'Mukry, Samina Naz', 'Khan, Rifat Zubair Ahmed', 'Munzir, Saima', 'Borhany, Munira', 'Shamsi, Tahir Sultan']","['Zaidi U', 'Sufaida G', 'Rashid M', 'Kaleem B', 'Maqsood S', 'Mukry SN', 'Khan RZA', 'Munzir S', 'Borhany M', 'Shamsi TS']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan. uzaidi26@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Clinical Research, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Clinical Research, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1593-196X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3153-0672']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20200312,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Pakistan', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC7069043,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'Essential thrombocythemia', 'Leukaemic free survival', 'Overall survival', 'Primary myelofibrosis']",2020/03/14 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2019/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-6700-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-6700-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Mar 12;20(1):205. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-6700-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some patients may never require treatment, whereas others relapse early after front line therapeutic approaches. Recent whole genome and whole exome sequencing studies have allowed a better understanding of CLL pathogenesis and the identification of genetic lesions with potential clinical relevance. Consistently, precision medicine plays a pivotal role in the treatment algorithm of CLL, since the integration of molecular biomarkers with the clinical features of the disease may guide treatment choices. Most CLL patients present at the time of diagnosis with an early stage disease and are managed with a watch and wait strategy. For CLL patients requiring therapy, the CLL treatment armamentarium includes both chemoimmunotherapy strategies and biological drugs. The efficacy of these treatment strategies relies upon specific molecular features of the disease. TP53 disruption (including both TP53 mutation and 17p deletion) is the strongest predictor of chemo-refractoriness, and the assessment of TP53 status is the first and most important decisional node in the first line treatment algorithm. The presence of TP53 disruption mandates treatment with biological drugs that inhibit the B cell receptor or, alternatively, the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) pathway and can, at least in part, circumvent the chemorefractoriness of TP53-disrupted patients. Beside TP53 disruption, the mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes also helps clinicians to improve treatment tailoring. In fact, patients carrying mutated IGHV genes in the absence of TP53 disruption experience a long-lasting and durable response to chemoimmunotherapy after fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) treatment with a survival superimposable to that of a matched general population. In contrast, patients with unmutated IGHV genes respond poorly to chemoimmunotherapy and deserve treatment with B cell receptor inhibitors. Minimal residual disease is also emerging as a relevant biomarker with potential clinical implications. Overall, precision medicine is now a mainstay in the management and treatment stratification of CLL. The identification of novel predictive biomarkers will allow further improvements in the treatment tailoring of this leukemia.","['Moia, Riccardo', 'Patriarca, Andrea', 'Schipani, Mattia', 'Ferri, Valentina', 'Favini, Chiara', 'Sagiraju, Sruthi', 'Al Essa, Wael', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Moia R', 'Patriarca A', 'Schipani M', 'Ferri V', 'Favini C', 'Sagiraju S', 'Al Essa W', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4415-2906'],['eng'],"['5 x 1000 No. 21198/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', ""PRIN; 2015ZMRFEA/Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca"", 'the AGING Project - Department of Excellence - DIMET, Universita del Piemonte', ""Orientale, Novara, Italy/Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della"", 'Ricerca', 'RF-2018-12365790/Ministero della Salute']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200310,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7139574,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'precision medicine', 'target therapy']",2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:01,['2020/03/14 06:00'],"['2020/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12030642 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12030642 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Mar 10;12(3). pii: cancers12030642. doi: 10.3390/cancers12030642.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether different types of TP53 mutations exert a uniformly poor outcome has not been investigated yet. Here, we addressed this issue by analyzing data of 1537 patients intensively treated within protocols of the German-Austrian AML study group. We classified TP53 mutations depending on their impact on protein structure and according to the evolutionary action (EAp53) score and the relative fitness score (RFS). In 98/1537 (6.4%) patients, 108 TP53 mutations were detected. While the discrimination depending on the protein structure and the EAp53 score did not show a survival difference, patients with low-risk and high-risk AML-specific RFS showed a different overall survival (OS; median, 12.9 versus 5.5 months, p = 0.017) and event-free survival (EFS; median, 7.3 versus 5.2 months, p = 0.054). In multivariable analyses adjusting for age, gender, white blood cell count, cytogenetic risk, type of AML, and TP53 variant allele frequency, these differences were statistically significant for both OS (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.15-4.0; p = 0.017) and EFS (HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.06-3.69; p = 0.033).

AML is a rare childhood cancer, relatively more frequent in girls, with distinct features in infancy. In the context of the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC), we examined the hypothesis that the association may vary by age, sex and disease subtype using data from 22 studies and a total of 3564 AML cases. METHODS: Pooled estimates by age, sex and overall for harmonised foetal growth markers in association with AML were calculated using the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century Project for 17 studies contributing individual-level data; meta-analyses were, thereafter, conducted with estimates provided ad hoc by five more studies because of administrative constraints. Subanalyses by AML subtype were also performed. RESULTS: A nearly 50% increased risk was observed among large-for-gestational-age infant boys (odds ratio [OR]: 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-2.14), reduced to 34% in boys aged <2 years (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.05-1.71) and 25% in boys aged 0-14 years (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.06-1.46). The association of large for gestational age became stronger in boys with M0/M1subtype (OR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.15-2.83). Large birth length for gestational age was also positively associated with AML (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.00-1.92) in boys. By contrast, there were null associations in girls, as well as with respect to associations of decelerated foetal growth markers. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated foetal growth was associated with AML, especially in infant boys and those with minimally differentiated leukaemia. Further cytogenetic research would shed light into the underlying mechanisms.","['Karalexi, Maria A', 'Dessypris, Nick', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Marcotte, Erin', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Heck, Julia E', 'Roman, Eve', 'Mueller, Beth A', 'Hansen, Johnni', 'Auvinen, Anssi', 'Lee, Pei-Chen', 'Schuz, Joachim', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Mora, Ana M', 'Dockerty, John D', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Wang, Rong', 'Bonaventure, Audrey', 'Kane, Eleanor', 'Doody, David R', 'Erdmann, Friederike', 'Kang, Alice Y', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'Petridou, Eleni Th']","['Karalexi MA', 'Dessypris N', 'Ma X', 'Spector LG', 'Marcotte E', 'Clavel J', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Heck JE', 'Roman E', 'Mueller BA', 'Hansen J', 'Auvinen A', 'Lee PC', 'Schuz J', 'Magnani C', 'Mora AM', 'Dockerty JD', 'Scheurer ME', 'Wang R', 'Bonaventure A', 'Kane E', 'Doody DR', 'Erdmann F', 'Kang AY', 'Metayer C', 'Milne E', 'Petridou ET']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, Cancer Prevention and Control, Yale Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Yale School of Medicine, CT, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'CRESS, UMR-S1153, INSERM, Paris-Descartes University, Villejuif, France; National Registry of Childhood Cancers, APHP, Hopital Paul-Brousse, CHU de Nancy, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, Heslington, York, United Kingdom.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Health Care Management, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Section of Environment and Radiation, Lyon, France.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Translational Medicine, CPO Piedmont and University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Central American Institute for Studies on Toxic Substances (IRET), Universidad Nacional, Heredia, Costa Rica.', 'Department of Preventative and Social Medicine, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', ""Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics Texas Children's Cancer Center, TX, USA."", 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, Cancer Prevention and Control, Yale Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Yale School of Medicine, CT, USA.', 'CRESS, UMR-S1153, INSERM, Paris-Descartes University, Villejuif, France.', 'Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, Heslington, York, United Kingdom.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Section of Environment and Radiation, Lyon, France; Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Childhood Cancer Research Group, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Center for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, WA, Australia.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece; Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

The study of the immune response in experimentally infected calves at an early stage of the disease development, synthesis of specific antibodies of classes G and M (IgG and IgM), diagnostic informativeness of detection of IgM in cattle leukemia is relevant and determines the purpose of this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples of blood and serum of cattle: animals experimentally infected with VLCRS, patients with cattle leukemia; control negative; specific to heterologous pathogens of cattle diseases. Indirect and sandwich variant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); commercial ELISA kits (IDEXX, USA; Hema LLC, FKP Kursk Biofactory Firm BIOK, Russia) for the detection of specific IgG and IgM for BLV in the agar gel immunodiffusion reaction (RID). RESULTS: The humoral immune response develops shortly after infection - by 1-8 weeks. IgM are detected starting from the 3(rd) day, and IgG from the 7th day after infection. Up to 97% of coincidence of positive results in RID and indirect variant of TF ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies to cattle IgM (IgMbovine) were found. DISCUSSION: The dynamics of the synthesis of antibodies of classes M and G to the glycoprotein gp 51 BLV has a dosedependent wave-like character, is consistent with the levels of increase / decrease in the absolute and relative number of leukocytes / blood lymphocytes of infected calves. FINDINGS: Serum specific IgM was detected starting 3 days after infection with BLV. Early detection of IgM in serum of cattle can be used as an additional test for the detection of sick animals.","['Gulyukin, M I', 'Kapustina, O V', 'Ezdakova, I Y', 'Valtsiferova, S V', 'Stepanova, T V', 'Anoyatbekov, M']","['Gulyukin MI', 'Kapustina OV', 'Ezdakova IY', 'Valtsiferova SV', 'Stepanova TV', 'Anoyatbekov M']","['Federal Scientific Centre VIEV, Moscow, 109428, Russian Federation.', 'Federal Scientific Centre VIEV, Moscow, 109428, Russian Federation.', 'Federal Scientific Centre VIEV, Moscow, 109428, Russian Federation.', 'Federal Scientific Centre VIEV, Moscow, 109428, Russian Federation.', 'Federal Scientific Centre VIEV, Moscow, 109428, Russian Federation.', 'Federal Scientific Centre VIEV, Moscow, 109428, Russian Federation.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7489-6175', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7382-8656', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8467-4920', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5731-8955', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9092-8045', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0180-0574']",['rus'],,['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Vopr Virusol,Voprosy virusologii,0417337,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*blood/virology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*blood/virology', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Lymphocytes/virology', 'Russia']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cattle', '*cattle leukemia', '*cattle leukemia virus', '*lymphocytosis', '*lymphosarcoma', '*monoclonal antibodies to IgMbovine', '*specific antibodies of classes G and M']",2019/01/01 00:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.36233/0507-4088-2019-64-4-173-177 [doi]'],ppublish,Vopr Virusol. 2019;64(4):173-177. doi: 10.36233/0507-4088-2019-64-4-173-177.,,,,['The authors declare no con fl ict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied THP-1 cells obtained from two major biorepositories. The two cell lines were closely related with a percentage match of short tandem repeat (STR) profiles ranging from 93.75% to 100%, depending on the algorithm used. Nevertheless, we found that the two cell lines presented discordant HLA type, cytogenetic aberrations and AML-related gene expression (including critical targets of MLL fusion). These discrepancies resulted mainly from loss of heterozygosity (LOH) involving five chromosomal regions. In view of their aberrant expression of key ""leukemia"" genes (e.g., LIN28B, MEIS1 and SPARC), we argue that one of the THP-1 cell lines may not be a reliable model for studying leukemia. Their defective expression of HLA molecules and abnormal adhesion properties is also a caveat for studies of antigen presentation. In a more general perspective, our findings show that seemingly minor discrepancies in STR profiles among cell lines may be the sign of major genetic drift, of sufficient magnitude to affect the reliability of cell line-based research.","['Noronha, Nandita', 'Ehx, Gregory', 'Meunier, Marie-Christine', 'Laverdure, Jean-Philippe', 'Theriault, Catherine', 'Perreault, Claude']","['Noronha N', 'Ehx G', 'Meunier MC', 'Laverdure JP', 'Theriault C', 'Perreault C']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'HLA Laboratory, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4611-1470', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7018-1770', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9453-7383']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200319,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'THP-1 Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA copy number variations', '*THP-1 cells', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*histocompatibility', '*reproducibility of results', '*transcriptomics']",2020/03/13 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32967 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2020 Oct 1;147(7):2000-2006. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32967.

METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted using data from the Hospital Pharmacy of Siena (HPS) and the Regional Administrative Database of Tuscany (RAD). Patients aged >/=18 years with >/=1 rituximab administration recorded between January 2012 and June 2016 were identified in the HPS database. Anonymized patient-level data were linked to RAD. Rituximab utilization during the first year of treatment was described using HPS. Hospital diagnoses of adverse infectious events that occurred during the first year of follow-up and four-year survival were observed using RAD. RESULTS: A total of 311 new users of rituximab were identified: 264 patients received rituximab for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 47 were treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Among new users with one complete year of follow-up (n = 203) over 95% received rituximab as the first-line treatment, and approximately 70% of them received 5-8 doses. No patient in the CLL group received >8 administrations. Four-year survival was approximately 70% in both CLL and NHL patients. Sepsis was the most frequent infectious event observed (5.1%). CONCLUSION: HPS and RAD provided complementary information on rituximab utilization, demonstrating their potential for future pharmacoepidemiological studies on antineoplastic medications administered in the Italian hospital setting. Overall, this general description of the real-world utilization of rituximab in patients treated for NHL and CLL at UHS was in line with treatment guidelines and current knowledge on the rituximab safety profile.","['Roberto, Giuseppe', 'Spini, Andrea', 'Bartolini, Claudia', 'Moscatelli, Valentino', 'Barchielli, Alessandro', 'Paoletti, Davide', 'Giorgi, Silvano', 'Fabbri, Alberto', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Donnini, Sandra', 'Gini, Rosa', 'Ziche, Marina']","['Roberto G', 'Spini A', 'Bartolini C', 'Moscatelli V', 'Barchielli A', 'Paoletti D', 'Giorgi S', 'Fabbri A', 'Bocchia M', 'Donnini S', 'Gini R', 'Ziche M']","['Agenzia Regionale di Sanita della Toscana, Firenze, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Science, Surgery and Neuroscience, University of Siena, and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy.', 'Agenzia Regionale di Sanita della Toscana, Firenze, Italy.', 'Department of Life sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Istituto per lo Studio la Prevenzione e la Rete Oncologica, Firenze, Italy.', 'Farmacia Oncologica, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy.', 'Farmacia Oncologica, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese and University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese and University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Life sciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Agenzia Regionale di Sanita della Toscana, Firenze, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Science, Surgery and Neuroscience, University of Siena, and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9564-214X'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200312,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Administrative Claims, Healthcare/statistics & numerical data', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Drug Utilization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infections/chemically induced/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacy Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC7067445,,,,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0229973 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-30012 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Mar 12;15(3):e0229973. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0229973. eCollection 2020.,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, combination treatment strategies, e.g., ATO with other agents, have shown promising results against different diseases. Here, we introduce in depth the latest evidence and detailed insights into ATO-mediated cures for APL by targeting PML/RARalpha chimeric protein, followed by the preclinical and clinical efficacy of ATO on various non-APL malignancies and solid tumors. Likewise, the antiviral activity of ATO against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) was also discussed briefly.

METHODS: Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-34a in bone marrow of 40 patients with initial treatment of AML, 22 patients with complete remission AML, 13 patients with refractory recurrence, 20 patients with non-hematological tumors and healthy persons. Pearson's correlation was performed to analyze the correlation between the expression level of miR-34a and clinical indicators in patients. RESULTS: The expression of miR-34a in the initial treatment group, complete remission group and refractory relapse group of AML patients was higher than that in the control group. In addition, the expression of miR-34a in the complete remission group was higher than that in the initial treatment group. Moreover, the expression of miR-34a in the refractory relapse group was lower than that in the initial treatment group. The expression level of miR-34a in initial treatment AML group was negatively correlated with the number of bone marrow primary immature cells, but not with the number of peripheral blood leukocytes, platelet count, hemoglobin content, age, gender, and chromosomal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of miR-34a in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with AML was down-regulated and related to tumor load. It may play an important role in the occurrence and development of leukemia and may become a new molecular marker for the diagnosis of AML.","['Liu, Xiaolei', 'Li, Hao']","['Liu X', 'Li H']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,,,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190730 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2020 Mar 1;66(3). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190730.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is possible to monitor treatment by molecular testing for BCR-ABL. The lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) is a commonly used marker associated with prognosis in various neoplasms. This study was performed to evaluate the relevance of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute monocyte count (AMC), and LMR in predicting molecular response status in patients with chronic phase CML. METHODS: Samples submitted to our hematology laboratory for BCR-ABL testing between April 2012 and October 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Concurrent hemogram testing together with the results of quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were noted. Data were grouped according to molecular response status and the ALC, AMC, and LMR were compared among patient groups. RESULTS: A total of 224 samples from 95 patients were included in the study. Analysis revealed differences between groups when newly diagnosed patients were compared with patients undergoing treatment, regardless of response status. However, analyzing the groups according to molecular response status failed to reveal differences in ALC, AMC, or LMR. CONCLUSIONS: ALC, AMC, and LMR are not potential biomarkers for predicting molecular response status in patients with chronic phase CML.","['Pepedil-Tanrikulu, Funda', 'Buyukkurt, Nurhilal', 'Korur, Asli', 'Sariturk, Cagla', 'Aytan, Pelin', 'Boga, Can', 'Ozdogu, Hakan', 'Kozanoglu, Ilknur']","['Pepedil-Tanrikulu F', 'Buyukkurt N', 'Korur A', 'Sariturk C', 'Aytan P', 'Boga C', 'Ozdogu H', 'Kozanoglu I']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190628 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2020 Mar 1;66(3). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190628.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR4) and its ligand stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) are important players involved in cross-talk between leukemia cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The aim to study the association between the immunohistochemical CXCR4 expression and the clinical outcome of AML in adult Egyptian patients. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients suffering from AML were recruited for this study, with an age range from 18 to 60 years and presenting from January 2013 to March 2017. All patients were subjected to complete blood count, BM aspiration, immunophenotyping, BM trephine biopsy, immunohistochemical staining with CXCR4 McAb and cytogenetics when feasible. RESULTS: CXCR4 was widely expressed (55.2%) among the studied patients. There was a significant relationship between CXCR4 and patients' outcomes. Fifteen (71.4%) patients who died were CXCR4 positive. The estimated mean time until death among CXCR4 negative cases was 37.6 +/- 4.04 months which was longer than that of CXCR4 positive cases who had mean of 20.04 +/- 4.9 months p = 0.016. The risk for death among CXCR4 positive cases was higher than CXCR4 negative cases with hazard ratio (HR) = 2.147 (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CXCR4 was expressed in a subset of AML patients and was associated with poor prognosis. CXCR4 expression appears to be an independent prognostic factor for survival in a heterogeneous group of AML patients.","['Rady, Asmhan S', 'Badawy, Ragia H', 'Gamal, Basma M El', 'Darwish, Amira D', 'Aziz, Rania S Abdel', 'Gammal, Mosaad El', 'Goweda, Reda A']","['Rady AS', 'Badawy RH', 'Gamal BME', 'Darwish AD', 'Aziz RSA', 'Gammal ME', 'Goweda RA']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Chemokine CXCL12/analysis/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', '*Receptors, CXCR4/analysis/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190725 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2020 Mar 1;66(3). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.190725.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These masses are complex to manage as they have a risk of compression to surrounding structures. Many of these children have to be managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Hence we sought to evaluate the local epidemiology of malignant mediastinal masses in children and their clinical presentation, and identified factors associated with ICU admission so that at-risk patients may be identified early. METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of institutional case records of 56 children below 18 years of age from 2000 to 2015 with a malignant mediastinal mass. We collected data on their presenting symptoms, clinical signs, radiological investigations, treatment and correlated these factors with admission to our ICU. RESULTS: Lymphoma was most common diagnosis, comprising 37 children (66.0%). There were 6 patients with neuroblastoma (10.7%), 3 patients with germ-cell tumour (5.4%) and 10 patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (17.9%). Overall, 21 patients (37.5%) had to be admitted to the ICU. Almost all patients (98.2%) were symptomatic on presentation, of which lymphadenopathy was the most common (69.6%). Factors that are significantly associated with ICU admission are stridor, pericardial effusion and need for pleural drainage. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant mediastinal masses in children in our institution range from leukaemias and lymphomas to germ cell tumours and neuroblastomas, of which almost all are symptomatic. These children have a risk of cardiorespiratory collapse and many of them require intensive care. We identified factors that are associated with ICU admission, with the aim of early intervention of at-risk cases.","['Lee, Shawn Hr', 'Oh, Bernice Lz', 'Kimpo, Miriam', 'Quah, Thuan C']","['Lee SH', 'Oh BL', 'Kimpo M', 'Quah TC']","['Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Health System, Singapore."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Health System, Singapore."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Health System, Singapore."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Health System, Singapore.""]",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7161-3782'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200312,Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', '*Leukemia', '*Mediastinal Diseases', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore/epidemiology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'intensive care', 'leukaemia', 'lymphoma', 'mediastinal mass']",2020/03/13 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jpc.14808 [doi]'],ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 2020 Jul;56(7):1039-1045. doi: 10.1111/jpc.14808.

Microtransplantation (MST) refers to infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells without substantial engraftment. MST has been shown to improve clinical outcomes compared with chemotherapy alone. This is the first trial reporting on broad correlative studies to define immunologic mechanisms of action of MST in older AML patients. Older patients with newly diagnosed AML were eligible for enrollment, receiving induction chemotherapy with cytarabine (100 mg/m2) on days 1-7 and idarubicin (12 mg/m2) on days 1-3 (7 + 3). MST was administered 24 hours later. Patients with complete response (CR) were eligible for consolidation with high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) and a second cycle of MST. Responses were evaluated according to standard criteria per NCCN. Immune correlative studies were performed. Sixteen patients were enrolled and received 7 + 3 and MST (median age 73 years). Nine (56%) had high-risk and seven (44%) had standard-risk cytogenetics. Ten episodes of CRS were observed. No cases of GVHD or treatment-related mortality were reported. Event-free survival (EFS) was 50% at 6 months and 19% at 1 year. Overall survival (OS) was 63% at 6 months and 44% at 1 year. Donor microchimerism was not detected. Longitudinal changes were noted in NGS, TCR sequencing, and cytokine assays. Addition of MST to induction and consolidation chemotherapy was well tolerated in older AML patients. Inferior survival outcomes in our study may be attributed to a higher proportion of very elderly patients with high-risk features. Potential immunologic mechanisms of activity of MST include attenuation of inflammatory cytokines and emergence of tumor-specific T cell clones.","['Sung, Anthony D', 'Jauhari, Shekeab', 'Siamakpour-Reihani, Sharareh', 'Rao, Arati V', 'Staats, Janet', 'Chan, Cliburn', 'Meyer, Everett', 'Gadi, Vijayakrishna K', 'Nixon, Andrew B', 'Lyu, Jing', 'Xie, Jichun', 'Bohannon, Lauren', 'Li, Zhiguo', 'Hourigan, Christopher S', 'Dillon, Laura W', 'Wong, Hong Yuen', 'Shelby, Rebecca', 'Diehl, Louis', 'de Castro, Carlos', 'LeBlanc, Thomas', 'Brander, Danielle', 'Erba, Harry', 'Galal, Ahmed', 'Stefanovic, Alexandra', 'Chao, Nelson', 'Rizzieri, David A']","['Sung AD', 'Jauhari S', 'Siamakpour-Reihani S', 'Rao AV', 'Staats J', 'Chan C', 'Meyer E', 'Gadi VK', 'Nixon AB', 'Lyu J', 'Xie J', 'Bohannon L', 'Li Z', 'Hourigan CS', 'Dillon LW', 'Wong HY', 'Shelby R', 'Diehl L', 'de Castro C', 'LeBlanc T', 'Brander D', 'Erba H', 'Galal A', 'Stefanovic A', 'Chao N', 'Rizzieri DA']","['Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Kite Pharma, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3765-641X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2837-443X']",['eng'],"['P30 AG028716/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20200330,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Allografts', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', '*Induction Chemotherapy', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Risk Factors']",PMC7433709,['NIHMS1577739'],,,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25781 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Jun;95(6):662-671. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25781.

Among extranodal localizations, cardiac involvement is extremely rare: to our knowledge, there are no findings reported in the literature of concomitant B-CLL diagnosis in the context of atrial myxoma (so-called collision tumours) and the best strategy to treat these malignancies is unclear. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 67-year-old woman diagnosed with B-CLL and atrial myxoma. Our patient was cardiologically symptomless and the cardiac mass was an incidental finding. The cardiac tumor appeared several years after B-CLL diagnosis. Histologic examination of the cardiac mass, removed in the suspicion of an atrial myxoma, revealed a lymphoid focus of B-CLL. The patient underwent surgery and subsequent systemic therapy for B-CLL. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant presence of B-CLL in the context of an atrial myxoma is extremely rare. The best strategy to treat these cardiac hematologic malignancies is unclear.","['Lolli, Ginevra', 'Broccoli, Alessandro', 'Stefoni, Vittorio', 'Argnani, Lisa', 'Leone, Ornella', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi']","['Lolli G', 'Broccoli A', 'Stefoni V', 'Argnani L', 'Leone O', 'Cavo M', 'Zinzani PL']","['Institute of Haematology ""L. e A.

However, after initial approval, subsequent trials identified specific immune-mediated and infectious toxicity that led to a reduced use and stopped the further development of this agent. PI3K inhibition as a treatment paradigm fell out of favor compared to other developments such as BTK or BCL2 inhibitors. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the experience with approved PI3Ki, including long-term experience, and highlights the current PI3Ki developments in CLL, B-cell and T-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. EXPERT OPINION: With careful monitoring and prophylaxis usage of the first-generation PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, in the approved indications, it is safe and remains an option in higher line therapy after the failure of other novel agents and/or chemoimmunotherapy. New developments with next-generation PI3K inhibitors of improved tolerability and sustained efficacy reignited the treatment principle and already led to newly approved therapeutic options for patients. Certainly, the authors here believe that PI3K inhibitors as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents is currently a rapidly evolving field in cancer treatment.","['Kienle, Dirk L', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Kienle DL', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University , Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology/Hematology, Kantonsspital Graubunden , Chur, Switzerland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University , Ulm, Germany.', 'Klinik Fur Innere Medizin I, Universitatsklinikum Des Saarlandes , Homburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200312,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'NHL', 'PI3K inhibitors', 'idelalisib', 'umbralisib']",2020/03/13 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2020.1737010 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2020 Jun;21(8):917-929. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2020.1737010.

However, it is sometimes seen in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a T cell malignancy caused by infection with human T cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-1), which is frequently accompanied by cutaneous lesions. However, the detailed clinicopathological characteristics of the dermatopathic reaction of lymph nodes in ATLL patients and HTLV-1 carriers, addressed in this study, remains to be clarified. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed 18 nodal lesions with dermatopathic reaction in HTLV-1 carriers. Axillary and inguinal lymph nodes were the primary affected tissues. Three cases with atypical lymphoid cell infiltration were defined as ATLL with dermatopathic reaction (ATLL-D), showing an abnormal T cell immunophenotype and T cell monoclonality. Two of the three ATLL-D patients died 14 and 7 months after diagnosis (the third case had a very short follow-up). The other 15 patients were indistinguishable from reactive lesions and were defined as HTLV-1-associated lymphadenitis with dermatopathic reaction (HAL-D). They showed an indolent clinical course, with only one case eventually transforming to aggressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Lymph node lesions accompanied by dermatopathic reaction in HTLV1 carriers represent a spectrum that includes reactive and neoplastic conditions. HAL-D should be distinguished from ATLL-D, especially to avoid overtreatment.","['Chinen, Shigeki', 'Miyagi, Takuya', 'Murakami, Yoshiya', 'Takatori, Mitsuyoshi', 'Sakihama, Shugo', 'Nakazato, Iwao', 'Kariya, Yoshiyuki', 'Yamaguchi, Sayaka', 'Takahashi, Kenzo', 'Karube, Kennosuke']","['Chinen S', 'Miyagi T', 'Murakami Y', 'Takatori M', 'Sakihama S', 'Nakazato I', 'Kariya Y', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Takahashi K', 'Karube K']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', ""Department of Pathology, Okinawa Prefectural Nanbu Medical Center and Children's Medical Center, Okinawa, Japan."", 'Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1205-858X'],['eng'],"['The Japanese Society of Hematology Research Grant', 'Grants-in-aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) 1/Ministry of Education, Culture,', 'Sports, Science and Technology of Japan', 'Japan Leukemia Research Fund', 'Mochida Memorial Foundation for Medical and Pharmaceutical Research', 'Yasuda Memorial Medical Foundation', 'Ichiro Kanehara Foundation for the Promotion of Medical Sciences and Medical Care', 'Okinawa Internal Medicine Research Promotion Society', 'Okinawa prefecture']",['Journal Article'],20200618,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",PMC7383570,,['NOTNLM'],"['adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma', 'dermatopathic reaction', 'human T cell leukaemia virus type 1', 'immunophenotype', 'prognosis']",2020/03/13 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.14102 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2020 Jul;77(1):133-143. doi: 10.1111/his.14102.

The present study aimed to explore Tanshinone IIA (TIIA) effects on OCI-AML3 and the involvement of the MAPK signaling pathway and miR-497 in TIIA-mediated effects. Cell growth percentage was detected using a cell counting kit. Expression of miR-497 was detected by qPCR. Phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK and p38 were assessed using western blot. The growth percentage of OCI-AML3 decreased and the effected time increased with increasing TIIA concentration. The miR-497 was upregulated and the p-ERK1/2 was decreased when the TIIA added. TIIA cannot influence the p-ERK1/2. Hence, the proliferation of OCI-AML3 cells was raising. However, when the p-ERK1/2 was inhibited, there no influence on the miR-497 expression after TIIA added. TIIA upregulates miR-497, and decrease the p-ERK1/2 expression, when TIIA simulated OCI-AML3 cell in vitro.

With increasing age senescent cells accumulate throughout the body, including the bone marrow and this has been associated with a number of age-related pathologies including malignancies. It has been shown that the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) creates a pro-tumoural environment that supports proliferation and survival of malignant cells. Understanding the role of senescent cells in tumor development better may help us to identify new treatment targets to impair tumor survival and reduce treatment resistance. In this review, we will specifically discuss the role of senescence in the aging bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Many BM disorders are age-related diseases and highly dependent on the BM microenvironment. Despite advances in drug development the prognosis particularly for older patients remains poor and new treatment approaches are needed to improve outcomes for patients. In this review, we will focus on the relationship of senescence and hematological malignancies, how senescence promotes cancer development and how malignant cells induce senescence.","['Hellmich, Charlotte', 'Moore, Jamie A', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'Rushworth, Stuart A']","['Hellmich C', 'Moore JA', 'Bowles KM', 'Rushworth SA']","['Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200225,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7052485,,['NOTNLM'],"['SASP', 'cancer microenvironment', 'leukemia', 'p16INK4a', 'senescence']",2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/13 06:01,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00230 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Feb 25;10:230. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00230. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Hellmich, Moore, Bowles and Rushworth.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To merge these into one high-throughput, highly multiplexed, single-cell assay, we quantify cell morphological features by their underlying, antibody-measurable molecular components, which empowers mass cytometers to 'see' like pathologists. When applied to 71 diverse clinical samples, single-cell morphometric profiling reveals robust and distinct patterns of 'morphometric' markers for each major cell type. Individually, lamin B1 highlights acute leukemias, lamin A/C helps distinguish normal from neoplastic mature T cells, and VAMP-7 recapitulates light-cytometric side scatter. Combined with machine learning, morphometric markers form intuitive visualizations of normal and neoplastic cellular distribution and differentiation. When recalibrated for myelomonocytic blast enumeration, this approach is superior to flow cytometry and comparable to expert microscopy, bypassing years of specialized training. The contextualization of traditional surface markers on independent morphometric frameworks permits more sensitive and automated diagnosis of complex hematopoietic diseases.","['Tsai, Albert G', 'Glass, David R', 'Juntilla, Marisa', 'Hartmann, Felix J', 'Oak, Jean S', 'Fernandez-Pol, Sebastian', 'Ohgami, Robert S', 'Bendall, Sean C']","['Tsai AG', 'Glass DR', 'Juntilla M', 'Hartmann FJ', 'Oak JS', 'Fernandez-Pol S', 'Ohgami RS', 'Bendall SC']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Immunology Graduate Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. bendall@stanford.edu.', 'Immunology Graduate Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. bendall@stanford.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1881-3440', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1341-2453']",['eng'],"['DRG-2017-09/DRCRF/Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation/United States', '1U24CA224309-01/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National', 'Institutes of Health (NIH)/International', '1R01AG057915-01/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National', 'Institutes of Health (NIH)/International', '1DP2OD022550-01/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National', 'Institutes of Health (NIH)/International', '5U19AI116484-02/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National', 'Institutes of Health (NIH)/International', '1-R00-GM104148-01/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National', 'Institutes of Health (NIH)/International', 'U19 AI116484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UH3 CA246633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA224309/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01AG056287-01/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National', 'Institutes of Health (NIH)/International', 'U19 AI104209/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG056287/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG057915/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 GM104148/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 EB024246/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200311,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Lamins)', '0 (R-SNARE Proteins)', '0 (VAMP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lamins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'R-SNARE Proteins/metabolism', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods']",PMC7301910,['NIHMS1597666'],,,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41591-020-0783-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41591-020-0783-x [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2020 Mar;26(3):408-417. doi: 10.1038/s41591-020-0783-x.

Here, we identify a novel synergistic interaction of the BET inhibitor JQ1 with the PI3Kalpha-specific inhibitor BYL719 to trigger mitochondrial apoptosis and to suppress tumor growth in models of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). RNA-Seq revealed that JQ1/BYL719 co-treatment shifts the overall balance of BCL-2 family gene expression towards apoptosis and upregulates expression of BMF, BCL2L11 (BIM), and PMAIP1 (NOXA) while downregulating BCL2L1 (BCL-xL). These changes were confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of RNA-Seq data followed by validation qRT-PCR and western blot identified MYC and FOXO3a as potential transcription factors (TFs) upstream of the observed gene expression pattern. Immunoprecipitation (IP) studies showed that JQ1/BYL719-stimulated increase in BIM expression enhances the neutralization of antiapoptotic BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1. This promotes the activation of BAK and BAX and caspase-dependent apoptosis, as (1) individual silencing of BMF, BIM, NOXA, BAK, or BAX, (2) overexpression of BCL-2 or MCL-1 or (3) the caspase inhibitor N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-Me) fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) all rescue JQ1/BYL719-induced cell death. In conclusion, co-inhibition of BET proteins and PI3Kalpha cooperatively induces mitochondrial apoptosis by proapoptotic re-balancing of BCL-2 family proteins.

Thus, the object of this study was to generate melphalan derivatives with improved cytotoxic activity in human cancer cells (RPMI8226, HL60 and THP1). Several melphalan derivatives were synthesised, modified in their two important functional groups. Nine analogues were tested, including melphalan compounds modified: only at the amino group, by replacing the amine with an amidine group containing a morpholine ring (MOR-MEL) or with an amidino group and dipropyl chain (DIPR-MEL); only at the carboxyl group to form methyl and ethyl esters of melphalan (EM-MEL, EE-MEL); and in a similar manner at both functional groups (EM-MOR-MEL, EE-MOR-MEL, EM-DIPR-MEL, EE-DIPR-MEL). Melphalan derivatives were evaluated for cytotoxicity (resazurin viability assay), genotoxicity (comet assay) and the ability to induce apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling, TUNEL, phosphatidylserine externalisation, chromatin condensation, activity of caspases 3/7, 8 and 9 and intracellular concentration of calcium ions) in comparison with the parent drug. Almost all derivatives, with the exception of MOR-MEL and DIPR-MEL, were found to be more toxic than melphalan in all cell lines evaluated. Treatment of cultures with the derivatives generated a significant higher level of DNA breaks compared to those treated with melphalan, especially after longer incubation times. In addition, all the melphalan derivatives demonstrated a high apoptosis-inducing ability in acute monocytic and promyelocytic leukemia cells. This study showed that the mechanism of action of the tested compounds differed depending on the cell line, and allowed the selection of the most active compounds for further, more detailed investigations.","['Gajek, Arkadiusz', 'Poczta, Anastazja', 'Lukawska, Malgorzata', 'Cecuda-Adamczewska, Violetta', 'Tobiasz, Joanna', 'Marczak, Agnieszka']","['Gajek A', 'Poczta A', 'Lukawska M', 'Cecuda-Adamczewska V', 'Tobiasz J', 'Marczak A']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236, Lodz, Poland. arkadiusz.gajek@biol.uni.lodz.pl.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236, Lodz, Poland.', 'LUKASIEWICZ Research Network-Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics, 5 Staroscinska St., 02-516, Warsaw, Poland.', 'LUKASIEWICZ Research Network-Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics, 5 Staroscinska St., 02-516, Warsaw, Poland.', 'LUKASIEWICZ Research Network-Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics, 5 Staroscinska St., 02-516, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236, Lodz, Poland.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200311,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Development', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphatidylserines']",PMC7066245,,,,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/11/21 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-61436-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-61436-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Mar 11;10(1):4479. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-61436-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequently affected molecules are involved in DNA methylations, chromatin modification, RNA splicing, transcription, signal transduction, cohesin regulation, and DNA repair. These mutations show strong positive and negative correlations with each other, suggesting the presence of functional interactions between mutations, which dictate disease progression. Because these mutations are associated with disease phenotype, drug response, and clinical outcomes, it is essential to be familiar with MDS genetics not only for better understanding of MDS pathogenesis but also for management of patients.","['Ogawa, Seishi']",['Ogawa S'],"['Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci,"Proceedings of the Japan Academy.

CTPS1-deficient patients display severe bacterial and viral infections. CTPS1 is responsible for CTP nucleotide de novo production involved in DNA/RNA synthesis. Herein, we characterized in depth lymphocyte defects associated with CTPS1 deficiency. Immune phenotyping performed in 7 patients showed absence or low numbers of mucosal-associated T cells, invariant NKT cells, memory B cells, and NK cells, whereas other subsets were normal. Proliferation and IL-2 secretion by T cells in response to TCR activation were markedly decreased in all patients, while other T cell effector functions were preserved. The CTPS1T566Dfs26X mutant protein was found to be hypomorphic, resulting in 80%-90% reduction of protein expression and CTPS activity in cells of patients. Inactivation of CTPS1 in a T cell leukemia fully abolished cell proliferation. Expression of CTPS1T566Dfs26X failed to restore proliferation of CTPS1-deficient leukemia cells to normal, except when forcing its expression to a level comparable to that of WT CTPS1. This indicates that CTPS1T566Dfs26X retained normal CTPS activity, and thus the loss of function of CTPS1T566Dfs26X is completely attributable to protein instability. This study supports that CTPS1 represents an attractive therapeutic target to selectively inhibit pathological T cell proliferation, including lymphoma.","['Martin, Emmanuel', 'Minet, Norbert',

B-ALL accounts for about 12% of all childhood and adult leukemias diagnosed in developed countries, and 60% of those diagnosed are patients younger than 20 years old. As the most common cancer in children (25% of all cases) with a peak incidence in patients between the ages of two and five years, with a second, smaller peak in the elderly, the factors predisposing children and adults to ALL remain largely unknown. Herein we present an eight-year-old male patient diagnosed with B-ALL. Chromosome studies of 20 G-banded metaphases of the bone marrow detected an abnormal male karyotype with loss of 9p [i(9)(q10)] and loss of 17p [der(17)(?::17q11.2->17p11.2::17p11.2->17qter)] within the context of a complex karyotype in eight metaphase cells. Four of these abnormal metaphases showed additional material of unknown origin on chromosome 12 at p11.2 [add(12)(p11.2)]. Metaphase FISH analysis was crucial to characterize such complex chromosomal abnormalities, underscoring the importance of molecular cytogenetics in characterizing complex karyotypes in this hematological malignancy.","['Nguyen, Andrew M', 'Tse, Vincent', 'Lapp, Katherine', 'Yang, Grace', 'Cunnien, Karen', 'Serk, Diane', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Nguyen AM', 'Tse V', 'Lapp K', 'Yang G', 'Cunnien K', 'Serk D', 'Tirado CA']","['The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Chapter Los Angeles.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Chapter Los Angeles.', 'Allina Health, Inc., Minneapolis, MN.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Chapter Los Angeles.', 'Allina Health, Inc., Minneapolis, MN.', 'HPA, Minneapolis, MN.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Chapter Los Angeles.', 'Allina Health, Inc., Minneapolis, MN.', 'HPA, Minneapolis, MN.', 'The University of Minnesota, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Baylor Scott and White Health, Department of Pathology, Temple, TX.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,,,,,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/13 06:01,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/13 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2020;46(1):24-31.,,['Copyright(c) by the Association of Genetic Technologists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SK phosphorylates sphingosine producing the potent signaling molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). SKIP gene (SPHKAP) expression is silenced by hypermethylation of its promoter in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, why SKIP activity is silenced in primary AML cells is unclear. Here, we investigated the consequences of SKIP down-regulation in AML primary cells and the effects of SKIP re-expression in leukemic cell lines. Using targeted ultra-HPLC-tandem MS (UPLC-MS/MS), we measured sphingolipids (including S1P and ceramides) in AML and control cells. Primary AML cells had significantly lower SK activity and intracellular S1P concentrations than control cells, and SKIP-transfected leukemia cell lines exhibited increased SK activity. These findings show that SKIP re-expression enhances SK activity in leukemia cells. Furthermore, other bioactive sphingolipids such as ceramide were also down-regulated in primary AML cells. Of note, SKIP re-expression in leukemia cells increased ceramide levels 2-fold, inactivated the key signaling protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and increased apoptosis following serum deprivation or chemotherapy. These results indicate that SKIP down-regulation in AML reduces SK activity and ceramide levels, an effect that ultimately inhibits apoptosis in leukemia cells. The findings of our study contrast with previous results indicating that SKIP inhibits SK function in fibroblasts and therefore challenge the notion that SKIP always inhibits SK activity.","['Ghazaly, Essam A', 'Miraki-Moud, Farideh', 'Smith, Paul', 'Gnanaranjan, Chathunissa', 'Koniali, Lola', 'Oke, Adedayo', 'Saied, Marwa H', 'Petty, Robert', 'Matthews, Janet', 'Stronge, Randal', 'Joel, Simon P', 'Young, Bryan D', 'Gribben, John', 'Taussig, David C']","['Ghazaly EA', 'Miraki-Moud F', 'Smith P', 'Gnanaranjan C', 'Koniali L', 'Oke A', 'Saied MH', 'Petty R', 'Matthews J', 'Stronge R', 'Joel SP', 'Young BD', 'Gribben J', 'Taussig DC']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom; Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, London, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom; Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, London, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, United Kingdom.

In the present study, we aimed to survey the inhibitory impact of the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 on both cellular and molecular aspects of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-derived KG-1 and U937 cells. Materials and Methods: We designed various assays to survey the antitumor impacts and molecular mechanisms underlying the action of BKM120 for the treatment of AML, and we performed experiments to check the effect of BKM120 in combination with idarubicin. Results: We found that PI3K inhibition diminished cell viability and metabolic activity and exerted a concentration-dependent growth-suppressive effect on the cells. Moreover, we suggested that the ability of BKM120 to induce its antiproliferative properties was mediated through the induction of p21-mediated G2/M cell-cycle arrest. Investigating the effect of inhibitor on the molecular features revealed not only that BKM120 reduced the expression of NF-kappaB antiapoptotic targets, but also that NF-kappaB suppression using bortezomib profoundly enhanced the cytotoxicity of the inhibitor, highlighting that the antileukemic effects of BKM120 are mediated, at least partly, through the modulation of the NF-kappaB pathway. Interestingly, we found that the single agent of BKM120 was unable to significantly alter the expression level of c-Myc; however, the capability of BKM120 to reduce the survival rate of AML cells was potentiated upon c-Myc inhibition using 10058-F4, suggestive of the plausible contribution of c-Myc in leukemic cell response to the PI3K inhibitor. Conclusion: Taken together, the results of this study reveal the efficacy of BKM120 as a therapeutic approach for AML; however, further investigations should be undertaken to determine the expediency of this inhibitor.","['Sadeghi, Soroush', 'Esmaeili, Shadi', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Bashash, Davood']","['Sadeghi S', 'Esmaeili S', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi A', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Bashash D']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran', 'Student Research Committee, Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran', 'Student Research Committee, Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran', 'Student Research Committee, Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8029-4920', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3785-1602', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8029-4920']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200312,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (NVP-BKM120)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)']",,"['Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",PMC7463220,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*KG-1 cell', '*PI3K inhibition', '*NF-kappaB', '*c-Myc', '*BKM120,']",2020/03/13 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/03/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2019.0440 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2020 Aug 28;37(3):167-176. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2019.0440.

Here, we found that the overexpression of H19 significantly inhibited cell viability and colony formation and prolongs survival in CML cell lines and three xenografted mouse models.

Decitabine has frequently been deployed but its efficacy and safety profile are not well described in this population. We retrospectively reviewed 42 patients treated with decitabine either alone or in combination with ruxolitinib at our institution: 16 with MPN-BP, 14 with MPN accelerated-phase (MPN-AP), and 12 with myelofibrosis with high-risk features (MF-HR). The median overall survival (OS) for the MPN-BP patients was 2.6 months, and for those who received >/=2 cycles of decitabine therapy, it was 6.7 months (3.8-29.8). MPN-BP patients with a poor performance status and who required hospitalization at the time of the initiation of decitabine had a dismal prognosis. After a median follow-up of 12.4 months for MPN-AP patients, and 38.7 months for MF-HR patients, the median OS was not reached for either cohort, with 1 and 2 patients alive at 60 months, respectively. The probability of spleen length reduction and transfusion independence within 12 months of initiating decitabine was 28.6 and 23.5%, respectively. The combination of decitabine and ruxolitinib appeared to improve overall survival versus single-agent decitabine (21 and 12.9 months, respectively). Decitabine, alone or in combination with ruxolitinib, appears to have clinical benefit for patients with advanced phases of MPN when initiated early in the disease course prior to the development of MPN-BP.","['Zhou, Selena', 'Tremblay, Douglas', 'Hoffman, Ronald', 'Kremyanskaya, Marina', 'Najfeld, Vesna', 'Li, Lihua', 'Moshier, Erin', 'Mascarenhas, John']","['Zhou S', 'Tremblay D', 'Hoffman R', 'Kremyanskaya M', 'Najfeld V', 'Li L', 'Moshier E', 'Mascarenhas J']","['Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Population Health Science and Policy/Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Population Health Science and Policy/Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA, john.mascarenhas@mssm.edu.']",,['eng'],"['P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL053762/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA196521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200311,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Retreatment', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7773003,['NIHMS1656440'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Accelerated phase', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Blast phase', '*Decitabine', '*Myelofibrosis', '*Myeloproliferative neoplasms']",2020/03/12 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['000506146 [pii]', '10.1159/000506146 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2021;144(1):48-57. doi: 10.1159/000506146.

Here, we identify 5 somatic missense mutations in ABCA1 in 26 patients with CMML. These mutations confer a proliferative advantage to monocytic leukemia cell lines in vitro. In vivo inactivation of ABCA1 or expression of ABCA1 mutants in hematopoietic cells in the setting of Tet2 loss demonstrates a myelosuppressive function of ABCA1. Mechanistically, ABCA1 mutations impair the tumor-suppressor functions of WT ABCA1 in myeloproliferative neoplasms by increasing the IL-3Rbeta signaling via MAPK and JAK2 and subsequent metabolic reprogramming. Overexpression of a human apolipoprotein A-1 transgene dampens myeloproliferation. These findings identify somatic mutations in ABCA1 that subvert its anti-proliferative and cholesterol efflux functions and permit the progression of myeloid neoplasms. Therapeutic increases in HDL bypass these defects and restore normal hematopoiesis.","['Viaud, Manon', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Gall, Julie', 'Ivanov, Stoyan', 'Guinamard, Rodolphe', 'Sore, Sophie', 'Merlin, Johanna', 'Ayrault, Marion', 'Guilbaud, Emma', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Auberger, Patrick', 'Wang, Nan', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Tall, Alan R', 'Yvan-Charvet, Laurent']","['Viaud M', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Gall J', 'Ivanov S', 'Guinamard R', 'Sore S', 'Merlin J', 'Ayrault M', 'Guilbaud E', 'Jacquel A', 'Auberger P', 'Wang N', 'Levine RL', 'Tall AR', 'Yvan-Charvet L']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France."", 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1065, Universite Cote d'Azur, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), Atip-Avenir, Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire (FHU) Oncoage, 06204 Nice, France.

ATL is preceded by decades of chronic HTLV-1 infection, and the tumors carry both somatic mutations and proviral DNA integrated into the tumor genome. In order to gain insight into the oncogenic process, we used targeted sequencing to track the evolution of the malignant clone in 6 individuals, 2 to 10 years before the diagnosis of ATL. Clones of premalignant HTLV-1-infected cells bearing known driver mutations were detected in the blood up to 10 years before individuals developed acute and lymphoma subtype ATL. Six months before diagnosis, the total number and variant allele fraction of mutations increased in the blood. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from premalignant cases (1 year prediagnosis) had significantly higher mutational burden in genes frequently mutated in ATL than did high-risk, age-matched HTLV-1 carriers who remained ATL-free after a median of 10 years of follow-up. These data show that HTLV-1-infected T-cell clones carrying key oncogenic driver mutations can be detected in cases of ATL years before the onset of symptoms. Early detection of such mutations may enable earlier and more effective intervention to prevent the development of ATL.","['Rowan, Aileen G', 'Dillon, Richard', 'Witkover, Aviva', 'Melamed, Anat', 'Demontis, Maria-Antonietta', 'Gillet, Nicolas A', 'Mun, Liew Jun', 'Bangham, Charles R M', 'Cook, Lucy B', 'Fields, Paul A', 'Taylor, Graham P']","['Rowan AG', 'Dillon R', 'Witkover A', 'Melamed A', 'Demontis MA', 'Gillet NA', 'Mun LJ', 'Bangham CRM', 'Cook LB', 'Fields PA', 'Taylor GP']","['Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College, London, United Kingdom; and."", 'Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Imperial College NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College, London, United Kingdom; and."", 'Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT100291MA/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Clone Cells/*pathology/virology', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/epidemiology/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*pathology/virology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/virology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",PMC7381760,,,,2020/03/12 06:00,2021/02/10 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61974-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002665 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jun 4;135(23):2023-2032. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002665.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 Jun 4;135(23):2013-2014.

OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of VSM PTH1R deficiency, we generated mice SM22-Cre:PTH1R(fl/fl);LDLR(-/-) mice (PTH1R-VKO) and Cre-negative controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunofluorescence and Western blot confirmed PTH1R expression in arterial VSM that was reduced by Cre-mediated knockout. PTH1R-VKO cohorts exhibited increased aortic collagen accumulation in vivo, and VSM cultures from PTH1R-VKO mice elaborated more collagen (2.5-fold; P=0.01) with elevated Col3a1 and Col1a1 expression. To better understand these profibrotic responses, we performed mass spectrometry on nuclear proteins extracted from Cre-negative controls and PTH1R-VKO VSM. PTH1R deficiency reduced Gata6 but upregulated the MADS (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens, and Srf DNA-binding domain)-box transcriptional co-regulator, Mkl-1 (megakaryoblastic leukemia [translocation] 1). Co-transfection assays (Col3a1 promoter-luciferase reporter) confirmed PTH1R-mediated inhibition and Mkl-1-mediated activation of Col3a1 transcription. Regulation mapped to a conserved hybrid CT(A/T)6GG MADS-box cognate in the Col3a1 promoter. Mutations of C/G in this motif markedly reduced Col3a1 transcriptional regulation by PTH1R and Mkl-1. Upregulation of Col3a1 and Col1a1 in PTH1R-VKO VSM was inhibited by small interfering RNA targeting Mkl1 and by treatment with the Mkl-1 antagonist CCG1423 or the Rock (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase)-2 inhibitor KD025. Chromatin precipitation demonstrated that VSM PTH1R deficiency increased Mkl-1 binding to Col3a1 and Col1a1, but not TNF, promoters. Proteomic studies of plasma extracellular vesicles and VSM from PTH1R-VKO mice identified C1r (complement component 1, r) and C1s (complement component 1, s), complement proteins involved in vascular collagen metabolism, as potential biomarkers. VSM C1r protein and C1r message were increased with PTH1R deficiency, mediated by Mkl-1-dependent transcription and inhibited by CCG1423 or KD025. CONCLUSIONS: PTH1R signaling restricts collagen production in the VSM lineage, in part, via Mkl-1 regulatory circuits that control collagen gene transcription. Strategies that maintain homeostatic VSM PTH1R signaling, as reflected in extracellular vesicle biomarkers of VSM PTH1R/Mkl-1 action, may help mitigate arteriosclerosis and vascular fibrosis.","['Behrmann, Abraham', 'Zhong, Dalian', 'Li, Li', 'Cheng, Su-Li', 'Mead, Megan', 'Ramachandran, Bindu', 'Sabaeifard, Parastoo', 'Goodarzi, Mohammad', 'Lemoff, Andrew', 'Kronenberg, Henry M', 'Towler, Dwight A']","['Behrmann A', 'Zhong D', 'Li L', 'Cheng SL', 'Mead M', 'Ramachandran B', 'Sabaeifard P', 'Goodarzi M', 'Lemoff A', 'Kronenberg HM', 'Towler DA']","['From the Internal Medicine, Endocrine Division (A.B., D.Z., L.L., S.-L.C., M.M., B.R., P.S., D.A.T.), UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'From the Internal Medicine, Endocrine Division (A.B., D.Z., L.L., S.-L.C., M.M., B.R., P.S., D.A.T.), UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'From the Internal Medicine, Endocrine Division (A.B., D.Z., L.L., S.-L.C., M.M., B.R., P.S., D.A.T.), UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'From the Internal Medicine, Endocrine Division (A.B., D.Z., L.L., S.-L.C., M.M., B.R., P.S., D.A.T.), UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'From the Internal Medicine, Endocrine Division (A.B., D.Z., L.L., S.-L.C., M.M., B.R., P.S., D.A.T.), UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'From the Internal Medicine, Endocrine Division (A.B., D.Z., L.L., S.-L.C., M.M., B.R., P.S., D.A.T.), UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Biochemistry (M.G., A.L.), UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Biochemistry (M.G., A.L.), UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston (H.M.K.).', 'From the Internal Medicine, Endocrine Division (A.B., D.Z., L.L., S.-L.C., M.M., B.R., P.S., D.A.T.), UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.']",,['eng'],"['P01 DK011794/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL069229/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL114806/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200311,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (COL3A1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)', '0 (Collagen Type III)', '0 (Mrtfa protein, mouse)', '0 (PTH1R protein, mouse)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Receptor, Parathyroid Hormone, Type 1)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/metabolism/pathology', 'Atherosclerosis/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'Collagen Type III/genetics/metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/*metabolism/pathology', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Parathyroid Hormone, Type 1/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, LDL/deficiency/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vascular Remodeling']",PMC7524585,['NIHMS1576084'],['NOTNLM'],"['*arteriosclerosis', '*cardiovascular diseases', '*collagen', '*fibrosis', '*transcription factors']",2020/03/12 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316141 [doi]'],ppublish,Circ Res. 2020 May 8;126(10):1363-1378. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316141.

TIF-90 has been shown to regulate ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis by interacting with polymerase I (Pol I) during the initiation of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription in the nucleolus. Recently, we showed that TIF-90-mediated rRNA synthesis can play an important role in driving tumorigenesis in human colon cancer cells. Here we show that TIF-90 binds GTP at threonine 310, and that GTP binding is required for TIF-90-enhanced rRNA synthesis. Overexpression of activated AKT induces TIF-90 T310, but not a GTP-binding site (TIF-90 T310N) mutant, to translocate into the nucleolus and increase rRNA synthesis. Complementing this result, treatment with mycophenolic acid (MPA), an inhibitor of GTP production, dissociates TIF-90 from Pol I and hence abolishes AKT-increased rRNA synthesis by way of TIF-90 activation. Thus, TIF-90 requires bound GTP to fulfill its function as an enhancer of rRNA synthesis. Both TIF variants are highly expressed in colon cancer cells, and depletion of TIF-IA expression in these cells results in significant sensitivity to MPA-inhibited rRNA synthesis and reduced cell proliferation. Finally, a combination of MPA and AZD8055 (an inhibitor of both AKT and mTOR) synergistically inhibits rRNA synthesis, in vivo tumor growth, and other oncogenic activities of primary human colon cancer cells, suggesting a potential avenue for the development of therapeutic treatments by targeting the regulation of rRNA synthesis by TIF proteins.","['Nguyen, Dang Quan', 'Hoang, Dinh Hoa', 'Nelson, Michael', 'Nigam, Lokesh', 'Nguyen, Vo Thanh Thao', 'Zhang, Lianjun', 'Pham, Tram Kim Thi', 'Ho, Huu Duc', 'Nguyen, Dai Dong Thi', 'Lam, Trung Quoc', 'Tat, Trinh To', 'Elhajmoussa, Yasmin', 'Ly, Quoc Trung', 'Pichiorri, Flavia', 'Pullarkat, Vinod', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Nguyen, Le Xuan Truong']","['Nguyen DQ', 'Hoang DH', 'Nelson M', 'Nigam L', 'Nguyen VTT', 'Zhang L', 'Pham TKT', 'Ho HD', 'Nguyen DDT', 'Lam TQ', 'Tat TT', 'Elhajmoussa Y', 'Ly QT', 'Pichiorri F', 'Pullarkat V', 'Zhang B', 'Kuo YH', 'Marcucci G', 'Nguyen LXT']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Light Microscopy Core, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Thong Nhat Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Oncology, Thong Nhat Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Health of Soc Trang province, Soc Trang, Vietnam.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5464-0861'],['eng'],['106-YS.02-2015.60/National Foundation for Science and Technology Development'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200311,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase I)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'DNA, Ribosomal/genetics', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*genetics', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA Polymerase I/genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Ribosomes/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*GTP', '*MPA', '*TIF-90', '*TIF-IA', '*rRNA synthesis']",2020/03/12 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29661 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Oct;235(10):7567-7579. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29661.

However, the diagnostic yield from the procedure in unselected patients in the South African public sector has not previously been described. Objectives: We identified the main indications and most common diagnoses encountered for BMAT and described the demographic and blood profiles of patients, including HIV-positive patients, who had undergone the procedure at a tertiary hospital in KwaZulu-Natal. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed laboratory data from January 2016 to December 2016 for all patients aged >/= 13 years who underwent the procedure and stratified findings by demographic data. Results: Among 120 BMAT biopsies studied, 80 (67%) cases were performed to evaluate suspected malignancy and a further 40 (33%) cases for non-malignant indications. The main indications for bone marrow examination were: cytopenias 38 (32%), lymphoma 35 (29%), leukaemia 21 (18%), and multiple myeloma 17 (14%). BMAT results revealed that 60 cases (50%) were malignant in origin, 30 cases (25%) were non-malignant and 30 cases (25%) were classified as normal. The common diagnoses were: leukaemia, 24 (20%); multiple myeloma, 16 (13%) and lymphoma, 13 (11%). Cases aged >/= 50 years were more likely to have a malignant diagnosis (odds ratio: 5.8 (95% confidence interval: 2.2-17.1) p-value < 0.001). Conclusion: The diagnostic yield of BMAT was high, with significant abnormalities detected in three quarters of cases. Haematological malignancy was the more common diagnosis. Increasing age was associated with an increase in reporting of haematology malignancy.","['Tshabalala, Wanda S', 'Pillay, Somasundram', 'Wilson, Douglas P K']","['Tshabalala WS', 'Pillay S', 'Wilson DPK']","[""Department of Internal Medicine, Grey's Hospital, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, Edendale Hospital, Pietermaritzburg complex, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Edendale Hospital, Pietermaritzburg complex, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5874-3729', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5604-645X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7756-8660']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200225,South Africa,Afr J Lab Med,African journal of laboratory medicine,101603205,,,,PMC7057739,,['NOTNLM'],"['age', 'bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy', 'diffuse large B cell lymphoma', 'haematological malignant diseases', 'human immune virus', 'indications', 'outcomes']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:01,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4102/ajlm.v9i1.1028 [doi]', 'AJLM-9-1028 [pii]']",epublish,Afr J Lab Med. 2020 Feb 25;9(1):1028. doi: 10.4102/ajlm.v9i1.1028. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020.

Our results indicate that RT53 possesses a direct antileukemic effect, even at a late stage. We also demonstrate that a single injection of a vaccine consisting of leukemic blasts exposed to RT53, which induces the hallmarks of immunogenic cell death, was highly effective in preventing leukemia development in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. The vaccine comprising RT53-treated APL cells generated long-term antileukemic protection and depletion experiments indicated that CD4 + T cells were of crucial importance for vaccine efficacy. Combined, our results provide the rationale for the exploration of RT53-based therapies for the treatment of acute leukemia.","['Habault, Justine', 'Kaci, Anna', 'Pasquereau-Kotula, Ewa', 'Fraser, Claire', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'Pla, Marika', 'Poyet, Jean-Luc']","['Habault J', 'Kaci A', 'Pasquereau-Kotula E', 'Fraser C', 'Chomienne C', 'Dombret H', 'Braun T', 'Pla M', 'Poyet JL']","['INSERM UMRS976, Institut De Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Universite De Paris, Paris, France.', 'Universite De Paris, Paris, France.', 'Laboratoire De Transfert Des Leucemies, EA3518, Institut De Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital-Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMRS976, Institut De Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMRS976, Institut De Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Universite De Paris, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMRS1131, Institut De Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Service De Biologie Cellulaire, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux De Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Universite De Paris, Paris, France.', 'Laboratoire De Transfert Des Leucemies, EA3518, Institut De Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital-Saint Louis, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux De Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", 'Universite De Paris, Paris, France.', 'Laboratoire De Transfert Des Leucemies, EA3518, Institut De Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital-Saint Louis, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux De Paris, Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny, France."", 'Universite De Paris, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMRS1131, Institut De Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMRS976, Institut De Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Universite De Paris, Paris, France.', 'c-Dithem, Inserm Consortium for Discovery and Innovation in Therapy and Medicine.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,['0 (Peptides)'],,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Peptides', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC7051191,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Anticancer peptide', '*acute leukemia', '*autologous tumor cell vaccine', '*tumor immunity']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:01,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2020.1728871 [doi]', '1728871 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2020 Mar 2;9(1):1728871. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2020.1728871. eCollection 2020.,,"['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

In the present review, we will elaborate on how the unique interplay between HLA-mismatched immune system and malignancy that characterizes haplo-HCT may impact relapse biology, shaping the selection of disease variants that are resistant to the ""graft-vs.-leukemia"" effect. In particular, we will present current knowledge on genomic loss of HLA, a relapse modality first described in haplo-HCT and accounting for a significant proportion of relapses in this setting, and discuss other more recently identified mechanisms of post-transplantation immune evasion and relapse, including the transcriptional downregulation of HLA class II molecules and the enforcement of inhibitory checkpoints between T cells and leukemia. Ultimately, we will review the available treatment options for patients who relapse after haplo-HCT and discuss on how a deeper insight into relapse immunobiology might inform the rational and personalized selection of therapies to improve the largely unsatisfactory clinical outcome of relapsing patients.","['Rovatti, Pier Edoardo', 'Gambacorta, Valentina', 'Lorentino, Francesca', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Vago, Luca']","['Rovatti PE', 'Gambacorta V', 'Lorentino F', 'Ciceri F', 'Vago L']","['Unit of Immunogenetics, Leukemia Genomics and Immunobiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunogenetics, Leukemia Genomics and Immunobiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Senescence in Stem Cell Aging, Differentiation and Cancer, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunogenetics, Leukemia Genomics and Immunobiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200225,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/methods', 'Graft vs Host Disease/therapy', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Tumor Escape']",PMC7052328,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HLA', '*haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*immune check point', '*immune escape', '*relapse']",2020/03/12 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00147 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Feb 25;11:147. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00147. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Rovatti, Gambacorta, Lorentino, Ciceri and Vago.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear whether lncRNAs are involved in conferring cetuximab resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Methods: Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays were performed to assess the sensitivity of CRC cell lines to cetuximab treatment. We incubated Caco-2 cells, which are partially responsive to cetuximab, with increasing concentrations of cetuximab for approximately 6 months to generate Caco-2 cetuximab-resistant (Caco-2 CR) cells. Microarray analysis comparing Caco-2 CR with Caco-2 cells was used to identify lncRNAs that were potentially related to cetuximab resistance. Caco-2 cells were stably transduced with cetuximab resistance-associated RNA transcript 16 (CRART16) or an empty vector using lentiviral infection; the cells were designated Caco-2-CRART16 and Caco-2-NC, respectively, and were analyzed with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to investigate RNA expression. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assays were used to assess apoptosis levels induced by cetuximab. The cell cycle, stemness biomarkers and membrane proteins of CRC cells were assessed via flow cytometry. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to examine CRART16 localization and expression. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to predict the potential mechanism of CRART16, which was further validated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Differences in measurement data were compared using Student's t test, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test and two-way ANOVA. Results: The novel lncRNA CRART16 was upregulated in Caco-2 CR cells. CRART16 overexpression reversed the effects of cetuximab on cell viability and reduced cetuximab-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, CRART16 overexpression led to increases in the proportion of CD44(+)/CD133(+) cells. In addition, CRART16 acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-371a-5p to regulate V-Erb-B2 Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 3 (ERBB3) expression. MiR-371a-5p mimics counteracted the cetuximab resistance induced by CRART16 overexpression. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that after CRART16 was overexpressed, the resulting differentially expressed mRNAs were mainly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. Conclusions: CRART16 overexpression may contribute to cetuximab resistance through the miR-371a-5p/ERBB3/MAPK pathway. Additionally, CRART16 contributes to the acquisition of stemness properties.","['Zhang, Xiaoqian', 'Wen, Long', 'Chen, Shanwen', 'Zhang, Junling', 'Ma, Yongchen', 'Hu, Jianwen', 'Yue, Taohua', 'Wang, Jingui', 'Zhu, Jing', 'Bu, Dingfang', 'Wang, Xin']","['Zhang X', 'Wen L', 'Chen S', 'Zhang J', 'Ma Y', 'Hu J', 'Yue T', 'Wang J', 'Zhu J', 'Bu D', 'Wang X']","[""1Department of General Surgery, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""1Department of General Surgery, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""1Department of General Surgery, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""1Department of General Surgery, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""2Department of Endoscopic Center, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""1Department of General Surgery, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""1Department of General Surgery, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""1Department of General Surgery, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""1Department of General Surgery, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""3Central Laboratory, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5"", ""1Department of General Surgery, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1764 1621grid.411472.5""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0381-5497'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200304,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC7057486,,['NOTNLM'],"['CRART 16', 'Cetuximab', 'ERBB3', 'Long noncoding RNA', 'Resistance', 'miR-371a-5p']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:01,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-020-1155-9 [doi]', '1155 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2020 Mar 4;20:68. doi: 10.1186/s12935-020-1155-9. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods: The expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET2, and APOBEC3B were evaluated in 39 pediatric MDS patients by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The quantification of p15(INK4B) methylation levels (MtL) was performed in 20 pediatric MDS patients by pyrosequencing. Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate possible differences between the expression levels of selected in patients and donors, according to MDS subtypes, karyotypes, evolution to AML and p15(INK4B) MtL. The correlations between the expression levels of the different genes were assessed by Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Results: We found that DNMTs expression levels were higher in pediatric MDS compared to donors [DNMT1 (p<0.03), DNMT3A (p<0.03), DNMT3B (p<0.02)]. TET2 and APOBEC3B expression levels did not show a statistically significant difference between pediatric patients and donors. Considering MDS subtypes, patients at initial stage presented DNMT1 overexpression (p<0.01), while DNMT3A (p<0.02) and DNMT3B (p<0.007) were overexpressed in advanced subtypes. TET2 and APOBEC3B expression did not differ in MDS subtypes. DNMT1 (p<0.03), DNMT3B (p<0.03), and APOBEC3B (p<0.04) expression was higher in patients with normal karyotypes, while patients with abnormal karyotypes showed higher DNMT3A expression (p<0.03). Karyotypes had no association with TET2 expression. DNMTs overexpression was observed in patients who showed disease evolution. A positive correlation was found between DNMTs expression and between APOBEC3B and DNMT3A/DNMT3B. However, TET2 expression was not correlated with DNMTs or APOBEC3B. p15(INK4B) MtL was higher in pediatric MDS patients compared with donors (p<0.03) and its hypermethylation was associated with increased DNMT1 expression (p<0.009). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the overexpression of DNMTs and an imbalance between the expressions of the DNA methylation/demethylation machinery components play an important role in MDS development and evolution to AML. These results have clinical implications indicating the importance of DNMTs inhibitors for preventing or delaying the progression to leukemia in pediatric MDS patients.","['Lamim Lovatel, Viviane', 'de Souza Fernandez, Cecilia', 'Ferreira Rodrigues, Eliane', 'de Cassia Tavares, Rita', 'Sobral da Costa, Elaine', 'Abdelhay, Eliana', 'Coelho Soares Lima, Sheila', 'de Souza Fernandez, Teresa']","['Lamim Lovatel V', 'de Souza Fernandez C', 'Ferreira Rodrigues E', 'de Cassia Tavares R', 'Sobral da Costa E', 'Abdelhay E', 'Coelho Soares Lima S', 'de Souza Fernandez T']","['Cytogenetics Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Mathematical and Statistical Institute, Federal Fluminense University (UFF), Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.', 'Cytogenetics Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Outpatient Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pediatrics Department, Faculty of Medicine, Federal Rio de Janeiro University (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Stem Cell Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Molecular Carcinogenesis Program, National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Cytogenetics Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8493-5855', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6410-5117', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0419-567X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9050-7918', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5340-5816', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5166-0832', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6742-3708', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1299-4666']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200123,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC6986259,,['NOTNLM'],"['APOBEC3B', 'DNMTs', 'TET2', 'pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:01,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S219026 [doi]', '219026 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Jan 23;12:543-556. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S219026. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Lamim Lovatel et al.'],,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR/ABL1 fusion protein in patients with ALL accounts for acts in 15-30% of B-lineage ALL cases, usually in adolescence. However, entire ABL1 gene deletion without BCR/ABL1 rearrangement is a rare phenomenon in ALL patients. Here we describe the first case of entire ABL1 gene deletion without BCR/ABL1 rearrangement in a female B-ALL patient. Relevant literature is reviewed to explain the association between ABL1 deletion and the pathogenesis/prognosis of this disease. ABL gene deletion can repress the activation of p53 and p73, and disrupt TGF-beta signaling pathway to allow malignant cells to invade the normal tissue. The clinical significance of ABL gene deletion needs to be further explored.","['Jiang, Yijing', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Guo, Dan', 'Zhang, Chenlu', 'Hong, Lemin', 'Huang, Hongming', 'Liu, Haiyan']","['Jiang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Guo D', 'Zhang C', 'Hong L', 'Huang H', 'Liu H']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong 226361, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0530-1622', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9695-4674']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200124,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6986541,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL1 deletion', 'ALL', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'pathogenesis', 'prognosis']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:01,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S238336 [doi]', '238336 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Jan 24;13:783-790. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S238336. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Jiang et al.'],,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) can only partially antagonize the inhibitive effects of ATRA. In this study, we hypothesized that antagonists of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) could further antagonize the inhibitive effect of ATRA and rescue BMP2-induced osteoblastogenesis. Materials and Methods: We first screened the dose-dependent effects of the specific antagonists of RAR alpha, beta and gamma and transforming growth factor-beta receptor (ER-50891, LE-135, MM11253, and SB-43142, respectively) on ATRA-induced inhibition of the total cell metabolic activity and proliferation of preosteoblasts. We selected ER-50891 and tested its effects on osteoblastogenesis with the presence or absence of 1 muM ATRA and/or 200 ng/mL BMP-2. We measured the following parameters: Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN) expression and extracellular matrix mineralization as well as the level of phosphorylated Smad1/5. Results: ER-50891 but not LE-135, MM11253, or SB-431542 significantly antagonized the inhibition of ATRA and enhanced the total cell metabolic activity and proliferation of preosteoblasts. Dose-dependent assays show ER-50891 could also rescue ATRA inhibited OCN expression and mineralization with or without the induction of BMP. ER-50891 also suppressed the ALP activity that was synergistically enhanced by BMP and ATRA. Neither ATRA, nor ER-50891 or their combination significantly affected the level of BMP-induced phosphorylated Smad1/5. Conclusion: The antagonist of RARalpha, ER-50891 could significantly attenuate ATRA's inhibitive effects on BMP 2-induced osteoblastogenesis.","['Wang, Siqian', 'Bi, Wenjuan', 'Liu, Yi', 'Cheng, Jiayi', 'Sun, Wei', 'Wu, Gang', 'Xu, Xin']","['Wang S', 'Bi W', 'Liu Y', 'Cheng J', 'Sun W', 'Wu G', 'Xu X']","[""Department of Implantology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Shandong University & Shandong Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Engineering Laboratory for Dental Materials and Oral Tissue Regeneration, Jinan, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Stomatology, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Oral Medicine, Guangzhou Institute of Oral Disease, Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Oral Implantology and Prosthetic Dentistry, Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), University of Amsterdam (UvA) and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""The Affiliated Stomatology Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Oral Implantology and Prosthetic Dentistry, Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), University of Amsterdam (UvA) and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Implantology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Shandong University & Shandong Key Laboratory of Oral Tissue Regeneration & Shandong Engineering Laboratory for Dental Materials and Oral Tissue Regeneration, Jinan, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4262-9136', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8941-2500']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200122,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Mice', 'Osteogenesis/*drug effects', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",PMC6985983,,['NOTNLM'],"['all-trans retinoic acid', 'bone morphogenetic protein 2', 'osteoblastogenesis', 'retinoic acid receptor', 'transforming growth factor beta']",2020/03/12 06:00,2021/01/06 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S215786 [doi]', '215786 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2020 Jan 22;14:297-308. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S215786. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) 2020 Wang et al.'],,['The authors declare no conflict of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients with AML receiving either induction chemotherapy or salvage chemotherapy between November 2014 and February 2016 were included in this prospective observational study from 10 Indian centres. IFI was defined as per the revised EORTC-MSG criteria. Data on type of chemotherapy used, type of anti-fungal prophylaxis used, time to neutrophil recovery, incidence of IFI and survival were collected. Two hundred patients (118 male and 82 females) with a median age of 35 years (range: 2-66) were recruited. One hundred and eighty-six (93%) had newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while 14 (7%) had relapsed disease. IFI occurred in 53 patients (26.5%) with proven or probable IFI occurring in 17 (8.5%). Use of posaconazole prophylaxis (p = 0.027) was the only factor found to be associated with a reduced incidence of IFI. The overall survival (OS) at 6 weeks and 3 months respectively was similar among patients who had IFI (83.0 +/- 5.2%; 81.0 +/- 5.4%) as compared to those without IFI (84.4 + 3.0%; 81.4 +/- 3.2%).

To evaluate Ten Eleven Translocation 2 gene (TET2) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2454206, rs34402524, rs61744960) in AML, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in relation to their disease prognostic criteria. The study included 136 subjects; 52 AML, 54 CML and 30 subjects as control group matched for age and sex. Routine investigations including CBC, bone marrow aspiration, flow cytometry biochemical investigations and cytogenetics and molecular study were performed accordingly. DNA extraction and SNP assay for TET2 gene polymorphism was done using (Thermo-Fisher predesigned SNP, USA) PCR prism 7500. The mean age was 43.4 +/- 14.0 years in AML patients, 45.98 +/- 15.7 years in CML patients and 39.3 +/- 6.587 years in control group (p > 0.05). The frequency of TET2 SNP rs 34402524 ranged from heterozygous to homozygous in both AML (46%, 54%) and CML (48%, 46.2%) groups but was mainly homozygous among the control (80%) group (p = 0.012). TET2 SNP rs 2454206 was mainly wild in CML (65.4%) and control (63.3%) groups compared to AML as wild was only in (46%) and heterozygous in (44%) with only 10% being homozygous (p = 0.046). TET2 SNP rs 61744960 showed a homozygous pattern among all three group (AML CML and control) showing no statistical significance (p = 0.528). Eventhough, higher non responders to treatment were among homozygous and heterozygous groups yet, response to therapy as respect to specific TET2 SNP showed no significant variation (p > 0.05). TET2 SNP in CML cases did not alter the prognostic criteria as no statistical significance was noted (p > 0.05) except for TET2 SNP rs 34402524 where homozygous cases had larger spleen size (p = 0.019). TET2 SNP is common in Egyptian myeloid neoplasm. This is the first study in this field and further studies are recommended to investigate TET2 and relation to other hematological malignancies and leukemogenesis transformation.","['Dammag, Enas A', 'Hamed, Nahla A M', 'Elhalawani, Nabil A', 'Kassem, Heba S', 'Ayad, Mona W']","['Dammag EA', 'Hamed NAM', 'Elhalawani NA', 'Kassem HS', 'Ayad MW']","['1Hematology Department, Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Taiz University, Taiz, Yemen.grid.430813.d', '2Hematology Department, Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.grid.7155.60000 0001 2260 6941', '2Hematology Department, Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.grid.7155.60000 0001 2260 6941', '3Medical Genetics Center, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.grid.7155.60000 0001 2260 6941', '4Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.grid.7155.60000 0001 2260 6941']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190820,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7042427,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Ten Eleven Translocation 2 gene']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:01,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01172-z [doi]', '1172 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Jan;36(1):91-96. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01172-z.

This study is aimed to investigate the prognostic effect of clinic, laboratory and flow cytometric analysis in CLL patients. Newly diagnosed 55 CLL cases were divided into two groups, as stable disease (Group 1) and progressive disease (Group 2). Group 1 included those who did not require any treatment since diagnosis and those who did not progress after receiving the first step anti CLL treatment. Group 2 included the patients who received >/= 2 steps treatment. The relation between the two groups was analyzed statistically in terms of clinical, laboratory and flow cytometric findings. Twenty patients (36.3%) required treatment at the time of diagnosis, four patients (3.8%) received first-line treatment during follow-up and 31 (56.3%) patients were followed without any treatment. Thirteen patients required second step treatment after a median of 26.3 months. The risk of progression was found to be increased 5-fold (p = 0.015) in the CD38 positive patient group, 4.2-fold (p = 0.0147) in the FMC7 negative patient group and 2.8-fold in the CD11c negative patient group. FMC 7 negativity decreased total survival 5.9-fold (p = 0.051). Unlike similar publications, we found that patients with CD11c or FMC7 negativity were in a higher need for >/= 2 step treatment. This suggests that CD11c or FMC7 negativity may be used as a poor prognostic marker in CLL.","['Senturk Yikilmaz, Aysun', 'Akinci, Sema', 'Bakanay, Sule Mine', 'Zengin, Zeynep Busra', 'Dilek, Imdat']","['Senturk Yikilmaz A', 'Akinci S', 'Bakanay SM', 'Zengin ZB', 'Dilek I']","['1Department of Hematology, Yildirim Beyazit University, Bilkent Yolu 3.

Factors affecting prognosis and treatment need in these patients have long been the subject of research. A retrospective study was conducted with patients diagnosed with LG-NHL in Hematology Departments of two centres between 2010 and 2018. At the time of diagnosis, demographic and disease characteristics, hematological and biochemical parameters were examined. Using these data, treatment requirements, response and survival rates were calculated. The effect of parameters on survival and need to treatment were analyzed. 93 LG-NHL patients were included in this study. 40 (43%) of these patients were MZL, 28 (30.1%) were FL and 25 (26.8%) were others. In comparison of patients required treatment with patients without treatment, there was significant difference among the number of comorbidity, platelet count, neutrophil count, disease subgroups and ferritin levels. Logistic regression analysis revealed that disease subgroup (other than MZL and FL) and ferritin levels were independent risk factors for need to treatment. Only ferritin level was found to be associated with overall survival. The current study demonstrated an association between serum ferritin levels and prognosis in patients with LG-NHL. Given that it is easily available and low-cost, the initial ferritin level can be used as a prognostic marker for patients with indolent lymphoma.","['Comert, Pinar', 'Yildiz, Abdulkerim', 'Yildirim, Murat', 'Afacan Ozturk, Hacer Berna', 'Pala, Cigdem', 'Albayrak, Murat', 'Ayli, Meltem']","['Comert P', 'Yildiz A', 'Yildirim M', 'Afacan Ozturk HB', 'Pala C', 'Albayrak M', 'Ayli M']","['1Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.grid.413698.10000 0004 0419 0366', '1Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.grid.413698.10000 0004 0419 0366', '2Department of Hematology, Gulhane Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.grid.7256.60000000109409118', '1Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.grid.413698.10000 0004 0419 0366', '1Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.grid.413698.10000 0004 0419 0366', '1Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.grid.413698.10000 0004 0419 0366', '2Department of Hematology, Gulhane Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.grid.7256.60000000109409118']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3829-289X'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190806,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7042426,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ferritin', 'Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Survival', 'Treatment']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:01,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01168-9 [doi]', '1168 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Jan;36(1):78-83. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01168-9.

The PPP2R5C gene encodes PP2A regulatory B56gamma subunit. Malignant transformation may occur, if mRNA of PPP2R5C is functionally deregulated, structurally altered, decreased or overexpressed. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine PPP2R5C mRNA expression, evaluate its association with the different clinical and haematological parameters and determine its prognostic impact in Egyptian adult acute myeloid leukaemia patients with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML). Peripheral blood samples of 50 de novo CN-AML patients and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were examined for PPP2R5C expression by Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction. The expression levels of PPP2R5C mRNA were significantly higher in the CN-AML samples than in the control samples (P </= 0.001). There was a statistical significant difference between the low and high expression levels of PPP2R5C with regard to age (P = 0.005, r = - 0.447, P = 0.001). The patients with an unfavourable response to induction chemotherapy had significant higher PPP2R5C expression levels than those with a favourable response (P = 0.002). There was a significant influence of high PPP2R5C expression levels on the overall survival and progression free survival (P = 0.03, 0.026), respectively. PPP2R5C overexpression is an adverse prognostic factor which affects leukaemogenesis in the CN-AML, it may predict the disease progression and overall survival during the follow-up of the patients.","['El Taweel, Maha', 'Gawdat, Rania M', 'Abdelfattah, Rafaat']","['El Taweel M', 'Gawdat RM', 'Abdelfattah R']","['1Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.grid.7776.10000 0004 0639 9286', '2Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Beni-Suef Teaching Hospital, Beni-Suef University, Beni- Suef, Egypt.grid.411662.60000 0004 0412 4932', '3Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.grid.7776.10000 0004 0639 9286']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190608,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7042454,,['NOTNLM'],"['B56gamma', 'CN-AML', 'PP2A', 'PPP2R5C', 'Real time-polymerase chain reaction']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:01,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01142-5 [doi]', '1142 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Jan;36(1):37-46. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01142-5.

Myelodysplastic Syndromes are a heterogenous group of myeloid neoplasias with differing prognosis. Diagnostics include morphology of blood and marrow and cytogenetic analysis. Risk scores, such as the IPSS or IPSS-R allow for prognostication of survival and the probability of transforming to acute myeloid leukemia. Most patients are elderly and may present with co-morbidities that need to be taken into account. Treatment measures include supportive care as well as low dose chemotherapy and up to hematopoetic cell transplantation and are therefore equally heterogenous in intensity. Supportive measures consist of transfusion of red cells but also platelets, erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) and if transfused, iron chelation. In older patients with advanced MDS, who are not candidates for hematopoetic cell transplantation, low-dose chemotherapy such as with hypomethylating agents, e. g. azacyitinde is reasonably effective and well tolerated.","['Stehle, Gregor', 'Schwarb, Heike', 'Passweg, Jakob R']","['Stehle G', 'Schwarb H', 'Passweg JR']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitatsspital Basel.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitatsspital Basel.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitatsspital Basel.']",,['ger'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Ther Umsch,Therapeutische Umschau.

The discovery of specific inhibitors of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase more than 20 years ago has revolutionized the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Prognosis and outcome of patients considerably improved and progress in the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors is ongoing. In comparison to imatinib, second generation inhibitors used in first line lead to faster and deeper molecular remissions accompanied by different adverse event profiles. An essential part of the management of CML patients is to assess regularly the remaining tumor load by standardized molecular methods. Based on several clinical trials definitions of optimal response to treatment and of treatment failure have been put forward and help guide the treatment of the patients. The concept of treatment free remission was investigated extensively and is now part of the management of CML patients. Advanced stages of CML are diagnosed less frequently but are still challenging to treat. In these cases, allogeneic transplantation still plays an important role in the attempt to control the disease.","['Heim, Dominik', 'Ebnother, Monika', 'Favre, Genevieve']","['Heim D', 'Ebnother M', 'Favre G']","['Hamatologie, Universitatsspital Basel.', 'Onkologie / Hamatologie, Claraspital, Basel.', '3 Hamatologie, Kantonsspital Baselland, Liestal.']",,['ger'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Ther Umsch,Therapeutische Umschau.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare malignant hematological disease. The incidence of the disease peaks in the childhood and thus is rare in adults, making assessment and care at qualified centers highly desirable. Clinically, ALL presents with the proliferation and accumulation of malignant, immature lymphatic blasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymphatic and non-lymphatic tissue. Untreated, ALL results in death within few months. ALL is a heterogeneously disease. Prognosis is determined by immunophenotype, cytogenetics and molecular markers which influences therapeutic strategies. The aim of therapy in younger patients is curative. Patients should be treated in international study group protocols. Overall survival has improved over the last decade; also with the introduction of new targeted therapies. In addition, there have been recent developments in minimal / measurable residual disease (MRD) determination, which has a strong impact on the decision for an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Medinger, Michael', 'Heim, Dominik', 'Lengerke, Claudia', 'Halter, Jorg P', 'Passweg, Jakob R']","['Medinger M', 'Heim D', 'Lengerke C', 'Halter JP', 'Passweg JR']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitatsspital Basel.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitatsspital Basel.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitatsspital Basel.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitatsspital Basel.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitatsspital Basel.']",,['ger'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Ther Umsch,Therapeutische Umschau.

The clinical presentation, symptoms and signs were heterogeneous and uncharacteristic; indistinguishable from idiopathic HES. Flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis revealed aberrant T-cells in all patients, with a Th2 immunophenotype, CD2 + CD3-CD4 + CD5 + CD7dim+/-CD8- in six of seven (86%) cases. CD10 was partially expressed in one of seven (14%) cases, and clonal TCR gene rearrangement was detected by PCR in five of seven (71%) patients. All patients were treated with corticosteroids and two of seven (29%) patients received anti-IL5 antibody therapy. With a median follow-up time of 7.5 years (2.3-14.1 years), one (11%) patient developed peripheral T-cell lymphoma 6.1 years after the initial diagnosis of L-HES and responded well to chemotherapy. All patients were alive at the last follow-up. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a combination of flow cytometry immunophenotyping and molecular analysis allows the identification of aberrant T-cells, facilitating a diagnosis of L-HES in patients with eosinophilia. A correct diagnosis is essential for the proper management of these patients.","['Hu, Zhihong', 'Wang, Wei', 'Thakral, Beenu', 'Chen, Zhining', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Hu Z', 'Wang W', 'Thakral B', 'Chen Z', 'Estrov Z', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Verstovsek S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas Health Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200311,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

HIV-1 infection is accompanied by metabolic alterations, such as oxidative stress, but the effect of cellular antioxidant responses on viral replication and latency is unknown. Here, we show that cells survive retroviral replication, both in vitro and in vivo in SIVmac-infected macaques, by upregulating antioxidant pathways and the intertwined iron import pathway. These changes are associated with remodeling of promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs), an important constituent of nuclear architecture and a marker of HIV-1 latency. We found that PML NBs are hyper-SUMOylated and that PML protein is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in productively infected cells, before latency establishment and after reactivation. Conversely, normal numbers of PML NBs were restored upon transition to latency or by decreasing oxidative stress or iron content. Our results highlight antioxidant and iron import pathways as determinants of HIV-1 latency and support their pharmacologic inhibition as tools to regulate PML stability and impair latency establishment.","['Shytaj, Iart Luca', 'Lucic, Bojana', 'Forcato, Mattia', 'Penzo, Carlotta', 'Billingsley, James', 'Laketa, Vibor', 'Bosinger, Steven', 'Stanic, Mia', 'Gregoretti, Francesco', 'Antonelli, Laura', 'Oliva, Gennaro', 'Frese, Christian K', 'Trifunovic, Aleksandra', 'Galy, Bruno', 'Eibl, Clarissa', 'Silvestri, Guido', 'Bicciato, Silvio', 'Savarino, Andrea', 'Lusic, Marina']","['Shytaj IL', 'Lucic B', 'Forcato M', 'Penzo C', 'Billingsley J', 'Laketa V', 'Bosinger S', 'Stanic M', 'Gregoretti F', 'Antonelli L', 'Oliva G', 'Frese CK', 'Trifunovic A', 'Galy B', 'Eibl C', 'Silvestri G', 'Bicciato S', 'Savarino A', 'Lusic M']","['Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for High Performance Computing and Networking, ICAR-CNR, Naples, Italy.', 'Institute for High Performance Computing and Networking, ICAR-CNR, Naples, Italy.', 'Institute for High Performance Computing and Networking, ICAR-CNR, Naples, Italy.', 'CECAD Research Center, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'CECAD Research Center, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Division of Virus-Associated Carcinogenesis, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut fur Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Biology, Cellular Biophysics, Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Italian Institute of Health, Rome, Italy.', 'Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research, Heidelberg, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9980-1275', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3822-1215', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5472-3517', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1944-7078', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0120-3569']",['eng'],"['04.704/Deutsches Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung (DZIF)/International', '04.810/Deutsches Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung (DZIF)/International', 'Gilead Sciences (Gilead)/International', 'Humboldt Foundation/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200311,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'HIV Infections/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Macaca', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Sumoylation', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Latency']",PMC7196916,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1 latency', '*iron', '*oxidative stress', '*promyelocytic leukemia protein', '*proteasome']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.15252/embj.2019102209 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2020 May 4;39(9):e102209. doi: 10.15252/embj.2019102209.

Here, we demonstrated that lncRNA LINC00899 was upregulated in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells and was quite correlated with poor prognosis of AML patients. High expression of LINC00899 in AML cells could promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis, and facilitate the progression of AML consequently both in vitro and in vivo. Besides, LINC00899 acted as a molecular sponge of miR-744-3p. Furthermore, we characterized YY1 as the direct target of miR-744-3p, and LINC00899/miR-744-3p interaction modulated YY1 expression in AML cells. Finally, we verified LINC00899 modulated AML cell proliferation and apoptosis via regulating YY1. Our study revealed novel mechanism about how did lncRNA LINC00899 execute function in AML and thus provided potential therapeutic interventions for AML. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: LncRNA LINC00899 is upregulated in AML cells and is correlated with poor prognosis of AML patients. LncRNA LINC00899 mediates cell proliferation and apoptosis of acute myeloid leukaemia cells. Knockdown of LINC00899 inhibited the growth of xenograft glioma tumour in vivo. LINC00899 acts as a molecular sponge of miR-744-3p.

However, the outcome of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) fully mismatched unrelated donor-derived MST in such patients is still unknown. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of HLA fully mismatched unrelated donor-derived MST, and partly matched related donor-derived MST, in AML of 126 patients from two centers in China, These patients, aged 16 to 65 years, were given three or four courses of MST, which consisted of a high dosage cytarabine followed by GPBSC from unrelated donor or related donor. There was a statistically significant difference in 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and 3-year overall survival (OS) between the unrelated and the related group. The non-treatment-related mortality (NRM) rates of patients, and other adverse complications, were no different in the two groups. In conclusion, unrelated donor-derived MST is believed to be a safe treatment, with efficacy similar to or higher than related donor-derived MST. This result provides support for the potential of MST for expanding the donor selection. However, the specific mechanism of action needs further study.","['Hu, Kai-Xun', 'Du, Xin', 'Guo, Mei', 'Yu, Chang-Lin', 'Qiao, Jian-Hui', 'Sun, Qi-Yun', 'Zuo, Hong-Li', 'Cai, Bo', 'Huang, Ya-Jing', 'Ai, Hui-Sheng', 'Dong, Zheng', 'Wang, Yi']","['Hu KX', 'Du X', 'Guo M', 'Yu CL', 'Qiao JH', 'Sun QY', 'Zuo HL', 'Cai B', 'Huang YJ', 'Ai HS', 'Dong Z', 'Wang Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangdong People's Hospital, Gongdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Fifth Medical Center, General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9184-8458'],['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200403,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', '*Unrelated Donors']",,,,,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2020/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25780 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Jun;95(6):630-636. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25780.

However, rates of patient participation remain low. Research has shown that a trusted physician recommendation is an important influence on patients' decisions to enroll in a CCT. Improving primary care providers' (PCPs') knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about CCTs is a promising potential path for improving CCT participation. The aim of this pilot study was to test the effect of an online educational course for PCPs about clinical trials on primary care providers' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, and behavior. Forty-one PCPs in the New York City area participated in a 1-h online training session on cancer clinical trials. These PCPs had self-selected to complete the training in a previous survey. The objectives of the training module were to (1) educate the PCPs about clinical trials, with a focus on overcoming misconceptions; and (2) discuss roles of PCPs in partnering with oncologists to help patients gain access to clinical trials. The training module included didactics, audio excerpts, and case descriptions. Participants completed a pre-test immediately before taking the course, a post-test immediately after taking the course, and a 3-month post-course survey. All three assessments included a general T/F knowledge test, a 7-item attitude/belief scale, and a knowledge test focused specifically on local resources and access for clinical trials. Forty-one PCPs completed the module and the pre-post course surveys. Eighty percent (33/41) also completed the 3-month post-course survey. General knowledge and local knowledge increased significantly (p < .05) from pre- to post-course. At 3 months post-training, both general and local knowledge scores remained significantly increased from baseline. For those who completed the 3-month post-course survey, attitudes and beliefs increased significantly from pre- to post-course, but this change was not sustained at 3 months post-training. At 3 months post-training, 52% of the PCPs who had an interaction with a recently diagnosed cancer patient reported speaking with patients about CCTs as a result of the training. A brief online course showed significant and sustained improvement in PCPs' general and local knowledge about cancer clinical trials, which translated into self-reported behavior change. Future dissemination of the course and further research into its impact are important next steps.","['Bylund, Carma L', 'Michaels, Margo', 'Weiss, Elisa S', 'Patel, Shilpa', ""D'Agostino, Thomas A"", 'Binz-Scharf, Maria Christina', 'McKee, Diane']","['Bylund CL', 'Michaels M', 'Weiss ES', 'Patel S', ""D'Agostino TA"", 'Binz-Scharf MC', 'McKee D']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA. carma.bylund@ufl.edu.', 'University of Florida, Gainesville, USA. carma.bylund@ufl.edu.', 'Education Network to Advance Cancer Clinical Trials, Bethesda, USA.', 'Health Access and Action Consulting Newton, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, USA.', 'The Center for Health Care Strategies, Hamilton, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.', 'Albany Stratton VA Medical Center, Albany, USA.', 'CUNY - City College of New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, USA.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, USA.']",,['eng'],"['U54 CA137788/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA132378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA132378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA137788/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,J Cancer Educ,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,8610343,,IM,"['Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/therapy', '*Physicians, Primary Care', 'Pilot Projects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC7483356,['NIHMS1574742'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Clinical trials', '*Educational intervention', '*Primary care providers', '*Provider-patient communication']",2020/03/12 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2022/10/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13187-020-01731-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s13187-020-01731-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Educ. 2021 Oct;36(5):1039-1044. doi: 10.1007/s13187-020-01731-3.,,['(c) 2020.

The chi-square homogeneity test (CSHT) and the Marascuilo multiple comparison procedure (MMCP) assessed the level of significance between the proportions of EBL-seropositive cattle (ESPC) across the study farms and AALM, and between the age groups at farms 1 and 3. Overall, the proportion of ESPC was 25.7% at dairy farms and AALM, 37.0% for farms and 1.0% for AALM. Furthermore, the proportions of ESPC at farms 1, 2 and 3 were 54.7%, 0.0% and 26.3% respectively, and statistically significant differences were seen across the farm/farm and farm/AALM comparisons, and between two age groups at farms 1 and 3. The 37-72-month-old age group showed the highest proportion of ESPC. This is the first serological evidence of EBL in the UAE. As previously reported, the ESPC are comparatively higher in dairy than Bos indicus cattle. Molecular and more extensive serological studies are needed to further corroborate the present data.

For adoptive T cell therapy, a single epitope has to be selected, with high affinity to MHC class I and adequate processing and presentation by malignant cells to trigger full activation of specific T cells. In silico prediction with three algorithms indicated 13 peptides of Cyclin A1 9 to 11 amino acids of length to have high affinity to HLA-A*02:01. Ten of them proved to be affine in an HLA stabilization assay using TAP-deficient T2 cells. Their immunogenicity was assessed by repetitive stimulation of CD8(+) T cells from two healthy donors with single-peptide-pulsed dendritic cells or monocytes. Intracellular cytokine staining quantified the enrichment of peptide-specific functional T cells. Seven peptides were immunogenic, three of them against both donors. Specific cell lines were cloned and used in killing assays to demonstrate recognition of endogenous Cyclin A1 in the HLA-A*02:01-positive AML cell line THP-1. Immunopeptidome analysis based on direct isolation of HLA-presented peptides by mass spectrometry of primary AML and OC samples identified four naturally presented epitopes of Cyclin A1. The immunopeptidome of HeLa cells transfected with Cyclin A1 and HLA-A*02:01 revealed six Cyclin A1-derived HLA ligands. Epitope p410-420 showed high affinity to HLA-A*02:01 and immunogenicity in both donors. It proved to be naturally presented on primary AML blast and provoked spontaneous functional response of T cells from treatment naive OC and, therefore, warrants further development for clinical application.","['Teck, Anja Tatjana', 'Urban, Sabrina', 'Quass, Petra', 'Nelde, Annika', 'Schuster, Heiko', 'Letsch, Anne', 'Busse, Antonia', 'Walz, Juliane Sarah', 'Keilholz, Ulrich', 'Ochsenreither, Sebastian']","['Teck AT', 'Urban S', 'Quass P', 'Nelde A', 'Schuster H', 'Letsch A', 'Busse A', 'Walz JS', 'Keilholz U', 'Ochsenreither S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chariteplatz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Interfaculty Institute of Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Interfaculty Institute of Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Charite Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chariteplatz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

We previously reported that programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression could predict ATLL outcomes. However, the roles of other immune checkpoint molecules remain largely unknown in ATLL. Our aim in this study was to explore the clinicopathological impacts of immune checkpoint molecules in ATLL. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 69 ATLL patients with antibodies against the following: PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), OX40, OX40 ligand (OX40L), CD137, CD137 ligand (CD137L), Galectin-9, T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), lymphocyte activating-3 (LAG-3), CD80, CD86, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR), GITR ligand (GITRL), and programmed death-1 (PD-1). Immune checkpoint molecules were variably expressed on neoplastic and/or microenvironmental cells. Expression of PD-1, OX40L, Galectin-9, and PD-L1 was nearly mutually exclusive on neoplastic cells, suggesting that immune checkpoint pathways differ in patients. Microenvironmental expression of PD-L1, OX40L, and Tim-3 was significantly associated with better overall survival (log-rank test; P =0.0004, 0.0394, and 0.0279, respectively). Univariate and multivariate analyses with clinical prognostic factors identified microenvironmental expression of PD-L1 and OX40L, and age (> 70 years) as significant prognostic factors. This is the first comprehensive analysis of ATLL immune checkpoint molecules. Our results may provide information on new therapeutic strategies in ATLL.","['Takeuchi, Mai', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Nakashima, Kazutaka', 'Kawamoto, Keisuke', 'Yamada, Kyohei', 'Yanagida, Eriko', 'Muta, Hiroko', 'Moritsubo, Mayuko', 'Umeno, Takeshi', 'Suzuki, Takaharu', 'Seto, Masao', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Takeuchi M', 'Miyoshi H', 'Nakashima K', 'Kawamoto K', 'Yamada K', 'Yanagida E', 'Muta H', 'Moritsubo M', 'Umeno T', 'Suzuki T', 'Seto M', 'Ohshima K']","['Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan. miyoshi_hiroaki@med.kurume-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata, 951-8520, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata, 951-8520, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Asahimachi 67, Kurume, Fukuoka, 830-0011, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2356-3725'],['eng'],"['JP26460446/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'JP17K17894/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '15ck0106015h0002/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200310,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T cell', 'Immune evasion', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-lymphoma', 'OX40 ligand', 'Programmed cell death 1 receptor']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03967-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03967-x [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 May;99(5):1093-1098. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03967-x.

In contrast, management of blast crisis (BC) CML remains challenging because BC cells acquire complex molecular alterations that confer stemness features to progenitor populations and resistance to BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Comprehensive models of BC transformation have proved elusive because of the rarity and genetic heterogeneity of BC, but are important for developing biomarkers predicting BC progression and effective therapies. To better understand BC, we performed an integrated multiomics analysis of 74 CP and BC samples using whole-genome and exome sequencing, transcriptome and methylome profiling, and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing. Employing pathway-based analysis, we found the BC genome was significantly enriched for mutations affecting components of the polycomb repressive complex (PRC) pathway. While transcriptomically, BC progenitors were enriched and depleted for PRC1- and PRC2-related gene sets respectively. By integrating our data sets, we determined that BC progenitors undergo PRC-driven epigenetic reprogramming toward a convergent transcriptomic state. Specifically, PRC2 directs BC DNA hypermethylation, which in turn silences key genes involved in myeloid differentiation and tumor suppressor function via so-called epigenetic switching, whereas PRC1 represses an overlapping and distinct set of genes, including novel BC tumor suppressors. On the basis of these observations, we developed an integrated model of BC that facilitated the identification of combinatorial therapies capable of reversing BC reprogramming (decitabine+PRC1 inhibitors), novel PRC-silenced tumor suppressor genes (NR4A2), and gene expression signatures predictive of disease progression and drug resistance in CP.","['Ko, Tun Kiat', 'Javed, Asif', 'Lee, Kian Leong', 'Pathiraja, Thushangi N', 'Liu, Xingliang', 'Malik, Simeen', 'Soh, Sheila Xinxuan', 'Heng, Xiu Ting', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Tan, Joanna H J', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Khng, Alexis J', 'Chng, Wee-Joo', 'Sia, Yee Yen', 'Fruman, David A', 'Ng, King Pan', 'Chan, Zhu En', 'Xie, Kim Jiajing', 'Hoi, Qiangze', 'Chan, Cheryl Xueli', 'Teo, Audrey S M', 'Velazquez Camacho, Oscar', 'Meah, Wee Yang', 'Khor, Chiea Chuen', 'Ong, Chin Thing J', 'Soon, Wei Jia W', 'Tan, Patrick', 'Ng, Pauline C', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Hillmer, Axel M', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Ko TK', 'Javed A', 'Lee KL', 'Pathiraja TN', 'Liu X', 'Malik S', 'Soh SX', 'Heng XT', 'Takahashi N', 'Tan JHJ', 'Bhatia R', 'Khng AJ', 'Chng WJ', 'Sia YY', 'Fruman DA', 'Ng KP', 'Chan ZE', 'Xie KJ', 'Hoi Q', 'Chan CX', 'Teo ASM', 'Velazquez Camacho O', 'Meah WY', 'Khor CC', 'Ong CTJ', 'Soon WJW', 'Tan P', 'Ng PC', 'Chuah C', 'Hillmer AM', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Computational and Systems Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Human Genetics, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Human Genetics, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Next Generation Sequencing Platform, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Next Generation Sequencing Platform, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Computational and Systems Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Cancer Therapeutics & Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre, Singapore;

There are two forms of PCL: primary, which arise de novo, and secondary which is a leukemic transformation in patients with previously multiple myeloma. Patients with PCL may benefit from stem cell transplantation and novel agents, but their prognosis remains inferior to that of patients who have multiple myeloma. CLINICAL CASE: We describe the case of 53 years old patient with relapsed plasma cells leukemia after unrelated bone marrow transplant, treated with a KRD chemotherapy regimen. He performed a very good response after the first 2 cycles (bone marrow malignant plasma cells reducing from 36% to 0.5%). However, according to the very poor prognosis of this disease, after the 4th cycle of chemotherapy the patient progressed and dead into few weeks. The KRD regimen was able to convert the chimerism after bone marrow transplant from partial to complete after the first 2 cycles of treatment, showing some activity in this disease. CONCLUSIONS: KRD regimen, in our clinical case, showed some activity being well tolerated in a very poor prognosis disease such as PCL. Probably, right use and maybe sooner use of new drugs such as bortezomib or carfilzomib, in combination regimens, may be useful in better treating such disease.","['Palazzo, Giulia']",['Palazzo G'],"['Ematologia, Ospedale S.G.

Thus, novel therapies are still urgently needed. Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins, primarily comprised of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 proteins, function as epigenetic readers and master transcription coactivators and are now recognized cancer therapeutic targets. BET degraders such as ZBC260 and dBET represent a novel class of BET inhibitors that act by inducing BET degradation. The current study demonstrates the therapeutic efficacies of BET degraders, particularly ZBC260, against lung cancer, as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms and identifying molecular markers that determine cell sensitivity to BET degraders. A panel of NSCLC cell lines possessed similar response patterns to ZBC260 and dBET but different responses to BET inhibitor JQ-1. BRD levels, particularly BRD4, correlated positively with high sensitivity to BET degraders but not to JQ-1. BET degraders potently induced apoptosis in sensitive NSCLC cells and were accompanied by reduction of Mcl-1 and c-FLIP levels, which are critical for mediating induction of apoptosis and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, ZBC260 exerted more potent activity than JQ-1 in vivo against the growth of NSCLC xenografts and patient-derived xenografts. These findings warrant future clinical validation of the efficacy of BET degraders in NSCLC, particularly those with high levels of BRD proteins, especially BRD4. SIGNIFICANCE: The current study demonstrates the potential of novel BET degraders in the treatment of lung cancer and warrants clinical validation of BET degraders in lung cancer with high levels of BRD4.","['Zong, Dan', 'Gu, Jiajia', 'Cavalcante, Giovanna C', 'Yao, Weilong', 'Zhang, Guojing', 'Wang, Shaomeng', 'Owonikoko, Taofeek K', 'He, Xia', 'Sun, Shi-Yong']","['Zong D', 'Gu J', 'Cavalcante GC', 'Yao W', 'Zhang G', 'Wang S', 'Owonikoko TK', 'He X', 'Sun SY']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital and Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, Jiangsu, P.

PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells that dampens T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 signaling by engaging with its ligand PD-L1 expressed on cancer cells. Despite the clinical success of PD-1 blockade using mAbs, most patients do not respond to the treatment, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms of PD-1 remain incompletely defined. Here we show that PD-1 is extensively N-glycosylated in T cells and the intensities of its specific glycoforms are altered upon TCR activation. Glycosylation was critical for maintaining PD-1 protein stability and cell surface localization. Glycosylation of PD-1, especially at the N58 site, was essential for mediating its interaction with PD-L1. The mAb STM418 specifically targeted glycosylated PD-1, exhibiting higher binding affinity to PD-1 than FDA-approved PD-1 antibodies, potently inhibiting PD-L1/PD-1 binding, and enhancing antitumor immunity. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the functional significance of PD-1 glycosylation and offer a rationale for targeting glycosylated PD-1 as a potential strategy for immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that glycosylation of PD-1 is functionally significant and targeting glycosylated PD-1 may serve as a means to improve immunotherapy response.","['Sun, Linlin', 'Li, Chia-Wei', 'Chung, Ezra M', 'Yang, Riyao', 'Kim, Yong-Soo', 'Park, Andrew H', 'Lai, Yun-Ju', 'Yang, Yi', 'Wang, Yu-Han', 'Liu, Jielin', 'Qiu, Yufan', 'Khoo, Kay-Hooi', 'Yao, Jun', 'Hsu, Jennifer L', 'Cha, Jong-Ho', 'Chan, Li-Chuan', 'Hsu, Jung-Mao', 'Lee, Heng-Huan', 'Yoo, Stephen S', 'Hung, Mien-Chie']","['Sun L', 'Li CW', 'Chung EM', 'Yang R', 'Kim YS', 'Park AH', 'Lai YJ', 'Yang Y', 'Wang YH', 'Liu J', 'Qiu Y', 'Khoo KH', 'Yao J', 'Hsu JL', 'Cha JH', 'Chan LC', 'Hsu JM', 'Lee HH', 'Yoo SS', 'Hung MC']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory of Lung Cancer Metastasis and Tumor Microenvironment, Lung Cancer Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, P.R.

Many transcription factors are continuously expressed during this process but it is presently unclear how these factors modify their targets as cells transition through different stages of specification. In olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis, the transcription factor PBX1 controls neurogenesis in progenitor cells and the survival of migrating neuroblasts. Here, we show that, at later differentiation stages, PBX1 also acts as a terminal selector for the dopaminergic neuron fate. PBX1 is also required for the morphological maturation of dopaminergic neurons and to repress alternative interneuron fates, findings that expand the known repertoire of terminal-selector actions. Finally, we reveal that the temporal diversification of PBX1 functions in neuronal specification is achieved, at least in part, through the dynamic regulation of alternative splicing. In Caenorhabditis elegans, PBX/CEH-20 also acts as a dopaminergic neuron terminal selector, which suggests an ancient role for PBX factors in the regulation of terminal differentiation of dopaminergic neurons.","['Remesal, Laura', 'Roger-Baynat, Isabel', 'Chirivella, Laura', 'Maicas, Miren', 'Brocal-Ruiz, Rebeca', 'Perez-Villalba, Ana', 'Cucarella, Carme', 'Casado, Marta', 'Flames, Nuria']","['Remesal L', 'Roger-Baynat I', 'Chirivella L', 'Maicas M', 'Brocal-Ruiz R', 'Perez-Villalba A', 'Cucarella C', 'Casado M', 'Flames N']","['Developmental Neurobiology Unit, Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, IBV-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain.', 'Developmental Neurobiology Unit, Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, IBV-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain.', 'Developmental Neurobiology Unit, Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, IBV-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain.', 'Developmental Neurobiology Unit, Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, IBV-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain.', 'Developmental Neurobiology Unit, Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, IBV-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Estructura de Recerca Interdisciplinar en Biotecnologia i Biomedicina (ERI BIOTECMED), and Departamento de Biologia Celular, Biologia Funcional y Antropologia Fisica, Universidad de Valencia, 46100 Burjassot, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Metabolic Experimental Pathology Unit, Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, IBV-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Metabolic Experimental Pathology Unit, Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, IBV-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain.', 'Developmental Neurobiology Unit, Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, IBV-CSIC, 46010 Valencia, Spain nflames@ibv.csic.es.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5330-2374', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0961-0609']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200413,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Patterning', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Survival', 'Dopaminergic Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Exons/genetics', 'Interneurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitosis', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neurogenesis', 'Olfactory Bulb/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult neurogenesis', '*Alternative splicing', '*Dopaminergic neuron', '*Neuron differentiation', '*Olfactory bulb', '*Terminal selector']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['dev.186841 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.186841 [doi]']",epublish,Development. 2020 Apr 13;147(8). pii: dev.186841. doi: 10.1242/dev.186841.,,['(c) 2020.

In this study, we simultaneously inactivated Sall4 using Hoxb6Cre and Plzf in mouse embryos, and found that their combined function regulates development of the proximal-anterior skeletal elements in hindlimbs. The Sall4; Plzf double knockout exhibits severe defects in the femur, tibia, and anterior digits, distinct defects compared to other allelic series of Sall4; Plzf We found that Sall4 regulates Plzf expression prior to hindlimb outgrowth. Further expression analysis indicated that Hox10 genes and GLI3 are severely downregulated in the Sall4; Plzf double knockout hindlimb bud. In contrast, PLZF expression is reduced but detectable in Sall4; Gli3 double knockout limb buds, and SALL4 is expressed in the Plzf; Gli3 double knockout limb buds. These results indicate that Plzf, Gli3, and Hox10 genes downstream of Sall4, regulate femur and tibia development. In the autopod, we show that Sall4 negatively regulates Hedgehog signaling, which allows for development of the most anterior digit. Collectively, our study illustrates genetic systems that regulate development of the proximal-anterior skeletal elements in hindlimbs.","['Chen, Katherine Q', 'Tahara, Naoyuki', 'Anderson, Aaron', 'Kawakami, Hiroko', 'Kawakami, Sho', 'Nishinakamura, Ryuichi', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Kawakami, Yasuhiko']","['Chen KQ', 'Tahara N', 'Anderson A', 'Kawakami H', 'Kawakami S', 'Nishinakamura R', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Kawakami Y']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development.', 'Stem Cell Institute, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, and.', 'Developmental Biology Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development.', 'Stem Cell Institute, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, and.', 'Developmental Biology Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development.', 'Department of Kidney Development, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan 860-0811.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development kawak005@umn.edu.', 'Stem Cell Institute, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, and.', 'Developmental Biology Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1797-5229', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5413-7171', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0043-9705']",['eng'],['R01 AR064195/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200310,United States,Genetics,Genetics,0374636,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gli3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sall4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vsx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli3)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Development', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Femur/embryology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tibia/embryology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zinc Finger Protein Gli3/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7198279,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Plzf', '*Sall4', '*Sonic Hedgehog-Gli3', '*limb', '*proximal-anterior skeleton']",2020/03/12 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['genetics.120.303069 [pii]', '10.1534/genetics.120.303069 [doi]']",ppublish,Genetics. 2020 May;215(1):129-141. doi: 10.1534/genetics.120.303069.

Combination therapy may reduce activation of escape pathways and deepen responses. This open-label, phase Ib, sequential dose-escalation and dose-expansion study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of the selective BTK inhibitor tirabrutinib alone, in combination with the PI3K delta (PI3Kdelta) inhibitor idelalisib, or with the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor entospletinib in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received either tirabrutinib monotherapy (80 mg every day) or tirabrutinib 20-150 mg every day in combination with either idelalisib (50 mg twice a day or 100 mg every day) or entospletinib (200 mg or 400 mg every day). RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included. Systemic tirabrutinib exposure was comparable between monotherapy and combination therapy. No MTD was identified. Across all treatment groups, the most common adverse event was diarrhea (43%, 1 patient grade >/=3); discontinuation due to adverse events was uncommon (13%). Objective response rates were 83%, 93%, and 100%, and complete responses were 7%, 7%, and 10% in patients receiving tirabrutinib, tirabrutinib/idelalisib, and tirabrutinib/entospletinib, respectively. As of February 21, 2019, 46 of 53 patients continue to receive treatment on study. CONCLUSIONS: Tirabrutinib in combination with idelalisib or entospletinib was well tolerated in patients with CLL, establishing an acceptable safety profile for concurrent selective inhibition of BTK with either PI3Kdelta or SYK. This small study did not establish a superior efficacy of the combinations over tirabrutinib alone.

The JNK and p38 protein kinases were activated by compound 1 to induce cancer cell apoptosis. Compound 1 also increased pro-apoptotic Bax level, which is a same function compared to a reported NO donor, JS-K. More interestingly, it decreased the level of an anti-apoptotic member Bcl-2, which is an opposite effect compared to JS-K.

These are observed in approximately 30% of patients, defined as stereotyped receptors and subdivided into subsets based on specific VH CDR3 aa motifs and phylogenetically related IGHV genes. Although relevant to CLL ontogeny, the distribution of CLL-biased stereotyped immunoglobulin rearrangements (CBS-IG) in normal B cells has not been so far specifically addressed using modern sequencing technologies. Here, we have investigated the presence of CBS-IG in splenic B cell subpopulations (s-BCS) and in CD5(+) and CD5(-) B cells from the spleen and peripheral blood (PB). METHODS: Fractionation of splenic B cells into 9 different B cell subsets and that of spleen and PB into CD5(+) and CD5(-) cells were carried out by FACS sorting. cDNA sequences of BcR IG gene rearrangements were obtained by NGS. Identification of amino acidic motifs typical of CLL stereotyped subsets was carried out on IGHV1-carrying gene sequences and statistical evaluation has been subsequently performed to assess stereotypes distribution. RESULTS: CBS-IG represented the 0.26% average of IGHV1 genes expressing sequences, were detected in all of the BCS investigated. CBS-IG were more abundant in splenic and circulating CD5(+) B (0.57%) cells compared to CD5(-) B cells (0.17%). In all instances, most CBS IG did not exhibit somatic hypermutation similar to CLL stereotyped receptors. However, compared to CLL, they exhibited a different CLL subset distribution and a broader utilization of the genes of the IGHV1 family. CONCLUSIONS: CBS-IG receptors appear to represent a part of the ""public"" BcR repertoire in normal B cells. This repertoire is observed in all BCS excluding the hypothesis that CLL stereotyped BcR accumulate in a specific B cell subset, potentially capable of originating a leukemic clone. The different relative representation of CBS-IG in normal B cell subgroups suggests the requirement for additional selective processes before a full transformation into CLL is achieved.","['Colombo, Monica', 'Bagnara, Davide', 'Reverberi, Daniele', 'Matis, Serena', 'Cardillo, Martina', 'Massara, Rosanna', 'Mastracci, Luca', 'Ravetti, Jean Louis', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Mazzocco, Michela', 'Squillario, Margherita', 'Mazzarello, Andrea Nicola', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Fais, Franco']","['Colombo M', 'Bagnara D', 'Reverberi D', 'Matis S', 'Cardillo M', 'Massara R', 'Mastracci L', 'Ravetti JL', 'Agnelli L', 'Neri A', 'Mazzocco M', 'Squillario M', 'Mazzarello AN', 'Cutrona G', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Ferrarini M', 'Fais F']","['U.O.

Presently, data on the neurotoxicity of Abeta in neural cells differentiated from stem cells are limited. In this study, we attempted to induce oxidative stress in transgenic 46C mouse embryonic stem cell-derived neurons via treatment with Abeta peptides (Abeta1-42 and Abeta25-35). 46C neural cells were generated by promoting the formation of multicellular aggregates, embryoid bodies in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor, followed by the addition of all-trans retinoic acid as the neural inducer. Mature neuronal cells were exposed to different concentrations of Abeta1-42 and Abeta25-35 for 24 h. Morphological changes, cell viability, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were assessed. We found that 100 microM Abeta1-42 and 50 microM Abeta25-35 only promoted 40% and 10%, respectively, of cell injury and death in the 46C-derived neuronal cells. Interestingly, treatment with each of the Abeta peptides resulted in a significant increase of intracellular ROS activity, as compared to untreated neurons. These findings indicate the potential of using neurons derived from stem cells and Abeta peptides in generating oxidative stress for the establishment of an in vitro AD model that could be useful for drug screening and natural product studies.","['Mansor, Nur Izzati', 'Ntimi, Carolindah Makena', 'Abdul-Aziz, Noraishah Mydin', 'Ling, King-Hwa', 'Adam, Aishah', 'Rosli, Rozita', 'Hassan, Zurina', 'Nordin, Norshariza']","['Mansor NI', 'Ntimi CM', 'Abdul-Aziz NM', 'Ling KH', 'Adam A', 'Rosli R', 'Hassan Z', 'Nordin N']","['Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology Research Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, Puncak Alam Campus, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; UPM-MAKNA Cancer Research Laboratory, Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Centre for Drug Research, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Gelugor, Penang, Malaysia.', 'Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210201,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Bosn J Basic Med Sci,Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,101200947,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (amyloid beta-protein (1-42))', '0 (amyloid beta-protein (25-35))']",IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Peptide Fragments/*toxicity']",PMC7861624,,,,2020/03/12 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17305/bjbms.2020.4639 [doi]'],epublish,Bosn J Basic Med Sci. 2021 Feb 1;21(1):98-110. doi: 10.17305/bjbms.2020.4639.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plasma cell tumor heterotopic gene 1 (PVT1) is an intergenic long non-coding RNA that is aberrantly expressed in different cancers. Myocardin-related transcription factor A or megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is a transcriptional coactivator of serum response factor that has been shown to promote cancer cell migration and invasion. In this study, we investigated the relationship between PVT1 and MKL1 as a novel regulatory mechanism underlying HCC progression. We used HepG2 and Cos7 cell lines. Transfection experiments with miR-3619-5p mimics/inhibitor, PVT1, siRNA-PVT1, MKL1, or siRNA-MKL1 were performed. RNA and protein levels were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot, respectively. Cell migration was assessed by transwell assay. Luciferase assays, RNA-FISH, RNA immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to confirm the interaction between PVT1, miR-3619-5p, and MKL1 in HCC cells. Overexpression of PVT1 was positively correlated with MKL1 upregulation, which promoted HepG2 cell migration. miR-3619-5p inhibited MKL1 expression in HCC cells by acting on its 3'-UTR. Furthermore, PVT1 promoted MKL1 expression and migration in HCC cells by directly binding to miR-3619-5p. In a positive feedback loop, MKL1 could activate PVT1 transcription by binding to the CArG box in the promoter region. Our findings may provide a basis for the development of novel targeted therapies in HCC.","['Liu, Hua', 'Yin, Yan', 'Liu, Ting', 'Gao, Yanying', 'Ye, Qing', 'Yan, Junqing', 'Ha, Fushuang']","['Liu H', 'Yin Y', 'Liu T', 'Gao Y', 'Ye Q', 'Yan J', 'Ha F']","['The Third Central Hospital of Tianjin, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Extracorporeal Life Support for Critical Diseases, Tianjin, China; Artificial Cell Engineering Technology Research Center, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Institute of Hepatobiliary Disease, Tianjin, China.', 'Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of Tianjin Chest Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Tianjin Chest Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'The Third Central Hospital of Tianjin, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Extracorporeal Life Support for Critical Diseases, Tianjin, China; Artificial Cell Engineering Technology Research Center, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Institute of Hepatobiliary Disease, Tianjin, China.', 'The Third Central Hospital of Tianjin, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Extracorporeal Life Support for Critical Diseases, Tianjin, China; Artificial Cell Engineering Technology Research Center, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Institute of Hepatobiliary Disease, Tianjin, China.', 'The Third Central Hospital of Tianjin, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Extracorporeal Life Support for Critical Diseases, Tianjin, China; Artificial Cell Engineering Technology Research Center, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Institute of Hepatobiliary Disease, Tianjin, China.', 'The Third Central Hospital of Tianjin, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Extracorporeal Life Support for Critical Diseases, Tianjin, China; Artificial Cell Engineering Technology Research Center, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Institute of Hepatobiliary Disease, Tianjin, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Bosn J Basic Med Sci,Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,101200947,"['0 (MIRN-3619 microRNA, human)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (PVT1 long-non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*etiology/*pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Movement', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/etiology/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",PMC7982070,,,,2020/03/12 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17305/bjbms.2020.4641 [doi]'],epublish,Bosn J Basic Med Sci. 2021 Apr 1;21(2):187-197. doi: 10.17305/bjbms.2020.4641.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effectors of the innate and the adaptive immune response show marked dysfunction and skewing towards the generation of a tolerant environment that favors disease expansion. Major deregulations are found in the T lymphocyte compartment, with inhibition of CD8(+) cytotoxic and CD4(+) activated effector T cells, replaced by exhausted and more tolerogenic subsets. Likewise, differentiation of monocytes towards a suppressive M2-like phenotype is induced at the expense of pro-inflammatory sub-populations. Thanks to their B-regulatory phenotype, leukemic cells play a central role in driving immunosuppression, progressively inhibiting immune responses. A number of signaling cascades triggered by soluble mediators and cell-cell contacts contribute to immunomodulation in CLL, fostered also by local environmental conditions, such as hypoxia and derived metabolic acidosis. Specifically, molecular pathways modulating T-cell activity in CLL, spanning from the best known cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) to the emerging T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif domains (TIGIT)/CD155 axes, are attracting increasing research interest and therapeutic relevance also in the CLL field. On the other hand, in the microenvironment, the B cell receptor (BCR), which is undoubtedly the master regulator of leukemic cell behavior, plays an important role in orchestrating immune responses, as well. Lastly, local conditions of hypoxia, typical of the lymphoid niche, have major effects both on CLL cells and on non-leukemic immune cells, partly mediated through adenosine signaling, for which novel specific inhibitors are currently under development. In summary, this review will provide an overview of the molecular and microenvironmental mechanisms that modify innate and adaptive immune responses of CLL patients, focusing attention on those that may have therapeutic implications.","['Arruga, Francesca', 'Gyau, Benjamin Baffour', 'Iannello, Andrea', 'Vitale, Nicoletta', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Arruga F', 'Gyau BB', 'Iannello A', 'Vitale N', 'Vaisitti T', 'Deaglio S']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, via Nizza, 52, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, via Nizza, 52, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, via Nizza, 52, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, via Nizza, 52, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, via Nizza, 52, 10126 Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, via Nizza, 52, 10126 Torino, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8940-1406', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0632-5036']",['eng'],"['23095/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', ""2017CBNCYT/Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca"", 'grant agreeement 813284/H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions', ""#D15D18000410001/Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca""]","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200306,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,,IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', '*Immunomodulation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology']",PMC7084946,,['NOTNLM'],"['hypoxia', 'immune checkpoints', 'immunosuppression', 'microenvironment', 'tolerance']",2020/03/12 06:00,2020/12/02 06:00,['2020/03/12 06:00'],"['2020/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21051825 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21051825 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Mar 6;21(5). pii: ijms21051825. doi: 10.3390/ijms21051825.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive activation of FLT3 by internal tandem duplications (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain has been causally linked to acute myeloid leukaemia. Oncogenic FLT3 ITD is partially retained in compartments of the biosynthetic route and aberrantly activates STAT5, thereby promoting cellular transformation. The pool of FLT3 ITD molecules in the plasma membrane efficiently activates RAS and AKT, which is likewise essential for cell transformation. Little is known about features and mechanisms of FLT3 ligand (FL)-dependent internalization of surface-bound FLT3 or FLT3 ITD. We have addressed this issue by internalization experiments using human RS4-11 and MV4-11 cells with endogenous wild-type FLT3 or FLT3 ITD expression, respectively, and surface biotinylation. Further, FLT3 wild-type, or FLT3 ITD-GFP hybrid proteins were stably expressed and characterized in 32D cells, and internalization and stability were assessed by flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry, and immunoblotting. FL-stimulated surface-exposed FLT3 WT or FLT3 ITD protein showed similar endocytosis and degradation characteristics. Kinase inactivation by mutation or FLT3 inhibitor treatment strongly promoted FLT3 ITD surface localization, and attenuated but did not abrogate FL-induced internalization. Experiments with the dynamin inhibitor dynasore suggest that active FLT3 as well as FLT3 ITD is largely endocytosed via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Internalization of kinase-inactivated molecules occurred through a different yet unidentified mechanism. Our data demonstrate that FLT3 WT and constitutively active FLT3 ITD receptor follow, despite very different biogenesis kinetics, similar internalization and degradation routes.","['Kellner, Fabienne', 'Keil, Andreas', 'Schindler, Katrin', 'Tschongov, Todor', 'Hunninger, Kerstin', 'Loercher, Hannah', 'Rhein, Peter', 'Bohmer, Sylvia-Annette', 'Bohmer, Frank-D', 'Muller, Jorg P']","['Kellner F', 'Keil A', 'Schindler K', 'Tschongov T', 'Hunninger K', 'Loercher H', 'Rhein P', 'Bohmer SA', 'Bohmer FD', 'Muller JP']","['Institute for Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Fungal Septomics, Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, Hans Knoll Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', ""Luminex B.V., 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands."", 'Institute for Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0223-6781'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200310,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Duplication/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC7176853,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications', '*GFP hybrid genes', '*degradation', '*oncogene', '*plasma membrane', '*receptor endocytosis', '*receptor tyrosine kinase']",2020/03/11 06:00,2021/04/30 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.15132 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Apr;24(8):4668-4676. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.15132.

However, there are no previous clinical records of invasive stachybotryosis. METHODS: Sinus biopsy specimens from a 23-year-old male with refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia were obtained at 3 different time points during the patient's hospitalization (139 days) and examined by histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Antifungal susceptibility testing and fungal speciation using multilocus sequence typing were performed. RESULTS: Hemorrhage, fungal germination, and hyphal growth were observed in the first sinus biopsy tissues. Areas with fungal growth tested positive for Stachybotrys by IHC. Fungal isolates were genotyped and identified as Stachybotrys chlorohalonata. The patient was cured from Stachybotrys sinusitis following sinus surgery and antifungal treatment. While a subsequent second sinus biopsy and a bronchoscopy showed no signs of fungal infection, a later, third sinus biopsy tested positive for Aspergillus calidoustus, a rare human pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report the first case of invasive S. chlorohalonata sinusitis that was surgically and medically cured but followed by invasive A. calidoustus sinusitis in the setting of refractory leukemia.

Its distinct toxicities include hyperglycemia, hypertension, and mood disturbance. IND216 is a single arm phase II trial of buparlisib in Relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Fourteen patients were enrolled, 13 were evaluable for response and toxicity. Six of 13 patients had a partial response (46%) with a median duration of response of 15.5 months, all 11 patients with tumor assessment experienced tumor shrinkage. The most common adverse events (>/=15%) were hyperglycemia, fatigue, anxiety, and gastrointestinal toxicities; all were < grade 3 except for fatigue. Three patients stopped therapy for alterations in mood. Lower levels of raptor were significantly associated with greater tumor shrinkage, suggesting that raptor could be a biomarker for response. This requires further validation in a larger CLL patient cohort. The clinical activity of buparlisib is comparable to other phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitors, with a different toxicity profile.Novelty and impactBuparlisib, an oral, pan PI3 kinase inhibitor, is associated with a 46% partial response rate among patients with relapse chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Experience from one center.,197-202,10.17219/acem/112605 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a complication of organ transplantation and a life-threatening condition. Children who underwent organ transplantation are at risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders and, among them, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most serious. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the clinical course of NHL after liver and kidney transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records of children who underwent liver/kidney transplantation and developed NHL. RESULTS: Nine children were identified, all girls, 6 after liver and 3 after kidney transplantations. Age at transplantation ranged from 1 year to 13 years (median: 4 years), while age at lymphoma diagnosis from 4 to 17 years (median: 12 years). Time from transplantation to lymphoma diagnosis ranged from 7 months to 12 years (median: 9 years). All but 1 patient developed mature B-cell lymphoma, 4 children - diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 2 children - Burkitt's lymphoma, 1 child - mature B-cell leukemia, 1 child - Burkitt-like lymphoma, while 1 patient was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. High levels of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA were found in blood of 3 patients, and EBV in tissue samples was detected in 4 patients. Six patients presented with stage III and 2 with stage IV disease. Two patients had graft involvement. Three children received chemotherapy according to R-CHOP, 3 LMB protocol (2 with addition of rituximab), while 1 received CHOP and 5 courses of COP. T-cell lymphoma patient was treated with Euro-LB protocol. Six out of 8 treated patients are alive with a median follow-up of 6 years. Two children died from disease progression during treatment and 1 from cerebral herniation before starting therapy. All patients experienced at least 1 toxic episode of grade 3 and 4 according to Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event (CTCAE). Complications of chemotherapy were manageable and there were no transplanted organ failures. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides further data on the treatment and outcome of monomorphic PTLD and indicates that it is feasible to treat solid organ recipients with multiagent chemotherapy.","['Dembowska-Baginska, Bozenna', 'Wakulinska, Anna', 'Daniluk, Iwona', 'Teisseyre, Joanna', 'Jankowska, Irena', 'Czubkowski, Piotr', 'Grenda, Ryszard', 'Jarmuzek, Wioletta', 'Grajkowska, Wieslawa', 'Maldyk, Jagoda', 'Kalicinski, Piotr']","['Dembowska-Baginska B', 'Wakulinska A', 'Daniluk I', 'Teisseyre J', 'Jankowska I', 'Czubkowski P', 'Grenda R', 'Jarmuzek W', 'Grajkowska W', 'Maldyk J', 'Kalicinski P']","[""Department of Oncology, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", ""Department of Oncology, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", ""Department of Oncology, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery and Organ Transplantation, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", ""Department of Nephrology, Kidney Transplantation and Hypertension, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", ""Department of Nephrology, Kidney Transplantation and Hypertension, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", ""Department of Pathology, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland."", 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery and Organ Transplantation, Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warszawa, Poland.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Liver Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['PTLD', 'children', 'non-Hodgkin lymphomas', 'post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders']",2020/03/11 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/112605 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2020 Feb;29(2):197-202. doi: 10.17219/acem/112605.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sanger sequencing (SS) is the most frequently used method for diagnostic BCR-ABL1 KD mutation screening, but it has some limitations-it is poorly sensitive and cannot robustly identify compound mutations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) may overcome these problems. NSG is increasingly available and has the potential to become the method of choice for diagnostic BCR-ABL1 KD mutation screening. A group discussion within an ad hoc constituted Panel of Experts has produced a series of consensus-based statements on the potential value of NGS testing before and during first-line TKI-based treatment, in relapsed/refractory cases, before and after allo-stem cell transplantation, and on how NGS results may impact on therapeutic decisions. A set of minimal technical and methodological requirements for the analysis and the reporting of results has also been defined.

Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 receptor signaling and proliferation in cells exogenously expressing FLT3 including FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), FLT3 D835Y, and FLT3 ITD D835Y, and it induced apoptosis in leukemic cells expressing FLT3 ITD. The recommended starting dose of gilteritinib is 120 mg (three 40 mg tablets) once daily. Gilteritinib was evaluated in one, phase III, open-label, multicenter, randomized study of gilteritinib (n = 247, gilteritinib arm) versus salvage chemotherapy (n = 124, salvage chemotherapy arm) in patients with relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutation. Overall survival (OS) was statistically significantly different between the two groups with a median OS of 9.3 months in the gilteritinib arm compared with 5.6 months for salvage chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.637; 95% confidence interval, 0.490-0.830; p = .0004 one-sided log-rank test). The most common adverse reactions with gilteritinib treatment were blood creatine phosphokinase increase, alanine aminotransferase increase, aspartate aminotransferase increase, blood alkaline phosphatase increase, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, constipation, cough, peripheral edema, dyspnea, dizziness, hypotension, pain in extremity, asthenia, arthralgia, and myalgia. The objective of this article is to summarize the scientific review of the application leading to regulatory approval in the EU. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Xospata was approved in the European Union as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation. Gilteritinib resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement of overall survival compared with salvage chemotherapy. At the time of the marketing authorization of gilteritinib, there were no approved standard therapies specifically for adult patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutation. In terms of safety, the overall accepted safety profile was considered manageable.","['Tzogani, Kyriaki', 'Roshol, Hilde', 'Olsen, Helga Haugom', 'Aas, Ida B', 'Dalhus, Marianne Loiten', 'Hakonsen, Gro Dahlseng', 'Nilssen, Laila Sortvik', 'Lindberg, Vibeke', 'Okvist, Mats', 'Bolstad, Bjorg', 'Rogovska, Irena', 'Karpova, Natalja', 'Enzmann, Harald', 'Gisselbrecht, Christian', 'Pignatti, Francesco']","['Tzogani K', 'Roshol H', 'Olsen HH', 'Aas IB', 'Dalhus ML', 'Hakonsen GD', 'Nilssen LS', 'Lindberg V', 'Okvist M', 'Bolstad B', 'Rogovska I', 'Karpova N', 'Enzmann H', 'Gisselbrecht C', 'Pignatti F']","['European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Statens legemiddelverk, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Statens legemiddelverk, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Statens legemiddelverk, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Statens legemiddelverk, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Statens legemiddelverk, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Statens legemiddelverk, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Statens legemiddelverk, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Statens legemiddelverk, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Statens legemiddelverk, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Zalu valsts agentura, Riga, Latvia.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Zalu valsts agentura, Riga, Latvia.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Bundesinstitut fur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, Bonn, Germany.', 'Hospital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200310,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Mutation', 'Pyrazines', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC7356782,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*European Medicines Agency', '*Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3', '*Gilteritinib (Xospata)']",2020/03/11 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0976 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2020 Jul;25(7):e1070-e1076. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0976.

Their name giving major component, PML protein, is essential for their formation. PML is present in many different isoforms due to differential splicing, which seem to contribute differently to PML NBs function. Sp100 and DAXX are also permanently residing in these structures. PML NBs disassemble in mitosis to form large cytoplasmic aggregates and reassemble after completion of cell division. Posttranslational modifications such as SUMOylation play important roles for protein association with PML NBs. In addition to the factors permanently associated with PML NBs, a large number of proteins may transiently reside in PML NBs dependent on cell stage, type, and condition. PML NBs have been indirectly implicated in a large number of cellular processes including apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair and replication. They are considered hot spots for posttranslational modifications and may serve as readily accessible protein depots. However, a precise function has been difficult to assign. Many DNA viruses target PML NBs after entry often resulting in reorganization of these subnuclear structures. Antiviral activity has been assigned to PML NBs partially based on the observation that PML protein is an interferon stimulated gene. In contrast, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection requires the presence of PML protein suggesting that PML NBs may be essential to establish infection. This review will summarize and discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role of PML NBs and individual protein components in the establishment of HPV infection.","['Guion, Lucile G', 'Sapp, Martin']","['Guion LG', 'Sapp M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular and Tumor Virology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, United States.', 'Feist Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular and Tumor Virology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, United States.', 'Feist Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, United States.']",,['eng'],"['P30 GM110703/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI081809/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI132149/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200219,Switzerland,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,101585359,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies', '*Leukemia', 'Nuclear Proteins', '*Papillomavirus Infections', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein']",PMC7045071,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HPV-human papillomavirus', '*Innate immnuity', '*L2 protein', '*PML', '*PML nuclear bodies', '*infectious entry', '*transcription']",2020/03/11 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcimb.2020.00035 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2020 Feb 19;10:35. doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2020.00035. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Guion and Sapp.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present investigation evaluates the synergistic mechanism of action of vitamins, such as L-ascorbic acid (L-AA) and alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TOC) in As2O3 chemotherapy using human leukemia (HL-60) cells. In vitro assays on the cytotoxicity of As2O3 and vitamins and cellular apoptotic evidences were done; a proteomic investigation with mass spectrometry was also performed. The combination of L-AA and alpha-TOC potentiates As2O3 cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells, substantiated by depletion in antioxidant status, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and inhibition of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and B-cell lymphoma 2 transcription factors. Mass spectrometry results showed decreased expression of proteins regulating cell cycle and translation in cells treated with As2O3, L-AA, and alpha-TOC when compared with As2O3-treated sample. In addition, this combination treatment identified numerous proteins associated with apoptosis and cell stress. HL-60 cells became more prone to As2O3 on exposure to L-AA and alpha-TOC, indicating that this combination may be a promising approach to increase the outcome of As2O3 chemotherapy.","['Vineetha, Radhakrishnan Chandraprabha', 'Hariharan, Sreedharan', 'Jaleel, Abdul', 'Chandran, Mahesh', 'Nair, Raveendran Harikumaran']","['Vineetha RC', 'Hariharan S', 'Jaleel A', 'Chandran M', 'Nair RH']","['Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India.', 'Proteomics Facility, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Trivandrum, India.', 'Proteomics Facility, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Trivandrum, India.', 'Physiology Research Laboratory, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, India.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200221,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7047343,,['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60 cells', 'L-ascorbic acid', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic trioxide', 'alpha-tocopherol']",2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:01,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00065 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Feb 21;10:65. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00065. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Vineetha, Hariharan, Jaleel, Chandran and Nair.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It therefore is essential to further define features, e.g., FLT3 alterations and KMT2A rearrangements, associated with inferior survival early to augment or alter therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes. Methods: To gain insights into the genetic drivers predictive of aggressive clinical behavior among pediatric leukemia patients, we performed comprehensive integrative clinical sequencing (ICS), including paired tumor/normal DNA sequencing and RNA-seq, for pediatric patients who presented at our institution over a period of five years with acute lymphoblastic or myelogenous leukemia (ALL and AML; n=43) and high-risk clinical features (high white blood cell count, extramedullary disease, or refractory and/or relapsed disease). Results: We found that RAS- and Ras-pathway aberrations, including N-RAS, NF1 and PTPN11, are frequent somatic mutations and, importantly, associated with decreased event free and overall survival (OS) (P=0.04, median event free survival 22.8 vs. 5.6 months; P=0.04, median OS 124 vs. 22.5 months). Conclusions: We thus propose that hyperactive Ras signaling confers inferior survival in high-risk pediatric acute leukemia and that Ras pathways should be molecularly characterized to inform clinical decision making and to identify patients for experimental clinical trials and RAS-targeted therapy.","['Ney, Gina M', 'Anderson, Bailey', 'Bender, Jonathan', 'Kumar-Sinha, Chandan', 'Wu, Yi-Mi', 'Vats, Pankaj', 'Cieslik, Marcin', 'Robinson, Dan R', 'Li, Qing', 'Chinnaiyan, Arul M', 'Mody, Rajen']","['Ney GM', 'Anderson B', 'Bender J', 'Kumar-Sinha C', 'Wu YM', 'Vats P', 'Cieslik M', 'Robinson DR', 'Li Q', 'Chinnaiyan AM', 'Mody R']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 HL132392/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007622/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 HG006508/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,China,Transl Pediatr,Translational pediatrics,101649179,,,,PMC7036640,,['NOTNLM'],"['Integrative clinical sequencing (ICS)', 'Ras', 'pediatric leukemia']",2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:01,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/tp.2019.12.03 [doi]', 'tp-09-01-43 [pii]']",ppublish,Transl Pediatr. 2020 Feb;9(1):43-50. doi: 10.21037/tp.2019.12.03.,,['2020 Translational Pediatrics.

However, paired ALL samples of initial diagnosis and relapse subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) could construct clonal lineage changes, and help to explore the key issues in the evolutionary process of tumor clones. Therefore, we aim to analyze gene alterations during the initial diagnosis and relapse of ALL patients and to explore the underlying mechanism. Methods: Targeted exome sequencing technology was used to detect molecular characteristic of initial diagnosis and relapse of ALL in 12 pediatric patients. Clinical features, treatment response, prognostic factors and genetic features were analyzed. Results: In our 12 paired samples, 75% of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients had alterations in the Ras pathway (NRAS, KRAS, NF1, and EPOR), and Ras mutation are very common in patients with ALL relapse. TP53 mutations mainly existed in the primary clones and occurred at the initial diagnosis and relapse of ALL. Relapse-associated genes such as NT5C2 and CREBBP were observed in patients with ALL relapse; however, all patients included in this study had gene abnormalities in the Ras pathway, and NT5C2 and CREBBP genes may collaboratively promote ALL relapse. Conclusions: Among the 12 ALL patients, Ras pathway mutations are common in ALL relapse and may be associated with other recurrence-related genes alterations. The study with paired samples could improve the understanding of ALL relapse.","['Zhang, Hong-Hong', 'Wang, Hong-Sheng', 'Qian, Xiao-Wen', 'Zhu, Xiao-Hua', 'Miao, Hui', 'Yu, Yi', 'Meng, Jian-Hua', 'Le, Jun', 'Jiang, Jun-Ye', 'Cao, Ping', 'Jiang, Wen-Jing', 'Wang, Ping', 'Fu, Yang', 'Li, Jun', 'Qian, Mao-Xiang', 'Zhai, Xiao-Wen']","['Zhang HH', 'Wang HS', 'Qian XW', 'Zhu XH', 'Miao H', 'Yu Y', 'Meng JH', 'Le J', 'Jiang JY', 'Cao P', 'Jiang WJ', 'Wang P', 'Fu Y', 'Li J', 'Qian MX', 'Zhai XW']","[""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Transl Pediatr,Translational pediatrics,101649179,,,,PMC7036641,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'gene mutations', 'next-generation sequencing (NGS)', 'relapse, pediatric']",2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:01,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/tp.2020.01.07 [doi]', 'tp-09-01-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Transl Pediatr. 2020 Feb;9(1):4-12. doi: 10.21037/tp.2020.01.07.,,['2020 Translational Pediatrics.

Heightened risk of CVD is often attributable to treatment with anthracycline chemotherapy. Anthracycline-mediated cardiac injury may lie latent for years following cessation of treatment and is therefore often not detected until disease is advanced and aggressive therapy is required. Symptomatic CVD may be preceded by subclinical cardiac and vascular dysfunction. This study aimed to determine whether such dysfunction could be detected in healthy, anthracycline-treated survivors of childhood leukaemia. Methods: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) with late gadolinium enhancement and endothelial function were used to characterise pre-clinical stages of CVD. Twenty-two long-term (>5 years survival; age 21 +/- 3 years) childhood leukaemia survivors were assessed. All survivors were asymptomatic and had normal resting echocardiography. To exclude potential confounding effects of radiotherapy, no survivors had received this treatment. Twenty-two similarly aged (25 +/- 3 years) gender-matched controls were recruited for comparison. Results: Left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in the survivors (55.0 +/- 4.6%) compared to the controls (59.4 +/- 6.2%; p = 0.010). Further, five survivors (23%) had clinically reduced (<50%) left ventricular ejection fraction. Normalised left ventricular end systolic volume was augmented in survivors (40.0 +/- 9.1 mL.m(2) vs. 34.5 +/- 7.5 mL.m(2); p = 0.038). Cardiac MRI did not show any late gadolinium enhancement. High resolution, ultrasound-derived flow mediated dilation was impaired in survivors (6.7 +/- 2.1% vs. 8.60 +/- 1.91%, p = 0.005). Conclusions: We detected subclinical changes in cardiovascular structure and function indicative of early disease in anthracycline-treated childhood leukaemia survivors with normal echocardiography. Early detection and characterisation of underlying disease allows for timely intervention and improved outcomes in this at-risk population.","['Long, Treya M', 'Marsh, Channa E', 'Dembo, Lawrence G', 'Watson, Philip', 'Wallman, Karen E', 'Walwyn, Thomas S', 'Choong, Catherine S', 'Naylor, Louise H']","['Long TM', 'Marsh CE', 'Dembo LG', 'Watson P', 'Wallman KE', 'Walwyn TS', 'Choong CS', 'Naylor LH']","['1School of Human Sciences: Exercise and Sport Science, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7910grid.1012.2', '1School of Human Sciences: Exercise and Sport Science, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7910grid.1012.2', 'Envision Medical Imaging, 178-190 Cambridge St, Wembley, WA 6014 Australia.', '3Advanced Heart Failure Unit and Cardiac Transplant Service of Western Australia, Fiona Stanley Hospital, 11 Robin Warren Dr, Murdoch, WA 6150 Australia.0000 0004 4680 1997grid.459958.c', 'Envision Medical Imaging, 178-190 Cambridge St, Wembley, WA 6014 Australia.', '1School of Human Sciences: Exercise and Sport Science, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7910grid.1012.2', '4School of Medicine: Paediatrics, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7910grid.1012.2', ""5Department of Haematology and Oncology, Perth Children's Hospital, 15 Hospital Ave, Nedlands, WA 6009 Australia.0000 0004 0625 8600grid.410667.2"", '4School of Medicine: Paediatrics, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7910grid.1012.2', ""6Department of Endocrinology, Perth Children's Hospital, 15 Hospital Ave, Nedlands, WA 6009 Australia.0000 0004 0625 8600grid.410667.2"", '1School of Human Sciences: Exercise and Sport Science, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7910grid.1012.2']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190814,England,Cardiooncology,"Cardio-oncology (London, England)",101689938,,,,PMC7048057,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anthracyclines', 'Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging', 'Childhood leukaemia', 'Late cardiotoxicity', 'Long-term survival']",2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:01,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40959-019-0047-4 [doi]', '47 [pii]']",epublish,Cardiooncology. 2019 Aug 14;5:11. doi: 10.1186/s40959-019-0047-4. eCollection 2019.,,['(c) The Author(s). 2019.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

DC vaccination is a promising strategy to induce anti-leukaemic immune responses. Methods: We conducted a first-in-human phase I study using TLR7/8-matured DCs transfected with RNA encoding the two AML-associated antigens WT1 and PRAME as well as CMVpp65. AML patients in CR at high risk of relapse were vaccinated 10x over 26 weeks. Results: Despite heavy pretreatment, DCs of sufficient number and quality were generated from a single leukapheresis in 11/12 cases, and 10 patients were vaccinated. Administration was safe and resulted in local inflammatory responses with dense T-cell infiltration. In peripheral blood, increased antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells were seen for WT1 (2/10), PRAME (4/10) and CMVpp65 (9/10). For CMVpp65, increased CD4(+) T cells were detected in 4/7 patients, and an antibody response was induced in 3/7 initially seronegative patients. Median OS was not reached after 1057 days; median RFS was 1084 days. A positive correlation was observed between clinical benefit and younger age as well as mounting of antigen-specific immune responses. Conclusions: Administration of TLR7/8-matured DCs to AML patients in CR at high risk of relapse was feasible and safe and resulted in induction of antigen-specific immune responses.

However, some of these survivors are at risk of distant complications including cardiovascular disease. We aimed to examine the risk of overweight/obesity and abnormal body composition in a large group of patients from our paediatric oncology centre. We used anthropometric methods and electrical bioimpedance to assess these features, and then determined their association with disease and treatment. We found patients treated for leukaemia/lymphoma (especially boys) had significantly higher rates of overweight/obesity compared to the other patient groups. On the contrary, overweight/obesity was more common in girls among patients treated for solid tumours. Patients treated for leukaemia/lymphoma were characterised by a higher body fat content compared to those treated for solid tumours and controls. During treatment for cancer, patients had a higher percentage of muscle mass deficiency compared to those in the control group. Our regression analysis showed time from completion of treatment, gender and type of therapy (radiotherapy, megachemotherapy) were associated with body weight and body composition including fat and muscle content. We recommend paediatricians and general practitioners should actively try to detect and prevent cardiovascular disease among childhood cancer survivors.","['Sawicka-Zukowska, Malgorzata', 'Luczynski, Wlodzimierz', 'Dobroch, Jakub', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna']","['Sawicka-Zukowska M', 'Luczynski W', 'Dobroch J', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, 17 Waszyngtona Street, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, 17 Waszyngtona Street, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.', 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5437-7119.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, 17 Waszyngtona Street, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, 17 Waszyngtona Street, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200113,England,Ecancermedicalscience,Ecancermedicalscience,101392236,,,,PMC7032940,,['NOTNLM'],"['child cancer survivor', 'fat tissue', 'obesity', 'paediatric oncology']",2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:01,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3332/ecancer.2020.999 [doi]', 'can-14-999 [pii]']",epublish,Ecancermedicalscience. 2020 Jan 13;14:999. doi: 10.3332/ecancer.2020.999. eCollection 2020.,,['(c) the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.'],,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In hematopoietic cell transplantation, most of the so-called graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect hinges on the recognition of histocompatibility antigens that reflect immunologically relevant genetic variants between donors and recipients. Whether other variants acquired during the neoplastic transformation, or the aberrant expression of gene products can yield antigenic targets of similar relevance as the minor histocompatibility antigens is actively being pursued. Modern genomics and proteomics have enabled the high throughput identification of candidate antigens for immunotherapy in both autologous and allogeneic settings. As such, these major histocompatibility complex-associated tumor-specific (TSA) and tumor-associated antigens (TAA) can allow for the targeting of multiple blood neoplasms, which is a limitation for other immunotherapeutic approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells. We review the current strategies taken to translate these discoveries into T-cell therapies and propose how these could be introduced in clinical practice. Specifically, we discuss the criteria that are used to select the antigens with the greatest therapeutic value and we review the various T-cell manufacturing approaches in place to either expand antigen-specific T cells from the native repertoire or genetically engineer T cells with minor histocompatibility antigen or TSA/TAA-specific recombinant T-cell receptors. Finally, we elaborate on the current and future incorporation of these therapeutic T-cell products into the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Janelle, Valerie', 'Rulleau, Caroline', 'Del Testa, Simon', 'Carli, Cedric', 'Delisle, Jean-Sebastien']","['Janelle V', 'Rulleau C', 'Del Testa S', 'Carli C', 'Delisle JS']","[""Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Departement de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division Hematologie et Oncologie, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200221,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC7046834,,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell immunotherapy', '*allogeneic stem cell transplant', '*chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)', '*histocompatibility antigens', '*transgenic T-cell receptors', '*tumor-associated antigens (TAA)', '*tumor-specific antigens (TSA)', '*viral antigens']",2020/03/11 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00276 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Feb 21;11:276. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00276. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Janelle, Rulleau, Del Testa, Carli and Delisle.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ascorbic acid (AA) also produces a selective cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Here, we exploit the potential benefit of ATO/AA combination in generating cytotoxicity to CRC cells, which may lay the groundwork for the potential combinational chemotherapy of CRCs. According to the results, we found that ATO and AA effectively inhibited the viability of human CRC cells in a synergistic manner. AA and ATO corporately activated caspase-3 to trigger apoptosis and upregulated the expression of caspase-1 and promoted formation of inflammasomes to induce pyroptosis. Furthermore, the stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction was demonstrated as a subcellular mechanism for apoptosis and pyroptosis induced by ATO/AA combination treatment. Our findings suggest that ATO combination with a conventional dosage of AA offers an advantage for killing CRC cells. The synergistic action of ATO/AA combination might be considered a plausible strategy for the treatment of CRC and perhaps other solid tumors as well.","['Tian, Wei', 'Wang, Zhuo', 'Tang, Nan-Nan', 'Li, Jia-Tong', 'Liu, Yu', 'Chu, Wen-Feng', 'Yang, Bao-Feng']","['Tian W', 'Wang Z', 'Tang NN', 'Li JT', 'Liu Y', 'Chu WF', 'Yang BF']","['Department of Pharmacology, The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine Pharmaceutics of China, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research, Ministry of Education, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University at Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine Pharmaceutics of China, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research, Ministry of Education, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University at Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine Pharmaceutics of China, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research, Ministry of Education, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University at Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine Pharmaceutics of China, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research, Ministry of Education, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University at Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine Pharmaceutics of China, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research, Ministry of Education, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University at Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine Pharmaceutics of China, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research, Ministry of Education, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University at Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The State-Province Key Laboratories of Biomedicine Pharmaceutics of China, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research, Ministry of Education, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University at Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200221,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC7047232,,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'arsenic trioxide', 'ascorbic acid', 'colorectal cancer', 'pyroptosis', 'reactive oxygen species']",2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:01,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2020.00123 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Feb 21;11:123. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.00123. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Tian, Wang, Tang, Li, Liu, Chu and Yang.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study is planned to investigate the prognostic role of pre-transplant soluble TIM-3 (sTIM-3) levels in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients. Methods: Pre-transplant serum sTIM-3 levels were measured in 177 allo-HSCT recipients [median age: 36(16-66) years; male/female: 111/66]. Results: Pre-transplant sTIM-3 levels were significantly higher in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients compared to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (p = 0.01). Pre-transplant sTIM-3 levels were significantly lower in patients with abnormal cytogenetics (p = 0.017). Pre-transplant sTIM-3 levels were significantly higher in patients who developed viral hemorrhagic cystitis (p = 0.034). A positive correlation was demonstrated between sTIM-3 levels and acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) grade (p = 0.013; r = 0.299). Overall survival (OS) was not statistically different between low- and high-TIM-3 groups (%35.2 vs %20.4; p > 0.05). Primary diagnosis (p = 0.042), sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (p < 0.001), acute GvHD (p = 0.001), chronic GvHD (p = 0.009) and post-transplant relapse (p = 0.003) represented significant impact on OS. Discussion: Increased sTIM-3 levels in AML patients seem to be compatible with the previous reports. The inhibitor role of TIM-3 in cellular immune response may be a possible explanation for the association of sTIM-3 with viral infections and GvHD. However, the main challenge remains to be the ambiguous association of pre-transplant sTIM-3 levels and post-transplant complications, as allo-HSCT recipients are expected to represent donor genetic features in the post-transplant setting. Conclusion: Further studies are warranted to clarify the particular role of sTIM-3 in the allo-HSCT setting.","['Yegin, Zeynep Arzu', 'Can, Ferda', 'Aydin Kaynar, Lale', 'Gokcen, Sanem', 'Eren Sadioglu, Rezzan', 'Ozkurt, Zubeyde Nur', 'Karacaoglu, Ozlem']","['Yegin ZA', 'Can F', 'Aydin Kaynar L', 'Gokcen S', 'Eren Sadioglu R', 'Ozkurt ZN', 'Karacaoglu O']","['Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Gazi University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0212-9663', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9761-0320']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['TIM-3', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'cytogenetics', 'graft versus host disease', 'prognosis', 'viral hemorrhagic cystitis']",2020/03/11 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1738097 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2020 Dec;25(1):125-133. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1738097.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most people encounter BPA in their daily routines. However, it has been heavily reported that BPA has a neurotoxic effect. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of lycopene on cognitive deficits induced by a high dose of BPA focusing on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and memory retrieval in adult male rats. Therefore, 72 rats were divided into four groups: control group, BPA group (50 mg/kg body weight (bw)) 3 days a week for 42 days, lycopene group (10 mg/kg bw) daily for 42 days, and lycopene + BPA group. Concurrent treatment of lycopene with BPA improved the learning and cognition memory in Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests along with an increase in acetylcholine esterase activity as well as inhibition of oxidative stress by restoring reduced glutathione and suppressing malondialdehyde hippocampal level to their normal levels. Mechanistically, lycopene upregulated the protein expression of tyrosine receptor kinase B, which resulted in an upsurge in its downstream cascades MAPK/ERK1/2/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway in the hippocampus of BPA-intoxicated rats. Furthermore, concurrent treatment of lycopene with BPA prevented apoptosis by marked decrease in Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) gene expression and caspase 3 activity while restoring B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) gene expression. In conclusion, the present study provided evidence that lycopene exerted a neuroprotective effect against BPA intoxication in hippocampi of rats via its antioxidant properties, activation of MAPK/ERK pathway, and inhibiting a neuronal apoptosis which reflected on improving the learning and cognition memory.","['El Morsy, E M', 'Ahmed, Mae']","['El Morsy EM', 'Ahmed M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Helwan, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Misr University for Science and Technology (MUST), 6th of October City, Giza, Egypt.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2874-6210'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200310,England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,"['0 (Bdnf protein, rat)', '0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (CREB1 protein, rat)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Endocrine Disruptors)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ntrk2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkB)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'MLT3645I99 (bisphenol A)', 'SB0N2N0WV6 (Lycopene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzhydryl Compounds/*toxicity', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity', 'Hippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lycopene/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Maze Learning/drug effects', 'Memory Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Phenols/*toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptor, trkB/metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bisphenol A', 'ERK', 'MAPK', 'cognitive deficits', 'lycopene', 'oxidative stress']",2020/03/11 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0960327120909882 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2020 Aug;39(8):1066-1078. doi: 10.1177/0960327120909882.

Using the stable form with the best degradation ability against the BCR-ABL fusion and ABL proteins in myelogenous leukemia K562 cells, we showed that Azo-PROTAC combines the potent protein knockdown and facile cell uptake properties of the small-molecule PROTAC with a reversible photoswitchability, offering a promising chemical knockdown strategy based on the light-induced reversible on/off properties.","['Jin, Yu-Hui', 'Lu, Meng-Chen', 'Wang, Yan', 'Shan, Wen-Xin', 'Wang, Xuan-Yu', 'You, Qi-Dong', 'Jiang, Zheng-Yu']","['Jin YH', 'Lu MC', 'Wang Y', 'Shan WX', 'Wang XY', 'You QD', 'Jiang ZY']","['State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiang Su Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiang Su Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiang Su Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiang Su Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiang Su Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines and Jiang Su Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8587-0122', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1671-1582']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200319,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (CRBN protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Azo Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/radiation effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/radiation effects', 'Ligands', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,,,,2020/03/11 06:00,2020/11/03 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b02058 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2020 May 14;63(9):4644-4654. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b02058.

Cancer is a complex disease where multiple gene loci contribute to the phenotype. The ability to simultaneously monitor differential expression originating from each locus allows for a more accurate indication into the degree of cancerous activity than either locus alone. Metal nanoparticles have been widely used as labels for in vitro identification and quantification of target sequences.Here we describe the synthesis of nanoparticles with different noble metal compositions in an alloy format that are then functionalized with thiol-modified ssDNA (nanoprobes). We also show how such nanoprobes are used in a non-cross-linking colorimetric method for the direct detection and quantification of specific mRNA targets, without the need for enzymatic amplification or reverse-transcription steps. The different metals in the alloy provide for distinct absorption spectra due to their characteristic plasmon resonance peaks. The color multiplexing allows for simultaneous identification of different mRNA targets involved in cancer development. A comparison of the absorption spectra of the nanoprobe mixtures taken before and after induced aggregation of metal nanoparticles allows to both identify and quantify each mRNA target. We describe the use of gold and gold-silver alloy nanoprobes for the development of the non-cross-linking method to detect a specific BCR-ABL fusion gene (e.g., e1a2 and e14a2) mRNA target associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using 10 ng/muL of unamplified total human RNA. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of this approach for the direct diagnostics of CML. This simple methodology takes less than 50 min to complete after total RNA extraction with comparable specificity and sensitivity to the more commonly used methods.","['Baptista, Pedro Viana']",['Baptista PV'],"['Departamento de Ciencias da Vida, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, UCIBIO, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal. pmvb@fct.unl.pt.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Alloys)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Alloys/chemistry', 'Colorimetry', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Metal Nanoparticles', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/*chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Colorimetric method', '*Gene expression', '*Gold nanoparticles', '*Gold-silver alloy nanoparticles', '*Nanoprobes', '*mRNA detection']",2020/03/11 06:00,2021/01/30 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-0716-0319-2_19 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2020;2118:251-268. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0319-2_19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we report the case of a 73-year-old hemodialysis patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who was treated with dasatinib. For 5 years prior, the patient had received nilotinib for the treatment of CML. Regular hemodialysis was initiated due to progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis, whereupon nilotinib was discontinued and the patient began receiving 100 mg dose of dasatinib once daily. On dialysis days, dasatinib was administered immediately after completion of dialysis. Four months after starting dasatinib, we performed a pharmacokinetic study. The plasma concentrations of dasatinib before, immediately, and 2 h after the completion of hemodialysis were 7.4, 6.1, and 59.5 ng/mL, respectively. Ultrasound cardiography revealed a gradual decline in ejection fraction during dasatinib therapy. Because the patient's dasatinib trough concentration was higher (6.1 ng/mL) than the target level (1.5 ng/mL), we suspected the development of dasatinib-related heart dysfunction; thus, dasatinib was discontinued 6 months after its initiation. We concluded that hemodialysis patients are potentially vulnerable to the cardiotoxic effects of dasatinib; monitoring of cardiac function and plasma drug concentration may thus be useful in assessing their condition.","['Mori, Jinichi', 'Oshima, Kumi', 'Tanimoto, Tetsuya', 'Ishizuka, Hikari', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Miura, Masatomo', 'Takahashi, Naoto']","['Mori J', 'Oshima K', 'Tanimoto T', 'Ishizuka H', 'Kimura S', 'Miura M', 'Takahashi N']","['Department of Hematology, Jyoban Hospital, Tokiwa Foundation, 57 Kaminodai Kamiyunagayamachi Jyoban, Iwaki, Fukushima, 972-8322, Japan. jinichi-mori@tokiwa.or.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Jyoban Hospital, Tokiwa Foundation, 57 Kaminodai Kamiyunagayamachi Jyoban, Iwaki, Fukushima, 972-8322, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Jyoban Hospital, Tokiwa Foundation, 57 Kaminodai Kamiyunagayamachi Jyoban, Iwaki, Fukushima, 972-8322, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Fukushima Rosai Hospital, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",,['eng'],['17K08408/Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200309,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Cardiotoxins)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/blood', '*Cardiotoxins', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Heart Failure/*chemically induced/diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/complications', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', '*Renal Dialysis', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/etiology/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Stroke Volume', 'Time Factors', 'Withholding Treatment']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Dasatinib', 'Hemodialysis', 'Pharmacokinetics']",2020/03/11 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02846-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02846-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Jul;112(1):115-117. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02846-5.

Seventy-three patients were identified, 16 of whom received PPIs or H2RAs concurrently with dasatinib. Major molecular response at 12 months was observed in 13 of 13 patients (100%) with concurrent PPIs or H2RAs (combination group), and in 23 of 51 patients (45.1%) who received only dasatinib (dasatinib-alone group; P < 0.001). Deep molecular response at 12 months was observed in four of six patients (66.7%) in the combination group, and seven of 38 patients (18.4%) in the dasatinib-alone group (P = 0.027). Dasatinib chemotherapy was stopped after 18 months for 25 patients (43.9%) from the dasatinib-alone group, but for none from the combination group.

Cytarabine remains the main drug to treat AML, and several studies have explored the prognostic relevance of the genotype of cytarabine metabolizing enzymes in AML. Glucuronidation has been identified to be relevant in the cytarabine clearance, but there are still few data concerning the clinical impact of genetic polymorphisms known to condition the activity of UDP-glucuronosyl transferases in AML patients. Here we report the association between the UGT1A1 rs8175347 genotype and the clinical outcome of 455 intermediate-risk cytogenetic AML patients receiving cytarabine-based chemotherapy. Patients with the UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant (associated to a lower UGT1A1 activity) had a lower overall survival (OS) (25.8% vs. 45.5%; p: 0.004). Multivariate analysis confirmed this association (p: 0.008; HR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.16-2.76). Subgroup analysis showed the negative effect of the UGT1A1*28 homozygous genotype on OS in women (14.8% vs. 52.7%; p: 0.001) but not in men. This lower OS was associated with longer neutropenia after consolidation chemotherapy and with higher mortality without previous relapse, suggesting an association between a low glucuronidation activity and mortal toxic events.","['Diaz-Santa, Johana', 'Rodriguez-Romanos, Rocio', 'Osca, Gemma', 'Pratcorona, Marta', 'Garrido, Ana', 'Coll, Rosa', 'Moret, Carla', 'Escoda, Lourdes', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Heras, Inma', 'Arnan, Montse', 'Vives, Susanna', 'Salamero, Olga', 'Lloveras, Natalia', 'Bargay, Joan', 'Sampol, Antonia', 'Cruz, David', 'Garcia, Antoni', 'Quinones, Teresa', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Gallardo, David']","['Diaz-Santa J', 'Rodriguez-Romanos R', 'Osca G', 'Pratcorona M', 'Garrido A', 'Coll R', 'Moret C', 'Escoda L', 'Tormo M', 'Heras I', 'Arnan M', 'Vives S', 'Salamero O', 'Lloveras N', 'Bargay J', 'Sampol A', 'Cruz D', 'Garcia A', 'Quinones T', 'Esteve J', 'Sierra J', 'Gallardo D']","[""Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO), Girona.

We examined whether dasatinib, a multi kinase inhibitor, which is broadly used for chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia is effective on EBV-positive B cell malignancies, using lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro and in vivo. As a result, in vitro experiments showed that dasatinib induced cell death of the EBV-LCLs which was not accompanied with a lytic reactivation of EBVs. To evaluate the effectiveness in EBV latency type III represented by immunodeficiency lymphoma, LCL-inoculated immunodeficient NOD/shi-scid/Il2rg(nul) (NOG) mice were treated with dasatinib. However, in vivo experiments revealed that dasatinib treatment exacerbated tumor cell infiltration into the spleen of LCL-inoculated NOG mice, whereas tumor size at the inoculated site was not affected by the treatment. These results suggest that dasatinib exacerbates the pathogenesis at least in some situations although the drug is effective in vitro. Hence, we should carefully examine a possibility of dasatinib repositioning for EBV(+) B cell malignancies.","['Kotaki, Ryutaro', 'Kawashima, Masaharu', 'Yamamoto, Yuichiro', 'Higuchi, Hiroshi', 'Nagashima, Etsuko', 'Kurosaki, Natsumi', 'Takamatsu, Masako', 'Kikuti, Yara Yukie', 'Imadome, Ken-Ichi', 'Nakamura, Naoya', 'Kotani, Ai']","['Kotaki R', 'Kawashima M', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Higuchi H', 'Nagashima E', 'Kurosaki N', 'Takamatsu M', 'Kikuti YY', 'Imadome KI', 'Nakamura N', 'Kotani A']","['Department of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Science, Tokai University, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Science, Tokai University, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Science, Tokai University, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Science, Tokai University, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research Institute of Science and Technology, Tokai University, 4-1-1 Kitakinme, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Science, Tokai University, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Science, Tokai University, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Science, Tokai University, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, National Center for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancy, Institute of Medical Science, Tokai University, Shimokasuya 143, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan. aikotani@k-lab.jp.', 'Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama, Japan. aikotani@k-lab.jp.', 'AMED-PRIME, Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, Tokyo, Japan. aikotani@k-lab.jp.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200309,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dasatinib/*adverse effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/*virology', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Splenomegaly/*etiology/*pathology']",PMC7062761,,,,2020/03/11 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-61300-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-61300-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Mar 9;10(1):4355. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-61300-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How alternate splicing regulates tumor development and resistance to targeted therapies in cancer remain poorly understood. Here we show that RNF113A, whose loss-of-function causes the X-linked trichothiodystrophy, is overexpressed in lung cancer and protects from Cisplatin-dependent cell death. RNF113A is a RNA-binding protein which regulates the splicing of multiple candidates involved in cell survival. RNF113A deficiency triggers cell death upon DNA damage through multiple mechanisms, including apoptosis via the destabilization of the prosurvival protein MCL-1, ferroptosis due to enhanced SAT1 expression, and increased production of ROS due to altered Noxa1 expression. RNF113A deficiency circumvents the resistance to Cisplatin and to BCL-2 inhibitors through the destabilization of MCL-1, which thus defines spliceosome inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to treat tumors showing acquired resistance to specific drugs due to MCL-1 stabilization.","['Shostak, Kateryna', 'Jiang, Zheshen', 'Charloteaux, Benoit', 'Mayer, Alice', 'Habraken, Yvette', 'Tharun, Lars', 'Klein, Sebastian', 'Xu, Xinyi', 'Duong, Hong Quan', 'Vislovukh, Andrii', 'Close, Pierre', 'Florin, Alexandra', 'Rambow, Florian', 'Marine, Jean-Christophe', 'Buttner, Reinhard', 'Chariot, Alain']","['Shostak K', 'Jiang Z', 'Charloteaux B', 'Mayer A', 'Habraken Y', 'Tharun L', 'Klein S', 'Xu X', 'Duong HQ', 'Vislovukh A', 'Close P', 'Florin A', 'Rambow F', 'Marine JC', 'Buttner R', 'Chariot A']","['Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Medical Chemistry, University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Medical Chemistry, University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'GIGA Genomics Platform, University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Human Genetics, CHU of Liege, University of Liege, Sart-Tilman, 4000, Liege, Belgium.', 'Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'GIGA Genomics Platform, University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Gene Expression and cancer, University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Institute for Pathology-University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute for Pathology-University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Medical Chemistry, University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Medical Chemistry, University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Center for Molecular Biology, Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, 03 Quang Trung, Danang, Vietnam.', 'Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Medical Chemistry, University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Signaling, University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology (WELBIO), Wavres, Belgium.', 'Institute for Pathology-University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Cancer Biology, VIB Center for Cancer Biology and KULeuven, Department of Oncology, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Cancer Biology, VIB Center for Cancer Biology and KULeuven, Department of Oncology, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Institute for Pathology-University Hospital, Cologne, Germany.', 'Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA), University of Liege, CHU, Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.

MCL1, a member of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family, may be a treatment target in several cancers, including SCLC. However, whether the expression profile of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family affects MCL1 inhibition strategy is unknown. A tissue microarray (TMA) was created from consecutive patients who were diagnosed with SCLC and had previously undergone surgery at Kyoto University Hospital (Kyoto, Japan) between 2001 and 2017. We used S63845, a MCL1 inhibitor, to assess the cytotoxic capacity in SCLC cell lines including a patient-derived cell line in vitro and in vivo. The combination of S63845 with navitoclax, a double BCL-XL/BCL-2 inhibitor, was also employed to examine the comprehensive inhibition of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family. Immunohistochemistry of a TMA from patients with surgically resected SCLC demonstrated high MCL1 expression with low BCL-XL and BCL-2 to be the most common expression profile. S63845 was effective in high MCL1- and low BCL-XL-expressing SCLC cell lines. S63845 induced BAK-dependent apoptosis in vitro, and the anti-tumor efficacy was confirmed in an in vivo model. Although knockdown of BCL-XL and BCL-2 improved the cytotoxic activity of S63845 and its combination with navitoclax increased the anti-tumor cytotoxicity, the therapeutic range of S63845 with navitoclax was narrow in in vivo studies. Our study suggests MCL1 inhibition therapy be applied for high MCL1- and low BCL-XL-expressing SCLC patients.","['Yasuda, Yuto', 'Ozasa, Hiroaki', 'Kim, Young Hak', 'Yamazoe, Masatoshi', 'Ajimizu, Hitomi', 'Yamamoto Funazo, Tomoko', 'Nomizo, Takashi', 'Tsuji, Takahiro', 'Yoshida, Hironori', 'Sakamori, Yuichi', 'Nakajima, Naoki', 'Menju, Toshi', 'Yoshizawa, Akihiko', 'Date, Hiroshi', 'Hirai, Toyohiro']","['Yasuda Y', 'Ozasa H', 'Kim YH', 'Yamazoe M', 'Ajimizu H', 'Yamamoto Funazo T', 'Nomizo T', 'Tsuji T', 'Yoshida H', 'Sakamori Y', 'Nakajima N', 'Menju T', 'Yoshizawa A', 'Date H', 'Hirai T']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan. ozahiro@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Takatsuki Red Cross Hospital, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5703-4119', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5706-8300']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200309,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/drug therapy', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*drug effects/metabolism']",PMC7063049,,,,2020/03/11 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2379-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2379-2 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Mar 9;11(3):177. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2379-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2016, we initiated a clinical trial with in-house produced CD19 CAR-T cells with a CD28 co-stimulatory domain. We analyzed, for the first time, differences in production features and phenotype between ALL and NHL patients. METHODS: Non-cryopreserved CAR-T cells were produced from patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells within 9 to 10 days. 93 patients with r/r ALL and NHL were enrolled under the same study. CAR-T cells of ALL and NHL patients were produced simultaneously, allowing the head-to-head comparison. RESULTS: All patients were heavily pretreated. Three patients dropped out from the study due to clinical deterioration (n=2) or production failure (n=1). Cells of ALL patients (n=37) expanded significantly better and contained more CAR-T cells than of NHL patients (n=53). Young age had a positive impact on the proliferation capacity. The infusion products from ALL patients contained significantly more naive CAR-T cells and a significantly higher expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3. PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, and CD28 were equally expressed. 100% of ALL patients and 94% of NHL patients received the target dose of 1x10e6 CAR-T/kg. The overall response rate was 84% (30/36) in ALL and 62% (32/52) in NHL. We further compared CAR-T cell infusion products to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), another common type of T cell therapy, mainly clinically effective in solid tumors. CAR-T cells contained significantly more naive T cells and central memory T cells and significantly less CCR5 compared to TIL infusion products. CONCLUSIONS: The in-house production of CAR-T cells is highly efficient and fast. Clinical response rate is high. CAR-T cells can be successfully produced for 99% of patients in just 9 to 10 days. Cells derived from ALL patients demonstrate a higher proliferation rate and contain higher frequencies of CAR-T cells and naive T cells than of NHL patients. In addition, understanding the differences between CAR-T and TIL infusion products, may provide an angle to develop CAR-T cells for the treatment of solid tumors in the future.

DESIGN: The design of this cross-sectional study involves a qualitative content analysis of semistructured interviews. SETTING: Participants were consecutively recruited in clinical settings throughout Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine parents (59% female) of 31 cancer survivors (aged 0-17 at diagnosis of leukaemia or central nervous system tumour) were interviewed approximately 16-24 months after the end of intensive cancer treatment (eg, chemotherapy). RESULTS: During treatment, more than 70% of parents reported difficulties reconciling paid work, household and family responsibilities and caring for the ill child. Couples spent little time with each other and approximately 25% reported dispute and burden. Many parents did not have enough energy for pursuing any hobbies during treatment. However, over the long term, being faced with the child's disease also led to strengthened relationships, new priorities, improved communication, increased mutual trust and greater appreciation for daily life. Supportive social networks (family/friends/employers), a strong partner relationship prior to the diagnosis and the use of psychosocial services (eg, family-oriented rehabilitation) had a positive impact. At the time of the interview, most families had adapted well. However, reintegration took time and some parents lacked the energy required to continue life as they did before the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Even though most parents successfully readjusted to a new 'normality', reintegrating into daily life after paediatric cancer treatment remains difficult. Professional psychosocial support could help families with the reintegration process. Lastly, clinical staff (eg, physicians, psychologists, social workers) should bear in mind that the burden of parents does not automatically end with the end of intensive cancer treatment.","['Peikert, Mona L', 'Inhestern, Laura', 'Krauth, Konstantin A', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Rutkowski, Stefan', 'Kandels, Daniela', 'Bergelt, Corinna']","['Peikert ML', 'Inhestern L', 'Krauth KA', 'Escherich G', 'Rutkowski S', 'Kandels D', 'Bergelt C']","['Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany m.peikert@uke.de.', 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Klinik Bad Oexen, Bad Oeynhausen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Swabian Children's Cancer Center, University Hospital Augsburg, Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany."", 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3754-7363', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2513-7954']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200308,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Family Relations/psychology', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Qualitative Research', 'Social Participation/psychology', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Work/psychology']",PMC7064139,,['NOTNLM'],"['*mental health', '*paediatric oncology', '*qualitative research']",2020/03/11 06:00,2021/02/07 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2019-033730 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033730 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2020 Mar 8;10(3):e033730. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033730.,,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Interestingly, the histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) has been linked to many inflammation-related diseases. Moreover, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been reported to induce migration and invasion in RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). This study intended to delineate the functional relevance of MLL1 in RA progression, which implicates the regulation of TLR4. First, clinical synovial tissues were collected from RA patients and patients with severe joint trauma to isolate FLSs. We identified highly expressed MLL1 and TLR4 in synovial tissues of RA patients, and the expression of them was positively correlated in RA-FLSs. More importantly, silencing of MLL1 and TLR4 resulted in suppressed migration and invasion of RA-FLSs, accompanied by reduced inflammation. Additionally, mechanistic investigations showed that MLL1 upregulated TLR4 expression by inducing H3K4me3 in the promoter region of TLR4. Functional assays revealed that overexpression of MLL1 activated the TRIF/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, resulting in accelerated migration and invasion, and inflammation of RA-FLSs in vitro. TLR4 knockdown could compromise the effects of MLL1 overexpression. The in vivo assays in a collagen-induced arthritis rat model validated the in vitro findings. Taken together, histone methyltransferase MLL1 induces TLR4 expression by mediating H3K4me3 in the TLR4 promoter, thus activating the TRIF/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, which thereby promotes the migration and invasion of RA-FLSs and ultimately exacerbates the progression of RA.","['Zhang, Yandong', 'Ji, Tiefeng', 'Ma, Shu', 'Wu, Wei']","['Zhang Y', 'Ji T', 'Ma S', 'Wu W']","['Department of Rheumatology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, PR China.', 'Department of Radiology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, PR China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, PR China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, PR China.

This study was conducted to investigate the role of P2X7R in modifying NLRP3-dependent IL-1beta secretion and regulating phagocytosis by Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum)-induced macrophages. Macrophages derived from a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line were cultured with T. pallidum. The activation of P2X7R in T. pallidum-treated macrophages occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The P2X7R silencing group showed significantly decreased NLRP3 mRNA and protein levels (vs. the Tp group, P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for IL-1beta secretion using ELISA (vs. the Tp group, P < 0.001). Furthermore, P2X7R siRNA transfection significantly decreased the percentage of spirochete-positive macrophages (29.73% vs. 70.83%, P < 0.001) and spirochete internalization (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), 9.20 vs. 19.39, P < 0.001). This finding revealed that P2X7R played a role in the induction of NLRP3-dependent IL-1beta secretion by T. pallidum-induced macrophages. Furthermore, we found that P2X7R plays an important role in IL-1beta secretion and in the promotion of T. pallidum phagocytosis by macrophages. These results may not only contribute to our understanding of the immune mechanism that is active during T. pallidum infection but may also lay the groundwork for strategies to combat syphilis.","['Xu, Shi-Lan', 'Lin, Yu', 'Liu, Wei', 'Zhu, Xiao-Zhen', 'Liu, Dan', 'Tong, Man-Li', 'Liu, Li-Li', 'Lin, Li-Rong']","['Xu SL', 'Lin Y', 'Liu W', 'Zhu XZ', 'Liu D', 'Tong ML', 'Liu LL', 'Lin LR']","['Center of Clinical Laboratory, Zhongshan Hospital, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Institute of Infectious Disease, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Center of Clinical Laboratory, Zhongshan Hospital, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Institute of Infectious Disease, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Center of Clinical Laboratory, Zhongshan Hospital, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Institute of Infectious Disease, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.

We investigated GI involvement of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Eighty-two patients were diagnosed with PTCL during 2007-2017. Eleven patients (13 %) had histologically-confirmed GI tract involvement {3 monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal lymphoma (MEITL), 3 extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma nasal type (ENKL), 2 PTCL, not otherwise specified, 1 adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, 2 ITLPD-GIT}. Three patients each had lesions in the small intestine and multiple lesions, two each in the stomach and colon, and one in the duodenum. Six of the 11 patients remained alive. No perforation/stenosis was observed after chemo-radiotherapy, although one patient with ENKL developed gastric bleeding during chemotherapy. One patient with ITLPD-GIT (CD4(-)/CD8(+)/Ki67(Low)) with a colonic lesion showing diffuse edema and multiple aphtha by endoscope and diarrhea, initially diagnosed with MEITL, had active but stable disease after various chemotherapies for 1 year and no therapy for the next 5 years. Another patient with ITLPD-GIT (CD4(+)/CD8(+)/Ki67(Low)) with a localized gastric lesion and slight epigastralgia was in remission for 1 year after radiation. In conclusion, about 10 % of PTCLs were complicated by GI tract lesions and most had a poor prognosis. ITLPD-GIT should be considered as a differential diagnosis based on histology and clinical course.

We had reported heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) over-expressed in high risk B-ALL children. 17-DMAG is a water soluble Hsp90 inhibitor, which was proved to be effective for advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancy. However, there is little research on its application in newly diagnosed B-ALL. And the detailed mechanism is seldom discussed. MAIN METHODS: Primary blast cells from 24 newly diagnosed B-ALL pediatric patients and two B-ALL cell lines were used in this study. Cell viability was measured by MTS assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry after annexin V-PI double staining. Protein expression was detected by immunoblotting analysis and immunofluorescence imaging. Cyto-ID autophagy detection assay was performed to show the autophagosomes and LysoTracker labeling to show the lysosomes. Gene knockdown was performed by RNA interference, and mRNA expression was measured by RT-qPCR. KEY FINDINGS: We showed 17-DMAG induced apoptosis in newly diagnosed B-ALL blasts and cell lines effectively. 17-DMAG induced heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) expression significantly. High expressed Hsc70 inhibited cathepsin D post-transcriptionally to impede the autophagic flux, which lead to the cell death. SIGNIFICANCE: Our work added new information towards understanding the molecular pharmacology of 17-DMAG, and suggested the newly diagnosed B-ALL pediatric patients might be benefited from 17-DMAG. Furthermore, we proved Hsc70 participated in the mechanism of cell death 17-DMAG leading in B-ALL.","['Xu, Gang', 'Ma, Xiujuan', 'Chen, Fang', 'Wu, Di', 'Miao, Jianing', 'Fan, Yang']","['Xu G', 'Ma X', 'Chen F', 'Wu D', 'Miao J', 'Fan Y']","['Department of Pediatric, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Yanda Daopei Hospital, Langfang 065201, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China; Key Laboratory of Research and Application of Animal Models for Environmental and Metabolic Disease, Liaoning Province, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China; Key Laboratory of Research and Application of Animal Models for Environmental and Metabolic Disease, Liaoning Province, Shenyang 110004, PR China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110004, PR China; Key Laboratory of Research and Application of Animal Models for Environmental and Metabolic Disease, Liaoning Province, Shenyang 110004, PR China.

A retrospective analysis was subsequently conducted to estimate the frequency of abscopal regression in follicular lymphoma (FL). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Potential cases were identified at multidisciplinary lymphoma meetings and fulfilled these criteria: (1) palliative ISRT given for histologically confirmed lymphoma, (2) >2 lesions visualized on FDG-PET, (3) >1 unirradiated lesion(s) outside ISRT volume, (4) no systemic therapy delivered <2 months before radiation therapy or between radiation therapy and response assessment, (5) complete metabolic response (CMR) in >/=1 unirradiated lesions detected on serial FDG-PET/CT. All ISRT patients with FL treated in 2016 to 2018 were systematically reviewed. RESULTS: Seven cases of abscopal regression were identified, including 4 patients with FL. In all cases, a CMR was apparent both within the ISRT volume and in >/=1 unirradiated lesions. One patient each was identified with mantle cell lymphoma (4 Gy in 2 fractions), Hodgkin lymphoma (20 Gy in 3 fractions, then 30 Gy in 15 fractions to the same volume), and Richter transformation of chronic lymphatic leukemia (30 Gy in 10 fractions). The 4 patients with FL received either 4 Gy in 2 fractions (n = 3) or 4 Gy followed 8 months later by 30 Gy in 15 fractions (n = 1). From 2016 to 2018, 29 courses of ISRT were prescribed for multifocal FL, after which 4 of 29 (13.8%) abscopal responses were detected, including in 4 of 9 (44.4%) patients with serial PET scans. Two patients, with relapsed disease after initial abscopal responses, experienced durable CMRs with immunotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: In 4 of 7 cases, PET-detected abscopal regression of lymphoma occurred after 4 Gy, in 2 of 7 cases after repeated ISRT to the same volume, and in 2 of 7 was associated with subsequent complete response to immunotherapy, consistent with an immune basis for the abscopal effect. Abscopal regressions in FL appear to be more common than previously suspected.","['MacManus, Michael P', 'Hofman, Michael S', 'Hicks, Rodney J', 'Campbell, Belinda A', 'Wirth, Andrew', 'Seymour, John F', 'Haynes, Nicole', 'Burbury, Kate']","['MacManus MP', 'Hofman MS', 'Hicks RJ', 'Campbell BA', 'Wirth A', 'Seymour JF', 'Haynes N', 'Burbury K']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia; The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.

Although advantageous for patients, self-congratulatory rejoicing about the new agents would be extremely premature. Questions abound about the need for a specific versus less specific FLT3 inhibitor (eg, midostautin) in the upfront setting and whether a single agent (gilteritnib), albeit better than chemotherapy, is sufficient for relapsed disease. Is the new liposomal formulation of daunorubicin/cytarabine better than '3 + 7' only in secondary AML? Should only those newly diagnosed patients with core binding factor AML routinely receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin? The isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors were approved based on non-randomized data; thus, one wonders whether single-agent isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitor therapy is appropriate for relapsed patients. Glasdegib, an orally available hedgehog inhibitor, is approved in conjunction with low-dose cytarabine in unfit patients but is rarely used in favor of a combination of hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine with venetoclax, which are hopeful newly approved combinations for the older and/or unfit previously untreated. Perhaps venetoclax-based combinations should be more widely used, but the data is currently lacking. Thus, a temperate approach, more clinical research, and a critical analysis of the available data remain important in this ""optimistic"" new era of AML therapeutics.","['Burnett, Alan', 'Stone, Richard']","['Burnett A', 'Stone R']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.

Indeed, cancer is associated with an increase in ribosome biogenesis and mutations in several ribosomal proteins genes are found in ribosomopathies, which are congenital diseases that display an elevated risk of cancer. Ribosomes and their biogenesis therefore represent attractive anti-cancer targets and several strategies are being developed to identify efficient and specific drugs. Homoharringtonine (HHT) is the only direct ribosome inhibitor currently used in clinics for cancer treatments, although many classical chemotherapeutic drugs also appear to impact on protein synthesis. Here we review the role of the human ribosome as a medical target in cancer, and how functional and structural analysis combined with chemical synthesis of new inhibitors can synergize. The possible existence of oncoribosomes is also discussed. The emerging idea is that targeting the human ribosome could not only allow the interference with cancer cell addiction towards protein synthesis and possibly induce their death but may also be highly valuable to decrease the levels of oncogenic proteins that display a high turnover rate (MYC, MCL1). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an advanced method that allows the visualization of human ribosome complexes with factors and bound inhibitors to improve our understanding of their functioning mechanisms mode. Cryo-EM structures could greatly assist the foundation phase of a novel drug-design strategy. One goal would be to identify new specific and active molecules targeting the ribosome in cancer such as derivatives of cycloheximide, a well-known ribosome inhibitor.","['Gilles, Arnaud', 'Frechin, Leo', 'Natchiar, Kundhavai', 'Biondani, Giulia', 'Loeffelholz, Ottilie von', 'Holvec, Samuel', 'Malaval, Julie-Lisa', 'Winum, Jean-Yves', 'Klaholz, Bruno P', 'Peyron, Jean-Francois']","['Gilles A', 'Frechin L', 'Natchiar K', 'Biondani G', 'Loeffelholz OV', 'Holvec S', 'Malaval JL', 'Winum JY', 'Klaholz BP', 'Peyron JF']","['IBMM, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IBMM, ENSCM, 34296 Montpellier, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, CNRS, Inserm, Centre for Integrative Biology, IGBMC, 67404 Illkirch, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, CNRS, Inserm, Centre for Integrative Biology, IGBMC, 67404 Illkirch, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, 06204 Nice, France."", 'Universite de Strasbourg, CNRS, Inserm, Centre for Integrative Biology, IGBMC, 67404 Illkirch, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, CNRS, Inserm, Centre for Integrative Biology, IGBMC, 67404 Illkirch, France.', 'IBMM, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IBMM, ENSCM, 34296 Montpellier, France.', 'IBMM, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IBMM, ENSCM, 34296 Montpellier, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, CNRS, Inserm, Centre for Integrative Biology, IGBMC, 67404 Illkirch, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, 06204 Nice, France.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9615-0318', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0806-6122', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3197-3414', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8674-8674', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6113-916X']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200305,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,,IM,"['*Cryoelectron Microscopy/methods', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/physiology', 'Ribosomes/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7140421,,['NOTNLM'],"['*antibiotics', '*cancer', '*leukemia', '*ribosome', '*targeted therapies']",2020/03/11 06:00,2021/03/17 06:00,['2020/03/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9030629 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9030629 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Mar 5;9(3). pii: cells9030629. doi: 10.3390/cells9030629.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, optimal risk stratification is of greatest importance for reasonable choice of treatment and prognostic evaluation. For our study, a total of 1707 samples of AML patients from three public databases were divided into meta-training, meta-testing and validation sets. The meta-training set was used to build risk prediction model, and the other four data sets were employed for validation. By log-rank test and univariate COX regression analysis as well as LASSO-COX, AML patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on AML risk score (AMLRS) which was constituted by 10 survival-related genes. In meta-training, meta-testing and validation sets, the patient in the low-risk group all had a significantly longer OS (overall survival) than those in the high-risk group (P < .001), and the area under ROC curve (AUC) by time-dependent ROC was 0.5854-0.7905 for 1 year, 0.6652-0.8066 for 3 years and 0.6622-0.8034 for 5 years. Multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that AMLRS was an independent prognostic factor in four data sets. Nomogram combining the AMLRS and two clinical parameters performed well in predicting 1-year, 3-year and 5-year OS.

MPN is less frequent in women of reproductive age. However, for essential thrombocythaemia (ET) in particular there is a second peak in women of reproductive age and 15% of polycythaemia vera (PV) patients are less than 40 years of age at the time of diagnosis. Thus these diseases are encountered in women of reproductive potential and may be diagnosed in pregnancy or in women being investigated for recurrent pregnancy loss. The incidence of MPN pregnancies is 3.2/100 000 maternities per year in the UK. The majority of data regarding Philadelphia-negative MPNs relates to patients with ET, for which the literature suggests significant maternal morbidity and poor fetal outcome; specifically maternal thrombosis and haemorrhage, miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), stillbirth and premature delivery as summarised in the recent systematic review and meta-analysis in Blood, 2018, 132, 3046. The literature for PV is more sparse but increasing and is concordant with ET pregnancy outcomes. The literature regarding primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is even more scarce. Treatment options include aspirin, venesection, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and cytoreductive therapy. Data and management recommendations are often extrapolated from other pro-thrombotic conditions or from ET to PV and PMF. Women of reproductive age with a diagnosis of MPN should receive information and assurance regarding management and outcome of future pregnancies. From pre-conceptual planning to the post-partum period, women should have access to joint care from an obstetrician with experience of high-risk pregnancies and a haematologist in a multidisciplinary setting.

Despite the complex and varied biological underpinnings, induction therapy for AML has remained fairly uniform over 4 decades and outcomes remain poor for most patients. Recently, enhanced understanding of the leukemic epigenome has resulted in the translational investigation of a number of epigenetic modifying agents currently in various stages of clinical development. These novel therapies are based on mechanistic rationale and offer the potential to improve AML patient outcomes.

Next-generation sequencing enables minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) detection; however, clinical significance is limited due to difficulty differentiating between pre-leukemic clonal hematopoiesis and frankly malignant clones. Here, we investigated AML MRD using targeted single-cell sequencing (SCS) at diagnosis, remission, and relapse (n = 10 relapsed, n = 4 nonrelapsed), with a total of 310 737 single cells sequenced. Sequence variants were identified in 80% and 75% of remission samples for patients with and without relapse, respectively. Pre-leukemic clonal hematopoiesis clones were detected in both cohorts, and clones with multiple cooccurring mutations were observed in 50% and 0% of samples. Similar clonal richness was observed at diagnosis in both cohorts; however, decreasing clonal diversity at remission was significantly associated with longer relapse-free survival. These results show the power of SCS in investigating AML MRD and clonal evolution.","['Ediriwickrema, Asiri', 'Aleshin, Alexey', 'Reiter, Johannes G', 'Corces, M Ryan', 'Kohnke, Thomas', 'Stafford, Melissa', 'Liedtke, Michaela', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Majeti, Ravindra']","['Ediriwickrema A', 'Aleshin A', 'Reiter JG', 'Corces MR', 'Kohnke T', 'Stafford M', 'Liedtke M', 'Medeiros BC', 'Majeti R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and.', 'Canary Center for Cancer Early Detection, Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute, and.']",,['eng'],['R01 CA188055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Clonal Evolution/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Remission Induction']",PMC7065471,,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/10 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31459-2 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001181 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 10;4(5):943-952. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001181.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,['Blood Adv. 2020 Apr 14;4(7):1218.

A key to risk-adapted therapies includes the identification of genomic features of individual tumors, including chromosome number (for hyper- and hypodiploidy) and gene fusions, notably ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, and BCR-ABL1 in B-cell ALL (B-ALL). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of large ALL cohorts has expanded the number of recurrent gene fusions recognized as drivers in ALL, and identification of these new entities will contribute to refining ALL risk stratification. We used RNA-seq on 126 ALL patients from our clinical service to test the utility of including RNA-seq in standard-of-care diagnostic pipelines to detect gene rearrangements and IKZF1 deletions. RNA-seq identified 86% of rearrangements detected by standard-of-care diagnostics. KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements, although usually identified, were the most commonly missed by RNA-seq as a result of low expression. RNA-seq identified rearrangements that were not detected by standard-of-care testing in 9 patients. These were found in patients who were not classifiable using standard molecular assessment. We developed an approach to detect the most common IKZF1 deletion from RNA-seq data and validated this using an RQ-PCR assay. We applied an expression classifier to identify Philadelphia chromosome-like B-ALL patients. T-ALL proved a rich source of novel gene fusions, which have clinical implications or provide insights into disease biology. Our experience shows that RNA-seq can be implemented within an individual clinical service to enhance the current molecular diagnostic risk classification of ALL.","['Brown, Lauren M', 'Lonsdale, Andrew', 'Zhu, Andrea', 'Davidson, Nadia M', 'Schmidt, Breon', 'Hawkins, Anthony', 'Wallach, Elise', 'Martin, Michelle', 'Mechinaud, Francoise M', 'Khaw, Seong Lin', 'Bartolo, Ray C', 'Ludlow, Louise E A', 'Challis, Jackie', 'Brooks, Ian', 'Petrovic, Vida', 'Venn, Nicola C', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Majewski, Ian J', 'Oshlack, Alicia', 'Ekert, Paul G']","['Brown LM', 'Lonsdale A', 'Zhu A', 'Davidson NM', 'Schmidt B', 'Hawkins A', 'Wallach E', 'Martin M', 'Mechinaud FM', 'Khaw SL', 'Bartolo RC', 'Ludlow LEA', 'Challis J', 'Brooks I', 'Petrovic V', 'Venn NC', 'Sutton R', 'Majewski IJ', 'Oshlack A', 'Ekert PG']","[""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Victorian Clinical Genetics Services, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Victorian Clinical Genetics Services, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Victorian Clinical Genetics Services, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia; and.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia."", 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Child', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genomics', 'Humans', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']",PMC7065479,,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/10 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31458-0 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001008 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 10;4(5):930-942. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001008.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,['Blood Adv. 2020 Apr 14;4(7):1217.

A recent study showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12459419 (C > T), results in the reduced expression of V domain-containing CD33 and limited efficacy of V domain-binding anti-CD33 antibodies. We developed JNJ-67571244, a novel human bispecific antibody capable of binding to the C2 domain of CD33 and to CD3, to induce T-cell recruitment and CD33+ tumor cell cytotoxicity independently of their SNP genotype status. JNJ-67571244 specifically binds to CD33-expressing target cells and induces cytotoxicity of CD33+ AML cell lines in vitro along with T-cell activation and cytokine release. JNJ-67571244 also exhibited statistically significant antitumor activity in vivo in established disseminated and subcutaneous mouse models of human AML. Furthermore, this antibody depletes CD33+ blasts in AML patient blood samples with concurrent T-cell activation. JNJ-67571244 also cross-reacts with cynomolgus monkey CD33 and CD3, and dosing of JNJ-67571244 in cynomolgus monkeys resulted in T-cell activation, transient cytokine release, and sustained reduction in CD33+ leukocyte populations. JNJ-67571244 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys up to 30 mg/kg. Lastly, JNJ-67571244 mediated efficient cytotoxicity of cell lines and primary samples regardless of their SNP genotype status, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit over other V-binding antibodies. JNJ-67571244 is currently in phase 1 clinical trials in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Nair-Gupta, Priyanka', 'Diem, Michael', 'Reeves, Dara', 'Wang, Weirong', 'Schulingkamp, Robert', 'Sproesser, Katrin', 'Mattson, Bethany', 'Heidrich, Bradley', 'Mendonca, Mark', 'Joseph, Jocelin', 'Sendecki, Jocelyn', 'Foulk, Brad', 'Chu, Gerald', 'Fink, Damien', 'Jiao, Qun', 'Wu, Sheng-Jiun', 'Packman, Kathryn', 'Elsayed, Yusri', 'Attar, Ricardo', 'Gaudet, Francois']","['Nair-Gupta P', 'Diem M', 'Reeves D', 'Wang W', 'Schulingkamp R', 'Sproesser K', 'Mattson B', 'Heidrich B', 'Mendonca M', 'Joseph J', 'Sendecki J', 'Foulk B', 'Chu G', 'Fink D', 'Jiao Q', 'Wu SJ', 'Packman K', 'Elsayed Y', 'Attar R', 'Gaudet F']","['Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)'],IM,"['Animals', 'C2 Domains', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/genetics', '*T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",PMC7065489,,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/10 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31455-5 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001188 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 10;4(5):906-919. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001188.,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we found that these intraclonal circulating fractions share persistent DNA methylation signatures largely associated with the mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGHV) and their origins from distinct stages of differentiation of antigen-experienced B cells. Increased leukemic birth rate, however, showed a very limited impact on DNA methylation of circulating CLL fractions independent of IGHV mutation status. Additionally, DNA methylation heterogeneity increased as leukemic cells advanced from PF to RF in the peripheral blood. This frequently co-occurred with heterochromatin hypomethylation and hypermethylation of Polycomb-repressed regions in the PF, suggesting accumulation of longevity-associated epigenetic features in recently born cells. On the other hand, transcriptional differences between paired intraclonal fractions confirmed their proliferative experience and further supported a linear advancement from PF to RF in the peripheral blood. Several of these differentially expressed genes showed unique associations with clinical outcome not evident in the bulk clone, supporting the pathological and therapeutic relevance of studying intraclonal CLL fractions.

CDC depends on several factors, including the availability and activity of the complement classical pathway (CP). Recently, a significant decrease in CP activity was shown to be associated with an immunoglobulin-C5a complex (Ig-C5a) and other markers of chronic CP activation in 40% of the patients. The study focused on the involvement of IgG-hexamers, an established CP activator, in the mechanism of chronic CP activation in CLL. Sera from 51 naive CLL patients and 20 normal controls were collected. CP and alternative pathway (AP) activities were followed by the complement activity marker sC5b-9. Serum high molecular weight (HMW) proteins were collected by gel-filtration chromatography and their complement activation capacity was assessed. The levels of IgM, another established CP activator, were measured. Data were associated with the presence of Ig-C5a. Baseline levels of activation markers negatively correlated with CP and the AP activities, supporting chronic complement activation. In patients with Ig-C5a, HMW proteins that are not IgM, activated the complement. HMW proteins were identified as IgG-aggregates by affinity binding assays and Western blot analysis. The data indicate chronic CP activation, mediated by cell-free IgG-hexamers as a cause of decreased CP activity in part of the CLL population. This mechanism may affect immunotherapy outcomes due to compromised CP activity and CDC.","['Michelis, Regina', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Aviv, Ariel', 'Stemer, Galia', 'Majdob, Rawan', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Shehadeh, Mona', 'Barhoum, Masad', 'Braester, Andrei']","['Michelis R', 'Tadmor T', 'Aviv A', 'Stemer G', 'Majdob R', 'Shvidel L', 'Shehadeh M', 'Barhoum M', 'Braester A']","['The Institute for Medical Research, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', 'The Institute for Medical Research, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Biochemistry Laboratory, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar Ilan University, Safed, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Bar Ilan University, Safed, Israel.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3513-9016'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200309,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],IM,"['Aged', '*Complement Pathway, Classical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight']",PMC7062264,,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2020/03/10 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0230033 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-30758 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Mar 9;15(3):e0230033. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0230033. eCollection 2020.,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Case Presentation and Review of Literature.,e921131,10.12659/AJCR.921131 [doi],"BACKGROUND Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) both have a common origin arising from mature CD5+ B-lymphocytes. Their distinction is crucial since MCL is a considerably more aggressive disease. Composite lymphoma consisting of CLL/SLL and MCL has been rarely reported. This type of composite lymphoma may be under-diagnosed as the 2 neoplasms have many features in common, both morphologically and immunophenotypically. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 57-year-old male patient who presented with a 4-month history of recurrent abdominal pain and distention with hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood showed a high leukocytes count (46.7x10(3)/uL) with marked lymphocytosis of 35.0x10(3)/uL, mostly small mature-looking, with some showing nuclear irregularities, with approximately 3% prolymphocytes. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry revealed 2 immunophenotypically distinct abnormal CD5+monotypic B-cell populations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on peripheral blood demonstrated IGH/CCND1 rearrangement consistent with t(11;14) in 65% of cells analyzed. Accordingly, based on compilation of findings from morphology, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and FISH, A diagnosis of composite lymphoma consisting of MCL; small cell variant and CLL/SLL was concluded. CONCLUSIONS We describe a case of composite lymphoma of MCL (small cell variant) and CLL/SLL that emphasizes the crucial role of the multiparametric approach, including vigilant cyto-histopathologic examination, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, as well as genetic testing, to achieve the correct diagnosis.","['Ibrahim, Feryal', 'Al Sabbagh, Ahmad', 'Amer, Aliaa', 'Soliman, Dina S', 'Al Sabah, Hesham']","['Ibrahim F', 'Al Sabbagh A', 'Amer A', 'Soliman DS', 'Al Sabah H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Central Clinical Laboratory, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200309,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IGH-CCND1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Composite Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics']",PMC7083592,,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/03/10 06:00'],"['2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['921131 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.921131 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2020 Mar 9;21:e921131. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.921131.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Are Radiation Effects on Blood Pressure Affected by Genetic Background?,552-559,10.1667/RR15536.1 [doi],"In this work, we utilized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wister Kyoto rats (WKY), from which the SHR was established, to evaluate the effects of whole-body acute radiation on the cardiovascular system at doses from 0 to 4 Gy. In the irradiated SHR, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased with increasing dose, while body weight gain decreased with increasing radiation dose. Furthermore, pathological observations of SHR demonstrated that the number of rats with cystic degeneration in the liver increased with increasing dose. The effects observed among SHR, such as increased SBP and retardation of body weight gain, appear very similar to those observed in Japanese atomic bomb survivors. In contrast, the SBP among WKY did not change relative to dose; the body weight, however, did change, as in the SHR. Therefore, the association between radiation exposure and SBP, but not between radiation exposure and retardation of body weight gain, may be affected by genetic background, as evident from strain difference. These results suggest that the SHR and WKY animal models may be useful for studying radiation effects on non-cancer diseases including circulatory diseases, chronic liver disease and developmental retardation.","['Takahashi, Norio', 'Misumi, Munechika', 'Niwa, Yasuharu', 'Murakami, Hideko', 'Ohishi, Waka', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Tanaka, Satoshi', 'Braga Tanaka, Ignacia', 'Suzuki, Gen']","['Takahashi N', 'Misumi M', 'Niwa Y', 'Murakami H', 'Ohishi W', 'Inaba T', 'Nagamachi A', 'Tanaka S', 'Braga Tanaka I', 'Suzuki G']","['Consultant, Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), Hiroshima, 732-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Statistics, Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), Hiroshima, 732-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), Hiroshima, 732-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), Hiroshima, 732-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Studies (Hiroshima), Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), Hiroshima, 732-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Radiobiology, Institute for Environmental Sciences, Aomori, 039-3212, Japan.', 'Department of Radiobiology, Institute for Environmental Sciences, Aomori, 039-3212, Japan.', 'International University of Health and Welfare Clinic, Tochigi, 324-8501, Japan.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Pressure/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Body Weight/*genetics/*radiation effects', '*Genetic Background', 'Liver/pathology/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR']",,,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/03/10 06:00'],"['2019/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['436360 [pii]', '10.1667/RR15536.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2020 Jun 1;193(6):552-559. doi: 10.1667/RR15536.1.,,"['(c)2020 by Radiation Research Society.

Early diagnosis can reduce mortality and improve prognosis. LncRNAs have been shown to be effective biomarkers for a variety of diseases and can act as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA). In this study, the dysregulated lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks (DLCN) of the chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and blastic crisis (BC) for CML are constructed. Then, based on dynamic network biomarkers (DNB), some dysregulated lncRNA-associated ceRNA network biomarkers of CP, AP, and BC for CML are identified according to DNB criteria. Thus, a lncRNA (SNHG5) is identified from DLCN_CP, a lncRNA (DLEU2) is identified from DLCN_AP, and two lncRNAs (SNHG3, SNHG5) are identified from DLCN_BC. In addition, the critical index (CI) used to detect disease outbreaks shows that CML occurs in CP, which is consistent with clinical medicine. By analyzing the functions of the identified ceRNA network biomarkers, it has been found that they are effective lncRNA biomarkers directly or indirectly related to CML. The result of this study will help deepen the understanding of CML pathology from the perspective of ceRNA and help discover the effective biomarkers of CP, AP, and BC for CML in the future, so as to help patients get timely treatment and reduce the mortality of CML.","['Xu, Junhua', 'Wu, Min', 'Sun, Yichen', 'Zhao, Hongqian', 'Wang, Yujie', 'Gao, Jie']","['Xu J', 'Wu M', 'Sun Y', 'Zhao H', 'Wang Y', 'Gao J']","['School of Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.', 'School of Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.', 'School of Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.', 'School of Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.', 'School of Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.', 'School of Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5189-8338'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200218,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA/genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",PMC7049421,,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/10 06:00'],"['2019/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/5189549 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Feb 18;2020:5189549. doi: 10.1155/2020/5189549. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Junhua Xu et al.'],,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug resistance and relapse are major difficulties in the treatment of T-ALL. Here, we report the antitumor potency of NL-101, a compound that combines the nitrogen mustard group of bendamustine with the hydroxamic acid group of vorinostat. We found NL-101 exhibited efficient antiproliferative activity in T-ALL cell lines (IC50 1.59-1.89 muM), accompanied by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased expression of Cyclin E1, CDK2, and CDK4 proteins and cleavage of PARP. In addition, this bendamustine-derived drug showed both a HDACi effect as demonstrated by histone hyperacetylation and p21 transcription and a DNA-damaging effect as shown by an increase in gamma-H2AX. Intriguingly, we found that NL-101-induced autophagy in T-ALL cells through inhibiting Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, as indicated by an increase in LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and decrease of p62. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine increased apoptotic cell death by NL-101, suggesting a prosurvival role of autophagy. In summary, our finding provides rationale for investigation of NL-101 as a DNA/HDAC dual targeting drug in T-ALL, either as a single agent or in combination with autophagy inhibitors.","['Gao, Hang', 'Lou, Siyue', 'Hong, Huanwu', 'Ge, Qiufu', 'Zhao, Huajun']","['Gao H', 'Lou S', 'Hong H', 'Ge Q', 'Zhao H']","['College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 311402, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 311402, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 311402, China.', 'Hangzhou Tinuo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310053, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 311402, China.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8921-1853', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8643-4261']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200214,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', '*Bendamustine Hydrochloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC7042524,,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/03/10 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/1520651 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Feb 14;2020:1520651. doi: 10.1155/2020/1520651. eCollection 2020.,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Hang Gao et al.'],,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Administered intravenously to humans, cisplatin is used as first-line chemotherapy treatment for patients diagnosed with various types of malignancies, such as leukemia, lymphomas, breast, testicular, ovarian, head and neck, and cervical cancers, and sarcomas. Once cisplatin enters the cell it exerts its cytotoxic effect by losing one chloride ligand, binding to DNA to form intra-strand DNA adducts, and inhibiting DNA synthesis and cell growth. The DNA lesions formed from cisplatin-induced DNA damage activate DNA repair response via NER (nuclear excision repair system) by halting cisplatin-induced cell death by activation of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) pathway. Although treatment has been shown to be effective, many patients experience relapse due to drug resistance. As a result, other platinum compounds such as oxaliplatin and carboplatin have since been used and have shown some levels of effectiveness. In this review, the clinical applications of cisplatin are discussed with a special emphasis on its use in cancer chemotherapy.","['Brown, Andrea', 'Kumar, Sanjay', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Brown A', 'Kumar S', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD-RCMI Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box18750, Jackson, Mississippi, MS 39217, USA.', 'Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD-RCMI Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box18750, Jackson, Mississippi, MS 39217, USA.', 'Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD-RCMI Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box18750, Jackson, Mississippi, MS 39217, USA.']",,['eng'],['G12 MD007581/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20190408,United States,J Cancer Sci Ther,Journal of cancer science & therapy,101526958,,,,PMC7059781,['NIHMS1032734'],['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer chemotherapy', 'Cisplatin', 'Human cancers', 'Platinum-based dugs']",2019/01/01 00:00,2019/01/01 00:01,['2020/03/10 06:00'],"['2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Cancer Sci Ther. 2019;11(4).

Chemical and biological studies on P. ginseng have focused primarily on its roots, whereas the seeds remain poorly understood. This study explores the phytochemical and biological properties of compounds from P. ginseng seeds. Methods: P. ginseng seeds were extracted with methanol, and 16 compounds were isolated using various chromatographic methods. The chemical structures of the isolates were determined by spectroscopic data. Antiinflammatory activities were evaluated for triterpene and steroidal saponins using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and THP-1 monocyte leukemia cells. Results: Phytochemical investigation of P. ginseng seeds led to the isolation of a novel triterpene saponin, pseudoginsenoside RT8, along with 15 known compounds. Pseudoginsenoside RT8 exhibited more potent antiinflammatory activity than the other saponins, attenuating lipopolysaccharide-mediated induction of proinflammatory genes such as interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, and suppressed reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide generation in a dose-dependent manner.

It is currently unclear how much of CRCI is attributable to disease, treatment, or both. We used CLL as a novel model to study the differential roles of disease and treatment in CRCI. One hundred and fifty CLL patients (100 treatment-naive and 50 chemotherapy-treated) including 84 patients with higher-risk of CLL progression completed objective neuropsychological tests. Sociodemographic-adjusted linear regression models examined cognitive outcomes in relation to risk and treatment. Higher-risk patients recalled two fewer words on a memory task (beta = -1.8, 95%CI -3.3,-0.3) and took 15 s longer on an executive function task (beta = 15.4, 95%CI 3.1, 27.6) than lower-risk patients, independent of treatment. Treated patients reported greater cognitive difficulties than treatment-naive patients (beta = -6.1, 95%CI -10.1, -2.2) but did not perform worse on objective measures. Higher-risk patients experienced impairments in executive function and memory suggesting that disease biology contributes to CRCI independent of treatment.","['Williams, AnnaLynn M', 'van Wijngaarden, Edwin', 'Seplaki, Christopher L', 'Heckler, Charles E', 'Weber, Miriam T', 'Barr, Paul M', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Janelsins, Michelle C']","['Williams AM', 'van Wijngaarden E', 'Seplaki CL', 'Heckler CE', 'Weber MT', 'Barr PM', 'Zent CS', 'Janelsins MC']","['Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'James P.

Chromosome analysis of the bone marrow showed t (12;17;15) (p13;q21;q22), and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the PML-RARA fusion signal only on the derivative chromosome 15. The patient was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with PML-RARA and was treated using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). In peripheral blood (PB), PML-RARA-positive polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) appeared on the second week and became negative on the sixth week after treatment, whereas PML-RARA-negative PMNs started to increase in number on the sixth week.

In AML, the main TKs mutations are produced in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), KIT and Janus kinase (JAK) genes, and with less frequency in BCR-ABL. The striking results with TK Inhibitors (TKIs) therapy in BCR-ABL1 chronic myeloid leukemias has paved the way for its clinical development in AML. However, the AML biology complexity seems to prevent TKI therapy from being proposed as a strong shift in the treatment paradigm and prognosis. While some FLT3 inhibitors have shown efficacy in well-designed studies, an increasing number of AML patients are being treated with TKIs as a new standard of care, compassionate use, or in clinical trials. We will review the current clinical evidence concerning the use of TKIs in different subsets of AML (BCR-ABL1, Core Binding Factor, FLT3 mutated, and FLT3 wild-type) to address the main topics concerning these targeted therapies for AML: 1) optimal place (upfront, relapsed/refractory or maintenance); 2) monotherapy or combination; 3) efficacy in TK mutated versus wild-type patients; 4) differences between selective and multi-targeted TKIs. In the next years, clinical trials and real-world data will help answer these questions and establish the impact of TKIs on outcomes of AML patients.","['Megias-Vericat, Juan Eduardo', 'Ballesta-Lopez, Octavio', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Montesinos, Pau']","['Megias-Vericat JE', 'Ballesta-Lopez O', 'Barragan E', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Montesinos P']","['Servicio de Farmacia, Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Avda.

Methods: A total of 206 newly diagnosed AML patients admitted to our department during January 2016 and December 2018 were enrolled in the study. Exclusive criteria were as followings including patients diagnosed as acute promyelocytic leukemia; those who received intravenous antifungal therapy after admission or had history of IFD one month before induction chemotherapy, or those with functional insufficiency of vital organs and those older than 65. Forty-seven patients received posaconazole (posaconazole group), 61 cases received voriconazole (voriconazole group) and 98 cases did not receive any prophylaxis (control group) during induction chemotherapy. Prophylactic efficacy and safety between posaconazole and voriconazole were compared. Results: During induction chemotherapy, five possible cases of IFD occurred in posaconazole group (10.6%); while 11 cases (18.0%) were in voriconazole group including 7 possible, 3 probable and 1 proven. Thirty-five cases (35.7%) in control group were diagnosed as IFD including 19 possible, 11 probable and 5 proven ones. The incidences of IFD in posaconazole and voriconazole group were significantly lower than that in control group (P<0.05). The difference of posaconazole group and voriconazole group was not significant (P>0.05). The reported adverse events in posaconazole group were significantly lower than those in voriconazole group [12.8%(6/47) vs. 32.8%(20/61), P<0.05]. Conclusions: Posaconazole and voriconazole decrease IFD as primary prophylaxis during induction chemotherapy in patients with AML. The prophylactic effect of IFD with posaconazole is similar as voriconazole, but posaconazole shows better safety.","['Pei, R Z', 'Lu, Y', 'Zhang, P S', 'Liu, X H', 'Chen, D', 'Du, X H', 'Sha, K Y', 'Li, S Y', 'Cao, J J', 'Chen, L G', 'Zhuang, X X', 'Tang, S H']","['Pei RZ', 'Lu Y', 'Zhang PS', 'Liu XH', 'Chen D', 'Du XH', 'Sha KY', 'Li SY', 'Cao JJ', 'Chen LG', 'Zhuang XX', 'Tang SH']","[""Department of Hematology, Ningbo Yinzhou People's Hospital, Ningbo 315040, Zhejiang Province, China.""]",,['chi'],['2020KY912/Zhejiang Medical and Health Science and Technology Project'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Invasive fungal disease', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Posaconazole']",2020/03/10 06:00,2020/04/04 06:00,['2020/03/09 06:00'],"['2020/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2020.03.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 1;59(3):213-217. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2020.03.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which these kinases drive tumor growth has not been completely elucidated. To determine the genes controlled by these protein kinases, we carried out a microarray analysis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) comparing early progenitor (ETP-ALL) cell lines whose growth is driven by PIM kinases to more mature T-ALL cells that have low PIM levels. This analysis demonstrated that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 was associated with increased PIM levels in ETP-ALL. Overexpression or knockdown of PIM in these T-ALL cell lines controlled the level of H19 and regulated the methylation of the H19 promoter, suggesting a mechanism by which PIM controls H19 transcription. In these T-ALL cells, the expression of PIM1 induced stem cell gene expression (SOX2, OCT-4, and NANOG) through H19. Identical results were found in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines where PIM kinases drive cancer growth, and both H19 and stem cell gene levels. Small molecule pan-PIM inhibitors (PIM-i) currently in clinical trials reduced H19 expression in both of these tumor types. Importantly, the knockdown of H19 blocked the ability of PIM to induce stem cell genes in T-ALL cells, suggesting a novel signal transduction cascade. In PCa, increases in SOX2 levels have been shown to cause both resistance to the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and the induction of neuroendocrine PCa, a highly metastatic form of this disease. Treatment of PCa cells with a small molecule pan-PIM-i reduced stem cell gene transcription and enhanced ADT, while overexpression of H19 suppressed the ability of pan-PIM-i to regulate hormone blockade. Together, these results demonstrate that the PIM kinases control the level of lncRNA H19, which in turn modifies stem cell gene transcription regulating tumor growth.","['Singh, Neha', 'Padi, Sathish K R', 'Bearss, Jeremiah J', 'Pandey, Ritu', 'Okumura, Koichi', 'Beltran, Himisha', 'Song, Jin H', 'Kraft, Andrew S', 'Olive, Virginie']","['Singh N', 'Padi SKR', 'Bearss JJ', 'Pandey R', 'Okumura K', 'Beltran H', 'Song JH', 'Kraft AS', 'Olive V']","['University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0123-2909', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3417-4845']",['eng'],"['P30 CA023074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200401,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (H19 long non-coding RNA)', '0 (NANOG protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (POU5F1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (SOX2 protein, human)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)']",IM,"['Androgen Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Organoids/growth & development/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC7191193,,['NOTNLM'],"['*H19', '*Pim kinase', '*SOX2', '*T-ALL', '*androgen deprivation therapy resistance', '*prostate cancer']",2020/03/09 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/03/09 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12662 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2020 May;14(5):974-990. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12662.

Transduction of human hematopoietic stem cells with GALV retroviral vectors is more efficient than with amphotropic vectors. In this study, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-gibbon ape leukemia virus (MoMLV-GALV) vector was constructed by replacing the natural env gene of the full-length Moloney MLV genome with the GALV env gene. To monitor viral transmission by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, internal ribosomal entry site-enhanced GFP (IRES-EGFP) was positioned between the GALV env gene and the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) to obtain pMoMLV-GALV-EGFP. The MoMLV-GALV-EGFP vector was able to replicate with high titer in TE671 human rhabdomyosarcoma cells and U-87 human glioma cells. To evaluate the potential of the MoMLV-GALV vector as a therapeutic agent, the gene for the fusogenic envelope G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) was incorporated into the vector. Infection with the resulting MoMLV-GALV-VSV-G vector resulted in lysis of the U-87 cells due to syncytium formation. Syncytium formation was also observed in the transfected human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP after extended cultivation of cells. In addition, we deleted the GALV env gene from the MoMLV-GALV-VSV-G vector to improve viral genome stability. This MoMLV-VSV-G vector is also replication competent and induces syncytium formation in 293T, HT1080, TE671 and U-87 cells. These results suggest that replication of the MoMLV-GALV-VSV-G vector or MoMLV-VSV-G vector may directly lead to cytotoxicity. Therefore, the vectors developed in this study are potentially useful tools for cancer gene therapy.","['Jin, Sae Young', 'Jung, Yong-Tae']","['Jin SY', 'Jung YT']","['Department of Microbiology, Dankook University, Cheonan, 330-714, Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dankook University, Cheonan, 330-714, Korea. yjung@dankook.ac.kr.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200307,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/*growth & development', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*growth & development', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Vesiculovirus/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",,,,,2020/03/09 06:00,2020/04/22 06:00,['2020/03/09 06:00'],"['2019/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-020-04585-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-020-04585-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2020 May;165(5):1089-1097. doi: 10.1007/s00705-020-04585-8.

The present study was designed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of miR-18a inhibitor against WEHI-3 and THP-1 leukemia cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS The changes in miR-18a inhibitor-transfected WEHI-3 and THP-1 cell proliferative potential was measured by use of the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Apoptotic changes were analyzed by electron microscopy, and evaluation of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and PTEN expression was assessed by RT-qPCR assay. RESULTS Transfection of miR-18a inhibitor significantly (P<0.05) suppressed the proliferative potential of WEHI-3 and THP-1 cells. The WEHI-3 cells showed the presence of characteristic apoptotic bodies on transfection with miR-18a inhibitor at 48 h. Flow cytometry showed that miR-18a inhibitor transfection significantly (P<0.05) increased the WEHI-3 cell percentage in G1 phase. The transfection of miR-18a inhibitor significantly (P<0.05) promoted apoptosis in WEHI-3 cells. In WEHI-3 cells, miR-18a inhibitor transfection markedly suppressed the expression of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR mRNA. The expression of PTEN mRNA was significantly (P<0.05) upregulated by miR-18a inhibitor transfection in WEHI-3 cells. CONCLUSIONS The present study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of miR-18a inhibitor against WEHI-3 and THP1 leukemia cells. The study demonstrated that miR-18a inhibitor suppressed the proliferative potential of WEHI-3 and THP1 cells and activated apoptotic process through upregulation of PTEN mRNA expression. Therefore, miR-18a inhibitor can be of therapeutic importance for the treatment of leukemia.","['Zhang, Liping', 'Kong, Lingxia', 'Yang, Yuzhi']","['Zhang L', 'Kong L', 'Yang Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou, Shandong, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Respiratory Medicine, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou, Shandong, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou, Shandong, China (mainland).""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200308,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (MIRN18A microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC7081926,,,,2020/03/09 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2020/03/09 06:00'],"['2020/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['921288 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.921288 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2020 Mar 8;26:e921288. doi: 10.12659/MSM.921288.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The negative impact of acute pancreatitis on the exocrine pancreatic function is well documented; however, its impact on the endocrine function needs more elucidation. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of Nano-Selenium (Nano-Se) on both pancreatic functions in acute pancreatitis. METHODS: l-arginine induced acute pancreatitis in rats was used as a model. Fifty adult male albino rats were separated into groups: 1- control group (C), 2- C+ Nano-Se, 3-acute pancreatitis group (AP) and 4- AP+ Nano-Se. Nano-Se was administered before induction of acute pancreatitis. Serum levels of amylase, lipase, selenium, glucose, insulin and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were measured. Homeostatic model assessment of beta cell function (HOMA-beta) was also calculated. Oxidative stress markers, selenium content and the anti-apoptotic factor, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) were assayed in pancreatic tissue along with immuno-expression of nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). RESULTS: Acute pancreatitis negatively affected both pancreatic functions. Nano-Se administration lessened the developed pancreatic injury and improved both pancreatic functions. CONCLUSION: Nano-Se could improve the deteriorated pancreatic functions in acute pancreatitis via its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and pro-apoptotic actions. Thus, it may be used in prevention of acute pancreatitis and the associated hyperglycemia in vulnerable individuals such as patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography.","['Abdel-Hakeem, Elshymaa A', 'Abdel-Hamid, Heba A', 'Abdel Hafez, Sara Mohamed Naguib']","['Abdel-Hakeem EA', 'Abdel-Hamid HA', 'Abdel Hafez SMN']","['Medical Physiology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, Minia, 61111, Egypt.

Many older patients with AML are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy regimens aimed at inducing remission before transplantation. The prognosis for this patient population remains poor, with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of less than 10 %. At present, there is no standard of care, and clinical trials should be considered. Hypomethylating agents often are the mainstay of treatment in this setting; however, improved genetic profiling and risk stratification based on molecular, biological, and clinical characteristics of AML enhance the ability to identify an individual patient's risk and can refine therapeutic options. Over the past 2 years, several novel agents have been approved for AML patients in either the frontline or relapsed settings. Additional agents have also shown promising activity. It is becoming a challenge for physicians to navigate these different options and select the optimal therapy or combination of therapies. The aim of this review is to summarize the available information to assist with treatment decisions for leukemia patients who are not suitable for intensive chemotherapy.","['Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Carraway, Hetty E', 'Chandhok, Namrata S', 'Prebet, Thomas']","['Griffiths EA', 'Carraway HE', 'Chandhok NS', 'Prebet T']","['Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, USA.

The rate of decline in BCR-ABL1 has been considered a better predictor of the response but has not been uniformly accepted. A paucity of evidence is available to predict the accuracy of the rate of decline in the Indian context. Therefore, we tested the accuracy of the rate of decline of BCR-ABL1 in predicting the molecular response compared with the single 90-day values in a retrospective cohort study of selected cancer centers in south India. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with chronic-phase CML diagnosed from January 2013 to December 2018, the serial BCR-ABL1 levels were estimated at 0, 45, and 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year. Data on patient demographics, risk stratification assessed using the Sokal and EUTOS (European Treatment and Outcome Study) scores were extracted using a mobile-based data capture tool from the medical records of the enrolled patients. The halving time, determined by log reduction, was compared with the 90-day BCR-ABL1 values using the receiver operating characteristic curve for the major and complete molecular response at 6 months and 1 year as standards. Accuracy was determined from the area under the curve. The cutoff for the halving time was chosen to balance the sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The rate of decline had more predictive accuracy compared with the 90-day BCR-ABL1 values (area under the curve for rate of decline, 0.83; 90-day, 0.80). A halving time of < 20 days identified 95% of the patients who had achieved major molecular response at 12 months compared with 80% using the single 90-day BCR-ABL1 response. CONCLUSIONS: The halving time of BCR-ABL1 appears promising as a predictor of the outcomes for patients with CML.","['Karpurmath, Shashidhar V', 'Seshachalam, Arun', 'Selvaraj, Kalaiselvi', 'Rajamani, Priyadarshini', 'Kumar, Satish', 'Reddy, Neelesh', 'Malipatil, Baswant', 'Sirigeri, Roopa', 'Prasad, Krishna', 'Reddy, Krishna', 'Danthala, Madhav', 'Udupa, Karthik S', 'Nandennavar, Manjunath', 'Murugesan, Janarthinakani', 'Patil, C N', 'Anoop, Parameswaran', 'Jacob, Roshan Koshy', 'Kalashetty, Mallikarjun', 'Rathnam, Krishnakumar', 'Ganapathy, Ramanan']","['Karpurmath SV', 'Seshachalam A', 'Selvaraj K', 'Rajamani P', 'Kumar S', 'Reddy N', 'Malipatil B', 'Sirigeri R', 'Prasad K', 'Reddy K', 'Danthala M', 'Udupa KS', 'Nandennavar M', 'Murugesan J', 'Patil CN', 'Anoop P', 'Jacob RK', 'Kalashetty M', 'Rathnam K', 'Ganapathy R']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bengaluru, India.

However, most of these developed two-photon absorption (TPA) O-dots have no tumor-targeting group, which hampers their wide application for targeted tumor imaging. Herein, we fabricated Sgc8c aptamer-mediated TPA O-dots as a proof-of-concept of the sensing platform for targeted imaging in live cells or deep tissues. The O-dots composed of trans-4-[p-(N, N-diethylamino)styryl]-4'-(dimethyl amino) stilbene (DEAS) emerged as TPA organic emissive cores and encapsulation by using poly (methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PMMA-co-MAA) as polymeric encapsulating matrix to form DEAS/PMMA-co-MAA O-dots via a co-precipitation strategy. The obtained O-dots enabled an extremely high TPA absorption cross-section, bright two-photon fluorescence (excitation at 720 nm; emission at 412 nm and 434 nm), excellent cell-permeability and high penetration depth. Sgc8c aptamer, as a protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7) receptor-targetable ligand, was further anchored on the surface of O-dots to obtain DEAS/PMMA-co-MAA@Sgc8c nanoprobes by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)-mediated coupling reaction. Guided by Sgc8c aptamer, DEAS/PMMA-co-MAA@Sgc8c nanoprobes could be rapidly internalized into target acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CEM) cells with high specificity and great efficiency. It was also performed that two-photon images of TPA nanoprobes exhibited high two-photon brightness not only in target CEM cells, but also in mouse liver tissue slices even a depth of up to 210 mum. In our perception, it is highly promising that this nanoprobe provides a valuable tool for in vivo targeted imaging.","['Yan, Huijuan', 'Ren, Wu', 'Liu, Shuanghui', 'Yu, Yi']","['Yan H', 'Ren W', 'Liu S', 'Yu Y']","['School of Pharmacy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, PR China.

Neomorphic activity of mutant IDH2 proteins results in hypermethylation of DNA and histones, leading to blocked haemopoietic differentiation. Enasidenib, an inhibitor of mutated IDH2 proteins, induces responses in patients with IDH2-mutated, relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. We aimed to establish the clinical outcomes of enasidenib monotherapy in a subgroup of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes harbouring mutations in IDH2 from the AG221-C-001 trial. METHODS: The multicentre, open-label, phase 1-2 AG221-C-001 trial enrolled patients with advanced haematological malignancies (2008 WHO criteria) harbouring an IDH2 mutation. The present study is a subgroup analysis of patients with IDH2-mutated myelodysplastic syndromes in the phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion portions of the trial. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were aged 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status score of 2 or lower, and were relapsed or refractory to, or ineligible for, standard treatments. Patients received oral doses of enasidenib at 60-300 mg per day in repeated 28-day treatment cycles. In this subgroup analysis, we focused on the safety and activity of enasidenib as main outcomes. Overall response rate, duration of response, and overall and event-free survival analyses were by intention-to-treat. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug in terms of treatment-emergent adverse events. The AG221-C-001 trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01915498, status ongoing but closed to recruitment. FINDINGS: 17 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes harbouring an IDH2 mutation (median age, 67.0 years [IQR 60.5-73.0]) were enrolled between Feb 18, 2014, and Sept 1, 2015. At data cutoff (Oct 1, 2018), after a median follow-up of 11.0 months (IQR 6.8-23.0), all patients had discontinued enasidenib, with a median of 3 treatment cycles (2-15) for all patients (five [29%] received >/=12 cycles). At entry, three (18%) patients had relapsed after allogeneic stem-cell transplants, 13 (76%) had previously received therapy with hypomethylating agents, and ten (59%) had received at least two previous therapies. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea and nausea (in nine [53%] patients each). Most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were indirect hyperbilirubinaemia (in six [35%] patients), pneumonia (in five [29%] patients), and thrombocytopaenia (in four [24%] patients). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events in more than one patient were pneumonia (in five [29% patients); tumor lysis syndrome (in three [18%] patients); and sepsis, atrial flutter, indirect hyperbilirubinaemia, cerebral hemorrhage, and mental status change (in two [12%] patients each). No treatment-related deaths occurred. An overall response was achieved in 9 patients (53% [95% CI 28-77]), with a median duration of response of 9.2 months (95% CI 1.0-not reached). Six (46%) of 13 patients previously treated with hypomethylating agents responded. Median overall survival was 16.9 months (95% CI 1.5-32.3), and median event-free survival was 11.0 months (1.5-16.7). INTERPRETATION: Enasidenib is generally well tolerated and can induce responses in patients with mutant IDH2 myelodysplastic syndromes, including in those who have had previous therapy with hypomethylating agents. Testing for IDH2 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes is essential for identifying patients who might benefit from enasidenib therapy, including those patients in whom conventional treatments have been unsuccessful.

BCL-2 family proteins are important regulators of apoptosis in pediatric solid tumors. In the current study, we discover that rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma cell lines are co-dependent on BCL-XL and MCL-1 for survival. A-1331852/S63845 co-treatment, but not combinations of either inhibitor with ABT-199, synergistically induces rapid intrinsic apoptosis in vitro and demonstrates efficiency in an in vivo embryonic chicken model of rhabdomyosarcoma. Interestingly, A-1331852/S63845-induced apoptosis is BAX/BAK-dependent and mediated by displacement of BAK from BCL-XL and MCL-1, respectively. Moreover, BAK interacts with BAX to build a pore-forming complex in the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to loss of mitochondrial outer membrane potential and caspase activation. Furthermore, in RD cells A-1331852/S63845 co-treatment disrupts BIM and NOXA in their interactions with BCL-XL and MCL-1, respectively, thereby contributing to apoptosis. Altogether, this study is the first to demonstrate the potency of A-1331852/S63845 in pediatric solid tumor cells and to describe the molecular mechanisms of A-1331852/S63845 co-treatment underlining the potential of BCL-XL and MCL-1 inhibition as treatment regime.","['Kehr, Sarah', 'Haydn, Tinka', 'Bierbrauer, Annika', 'Irmer, Barnabas', 'Vogler, Meike', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Kehr S', 'Haydn T', 'Bierbrauer A', 'Irmer B', 'Vogler M', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Komturstr. 3a, 60528, Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner site Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.

METHODS AND PATIENTS: Fifty-five consecutive AML patients were treated with MEC from 2009 to 2018. Chemosensitivity was evaluated by WT1 quantification. RESULTS: 27/55 patients (49.1%) had AML resistant to induction and 28/55 patients (50.9%) had AML relapse. 25/55 patients (45.5%) achieved a CR after one course of MEC, and 12 patients (21.8%) achieved WT1 negativity. In 12 patients, a second MEC was administered. Four out of 12 patients improved significantly their response with the 2nd MEC. MEC was an effective bridge to transplant, 32/55 patients (58.2%) received an allogenic stem cell transplant. Median overall survival (OS) from MEC was 455 days (95% CI 307-602 days.); patient with WT1 negative CR had the best OS (P<.000). CONCLUSION: WT1 is a useful marker of chemosensitivity after MEC as rescue and bridge-to-transplant therapy.","['Marconi, Giovanni', 'Talami, Annalisa', 'Abbenante, Maria Chiara', 'Sartor, Chiara', 'Parisi, Sarah', 'Nanni, Jacopo', 'Bertamini, Luca', 'Ragaini, Simone', 'Olivi, Matteo', 'de Polo, Stefano', 'Cristiano, Gianluca', 'Fontana, Maria Chiara', 'Bochicchio, Maria Teresa', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Arpinati, Mario', 'Sessa, Mariarosaria', 'Baldazzi, Carmen', 'Caso, Lucia', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Bonifazi, Francesca', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Curti, Antonio']","['Marconi G', 'Talami A', 'Abbenante MC', 'Sartor C', 'Parisi S', 'Nanni J', 'Bertamini L', 'Ragaini S', 'Olivi M', 'de Polo S', 'Cristiano G', 'Fontana MC', 'Bochicchio MT', 'Ottaviani E', 'Arpinati M', 'Sessa M', 'Baldazzi C', 'Caso L', 'Testoni N', 'Baccarani M', 'Bonifazi F', 'Martinelli G', 'Paolini S', 'Cavo M', 'Papayannidis C', 'Curti A']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

Current surgical and pharmacological approaches are ineffective, and liver transplantation represents the only curative option. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and histone deacetylase 6 inhibitors (HDAC6is) have arisen as promising therapeutic strategies, but with partial benefits. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Here, we tested an approach based on the design, synthesis, and validation of a family of UDCA synthetic conjugates with selective HDAC6i capacity (UDCA-HDAC6i). Four UDCA-HDAC6i conjugates presented selective HDAC6i activity, UDCA-HDAC6i #1 being the most promising candidate. UDCA orientation within the UDCA-HDAC6i structure was determinant for HDAC6i activity and selectivity. Treatment of polycystic rats with UDCA-HDAC6i #1 reduced their hepatomegaly and cystogenesis, increased UDCA concentration, and inhibited HDAC6 activity in liver. In cystic cholangiocytes UDCA-HDAC6i #1 restored primary cilium length and exhibited potent antiproliferative activity. UDCA-HDAC6i #1 was actively transported into cells through BA and organic cation transporters. CONCLUSIONS: These UDCA-HDAC6i conjugates open a therapeutic avenue for PLDs.","['Caballero-Camino, Francisco J', 'Rivilla, Ivan', 'Herraez, Elisa', 'Briz, Oscar', 'Santos-Laso, Alvaro',

Patients undergoing TKI therapy should be closely monitored to ensure that the best therapeutic response and quality of life are achieved, and to control suboptimal responses and adverse events. Despite the high rate of response using current first-line TKIs, treatment failure may still occur, and resistance is considered a challenge in the treatment of patients with CML. The third-generation TKI, ponatinib, is a potent orally bioavailable pan BCR-ABL inhibitor that inhibits both wild-type and mutant BCR-ABL1 kinase, including the ""gatekeeper"" T315I mutation, which is resistant to all other currently available TKIs. This paper reviews the effectiveness, feasibility, and safety of ponatinib in the real-life clinical management of CML. Potential prognostic factors in identifying patients most likely to benefit from ponatinib treatment will be discussed, and case presentations illustrating situations encountered in real-life clinical practice are described. Ponatinib is effective in patients who have received prior TKIs in clinical studies as well as under real-life conditions. Nevertheless, the risk/benefit balance must be evaluated for each patient, particularly considering disease state, mutational status, treatment line, intolerance/resistance to prior TKIs, age, frailty, and specific comorbidities.","['Luciano, Luigia', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Attolico, Immacolata', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Maggi, Alessandro', 'Malato, Alessandra', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Palmieri, Fausto', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Sgherza, Nicola', 'Specchia, Giorgina']","['Luciano L', 'Annunziata M', 'Attolico I', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Maggi A', 'Malato A', 'Martino B', 'Palmieri F', 'Pane F', 'Sgherza N', 'Specchia G']","['Hematology - Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University, Napoli, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, AORN Cardarelli, Naples, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Unit, Policlinico of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, AOU Policlinico-OVE, Department of Surgery and Medical Specialties, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, Hospital ""S.G.

The differential diagnosis is extensive and the success of identifying a cause depends on the thoroughness of efforts to establish a diagnosis. For the early diagnosis of NIHF, a virtual gene panel diagnostic tool was developed. The female premature baby in question was delivered via emergency cesarean at 30 + 1 weeks of gestational age (GA) due to rapidly developing NIHF to a healthy mother. The family history was noncontributory. METHODS: DNA of the family was extracted and sequenced by the virtual hydrops panel with whole-exome sequencing. RESULTS: The hydrops panel revealed Noonan syndrome (NS) with a germline mutation in PTPN11 c.218C>T (p.Thr73Ile). CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of our patient was rapidly confirmed by the hydrops panel. The variant of c.218C>T (p.Thr73Ile) has not yet been described in literature relating to NIHF. Only a few case reports of this variant are known. This particular mutation is associated with Noonan syndrome, congenital heart defect and persistent thrombocytopenia.

We review the classification, clinical presentation, histology, cytogenetics, and the treatment of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Burkitt's lymphoma might be associated with tumor lysis syndrome which is a potentially fatal complication that occurs spontaneously or upon initiation of chemotherapy. Major improvements were made in the treatment of pediatric and adults population using short-course dose-intensive chemotherapy regimens, usually 1 week after a prephase induction. Addition of Rituximab to chemotherapy has become a standard of care. Relapsed/refractory disease has a very poor prognosis and the benefit from autologous/allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant remains uncertain. Rituximab-based short-course dose-intensive chemotherapy is the standard of care of Burkitt's lymphoma even in the immunodeficiency-related form.","['Saleh, Khalil', 'Michot, Jean-Marie', 'Camara-Clayette, Valerie', 'Vassetsky, Yegor', 'Ribrag, Vincent']","['Saleh K', 'Michot JM', 'Camara-Clayette V', 'Vassetsky Y', 'Ribrag V']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut de Cancerologie Gustave Roussy, 114 Rue Edouard Vaillant, 94810, Villejuif, France."", 'DITEP, Institut de Cancerologie Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Plateforme AMMICA, Recherche Translationnelle Hematologie, INSERM US23/CNRS UMS3655, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris Sud, Institut de Cancerologie Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR 9018, Universite Paris Sud, Institut de Cancerologie Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut de Cancerologie Gustave Roussy, 114 Rue Edouard Vaillant, 94810, Villejuif, France. vincent.ribrag@gustaveroussy.fr."", 'DITEP, Institut de Cancerologie Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. vincent.ribrag@gustaveroussy.fr.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20200306,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/metabolism', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,['NOTNLM'],"[""*Burkitt's lymphoma"", '*C-MYC', '*CODOX-M/IVAC', '*DA-EPOCH-R', '*Endemic form', '*GMALL-B-ALL/NHL', '*HOVON', '*Immunodeficiency-related', '*L3ALL', '*LMB', '*Sporadic form', '*T(8;14)', '*Tumor lysis syndrome', '*hyperCVAD']",2020/03/08 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/03/08 06:00'],"['2020/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-020-0898-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-020-0898-8 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2020 Mar 6;22(4):33. doi: 10.1007/s11912-020-0898-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhancers are able to activate transcription of genes involved in normal cell biology, whereas aberrant enhancer activity leads to oncogenesis. MYC is a well-established proto-oncogene involved in half of human cancers amplifying the output of its targets. The crosstalk between MYC and enhancers is known for many years since the discovery of IgH enhancer juxtaposition with MYC in high-grade lymphomas. Here, we focus mainly in the enhancers surrounding MYC in the 8q24 locus. That region comprises several enhancers that associate with other transcription factors, transmembrane receptors, and fusion genes composing complex regulatory networks aberrantly expressed in almost all types of hematological malignancies. Understanding the nature of these interactions in normal blood cells and in leukemias/lymphomas will expand MYC targeting options in the armamentarium against hematological cancers.","['Benetatos, Leonidas', 'Benetatou, Agapi', 'Vartholomatos, George']","['Benetatos L', 'Benetatou A', 'Vartholomatos G']","['Blood Bank, Preveza General Hospital, 48100, Preveza, Greece. benetatosleon@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Health Sciences, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.', 'Molecular Biology Laboratory, Ioannina University Hospital, Ioannina, Greece.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200306,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Enhancers', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Leukemia', '*MYC', '*Transcription factor']",2020/03/08 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00109-020-01891-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00109-020-01891-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2020 Apr;98(4):471-481. doi: 10.1007/s00109-020-01891-1.

However, the development of novel therapies is still required, especially for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. By utilizing an in vitro drug screening system, active molecular targeting agents against ALL were explored in this study. METHODS: By the in vitro drug sensitivity test, 81 agents with various actions were screened for their cytotoxicity in a panel of 22 ALL cell lines and ALL clinical samples. The drug effect score (DES) was calculated from the dose-response of each drug for comparison among drugs or samples. Normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were also applied onto the drug screening to provide the reference control values. The drug combination effect was screened based on the Bliss independent model, and validated by the improved isobologram method. RESULTS: On sensitivity screening in a cell line panel, barasertib-HQPA which is an active metabolite of barasertib, an aurora B kinase inhibitor, alisertib, an aurora A kinase inhibitor, and YM155, a survivin inhibitor, were effective against the broadest range of ALL cells. The DES of barasertib-HQPA was significantly higher in ALL clinical samples compared to the reference value. There were significant correlations in DES between barasertib-HQPA and vincristine or docetaxel. In the drug combination assay, barasertib-HQPA and eribulin showed additive to synergistic effects. CONCLUSION: Aurora B kinase was identified to be an active therapeutic target in a broad range of ALL cells. Combination therapy of barasertib and a microtubule-targeting drug is of clinical interest.","['Goto, Hiroaki', 'Yoshino, Yuki', 'Ito, Mieko', 'Nagai, Junichi', 'Kumamoto, Tadashi', 'Inukai, Takesi', 'Sakurai, Yukari', 'Miyagawa, Naoyuki', 'Keino, Dai', 'Yokosuka, Tomoko', 'Iwasaki, Fuminori', 'Hamanoue, Satoshi', 'Shiomi, Masae', 'Goto, Shoko']","['Goto H', 'Yoshino Y', 'Ito M', 'Nagai J', 'Kumamoto T', 'Inukai T', 'Sakurai Y', 'Miyagawa N', 'Keino D', 'Yokosuka T', 'Iwasaki F', 'Hamanoue S', 'Shiomi M', 'Goto S']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan. hgotou@kcmc.jp."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Yamanashi University, Kofu, Japan.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa Minami-Ku, Yokohama, Japan.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6737-1509'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200306,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Furans)', '0 (Ketones)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '29P8LWS24N (AZD 1152-HQPA)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'LR24G6354G (eribulin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Aurora Kinase A/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Docetaxel/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Furans/administration & dosage', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Ketones/administration & dosage', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Aurora B kinase', '*Barasertib', '*In vitro drug sensitivity test', '*Survivin']",2020/03/08 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-020-04045-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-020-04045-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2020 Apr;85(4):773-783. doi: 10.1007/s00280-020-04045-9.

Existing meta-analysis approaches in systems biology often focus on hypothesis testing and neglect real expression changes, i.e. effect sizes, across independent studies. In addition, most integrative tools completely ignore the topological order of gene regulatory networks that hold key characteristics in understanding biological processes. Here we introduce a novel meta-analysis framework, Network-Based Integrative Analysis (NBIA), that transforms the challenging meta-analysis problem into a set of standard pathway analysis problems that have been solved efficiently. NBIA utilizes techniques from classical and modern meta-analysis, as well as a network-based analysis, in order to identify patterns of genes and networks that are consistently impacted across multiple studies. We assess the performance of NBIA by comparing it with nine meta-analysis approaches: Impact Analysis, GSA, and GSEA combined with classical meta-analysis methods (Fisher's and the additive method), plus the three MetaPath approaches that employ multiple datasets. The 10 approaches have been tested on 1,737 samples from 27 expression datasets related to Alzheimer's disease, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and influenza. For all of the three diseases, NBIA consistently identifies biological pathways relevant to the underlying diseases while the other 9 methods fail to capture the key phenomena. The identified AML signature is also validated on a completely independent cohort of 167 AML patients. In this independent cohort, the proposed signature identifies two groups of patients that have significantly different survival profiles (Cox p-value 2 x 10(-6)). The NBIA framework will be included in the next release of BLMA Bioconductor package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BLMA.html).","['Nguyen, Tin', 'Shafi, Adib', 'Nguyen, Tuan-Minh', 'Schissler, A Grant', 'Draghici, Sorin']","['Nguyen T', 'Shafi A', 'Nguyen TM', 'Schissler AG', 'Draghici S']","['Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, 89557, Nevada, United States. tinn@unr.edu.', 'Wayne State University, Department of Computer Science, Detroit, 48202, Michigan, United States.', 'Wayne State University, Department of Computer Science, Detroit, 48202, Michigan, United States.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Nevada, Reno, 89557, Nevada, United States.', 'Wayne State University, Department of Computer Science, Detroit, 48202, Michigan, United States.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8001-9470', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2066-6163', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0786-8377']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200306,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,,PMC7060280,,,,2020/03/08 06:00,2020/03/08 06:01,['2020/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-60981-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-60981-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Mar 6;10(1):4188. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-60981-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of donor developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia 8 yrs after donating both bone marrow and peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes a 51-year old female diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who donated both bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells 8 yrs ago for her brother with severe aplastic anemia. Whole exome sequencing revealed leukemic genetic lesions (SF3B1 and BRAF mutation) only appeared in the donor sister, not the recipient, and an unusual type of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with the recipient's peripheral blood stem cells was done. The patient remained in remission for 3 months before disease relapsed. CD19 CAR-T therapy followed by HLA-identical unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was applied and the patient remains in remission for 7 months till now. CONCLUSIONS: This donor leukemia report supports the hypothesis that genetic lesions happen randomly in leukemogenesis. SF3B1 combined with BRAF mutation might contribute to the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Zhou, Di', 'Xie, Ting', 'Chen, Suning', 'Ling, Yipeng', 'Xu, Yueyi', 'Chen, Bing', 'Ouyang, Jian', 'Yang, Yonggong']","['Zhou D', 'Xie T', 'Chen S', 'Ling Y', 'Xu Y', 'Chen B', 'Ouyang J', 'Yang Y']","[""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China. 915834491@qq.com.""]",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200306,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors/genetics', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",PMC7060641,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BRAF', 'Donor leukemia', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'SF3B1']",2020/03/08 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2020/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-6681-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-6681-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Mar 6;20(1):195. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-6681-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technical and logistical issues, however, make it challenging to accurately detect abnormal copy number events in a cost-effective manner in clinical studies. RESULTS: Here we present CNV Radar, a software tool that utilizes next-generation sequencing read depth information and variant allele frequency patterns, to infer the true copy number status of genes and genomic regions from whole exome sequencing data. Evaluation of CNV Radar in a public multiple myeloma dataset demonstrated that CNV Radar was able to detect a variety of CNVs associated with risk of progression, and we observed > 70% concordance with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results. Compared to other CNV callers, CNV Radar showed high sensitivity and specificity. Similar results were observed when comparing CNV Radar calls to single nucleotide polymorphism array results from acute myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer datasets available on TCGA. More importantly, CNV Radar demonstrated its utility in the clinical trial setting: in POLLUX and CASTOR, two phase 3 studies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, we observed a high concordance rate with FISH for del17p, a risk defining CNV event (88% in POLLUX and 90% in CASTOR), therefore allowing for efficacy assessments in clinically relevant disease subgroups. Our case studies also showed that CNV Radar is capable of detecting abnormalities such as copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity that elude other approaches. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that CNV Radar is more sensitive than other CNV detection methods, accurately detects clinically important cytogenetic events, and allows for further interrogation of novel disease biology. Overall, CNV Radar exhibited high concordance with standard methods such as FISH, and its success in the POLLUX and CASTOR clinical trials demonstrated its potential utility for informing clinical and therapeutic decisions.","['Soong, David', 'Stratford, Jeran', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Bahlis, Nizar', 'Davies, Faith', 'Dispenzieri, Angela', 'Sasser, A Kate', 'Schecter, Jordan M', 'Qi, Ming', 'Brown, Chad', 'Jones, Wendell', 'Keats, Jonathan J', 'Auclair, Daniel', 'Chiu, Christopher', 'Powers, Jason', 'Schaffer, Michael']","['Soong D', 'Stratford J', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Bahlis N', 'Davies F', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Sasser AK', 'Schecter JM', 'Qi M', 'Brown C', 'Jones W', 'Keats JJ', 'Auclair D', 'Chiu C', 'Powers J', 'Schaffer M']","['Janssen Research & Development, LLC, 1400 McKean Road, Spring House, PA, 19477, USA. david.soong@caa.columbia.edu.', 'Q2 Solutions, EA Genomics, Morrisville, NC, USA.', 'Unite de Genomique du Myelome, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'University of Calgary, Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Myeloma Institute, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Division of Hematology, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Genmab, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Raritan, NJ, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, 1400 McKean Road, Spring House, PA, 19477, USA.', 'OmicSoft Corporation, Cary, NC, USA.', 'Q2 Solutions, EA Genomics, Morrisville, NC, USA.', 'Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Norwalk, CT, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, 1400 McKean Road, Spring House, PA, 19477, USA.', 'Q2 Solutions, EA Genomics, Morrisville, NC, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, 1400 McKean Road, Spring House, PA, 19477, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200306,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'ROC Curve', '*Software']",PMC7060549,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Copy number variation', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Next generation sequencing', 'Prostate cancer']",2020/03/08 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2020/03/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-020-3397-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-020-3397-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 Mar 6;21(1):98. doi: 10.1186/s12859-020-3397-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed the occurrence of nonsyndromic oral clefts in families of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 50) and controls (n = 125). The parents of the patients answered a questionnaire with basic demographic information and family history of nonsyndromic oral clefts in first-degree relatives. Statistical analysis was carried out using Fisher's exact test. In the ALL group, 22 (44%) were male and 28 (56%) were female, and the average age was 13.2 +/- 12.2 years. In the control group, 64 (51.2%) were male and 65 were female and the average age was 11.3 +/- 10.3 years. Two out of 50 patients (4%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had a positive history of nonsyndromic oral clefts, whereas there were no reported occurrences of nonsyndromic oral clefts in the control group (OR: 12.94, 95% CI: 0.61-274.6, p = 0.08). Despite the limited population, the frequency of nonsyndromic oral clefts was increased in the first-degree relatives of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

We designed a comprehensive fluorescence in situ hybridization (CI-FISH) assay that consists of genomic probes to simultaneously investigate oncogenes and oncosuppressors recurrently involved in chromosome rearrangements in T-ALL, which was applied to 338 T-ALL cases. CI-FISH provided genetic classification into one of the well-defined genetic subgroups (ie, TAL/LMO, HOXA, TLX3, TLX1, NKX2-1/2-2, or MEF2C) in 80% of cases. Two patients with translocations of the LMO3 transcription factor were identified, suggesting that LMO3 activation may serve as an alternative to LMO1/LMO2 activation in the pathogenesis of this disease. Moreover, intrachromosomal rearrangements that involved the 10q24 locus were found as a new mechanism of TLX1 activation. An unequal distribution of cooperating genetic defects was found among the six genetic subgroups. Interestingly, deletions that targeted TCF7 or TP53 were exclusively found in HOXA T-ALL, LEF1 defects were prevalent in NKX2-1 rearranged patients, CASP8AP2 and PTEN alterations were significantly enriched in TAL/LMO leukemias, and PTPN2 and NUP214-ABL1 abnormalities occurred in TLX1/TLX3.

Given the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) enzymes in leukemogenesis, we designed a study to investigate the anti-leukemic property of panobinostat, a HDAC inhibitor, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Our results showed that panobinostat decreased cell viability of pre-B ALL-derived cells. The favorable anti-leukemic effects of the inhibitor was further confirmed by cell cycle analysis, where we found that panobinostat prolonged the transition of the cells from G1 phase probably through c-Myc-mediated up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Unlike the apoptotic effect of panobinostat on Nalm-6 cells, the expression of anti-apoptotic nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) target genes remained unchanged. Accordingly, we found that the inhibition of NF-kappaB pathway using bortezomib boosted the effect of panobinostat, indicating that panobinostat-induced apoptosis could be attenuated through the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. The results of the present study reflected another aspect of autophagy in leukemic cells, as we showed that although Nalm-6 cells could exploit autophagy to override the anti-survival effect of HDAC inhibition, the presence of an autophagy inhibitor could alter the compensatory circumstance to induce cell death. Beyond panobinostat cytotoxicity as a single agent, synergistic experiments outlined that pharmaceutical targeting of HDACs could amplify the cytotoxicity of vincristine in ALL cells, delineating that panobinostat, either as a single agent or in a combined modality, possesses novel promising potentials for the treatment of ALL.","['Mehrpouri, Mahdieh', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Bashash, Davood']","['Mehrpouri M', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi A', 'Momeny M', 'Bashash D']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Student Research Committee, Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Student Research Committee, Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Student Research Committee, Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Turku Bioscience Centre, University of Turku and Abo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Previous studies have demonstrated that molecules able to disrupt this interaction improve the nuclear translocation of c-Abl, inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells. Through an X-ray crystallography screening program, we have identified two phosphate-containing compounds, inosine monophosphate (IMP) and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), as binders of human 14-3-3sigma, by targeting the protein amphipathic groove. Interestingly, they also act as weak inhibitors of the 14-3-3/c-Abl PPI, demonstrated by NMR, SPR, and FP data. A 37-compound library of PLP and IMP analogues was investigated using a FP assay, leading to the identification of three further molecules acting as weak inhibitors of the 14-3-3/c-Abl complex formation. The antiproliferative activity of IMP, PLP, and the three derivatives was tested against K-562 cells, showing that the parent compounds had the most pronounced effect on tumor cells. PLP and IMP were also effective in promoting the c-Abl nuclear translocation in c-Abl overexpressing cells. Further, these compounds demonstrated low cytotoxicity on human Hs27 fibroblasts. In conclusion, our data suggest that 14-3-3sigma targeting compounds represent promising hits for further development of drugs against c-Abl-dependent cancers.","['Iralde-Lorente, Leire', 'Tassone, Giusy', 'Clementi, Letizia', 'Franci, Lorenzo', 'Munier, Claire C', 'Cau, Ylenia', 'Mori, Mattia', 'Chiariello, Mario', 'Angelucci, Adriano', 'Perry, Matthew W D', 'Pozzi, Cecilia', 'Mangani, Stefano', 'Botta, Maurizio']","['Iralde-Lorente L', 'Tassone G', 'Clementi L', 'Franci L', 'Munier CC', 'Cau Y', 'Mori M', 'Chiariello M', 'Angelucci A', 'Perry MWD', 'Pozzi C', 'Mangani S', 'Botta M']","['Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy-Department of Excellence 2018-2022, Universita degli Studi di Siena, via Aldo Moro 2, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy-Department of Excellence 2018-2022, Universita degli Studi di Siena, via Aldo Moro 2, 53100 Siena, Italy.', ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, 67100, L'Aquila, Italy."", 'Istituto per lo Studio, la Prevenzione e la Rete Oncologica (ISPRO), Via Fiorentina, 1 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche - Dipartimento di Eccellenza 2018-2022, Universita degli Studi di Siena, via Aldo Moro, 2 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica, Via Fiorentina 1, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Medicinal Chemistry, Research and Early Development, Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmune (RIA), BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg 431 83, Sweden.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy-Department of Excellence 2018-2022, Universita degli Studi di Siena, via Aldo Moro 2, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy-Department of Excellence 2018-2022, Universita degli Studi di Siena, via Aldo Moro 2, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Istituto per lo Studio, la Prevenzione e la Rete Oncologica (ISPRO), Via Fiorentina, 1 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica, Via Fiorentina 1, 53100 Siena, Italy.', ""Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila, 67100, L'Aquila, Italy."", 'Medicinal Chemistry, Research and Early Development, Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmune (RIA), BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg 431 83, Sweden.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy-Department of Excellence 2018-2022, Universita degli Studi di Siena, via Aldo Moro 2, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy-Department of Excellence 2018-2022, Universita degli Studi di Siena, via Aldo Moro 2, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy-Department of Excellence 2018-2022, Universita degli Studi di Siena, via Aldo Moro 2, 53100 Siena, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2398-1254', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8434-5177', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8755-1889', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9799-0746', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2574-3911', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4824-7478', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0456-6995']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200320,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '131-99-7 (Inosine Monophosphate)', '5V5IOJ8338 (Pyridoxal Phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (SFN protein, human)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Exoribonucleases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inosine Monophosphate/metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity', 'K562 Cells', 'Organophosphates/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Protein Binding/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate/metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology/toxicity']",,,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.0c00039 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2020 Apr 17;15(4):1026-1035. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.0c00039.

Central nervous system-directed ALL therapies also put children at risk for cognitive impairments. Cancer therapies can cause an increase in oxidative stress, which may contribute to treatment-related symptoms. This study examined the longitudinal relationships between biomarkers of oxidative stress in the cerebrospinal fluid, the Childhood Cancer Symptom Cluster-Leukemia (CCSC-L), and cognition, in children over the first year of ALL treatment. Methods: Glutathione (GSH) biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured in cerebrospinal fluid collected during treatment lumbar punctures. GSH biomarkers, symptoms, and cognitive function of 132 children aged 3 to 18 years were evaluated at four time points during the first year of leukemia treatment. Participants, 7 years and older, completed self-report measures, and parents reported for younger children. Cognitive function measurements for all participants were completed by parents. A longitudinal parallel-process model was used to explore the influence of the initial measurement and the subsequent change over four time points of the GSH biomarkers on the CCSC-L and cognition. Results: GSH biomarkers increased over the four time points indicating decreasing oxidative stress. When GSH biomarkers were higher (less oxidative stress) at the initial measurement, the CCSC-L severity was lower, cognition was better, and cognition improved over the four measurements. Screening children for high levels of oxidative stress would be a foundation for future intervention studies to address symptom distress and cognitive impairments.","['Hooke, Mary C', 'Hatch, Daniel', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn J', 'Whitman, Susan', 'Moore, Ida', 'Montgomery, David', 'Marano, Kari', 'Mitby, Pauline', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Taylor, Olga', 'Pan, Wei']","['Hooke MC', 'Hatch D', 'Hockenberry MJ', 'Whitman S', 'Moore I', 'Montgomery D', 'Marano K', 'Mitby P', 'Scheurer ME', 'Taylor O', 'Pan W']","['University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', ""Children's Minnesota Cancer and Blood Disorders Program, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", 'Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', ""Children's Minnesota Cancer and Blood Disorders Program, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers/Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', ""Children's Minnesota Cancer and Blood Disorders Program, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers/Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers/Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6137-9224'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200306,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/*physiology', 'Fatigue/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Nausea/etiology', 'Oncology Nursing/methods', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Pain/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications/therapy', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology', 'Syndrome']",PMC7312345,,['NOTNLM'],"['*biomarkers', '*cognitive functioning', '*leukemia', '*symptom cluster']",2020/03/07 06:00,2021/03/23 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1043454220909785 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2020 Jul/Aug;37(4):244-254. doi: 10.1177/1043454220909785.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death reported to limit the size of organizers. Little is known about the identity of intracellular signals driving organizer cell death. Here we investigated in Xenopus the role of both the anti-apoptotic protein Myeloid-cell-leukemia 1 (Mcl1) and the cysteine proteases Caspase-3 and Caspase-7 in formation of the axial organizing center-the notochord-that derives from the Spemann organizer, and participates in the induction and patterning of the neuroepithelium. RESULTS: We confirm a role for apoptosis in establishing the axial organizer in early neurula. We show that the expression pattern of mcl1 is coherent with a role for this gene in early notochord development. Using loss of function approaches, we demonstrate that Mcl1 depletion decreases neuroepithelium width and increases notochord cells apoptosis, a process that relies on Caspase-7, and not on Caspase-3, activity. Our data provide evidence that Mcl1 protein levels physiologically control notochord cells' survival and that Caspase-7 is the executioner protease in this developmental process. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals new functions for Mcl1 and Caspase-7 in formation of the axial signalling center.","['Sena, Elena', 'Bou-Rouphael, Johnny', 'Rocques, Nathalie', 'Carron-Homo, Clemence', 'Durand, Beatrice C']","['Sena E', 'Bou-Rouphael J', 'Rocques N', 'Carron-Homo C', 'Durand BC']","['Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Orsay, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, CNRS UMR7622, IBPS Developmental Biology Laboratory, Paris, France.', 'Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Orsay, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, CNRS UMR7622, IBPS Developmental Biology Laboratory, Paris, France.', 'Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Orsay, France.', 'Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, CNRS UMR7622, IBPS Developmental Biology Laboratory, Paris, France.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1220-5639', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0047-288X']",['eng'],"['DOC20170505923/Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer/International', 'CNRS-UMR3347/Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique/International', 'FPGG0039/Fondation Pierre Gilles de Gennes/International', 'INSERM-U1021/Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche', 'Medicale/International', 'RS19/75-52/Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer Comite Ile de France/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200316,United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Body Patterning/physiology', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis', 'Caspase 7/*biosynthesis', '*Cell Survival', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Notochord/metabolism', 'Organizers, Embryonic/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenopus Proteins/genetics', 'Xenopus laevis/embryology/genetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*mcl1', '*neuroepithelium', '*organizer', '*xenopus']",2020/03/07 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dvdy.169 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2020 Jul;249(7):847-866. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.169.

To address this issue, a library of 17 novel COL derivatives, namely N-carbamates of N-deacetyl-4-(bromo/chloro/iodo)thiocolchicine, has been tested against two types of primary cancer cells. These included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and human breast cancer (BC) derived from two different tumor subtypes, ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma grade III (IDCG3) and metastatic carcinoma (MC). Four novel COL derivatives showed higher anti-proliferative activity than COL (IC50 = 8.6 nM) towards primary ALL cells in cell viability assays (IC50 range of 1.1-6.4 nM), and several were more potent towards primary IDCG3 (IC50 range of 0.1 to 10.3 nM) or MC (IC50 range of 2.3-9.1 nM) compared to COL (IC50 of 11.1 and 11.7 nM, respectively). In addition, several derivatives were selectively active toward primary breast cancer cells compared to normal breast epithelial cells. The most promising derivatives were subsequently tested against the NCI panel of 60 human cancer cell lines and seven derivatives were more potent than COL against leukemia, non-small-cell lung, colon, CNS and prostate cancers. Finally, COL and two of the most active derivatives were shown to be effective in killing BC cells when tested ex vivo using fresh human breast tumor explants. The present findings indicate that the select COL derivatives constitute promising lead compounds targeting specific types of cancer.","['Urbaniak, Alicja', 'Jousheghany, Fariba', 'Pina-Oviedo, Sergio', 'Yuan, Youzhong', 'Majcher-Uchanska, Urszula', 'Klejborowska, Greta', 'Moorjani, Anika', 'Monzavi-Karbassi, Behjatolah', 'Huczynski, Adam', 'Chambers, Timothy C']","['Urbaniak A', 'Jousheghany F', 'Pina-Oviedo S', 'Yuan Y', 'Majcher-Uchanska U', 'Klejborowska G', 'Moorjani A', 'Monzavi-Karbassi B', 'Huczynski A', 'Chambers TC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0807-1263', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3122-9794']",['eng'],"['2016/21/B/ST5/00111/Polish Science Centre', 'Arkansas Breast Cancer Research Program']",['Journal Article'],20200305,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carbamates/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colchicine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Colchicum/chemistry', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Middle Aged', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['breast cancer', 'colchicine', 'ex vivo', 'explant', 'primary cells']",2020/03/07 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2019/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.22487 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2020 Jun;34(6):e22487. doi: 10.1002/jbt.22487.

However, translation of TRAIL to clinical studies was less successful as a large number of cancer cells acquire resistance to TRAIL-based monotherapies. An ideal strategy to overcome TRAIL resistance is to combine it with potential sensitizing agents. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the TRAIL-sensitizing effect of curcumin in leukemia. METHODS: The mechanism underlying TRAIL sensitization by curcumin was studied by flow cytometric analysis of TRAIL receptors in leukemic cell lines and patient samples, and immunoblot detection of TRAIL-apoptosis signaling proteins. RESULTS: Curcumin augments TRAIL-apoptotic signaling in leukemic cells by upregulating the expression of DR4 and DR5 along with suppression of cFLIP and anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, and XIAP. Curcumin pre-treatment significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the sensitivity of leukemic cell lines to TRAIL recombinant proteins. IL2-TRAIL peptide in the presence of curcumin induced potent apoptosis (p < 0.001) as compared to TRAIL and IL2-TRAIL protein in leukemic cell lines with IC50 < 0.1 muMu. Additionally, the combination of IL2-TRAIL peptide and curcumin showed significant cytotoxicity in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with an efficacy of 90% in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but 100% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). CONCLUSION: Overall, our results suggest that curcumin potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis through modulation of death receptors and anti-apoptotic proteins which significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy.","['Surapally, Sridevi', 'Jayaprakasam, Madhumathi', 'Verma, Rama Shanker']","['Surapally S', 'Jayaprakasam M', 'Verma RS']","['Stem Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences Building, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600036, India.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India.', 'Stem Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences Building, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600036, India. vermars@iitm.ac.in.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200305,Switzerland,Pharmacol Rep,Pharmacological reports : PR,101234999,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Curcumin/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Curcumin', 'Death receptors', 'Leukemia', 'TRAIL Resistance']",2020/03/07 06:00,2021/05/29 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s43440-020-00073-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s43440-020-00073-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Rep. 2020 Aug;72(4):1032-1046. doi: 10.1007/s43440-020-00073-7.

This paper analyses the output, outcome and impact of the program between 2001 and 2014 using the data collected by the Max Foundation. Method: We extracted data on GIPAP patients' country of residence, sex, diagnosis, date of enrollment in GIPAP, age at enrollment, case closure date, and reason for closure from The Max Foundation database covering the period 2001 to 2014. We used Kaplan-Meier method to assess the survival rate of patients in GIPAP and used the proportional hazard regression model to estimate the effect of different variables on patients' survival. Findings: About 63,000 GIPAP patients in 93 countries received over 71 million defined daily doses (DDD) of imatinib between 2001 and 2014. Our analysis showed that GIPAP patients had a 5-year survival rate of 89% which compares favorably to survival in high income countries despite the challenges of delivering cancer care in LMICs. Age at enrollment into the program, sex, duration between diagnosis and enrollment into program, year of enrollment, and patients' diagnosis (CML vs non-CML) were factors that influenced survival. Interpretation: The GIPAP program has improved the survival of CML and GIST patients in LMICs, most of whom would not have had access to imatinib in the absence of the donation and therapeutic support of the program. Funding: This work was funded as part of Access Accelerated case studies. Access Accelerated is an initiative of more than 20 global biopharmaceutical companies in partnership with the World Bank and Union of International Cancer Control that seeks to reduce barriers to prevention, treatment and care for non-communicable diseases in LMICs.","['Umeh, Chukwuemeka A', 'Garcia-Gonzalez, Pat', 'Tremblay, David', 'Laing, Richard']","['Umeh CA', 'Garcia-Gonzalez P', 'Tremblay D', 'Laing R']","['Department of Global Health, Boston University School of Public Health, MA, 801 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA 02118, United States.', 'Hemet Valley Medical Center, 1117 E Devonshire Ave, Hemet, CA 92543, United States.', 'The Max Foundation, Global Headquarters, 1107 NE 45th Street, Suite 230 Seattle, WA 98105 USA.', 'Novartis-Oncology, 81 Batson Drive Aurora ON L4G 3R2, Canada.', 'Department of Global Health, Boston University School of Public Health, MA, 801 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA 02118, United States.', 'School of Public, Health, Faculty of Community and Health Sciences, University of Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200126,England,EClinicalMedicine,EClinicalMedicine,101733727,,,,PMC7046500,,['NOTNLM'],"['Access observatory', 'CML survival rate', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'GIPAP', 'Glivec International Patient Assistance Program', 'Max foundation', 'Novartis']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:01,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100257 [doi]', 'S2589-5370(20)30001-8 [pii]', '100257 [pii]']",epublish,EClinicalMedicine. 2020 Jan 26;19:100257. doi: 10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100257. eCollection 2020 Feb.,,['(c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],,"['David Tremblay works for Novartis Pharma AG and Pat Garcia-Gonzalez works for The', 'Max Foundation.

In human NK cells, the role of PLZF in liver residency is still unknown. Expression of PLZF in matched human peripheral blood- and liver-derived NK cells and the association of PLZF expression with surface molecules and transcription factors relevant for tissue residency were investigated using multiparameter flow cytometry and assessing single-cell messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Intrahepatic cluster of differentiation (CD)56(bright) NK cells expressed significantly higher levels of PLZF than peripheral blood CD56(bright) NK cells, which were predominantly PLZF(lo). Expression of PLZF was highest within C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6)(+)CD69(+) liver-resident NK cells among intrahepatic CD56(bright) NK cell populations. Association of PLZF with liver-residency markers was also reflected at mRNA levels. A small PLZF(hi)CD56(bright) NK cell population was identified in peripheral blood that also expressed the liver-residency markers CXCR6 and CD69 and shared functional characteristics with liver-resident NK cells. Conclusion: PLZF is implicated as part of a transcriptional network that promotes liver residency of human NK cells. Expression of liver-homing markers on peripheral blood PLZF(hi)CD56(bright) NK cells identifies an intermediate population potentially contributing to the maintenance of liver-resident NK cells.","['Hess, Leonard U', 'Martrus, Gloria', 'Ziegler, Annerose E', 'Langeneckert, Annika E', 'Salzberger, Wilhelm', 'Goebels, Hanna', 'Sagebiel, Adrian F', 'Hagen, Sven H', 'Poch, Tobias', 'Ravichandran, Gevitha', 'Koch, Martina', 'Schramm, Christoph', 'Oldhafer, Karl J', 'Fischer, Lutz', 'Tiegs, Gisa', 'Richert, Laura', 'Bunders, Madeleine J', 'Lunemann, Sebastian', 'Altfeld, Marcus']","['Hess LU', 'Martrus G', 'Ziegler AE', 'Langeneckert AE', 'Salzberger W', 'Goebels H', 'Sagebiel AF', 'Hagen SH', 'Poch T', 'Ravichandran G', 'Koch M', 'Schramm C', 'Oldhafer KJ', 'Fischer L', 'Tiegs G', 'Richert L', 'Bunders MJ', 'Lunemann S', 'Altfeld M']","['Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'First Medical Clinic and Polyclinic Center for Internal Medicine University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology and Hepatology University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg Germany.', 'Division of Transplantation Surgery University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz Germany.', 'First Medical Clinic and Polyclinic Center for Internal Medicine University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg Germany.', 'Martin Zeitz Center for Rare Diseases University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg Germany.', 'Department of General and Abdominal Surgery Asklepios Hospital Barmbek Semmelweis University of Medicine Asklepios Campus Hamburg Germany.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery and Transplant Surgery University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology and Hepatology University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'University of Bordeaux Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Bordeaux Population Health Research Center UMR1219 and Inria, Team SISTM Bordeaux France.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.', 'Research Department Virus Immunology Heinrich Pette Institute Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology Hamburg Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200106,United States,Hepatol Commun,Hepatology communications,101695860,,,,PMC7049682,,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:01,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/hep4.1463 [doi]', 'HEP41463 [pii]']",epublish,Hepatol Commun. 2020 Jan 6;4(3):409-424. doi: 10.1002/hep4.1463. eCollection 2020 Mar.,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Following primary replication in mucosal epithelial cells, the virus can enter sensory neurons innervating peripheral tissues via nerve termini. The viral genome is then transported to the nucleus where it can be maintained without producing infectious progeny, and thus latency is established in the cell. Yin-Yang balance is an essential concept in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory. Yin represents stable and inhibitory factors, and Yang represents the active and aggressive factors. When the organism is exposed to stress, especially psychological stress caused by emotional stimulation, the Yin-Yang balance is disturbed and the virus can re-engage in productive replication, resulting in recurrent diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of the stress-induced susceptibility to HSV-1 primary infection and reactivation is needed and will provide helpful insights into the effective control and treatment of HSV-1. Here we reviewed the recent advances in the studies of HSV-1 susceptibility, latency and reactivation. We included mechanisms involved in primary infection and the regulation of latency and described how stress-induced changes increase the susceptibility to primary and recurrent infections.","['Yan, Chang', 'Luo, Zhuo', 'Li, Wen', 'Li, Xue', 'Dallmann, Robert', 'Kurihara, Hiroshi', 'Li, Yi-Fang', 'He, Rong-Rong']","['Yan C', 'Luo Z', 'Li W', 'Li X', 'Dallmann R', 'Kurihara H', 'Li YF', 'He RR']","['Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Chinese Medicine & Disease Susceptibility, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Chinese Medicine & Disease Susceptibility, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Chinese Medicine & Disease Susceptibility, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Institute of Atmospheric Environmental Safety and Pollution Control, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Chinese Medicine & Disease Susceptibility, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Chinese Medicine & Disease Susceptibility, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Chinese Medicine & Disease Susceptibility, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'International Cooperative Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Modernization and Innovative Drug Development of Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190622,Netherlands,Acta Pharm Sin B,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

These mutational alterations (PIM1, SPEN, and MYD88 [L265P]) and expression signatures (NF-kappaB, IRF4, and JAK-STAT engagement) were associated with proliferative signaling, and were found to be enriched in patients treated with RCHOP that experienced unfavorable outcomes.

We are the first to report the genomic validation of a high-risk phenotype with a preferential response towards R2CHOP therapy in non-GCB DLBCL patients. These conclusions could be translated to a clinical setting to identify the ~38% of non-GCB patients that could be considered high-risk, and would benefit from alternative therapies to standard RCHOP based on personalized genomic data.","['Hartert, Keenan T', 'Wenzl, Kerstin', 'Krull, Jordan E', 'Manske, Michelle', 'Sarangi, Vivekananda', 'Asmann, Yan', 'Larson, Melissa C', 'Maurer, Matthew J', 'Slager, Susan', 'Macon, William R', 'King, Rebecca L', 'Feldman, Andrew L', 'Gandhi, Anita K', 'Link, Brian K', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Yang, Zhi-Zhang', 'Ansell, Stephen M', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Nowakowski, Grzegorz S', 'Novak, Anne J']","['Hartert KT', 'Wenzl K', 'Krull JE', 'Manske M', 'Sarangi V', 'Asmann Y', 'Larson MC', 'Maurer MJ', 'Slager S', 'Macon WR', 'King RL', 'Feldman AL', 'Gandhi AK', 'Link BK', 'Habermann TM', 'Yang ZZ', 'Ansell SM', 'Cerhan JR', 'Witzig TE', 'Nowakowski GS', 'Novak AJ']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Celgene, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Bone & Marrow Transplantation, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

Several diatoms are known to have anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-microbial properties, but the compounds responsible of these activities are often still unknown. The diatom Cylindrotheca closterium showed anti-inflammatory properties inhibiting TNFalpha release in human monocytic leukemia cells. In this study, we present the full transcriptome of C. closterium, and used an -omic approach to identify transcripts coding enzymes that can be involved in the synthesis/degradation of anti-inflammatory compounds. This approach allowed to identify phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphatase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3, phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase and violaxanthin de-epoxidase, which are known to be involved in anti-inflammatory compound metabolism. When C. closterium was cultured in silica-starvation conditions, selected as stress condition to potentially trigger the synthesis of bioactive metabolites, anti-inflammatory activity was lost and expression levels of the analyzed transcripts were reduced. These data suggested that the control culturing condition was the most active. This study used for the first time a transcriptomic-guided approach to identify enzymes involved in anti-inflammatory compound metabolism, directing future discoveries of marine natural products in microalgae.","['Elagoz, Ali M', 'Ambrosino, Luca', 'Lauritano, Chiara']","['Elagoz AM', 'Ambrosino L', 'Lauritano C']","['Department of Integrative Marine Ecology, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Villa Comunale, 80121, Napoli, Italy.', 'Ghent University, Marine Biology Research Group, Krijgslaan 281, B-9000, Gent, Belgium.', 'Research Infrastructure for Marine Biological Resources Department, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Villa Comunale, 80121, Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Integrative Marine Ecology, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Villa Comunale, 80121, Napoli, Italy. chiara.lauritano@szn.it.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4580-9594'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200305,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.64 (phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphatase)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Closterium/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Diatoms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",PMC7058042,,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-61007-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-61007-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Mar 5;10(1):4138. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-61007-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These dichotomous functions are performed by three distinct cell types: energy-storing white adipocytes, and thermogenic beige and brown adipocytes. Previous studies have demonstrated that exposure to environmental cold stimulates the recruitment of beige adipocytes in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice and humans, a process that has been extensively investigated. However, beige adipose tissue also develops during the peri-weaning period in mice, a developmental program that remains poorly understood. Here, we address this gap in our knowledge using genetic, imaging, physiologic, and genomic approaches. We find that, unlike cold-induced recruitment in adult animals, peri-weaning development of beige adipocytes occurs in a temperature- and sympathetic nerve-independent manner. Instead, the transcription factor B cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (BCL6) acts in a cell-autonomous manner to regulate the commitment but not the maintenance phase of beige adipogenesis. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing (seq) studies reveal that BCL6 regulates a core set of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial uncoupling, which are necessary for development of functional beige adipocytes. Together, our findings demonstrate that distinct transcriptional and signaling mechanisms control peri-weaning development and cold-induced recruitment of beige adipocytes in mammals.","['Wu, Yixuan', 'Kinnebrew, Melissa A', 'Kutyavin, Vassily I', 'Chawla, Ajay']","['Wu Y', 'Kinnebrew MA', 'Kutyavin VI', 'Chawla A']","['Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795.', 'Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94115.', 'Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795.', 'Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795; ajay.chawla@merck.com.', 'Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9637-9219'],['eng'],"['P30 DK026743/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK094641/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK101064/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200305,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Bcl6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)']",IM,"['Adipocytes, Beige/*cytology/metabolism', '*Adipogenesis', 'Animals', '*Cold Temperature', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thermogenesis', 'Weaning']",PMC7104269,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL6', '*development', '*metabolism', '*sympathetic nervous system', '*thermogenesis']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['1920419117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1920419117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Mar 24;117(12):6883-6889. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1920419117.

In addition to blocking B-cell receptor signaling and chemokine receptor-mediated pathways in CLL cells, that are known drivers of disease, ibrutinib also affects the microenvironment in CLL via targeting BTK in myeloid cells and IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) in T-cells. These non-BTK effects were suggested to contribute to the success of ibrutinib in CLL. By using the Emicro-TCL1 adoptive transfer mouse model of CLL, we observed that ibrutinib effectively controls leukemia development, but also results in significantly lower numbers of CD8+ effector T-cells, with lower expression of activation markers, as well as impaired proliferation and effector function. Using CD8+ T-cells from a T-cell receptor (TCR) reporter mouse, we verified that this is due to a direct effect of ibrutinib on TCR activity, and demonstrate that co-stimulation via CD28 overcomes these effects. Most interestingly, combination of ibrutinib with blocking antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 axis in vivo improved CD8+ T-cell effector function and control of CLL. In sum, these data emphasize the strong immunomodulatory effects of ibrutinib and the therapeutic potential of its combination with immune checkpoint blockade in CLL.","['Hanna, Bola S', 'Yazdanparast, Haniyeh', 'Demerdash, Yasmin', 'Roessner, Philipp M', 'Schulz, Ralph', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Seiffert, Martina']","['Hanna BS', 'Yazdanparast H', 'Demerdash Y', 'Roessner PM', 'Schulz R', 'Lichter P', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Seiffert M']","['Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210401,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC8017821,,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.238154 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.238154 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Apr 1;106(4):968-977. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.238154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pTCR/TCR signaling pathways play a critical role in cell fate decisions during physiological thymocyte development, with an interplay between TCR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling determining the T-lymphocyte selection process. We performed an shRNA screen in vitro and in vivo in T-ALL cell lines and patient derived xenograft (PDX) samples to identify vulnerabilities in the pTCR/TCR pathway and identified a critical role for the kinase LCK in cell proliferation. LCK knockdown or inhibition with dasatinib (DAS) caused cell cycle arrest. Combination of DAS with dexamethasone (DEX) resulted in significant drug synergy leading to cell death. The efficacy of this drug combination was underscored in a randomized phase II-like murine trial, recapitulating an early phase human clinical trial. T-ALL expansion in immunocompromised mice was significantly impaired using this drug combination, relative to mice receiving control vehicle or single drug treatment, highlighting the immediate clinical relevance of this drug combination for high risk T-ALL patients. Our results thus provide a strategy to improve the efficacy of current chemotherapy platforms and circumvent GC resistance.","['Shi, Yuzhe', 'Beckett, Melanie C', 'Blair, Helen J', 'Tirtakusuma, Ricky', 'Nakjang, Sirintra', 'Enshaei, Amir', 'Halsey, Christina', 'Vormoor, Josef', 'Heidenreich, Olaf', 'Krippner-Heidenreich, Anja', 'van Delft, Frederik W']","['Shi Y', 'Beckett MC', 'Blair HJ', 'Tirtakusuma R', 'Nakjang S', 'Enshaei A', 'Halsey C', 'Vormoor J', 'Heidenreich O', 'Krippner-Heidenreich A', 'van Delft FW']","['Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Prinses Maxima Centrum voor Kinderoncologie, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Prinses Maxima Centrum voor Kinderoncologie, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Prinses Maxima Centrum voor Kinderoncologie, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",,['eng'],['ETM/374/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210401,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC8018112,,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.241026 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.241026 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Apr 1;106(4):1056-1066. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.241026.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: To validate the use of somatic mutations to determine AML ontogeny in the elderly population, we identified 178 elderly (> 70 years) patients with AML with NexGen Sequencing data. Patients were divided clinically into primary AML (pAML) or sAML based on prior history of AHD. Patients were then reclassified into 4 groups based on somatic mutations and cytogenetics as suggested by Lindsley et al: group 1 (pAML) with CBF rearrangements, 11q23/MLL, and NPM1 mutation (MT); group 2 (sAML) with SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, ZRSR2, ASXL1, EZH2, BCOR, or STAG2 MT; group 3 with TP53 MT; and group 4 as not otherwise specified (NOS). RESULTS: Based on clinical criteria, 95 patients were classified as pAML and 82 patients as sAML. Based on the AML ontogeny proposed, 8 patients were classified as pAML, 72 patients as sAML, 28 patients had TP53 MT, and 70 patients were classified as NOS. The median overall survival was 22.4,14, 2.8, and 11.2 months, respectively. Clinical versus molecular classification was discordant where 25% (n = 2) of patients classified as pAML by molecular signature had a history of AHD, whereas 44% (n = 32) of patients classified molecularly as sAML had no prior AHD. In the TP53 MT and NOS categories, 37% (n = 28) and 43% (n = 70) of patients had AHD, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that molecular annotation of elderly patients with AML reclassifies a significant proportion of patients as sAML, which may have therapeutic implications.","['Melody, Megan', 'Kuykendall, Andrew', 'Sallman, David', 'Al Ali, Najla', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Talati, Chetasi', 'Padron, Eric', 'Sweet, Kendra', 'Extermann, Martine', 'List, Alan', 'Lancet, Jeffrey', 'Komrokji, Rami']","['Melody M', 'Kuykendall A', 'Sallman D', 'Al Ali N', 'Zhang L', 'Talati C', 'Padron E', 'Sweet K', 'Extermann M', 'List A', 'Lancet J', 'Komrokji R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

It is associated with leukemia, HIV transcription, and head neck cancer. However, its role in odontogenic differentiation of dental pulp cells (DPCs) is unclear. Here, we show the expression of AFF4 is increased during odontogenesis. Depletion of AFF4 in human DPCs leads to a decrease of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium mineralization and odontogenic-related genes expression. On the contrary, Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of AFF4 induces the odontogenic potential of DPCs. Mechanistically, we found AFF4 regulates the transcription of NFIC, a key factor for tooth root formation. Overexpression of NFIC successfully rescues the restricted differentiation of AFF4-depleted cells. Our data demonstrate that AFF4 serves as a previously unknown regulator of odontogenesis.","['Zhang, Yuning', 'Xiao, Qingyue', 'Wu, Zuping', 'Xu, Ruoshi', 'Zou, Shujuan', 'Zhou, Chenchen']","['Zhang Y', 'Xiao Q', 'Wu Z', 'Xu R', 'Zou S', 'Zhou C']","['State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Centre for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Centre for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Centre for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Centre for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Centre for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China; Department of Orthodontics, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Centre for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China; Department of Pediatric Dentistry, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.

In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of agar/polyvinyl alcohol nanofiber (PVA) scaffold on the proliferation efficiency and differentiation potential of neonate mouse spermatogonial stem cells (SCCs). Testicular cells were isolated from testes of 40 mouse pups and were seeded in: 1) 2D cell culture plates in the absence (2D/-GF) or presence (2D/+GF) of growth factors and 2) onto agar/PVA scaffold in the absence (3D/-GF) or presence (3D/+GF) of growth factors. The cells were subsequently cultured for 4 weeks. First 2 weeks were dedicated to proliferative phase, whereas the next 2 weeks emphasized the differentiation phase. The identity of the SCCs was investigated at different time-points by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses against the germ cell markers, including PLZF, Id-4, Gfralpha-1, Tekt-1, and Sycp-3. After 2 weeks of culture, the 3D/+GF group showed the highest percentage of PLZF-positive cells among culture systems (P < 0.05). The expression levels of pre-meiotic markers (Id-4 and Gfralpha-1) decreased significantly in all groups, particularly in 3D/+GF group after 28 days of culture. Additionally, the cells in the 3D/+GF group displayed the highest expression of meiotic (Sycp-3) and post-meiotic markers (Tekt-1) 14 days after differentiation induction. Seemingly, the combination of the agar/PVA scaffold and growth factor-supplemented medium synergistically increased the differentiation rate of mouse SSCs into meiotic and post-meiotic cells. Thus, agar/PVA nanofiber scaffolds may have the potential for applications in the restoration of infertility, especially in azoospermic males.

A key side effect of busulfan is the alteration of male reproductive function. Infertility caused by anti-cancer treatments has become a significant concern, but there are currently limited treatments for this condition. Recently, we demonstrated that Gosha-jinki-gan, a traditional Japanese medicine, completely reversed the spermatogenesis defects caused by cancer treatment in mice. Hochu-ekki-to and Hachimi-jio-gan are commonly used to treat male infertility, and Hachimi-jio-gan shares herbal ingredients with Gosha-jinki-gan. Therefore, in the present study, we administered Hachimi-jio-gan and Hochu-ekki-to alone or in combination to mice with severe aspermatogenesis caused by busulfan treatment. We performed testis weight measurements, quantitative histological assessments of the testes and the epididymis, and evaluated sperm counts and morphology.

The full cohort of Ikaros target genes have yet to be identified. Here, we demonstrate that Ikaros directly regulates expression of the small GTPase, Rab20. Using ChIP-seq and qChIP we assessed Ikaros binding and the epigenetic signature at the RAB20 promoter. Expression of Ikaros, CK2, and RAB20 was determined by qRT-PCR. Overexpression of Ikaros was achieved by retroviral transduction, whereas shRNA was used to knockdown Ikaros and CK2. Regulation of transcription from the RAB20 promoter was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that Ikaros binds the RAB20 promoter in B-ALL. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that Ikaros represses RAB20 transcription via chromatin remodeling. Phosphorylation by CK2 kinase reduces Ikaros' affinity toward the RAB20 promoter and abolishes its ability to repress RAB20 transcription. Dephosphorylation by PP1 phosphatase enhances both Ikaros' DNA-binding affinity toward the RAB20 promoter and RAB20 repression. In conclusion, the results demonstrated opposing effects of CK2 and PP1 on expression of Rab20 via control of Ikaros' activity as a transcriptional regulator. A novel regulatory signaling network in B-cell leukemia that involves CK2, PP1, Ikaros, and Rab20 is identified.","['Payne, Jonathon L', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Ding, Yali', 'Dhanyamraju, Pavan Kumar', 'Bamme, Yevgeniya', 'Schramm, Joseph W', 'Desai, Dhimant', 'Sharma, Arati', 'Gowda, Chandrika', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Payne JL', 'Song C', 'Ding Y', 'Dhanyamraju PK', 'Bamme Y', 'Schramm JW', 'Desai D', 'Sharma A', 'Gowda C', 'Dovat S']","['School of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350, USA.', 'College of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'College of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'College of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'College of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'College of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'College of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'College of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'College of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'College of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7891-2921', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4081-2543', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9336-9402', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0777-0908']",['eng'],"['Endowed Chair/Four Diamonds Fund', 'CA209829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA221109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA213912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA213912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Scholar Hope Grant/Hyundai Hope On Wheels', 'CA221109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA209829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', ""Scholar Grant/St. Baldrick's Foundation""]",['Journal Article'],20200303,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.6.1- (Rab20 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7084408,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'CK2', 'Ikaros', 'PP1', 'RAB20']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21051718 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21051718 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Mar 3;21(5). pii: ijms21051718. doi: 10.3390/ijms21051718.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While this strategy is initially successful, drug resistance can become a problem. Therefore, new targets need to be identified to ensure the disease can be appropriately managed. The thioredoxin (Trx) system, comprised of Trx, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and NADPH, is an antioxidant system previously identified as a target for therapies aimed at overcoming drug resistance in other cancers. We assessed the effectiveness of TrxR inhibitors on drug resistant CML cells and examined links between TrxR and the bcr-abl cell-signalling pathway. Two TrxR inhibitors, auranofin and [Au(d2pype)2]Cl, increased intracellular ROS levels and elicited apoptosis in both sensitive and imatinib resistant CML cells. Inhibition of TrxR activity by these pharmacological inhibitors, or by specific siRNA, also resulted in decreased bcr-abl mRNA and protein levels, and lower bcr-abl downstream signalling activity, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of TrxR inhibitors as CML therapies. In addition, imatinib resistant CML cell lines showed upregulated expression of the Trx system. Furthermore, analysis of datasets showed that CML patients who did not respond to imatinib had higher Trx mRNA levels than patients who responded to treatment. Our study demonstrates a link between the Trx system and the bcr-abl protein and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the Trx system to improve CML patients' outcomes.","['Clapper, Erin', 'Wang, Sicong', 'Raninga, Prahlad V', 'Di Trapani, Giovanna', 'Tonissen, Kathryn F']","['Clapper E', 'Wang S', 'Raninga PV', 'Di Trapani G', 'Tonissen KF']","['School of Environment and Science, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, QLD 4111, Australia.', 'Griffith Institute for Drug Discovery, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, QLD 4111, Australia.', 'School of Environment and Science, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, QLD 4111, Australia.', 'Griffith Institute for Drug Discovery, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, QLD 4111, Australia.', 'Signal Transduction Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Herston, Brisbane, QLD 4006, Australia.', 'School of Environment and Science, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, QLD 4111, Australia.', 'School of Environment and Science, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, QLD 4111, Australia.', 'Griffith Institute for Drug Discovery, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane, QLD 4111, Australia.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200303,Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,,,,PMC7139888,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'ROS', 'apoptosis', 'bcr-abl', 'drug resistance', 'imatinib', 'thioredoxin']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:01,['2020/03/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:01 [medline]']","['antiox9030207 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox9030207 [doi]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2020 Mar 3;9(3). pii: antiox9030207. doi: 10.3390/antiox9030207.,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Bone marrow or peripheral blood cells of CLL patients were cultured with DSP30 plus IL-2 for 72 h, following which R-banding analysis was conducted. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in 85 patients. CA results were compared with data obtained by FISH. Results: Among 89 CLL patients, the success rate of chromosome analysis was 94.38% (84/89) . Clonal aberrations were detected in 51 patients (51/84, 60.71%) . Of them, 27 (27/51, 52.94%) were complex karyotype. Among 85 CLL patients tested by FISH, chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 74 (74/85, 87.06%) patients, of which 2 (2/74) patients were complex karyotypes, accounting for 2.70%. Of the 85 CLL patients examined by FISH, 50 had abnormal karyotype analysis, 30 had normal karyotype, 5 failed to have chromosome analysis. Among them, 25 cases showed clonal aberrations by FISH assay but normal by CA, and 4 cases were normal by FISH but displayed aberrations in chromosome analysis, and totally 78 (91.76%) cases with abnormality detected by the combination of the two methods. The frequency of 13q- abnormality detected by FISH was significantly higher than that by CA analysis (69.41%vs 16.67%, P<0.001) , while the frequency of 11q-,+12 and 17p- detected by two methods showed no significant difference (P>0.05) . The detection rate of complex abnormalities in conventional karyotype analysis was higher than that in FISH (50.98%vs 2.70%) . In addition, 11 low-risk and 9 intermediate-risk patients according to FISH results showed complex karyotype by cytogenetics, and were classified into high-risk cytogenetic subgroup. Conclusion: DSP30 and IL-2 are effective in improving the detection rate of CA in CLL patients (60.71%) and CA is more effective to detect complex karyotype.

Methods: The clinical data of 298 newly diagnosed non-M(3) AML patients between January 2010 and December 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical characteristics and prognosis of CD7(+) and CD7(-) patients were respectively compared in all patients, and in patients with WT and MT CEBPA. The relationship between CD7 expression and CEBPA mutation was determined by chi-square, and the effects of CEBPA mutation on survival and prognosis in CD7(+) group by Kaplan-Meier method. Results: In CD7(+) group, the frequencies of CEBPA mutation were 10.1% (single site) and 33.9% (double site) , significantly higher than those of the CD7(-) group (5.3% and 4.2%) (P=0.000) . Subgroup prognostic analysis showed a lower CR rate (P=0.001) and a higher RR (P=0.023) in CD7(+) group comparing to those of CD7(-) group in AML patients with wild type CEBPA. There were no statistical difference between CD7(+) group and CD7(-) group in overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (P>0.05) , while in the CEBPA mutant group the CD7(+) group has higher OS (P=0.019) and DFS (P=0.010) . Based on the CD7 expression and CEBPA mutation, 298 cases were divided into 3 subgroups, named as CD7(+)-CEBPA MT group, CD7(-) and CD7(+)-CEBPA WT group. The 3-year OS of the 3 groups were 80.2%, 48.0% and 30.6%, respectively (P<0.001) , and the 3-year DFS were 74.1%, 37.4% and 22.2%, respectively (P<0.001) . Conclusion: The CEBPA mutation rate was higher in CD7(+) AML patients then that of CD7(-) patients. CD7 expression has opposite prognostic significance in AML patients carrying the wild-type or mutant-type CEBPA. Based on CD7 expression and CEBPA mutation, a new risk stratification model can be established, which is helpful to guide the clinical individualized treatment for AML patients.","['Zhu, M Y', 'Zhu, Y', 'Chen, R R', 'Zhu, L X', 'Zhu, J J', 'Li, X Y', 'Zhou, D', 'Yang, X D', 'Zheng, Y L', 'Xie, M X', 'Sun, J N', 'Huang, X B', 'Li, L', 'Xie, W Z', 'Ye, X J']","['Zhu MY', 'Zhu Y', 'Chen RR', 'Zhu LX', 'Zhu JJ', 'Li XY', 'Zhou D', 'Yang XD', 'Zheng YL', 'Xie MX', 'Sun JN', 'Huang XB', 'Li L', 'Xie WZ', 'Ye XJ']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jinhua Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinhua 321017, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",,['chi'],['2017KY059/Zhejiang Medical and Health Science Research Foundation'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7357943,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD7 antigen', 'Gene, CEBPA', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Prognosis']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.02.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 14;41(2):100-105. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.02.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: A total of 226 patients receiving nilotinib or dastinib as second-line (n=183) and third-line (n=43) therapy were included in this study. With a median follow-up of 21 (range, 1-135) months, the cumulative rates of complete hematological response (CHR) , complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) were 80.4%, 56.3%and 38.3%, respectively in those receiving TKI as second-line TKI therapy.

It is characterised by a build-up of immature myeloid cells anchored in the protective niche of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is central to the pathogenesis of AML as it has fundamental control over AML cell adhesion into the protective BM niche, adaptation to the hypoxic environment, cellular migration and survival. High levels of CXCR4 expression are associated with poor relapse-free and overall survival. The CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12 (SDF-1), is expressed by multiple cells types in the BM, facilitating the adhesion and survival of the malignant clone. Blocking the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is an attractive therapeutic strategy providing a 'multi-hit' therapy that both prevents essential survival signals and releases the AML cells from the BM into the circulation. Once out of the protective niche of the BM they would be more susceptible to destruction by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. In this review, we disentangle the diverse roles of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in AML. We then describe multiple CXCR4 inhibitors, including small molecules, peptides, or monoclonal antibodies, which have been developed to date and their progress in pre-clinical and clinical trials. Finally, the review leads us to the conclusion that there is a need for further investigation into the development of a 'multi-hit' therapy that targets several signalling pathways related to AML cell adhesion and maintenance in the BM.","['Ladikou, Eleni E', 'Chevassut, Timothy', 'Pepper, Chris J', 'Pepper, Andrea Gs']","['Ladikou EE', 'Chevassut T', 'Pepper CJ', 'Pepper AG']","['Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3021-3851', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8672-1906', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3603-8839', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9795-1280']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200305,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (4-fluorobenzoyl-TN-14003)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (LY2510924)', '0 (N-(1,4,8,11-', 'tetraazacyclotetradecanyl-1,4-phenylenebis(methylene))-2-(aminomethyl)- pyridine)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '7KNP87L4X4 (ulocuplumab)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzylamines', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*physiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclams', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/physiology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptides/therapeutic use', 'Peptides, Cyclic/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CXCL12/CXCR4', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*cell adhesion']",2020/03/07 06:00,2021/01/28 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16456 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jun;189(5):815-825. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16456.

Polymorphisms in folate genes have been associated with a protective effect against ALL, although some studies contradict these findings. We aimed to test whether there is an association between the MTHFR rs1801133 variant and the occurrence of B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) taking in account molecularly distinct subtypes of fetal origin. METHODS: We performed a case-control genotyping study with 2067 samples, 1309 ALL and 758 controls, from children aged </= 15 years for MTHFR rs1801133 polymorphism. Risk associations were calculated by odds ratios estimated with unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for frequency-matched ethnic groups. RESULTS: Overall, MTHFR rs1801133 does not impact ALL risk in children with more than 6 years of age. A significant positive association for MTHFR rs1801133 variant was found for ALL with KMT2A-r in the dominant model (adj. OR, 1.48, 95 % CI, 1.01-2.17), while ETV6-RUNX1 and Hyperdiploid subgroups have shown a borderline effect (adj. OR, 1.33, 95 % CI, 0.99-1.78).

For this purpose, covalent modification of MNPs with 3-aminopropylsilane and N-di-Fmoc-L-lysine followed by removal of N-protecting groups was carried out. Since the degree of hydroxylation of the surface of the starting nanoparticles plays a crucial role in the silanization reaction and the possibility of obtaining stable colloidal solutions. In present work we for the first time performed a comparative qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the number of adsorbed water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the surface of chemically and physically obtained Fe3O4 MNPs using comprehensive FTIR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The results obtained can be further used for magnetic labeling of cells in experiments in vitro and in vivo.","['Demin, Alexander M', 'Mekhaev, Alexander V', 'Kandarakov, Oleg F', 'Popenko, Vladimir I', 'Leonova, Olga G', 'Murzakaev, Aidar M', 'Kuznetsov, Dmitry K', 'Uimin, Mikhail A', 'Minin, Artem S', 'Shur, Vladimir Ya', 'Belyavsky, Alexander V', 'Krasnov, Victor P']","['Demin AM', 'Mekhaev AV', 'Kandarakov OF', 'Popenko VI', 'Leonova OG', 'Murzakaev AM', 'Kuznetsov DK', 'Uimin MA', 'Minin AS', 'Shur VY', 'Belyavsky AV', 'Krasnov VP']","['Postovsky Institute of Organic Synthesis, Russian Academy of Sciences (Ural Branch), 22 S.

METHODS: This descriptive, retrospective medical chart review collected patient-level data in 2018 from adults with >/=1 minimal residual disease (MRD) test during front-line ALL treatment. Data were stratified by MRD status. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were included (median age 44 years, 23 % Philadelphia chromosome-positive; MRD-positive: n = 17, MRD-negative: n = 50, MRD result unknown: n = 15). HyperCVAD (32 %) and HOVON (26 %) were the most frequently used front-line treatment protocols; 22 % of patients received stem cell transplantation. Overall, 76 % of ALL patients were hospitalized (mean 1.1 hospitalization/month). Complete hematological response (CRh) occurred in 66/82 patients (80 %). Median relapse-free survival from CRh was 32.7 months (MRD-positive: 11.7 months; MRD-negative: 33.3 months). Median overall survival from diagnosis was 28.9 months (MRD-positive: 15.3 months; MRD-negative: not reached). Most patients (88 %) were MRD tested during induction; testing rates considerably decreased thereafter (39 % during consolidation). CONCLUSIONS: B-cell precursor ALL represents a clinical burden and impacts healthcare resources; MRD-positive patients have worse prognosis than MRD-negative patients. Efforts should be made to adhere to recommendations for MRD testing in clinical guidelines.","['Deeren, Dries', 'Balabanov, Stefan', 'Nickel, Katharina', 'Giannopoulou, Christina', 'Gonzalez-McQuire, Sebastian', 'Kutikova, Lucie', 'Bouwmeester, Walter', 'Spyridonidis, Alexandros']","['Deeren D', 'Balabanov S', 'Nickel K', 'Giannopoulou C', 'Gonzalez-McQuire S', 'Kutikova L', 'Bouwmeester W', 'Spyridonidis A']","['AZ Delta, Wilgenstraat 2, B-8800, Roeselare, Belgium.

She subsequently relapsed and tumor molecular profiling was repeated, revealing 2 new potentially targetable mutations (FLT3 and IDH2).

Of 535 pediatric ALL patients (January 2004 to December 2016 from the Yeungnam region of Korea), 72 (13.5%) patients with an initial white blood cell (WBC) count of >/=100x10/L were included in this study, of whom 38 patients had extreme hyperleukocytosis (WBC>200x10/L) at diagnosis. Fourteen patients (19.4%) had >/=1 early respiratory and neurologic complications during induction therapy. Relapse occurred in 8 patients (24.2%) with extreme hyperleukocytosis and in 1 patient (3.0%) with an initial WBC count of 100 to 200x10/L (P=0.012). Estimated 10-year event-free survival rate (EFS) and overall survival rate were 78.3%+/-8.4% and 82.6%+/-7.7%, respectively. The 10-year EFS was significantly lower in patients with an initial WBC count of >200x10/L than in those with an initial WBC count of 100 to 200x10/L (65.7%+/-13.4% vs. 91.2%+/-7.9%; P=0.011). The 10-year EFS and overall survival rate did not differ significantly between patients with extreme hyperleukocytosis who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and those who received chemotherapy. In conclusion, pediatric ALL with hyperleukocytosis can lead to early complications and mortality.

Some of these antibodies show a correlation between the tissue expression of PD-L1 and response. Evaluation of PD-L1 expression presents multiple challenges, but some preanalytical issues such as tissue fixation have been scarcely evaluated. With the hypothesis that immunohistochemical staining of PD-L1 may be impacted by the time of specimen fixation, we evaluated differences in its expression in tonsil samples exposed to predefined fixation times. Random nontumoral tonsillectomy specimens were blindly evaluated in tissue microarray slides after staining with SP142 and SP263 antibodies. With fixation times ranging from 12 to 72 hours, between 2.8% and 6.1% of the samples were considered to be suboptimally stained, with no differences between the 2 antibodies within these fixation times. A significantly higher proportion of samples exposed to a fixation time of 96 hours presented suboptimal immunostaining (15.6%, P<0.0001). In addition, suboptimally stained spots were 20.8% using SP142 and 10.4% using SP263 after 96 hours of fixation (P=0.046). In conclusion, the quality of staining for PD-L1 in tonsil samples decreased with overfixation of the specimen at times >72 hours. Samples exposed to formaldehyde for longer periods presented suboptimal results for both clones, but the SP142 antibody presented a significantly lower tolerance to formalin overexposure than SP263. These results indicate the relevance of a controlled preanalytical processing of samples and particularly the length of fixation of tumor specimens.","['Barbera, Angels', 'Marginet Flinch, Ruth', 'Martin, Montserrat', 'Mate, Jose L', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Martinez-Soler, Fina', 'Santalucia, Tomas', 'Fernandez, Pedro L']","['Barbera A', 'Marginet Flinch R', 'Martin M', 'Mate JL', 'Oriol A', 'Martinez-Soler F', 'Santalucia T', 'Fernandez PL']","['Fundamental Care and Medical-Surgical Nursing Department, School of Nursing, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Barcelona University.', 'Pathology Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital and Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.', 'Pathology Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital and Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.', 'Pathology Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital and Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.', 'Pathology Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital and Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Fundamental Care and Medical-Surgical Nursing Department, School of Nursing, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Barcelona University.', 'Fundamental Care and Medical-Surgical Nursing Department, School of Nursing, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Barcelona University.', 'Pathology Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital and Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*chemistry', 'B7-H1 Antigen/*biosynthesis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Palatine Tonsil/*metabolism/pathology', '*Tissue Fixation']",,,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000847 [doi]', '00129039-202101000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2021 Jan;29(1):76-81. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000847.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is difficult to determine whether this is due to resistance or intolerance to the drug; thus, we have used the more inclusive term of ruxolitinib failure. The survival of patients with myelofibrosis after ruxolitinib failure is poor but varies significantly by the pattern of the failure, underlining the need for a clinically appropriate classification. In this review, we propose diagnostic guidance for early recognition of the pattern of ruxolitinib failure and we recommend treatment options. The most frequent patterns of ruxolitinib failure are loss or failure to obtain a significant reduction in splenomegaly or symptom response, and the development or persistence of clinically significant cytopenias. Ruxolitinib dose modification and other ancillary therapies are sometimes helpful, and splenectomy is a palliative option in selected cases. Stem-cell transplantation is the only curative option for these patterns of failure, but its restricted applicability due to toxicity highlights the importance of ongoing clinical trials in this area. Recent approval of fedratinib by the US Food and Drug Administration provides an alternative option for patients with suboptimal or loss of spleen response. The transformation of myelofibrosis to accelerated or blast phase is an infrequent form of failure with an extremely poor prognosis, whereby patients who are ineligible for transplantation have limited treatment options.","['Gupta, Vikas', 'Cerquozzi, Sonia', 'Foltz, Lynda', 'Hillis, Christopher', 'Devlin, Rebecca', 'Elsawy, Mahmoud', 'Grewal, Kuljit', 'Hamm, Caroline', 'McNamara, Caroline', 'Sirhan, Shireen', 'Leber, Brian']","['Gupta V', 'Cerquozzi S', 'Foltz L', 'Hillis C', 'Devlin R', 'Elsawy M', 'Grewal K', 'Hamm C', 'McNamara C', 'Sirhan S', 'Leber B']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Tom Baker Cancer Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', ""St Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Juravinski Cancer Centre, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', ""Memorial University of Newfoundland, St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada."", 'Windsor Regional Cancer Program, Windsor, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Juravinski Cancer Centre, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200305,United States,JCO Oncol Pract,JCO oncology practice,101758685,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Canada', 'Humans', 'Nitriles', '*Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines', 'United States']",PMC7359776,,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JOP.19.00506 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Oncol Pract. 2020 Jul;16(7):351-359. doi: 10.1200/JOP.19.00506.

Here, we reported that human FLT3/ITD expression led to axis duplication and dorsalization in about 50% of zebrafish embryos. The morphologic phenotype was accompanied by ectopic expression of a morphogen follistatin (fst) during early embryonic development. Increase in fst expression also occurred in adult FLT3/ITD-transgenic zebrafish, Flt3/ITD knock-in mice, and human FLT3/ITD AML cells. Overexpression of human FST317 and FST344 isoforms enhanced clonogenicity and leukemia engraftment in xenotransplantation model via RET, IL2RA, and CCL5 upregulation. Specific targeting of FST by shRNA, CRISPR/Cas9, or antisense oligo inhibited leukemic growth in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, serum FST positively correlated with leukemia engraftment in FLT3/ITD AML patient-derived xenograft mice and leukemia blast percentage in primary AML patients. In FLT3/ITD AML patients treated with FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib, serum FST levels correlated with clinical response. These observations supported FST as a novel therapeutic target and biomarker in FLT3/ITD AML.","['He, Bai-Liang', 'Yang, Ning', 'Man, Cheuk Him', 'Ng, Nelson Ka-Lam', 'Cher, Chae-Yin', 'Leung, Ho-Ching', 'Kan, Leo Lai-Hok', 'Cheng, Bowie Yik-Ling', 'Lam, Stephen Sze-Yuen', 'Wang, Michelle Lu-Lu', 'Zhang, Chun-Xiao', 'Kwok, Hin', 'Cheng, Grace', 'Sharma, Rakesh', 'Ma, Alvin Chun-Hang', 'So, Chi Wai Eric', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam', 'Leung, Anskar Yu-Hung']","['He BL', 'Yang N', 'Man CH', 'Ng NK', 'Cher CY', 'Leung HC', 'Kan LL', 'Cheng BY', 'Lam SS', 'Wang ML', 'Zhang CX', 'Kwok H', 'Cheng G', 'Sharma R', 'Ma AC', 'So CW', 'Kwong YL', 'Leung AY']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Centre for Genomic Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Centre for Genomic Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Centre for Genomic Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.', ""Leukemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Division of Cancer Studies, Department of Hematological Medicine, King's College London, London, UK."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4117-0036', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9975-8687']",['eng'],"['G0800892/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Li Shu Fan Medical Foundation (LSFMF)/International', 'Croucher Foundation/International', 'GRF: 17126117/University Grants Committee (UGC)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200305,England,EMBO Mol Med,EMBO molecular medicine,101487380,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Follistatin)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', '*Follistatin/blood', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Zebrafish/embryology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC7136967,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*follistatin', '*internal tandem duplication of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3']",2020/03/07 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.15252/emmm.201910895 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO Mol Med. 2020 Apr 7;12(4):e10895. doi: 10.15252/emmm.201910895.

How TGFbeta supports the bioenergetic cost of matrix protein synthesis is not fully understood. Here, we show that TGFbeta promotes protein translation at least in part by increasing the mitochondrial oxidation of glucose and glutamine carbons to support the bioenergetic demand of translation. Surprisingly, we found that in addition to stimulating the entry of glucose and glutamine carbon into the TCA cycle, TGFbeta induced the biosynthesis of proline from glutamine in a Smad4-dependent fashion. Metabolic manipulations that increased mitochondrial redox generation promoted proline biosynthesis, while reducing mitochondrial redox potential and/or ATP synthesis impaired proline biosynthesis. Thus, proline biosynthesis acts as a redox vent, preventing the TGFbeta-induced increase in mitochondrial glucose and glutamine catabolism from generating damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) when TCA cycle activity exceeds the ability of oxidative phosphorylation to convert mitochondrial redox potential into ATP. In turn, the enhanced synthesis of proline supports TGFbeta-induced production of matrix proteins.","['Schworer, Simon', 'Berisa, Mirela', 'Violante, Sara', 'Qin, Weige', 'Zhu, Jiajun', 'Hendrickson, Ronald C', 'Cross, Justin R', 'Thompson, Craig B']","['Schworer S', 'Berisa M', 'Violante S', 'Qin W', 'Zhu J', 'Hendrickson RC', 'Cross JR', 'Thompson CB']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Donald B. and Catherine C.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to develop the classification model from reduced features and instances. METHODS: In this paper we proposed four search algorithms for feature selection the first algorithm is Random Global Optimal (RGO) search algorithm for searching the continuous, global optimal subset of features from the random population. The second is Global and Local Optimal (GLO) search algorithm for searching the global and local optimal subset of features from population. The third one is Random Local Optimal (RLO) search algorithm for generating random, local optimal subset of features from the random population. Finally the Random Global and Optimal (RGLO) search algorithm for searching the continuous, global and local optimal subset of features from the random population. RGLO search algorithm combines the properties of first three stated algorithm. The subsets of features generated from the proposed four search algorithms are evaluated using the consistency based subset evaluation measure. Instance based learning algorithm is applied to the resulting feature dataset to reduce the instances that are redundant or irrelevant for classification. The model developed using naive Bayesian classifier from the reduced features and instances is validated with the tenfold cross validation. RESULTS: Classification accuracy based on RGLO search algorithm using naive Bayesian classifier is 94.82% for Breast, 97.4% for DLBCL, 98.83% for SRBCT and 98.89% for Leukemia datasets. CONCLUSION: The RGLO search based reduced features results in the high prediction rate with less computational time when compared with the complete dataset and other proposed subset generation algorithm.","['Meenachi, Loganathan', 'Ramakrishnan, Srinivasan']","['Meenachi L', 'Ramakrishnan S']","['Department of Information Technology, Dr. Mahalingam College of Engineering and Technology, Pollachi, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Department of Information Technology, Dr. Mahalingam College of Engineering and Technology, Pollachi, Tamilnadu, India.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Imaging,Current medical imaging,101762461,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Data Mining/*methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Support Vector Machine']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Particle swarm optimization', '*cancer classification', '*differential evolution', '*instance based learning', '*naive bayesian classifier', '*tabu search.']",2020/03/07 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2018/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CMIR-EPUB-91861 [pii]', '10.2174/1573405614666180720152838 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Imaging. 2020;16(3):249-261. doi: 10.2174/1573405614666180720152838.,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we tested whether aGvHD therapy could be improved by delivering GCs with the help of inorganic-organic hybrid nanoparticles (IOH-NPs) that preferentially target myeloid cells. IOH-NPs containing the GC betamethasone (BMP-NPs) efficiently reduced morbidity, mortality, and tissue damage in a totally MHC mismatched mouse model of aGvHD. Therapeutic activity was lost in mice lacking the GC receptor (GR) in myeloid cells, confirming the cell type specificity of our approach. BMP-NPs had no relevant systemic activity but suppressed cytokine and chemokine gene expression locally in the small intestine, which presumably explains their mode of action. Most importantly, BMP-NPs delayed the development of an adoptively transferred B cell lymphoma better than the free drug, although the overall incidence was unaffected. Our findings thus suggest that employing IOH-NPs could diminish the risk of relapse associated with GC therapy of aGvHD patients while still allowing to efficiently ameliorate the disease.","['Kaiser, Tina K', 'Li, Hu', 'Rossmann, Laura', 'Reichardt, Sybille D', 'Bohnenberger, Hanibal', 'Feldmann, Claus', 'Reichardt, Holger M']","['Kaiser TK', 'Li H', 'Rossmann L', 'Reichardt SD', 'Bohnenberger H', 'Feldmann C', 'Reichardt HM']","['Institute for Cellular and Molecular Immunology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Immunology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Immunology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Immunology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Immunology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4647-057X'],['eng'],['1631/17-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200320,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Cytokines)', '7BK02SCL3W (betamethasone sodium phosphate)', '9842X06Q6M (Betamethasone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Betamethasone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Intestine, Small/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*glucocorticoids', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukemia effect', '*macrophages', '*nanoparticles']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/12/16 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.201948464 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2020 Aug;50(8):1220-1233. doi: 10.1002/eji.201948464.

The dictum that HPVG warrants surgical intervention is challenged in the recent literature. This is because of the identification of various causes of HVPG other than bowel gangrene. Most of these newly identified causes can be managed conservatively. However, bowel gangrene, if missed, is fatal. Hence, sound clinical judgment and accurate diagnosis based on specific clinical parameters and imaging findings are important. We present a case of a young male with tumor lysis syndrome and neutropenic sepsis. He underwent treatment for a relapse of T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and presented with abdominal pain and distension. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed HPVG, and the differential diagnosis was neutropenic colitis or pseudomembranous colitis, with steroid use as the probable cause. The patient was managed conservatively. The case emphasizes that the evaluation for a specific cause of HPVG is important to reduce unnecessary surgery. A succinct literature review provides the reasons for the changing mortality rates.","['Mehta, Shruti', 'Desai, Gunjan S', 'Shah, Saumil', 'Mehta, Hitesh', 'Phadke, Aniruddha']","['Mehta S', 'Desai GS', 'Shah S', 'Mehta H', 'Phadke A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Surgical Gastroenterology, Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Gastroenterology, Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Surgical Gastroenterology, Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Gastroenterology, Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9307-5479'],['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200303,United States,Surg J (N Y),"Surgery journal (New York, N.Y.)",101695022,,,,PMC7054055,,['NOTNLM'],"['bowel gangrene', 'leukemia', 'necrotizing enterocolitis']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:01,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1055/s-0040-1702919 [doi]', '1900048cr [pii]']",epublish,Surg J (N Y). 2020 Mar 3;6(1):e37-e41. doi: 10.1055/s-0040-1702919. eCollection 2020 Jan.,,,,"['Conflict of Interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest in', 'this study.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have systematically elaborated on this disorder and its features related with hematologic malignancy. Objective: This study aimed to describe the clinicopathological characteristics, treatment, and outcome of Sweet syndrome and to evaluate patient characteristics associated with hematologic malignancy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with Sweet syndrome at the Department of Dermatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from October 2010 to February 2019. Results: The study included 37 patients (16 men and 21 women), with a mean age of 53 years. Ten patients (27%) were classified as having malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome: nine with a hematologic malignancy including acute myeloid leukemia (4/9, 44%), myelodysplastic syndrome (4/9, 44%), and multiple myeloma (1/9, 11%) and one with a solid tumor diagnosed with liver carcinoma. The mean hemoglobin and platelet levels (P = 0.007 and P = 0.013, respectively), were significantly lower in patients with hematologic malignancy than in those with Sweet syndrome only. No significant difference in histopathology was found between patients with and without hematologic malignancy. Systemic corticosteroids were the most frequently used treatment (24/37, 65%). Higher mortality was found in patients with hematologic malignancy. Conclusion: It is important to assess Sweet syndrome patients who have laboratory evidence of lower hemoglobin and platelet levels for a hematologic malignancy.","['Zheng, Siting', 'Li, Sheng', 'Tang, Shunli', 'Pan, Yunlei', 'Ding, Yuwei', 'Qiao, Jianjun', 'Fang, Hong']","['Zheng S', 'Li S', 'Tang S', 'Pan Y', 'Ding Y', 'Qiao J', 'Fang H']","['Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200218,Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,,,PMC7039821,,['NOTNLM'],"['Sweet syndrome', 'hematologic malignancy', 'mortality', 'outcome', 'treatment']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:01,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2020.00020 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2020 Feb 18;7:20. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2020.00020. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zheng, Li, Tang, Pan, Ding, Qiao and Fang.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adipocytes are prevalent in the BM stroma and increase in number with age. AML in elderly patients induces remodeling and lipolysis of BM adipocytes, which may promote AML cell survival through metabolic activation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). FAO reactions generate acetyl-CoA from fatty acids under aerobic conditions and, under certain conditions, it can cause uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Recent experimental evidence indicates that FAO is associated with quiescence and drug-resistance in leukemia stem cells. In this review, we highlight recent progress in our understanding of fatty acid metabolism in AML cells in the adipocyte-rich BM microenvironment, and discuss the therapeutic potential of combinatorial regimens with various FAO inhibitors, which target metabolic vulnerabilities of BM-resident, chemoresistant leukemia cells.","['Tabe, Yoko', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Tabe Y', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Section of Leukemia Biology Research, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200218,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7040225,,['NOTNLM'],"['adipocyte', 'bone marrow microenvironment', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'therapy resistance']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:01,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00155 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Feb 18;10:155. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00155. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Tabe, Konopleva and Andreeff.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is heterogeneous, including different subsets of patients distinguished by LGL immunophenotype (CD8+ Talphabeta, CD4+ Talphabeta, Tgammadelta, NK) and the clinical course of the disease (indolent/symptomatic/aggressive). Even if the etiology of LGLL remains elusive, evidence is accumulating on the genetic landscape driving and/or sustaining chronic LGL proliferations. The most common gain-of-function mutations identified in LGLL patients are on STAT3 and STAT5b genes, which have been recently recognized as clonal markers and were included in the 2017 WHO classification of the disease. A significant correlation between STAT3 mutations and symptomatic disease has been highlighted. At variance, STAT5b mutations could have a different clinical impact based on the immunophenotype of the mutated clone. In fact, they are regarded as the signature of an aggressive clinical course with a poor prognosis in CD8+ T-LGLL and aggressive NK cell leukemia, while they are devoid of negative prognostic significance in CD4+ T-LGLL and Tgammadelta LGLL. Knowing the specific distribution of STAT mutations helps identify the discrete mechanisms sustaining LGL proliferations in the corresponding disease subsets. Some patients equipped with wild type STAT genes are characterized by less frequent mutations in different genes, suggesting that other pathogenetic mechanisms are likely to be involved. In this review, we discuss how the LGLL mutational pattern allows a more precise and detailed tumor stratification, suggesting new parameters for better management of the disease and hopefully paving the way for a targeted clinical approach.","['Teramo, Antonella', 'Barila, Gregorio', 'Calabretto, Giulia', 'Vicenzetto, Cristina', 'Gasparini, Vanessa Rebecca', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Zambello, Renato']","['Teramo A', 'Barila G', 'Calabretto G', 'Vicenzetto C', 'Gasparini VR', 'Semenzato G', 'Zambello R']","['Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Medicine (DIMED), Padova University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Medicine (DIMED), Padova University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Medicine (DIMED), Padova University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Medicine (DIMED), Padova University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Medicine (DIMED), Padova University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Medicine (DIMED), Padova University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Medicine (DIMED), Padova University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padova, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200218,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7040228,,['NOTNLM'],"['STAT3', 'STAT5b', 'T-LGL leukemia (T-LGLL)', 'chronic lymphoproliferative disease of NK cells (CLPD-NK)', 'large granular lymphocyte (LGL)', 'mutation']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:01,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00152 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Feb 18;10:152. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00152. eCollection 2020.,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Teramo, Barila, Calabretto, Vicenzetto, Gasparini, Semenzato', 'and Zambello.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has two pathological subtypes: classical HCL (HCL-C) and HCL-variant (HCL-V). HCL-C and HCL-V are distinct in morphology and immunophenotype. Their differentiation is important for patient management and clinical outcome, with HCL-V responding poorly to conventional HCL treatments. Recently, whole genomic sequencing has been used to identify the difference between HCL-C and HCL-V and mutation of BRAF(V600E) has been proved to be a molecular hallmark of HCL-C. However, BRAF inhibitors were not effective in all HCL-C cases and HCL-V seems be lack of the high-frequency mutations. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the genomic changes between HCL-C and HCL-V by high-resolution studies, especially in Chinese population, the genomic alterations of HCL have rarely be reported. Methods: In this study, the clinical features of a total of 18 Chinese HCL patients were described. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis was performed to evaluate the genomic copy number alterations (CNA) and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) on six HCL-Vs with CD25(-)/BRAF(V600E-) and four HCL-Cs with CD25(+)/BRAF(V600E+). Results: A total of 24 CNAs including seven chromosomal gains and 17 chromosomal losses, and 22 CN-LOHs were revealed. Five of the six cases of HCL-V showed 15 CNAs including four cryptic chromosomal gains and 11 chromosomal losses. Overlapping regions involving micro-deletion of chromosome 2q13 and large chromosomal loss of 14q were showed in HCL-V. In HCL-C, a total of nine CNAs were revealed in three of the four cases including three chromosomal gains and six chromosomal losses. No overlapping area was observed among the CNVs. 15 CN-LOHs were showed in five of the six cases of HCL-V and seven CN-LOHs was demonstrated in all of the four HCL-Cs. Conclusions: Comparing to Westerners, a relatively higher proportion of HCL-V in all HCL is observed in this study. CNAs and CN-LOHs were common in both HCL-V and HCL-C but the CNAs were different in them. HCL-C was characterized with the higher ratio of large chromosomal changes but lacked of recurrent CNAs, while HCL-V was presented with the higher incidence of cryptic CNAs and recurrent CNAs involving tumor-associated genes. It is necessary to further investigate the association of the genes, such as NPHP1 and TRAF3 genes, and HCL-V in the future study.","['Zhang, Rui', 'Wu, Yongli', 'Wang, Xianfu', 'Lu, Xianglan', 'Li, Yan', 'Li, Shibo', 'Yan, Xiaojing']","['Zhang R', 'Wu Y', 'Wang X', 'Lu X', 'Li Y', 'Li S', 'Yan X']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110001, P.R.

The primary objective of this study was to compare cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) versus echocardiography (ECHO) to detect a reduction in left ventricular ejection function, suggestive of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. We studied eligible patients who were 18 years or older, who had breast cancer or lymphoma, and who were offered treatment with doxorubicin with curative intent dosing of 240 to 300 mg/m (2) body surface area between March 1, 2009 and October 31, 2013. Patients underwent baseline CMRI and ECHO. Both imaging studies were repeated after four cycles of treatment. Ejection fraction (EF) calculated by both methods was compared and analyzed with the inferential statistical Student's t test. Twenty-eight eligible patients were enrolled. Two patients stopped participating in the study before undergoing baseline CMRI; 26 patients underwent baseline ECHO and CMRI. Eight of those 26 patients declined posttreatment studies, so the final study population was 18 patients. There was a significant difference in EF pre- and posttreatment in the CMRI group ( p = 0.009) versus the ECHO group that showed no significant differences in EF ( p = NS). It appears that CMRI is superior to ECHO for detecting doxorubicin-induced reductions in cardiac systolic function. However, ECHO is less expensive and more convenient for patients because of its noninvasive character and bedside practicality.

Objectives: The objectives of the study were to study the predictive role of median and coefficient of variation of neutrophil scattering items in blood samples for differentiation of leukemic subjects. Methods: We evaluated six neutrophil scattering parameters: neutrophil side scatter mean intensity, neutrophil side fluorescence light (SFL) mean intensity, neutrophil forward scatter mean intensity, neutrophil side scatter area distribution width (NE-WX), neutrophil SFL area distribution width (NE-WY), and neutrophil forward scatter area distribution width (NE-WZ), measured in white blood cell differential scattergram generated by the hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN-1000) at an academic medical center. Results: We collected 433 blood samples from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) cases and normal controls. AML group showed highly significant differences in the mean values compared with the control group. Out of six neutrophil scattering items, NE-WX, NE-WY, and NE-WZ showed high efficiency, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.764, 0.748, and 0.757, respectively, to differentiate AML from ALL cases and control groups. When comparing combined acute leukemia cases (AML plus ALL) with the control group, NE-WX, NE-WY, and NE-WZ generated highly significant AUC values (0.840, 0.884, and 0.801, respectively). Conclusion: The neutrophil scattering parameters generated during CBC analysis provide a new tool for the prediction of acute leukemia and its lineage.","['Zeeshan-Haider, Rana', 'Urrechaga, Eloisa', 'Uddin-Ujjan, Ikram', 'Sultan-Shamsi, Tahir']","['Zeeshan-Haider R', 'Urrechaga E', 'Uddin-Ujjan I', 'Sultan-Shamsi T']","['National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Hospital Galdakao-Usansolo, Galdakao, Spain.', 'Basic Medical Sciences, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Science, Jamshoro, Pakistan.', 'Jamil-ur-Rahman Center for Genome Research, International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Institute, Marmara Research Center, TUBITAK, Gebze-Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Cell Count/instrumentation/*methods', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Hematology analyzer', 'Neutrophil scattering items', 'Sysmex']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['j72/1/37 [pii]', '10.24875/RIC.19003194 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2020;72(1):37-45. doi: 10.24875/RIC.19003194.,,['Copyright: (c) 2019 Permanyer.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios for 30-day mortality and achievement of composite complete remission (CRc). Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios for overall survival (OS). Among 779 patients, clinical leukostasis was reported in 27%, and leukapheresis was used in 113 patients (15%).

A lineage of the protozoan parasite genus Theileria infects bovine leukocytes and induces their uncontrolled proliferation causing a leukemia-like disease. Given the importance of E2F transcription factors in mammalian cell cycle regulation, we investigated the role of E2F signaling in Theileria-induced host cell proliferation. Using comparative genomics and surface plasmon resonance, we identified parasite-derived peptides that have the sequence-specific ability to increase E2F signaling by binding E2F negative regulator Retinoblastoma-1 (RB). Using these peptides as a tool to probe host E2F signaling, we show that the disruption of RB complexes ex vivo leads to activation of E2F-driven transcription and increased leukocyte proliferation in an infection-dependent manner. This result is consistent with existing models and, together, they support a critical role of E2F signaling for Theileria-induced host cell proliferation, and its potential direct manipulation by one or more parasite proteins.","['Tretina, Kyle', 'Haidar, Malak', 'Madsen-Bouterse, Sally A', 'Sakura, Takaya', 'Mfarrej, Sara', 'Fry, Lindsay', 'Chaussepied, Marie', 'Pain, Arnab', 'Knowles, Donald P', 'Nene, Vishvanath M', 'Ginsberg, Doron', 'Daubenberger, Claudia A', 'Bishop, Richard P', 'Langsley, Gordon', 'Silva, Joana C']","['Tretina K', 'Haidar M', 'Madsen-Bouterse SA', 'Sakura T', 'Mfarrej S', 'Fry L', 'Chaussepied M', 'Pain A', 'Knowles DP', 'Nene VM', 'Ginsberg D', 'Daubenberger CA', 'Bishop RP', 'Langsley G', 'Silva JC']","['Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.', 'Program in Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Comparative des Apicomplexes, Faculte de Medicine, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne, Paris Cite, France.', 'Inserm U1016, Cnrs UMR8104, Cochin Institute, Paris, 75014, France.', 'Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, 99164-7040, USA.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Comparative des Apicomplexes, Faculte de Medicine, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne, Paris Cite, France.', 'Inserm U1016, Cnrs UMR8104, Cochin Institute, Paris, 75014, France.', 'Pathogen Genomics Laboratory, Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering (BESE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, 23955-6900, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, 99164-7040, USA.', 'Animal Disease Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service, USDA, Pullman, WA, 99164-7030, USA.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Comparative des Apicomplexes, Faculte de Medicine, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne, Paris Cite, France.', 'Inserm U1016, Cnrs UMR8104, Cochin Institute, Paris, 75014, France.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Molecular Cell Biology Department, PO Box 26, Rehovot, 76100, Israel.', 'Pathogen Genomics Laboratory, Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering (BESE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, 23955-6900, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, 99164-7040, USA.', 'International Livestock Research Institute, Nairobi, 00100, Kenya.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Molecular Cell Biology Department, PO Box 26, Rehovot, 76100, Israel.', 'The Mina and Everard Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 52900, Israel.', 'Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland.', 'University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, 99164-7040, USA.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Comparative des Apicomplexes, Faculte de Medicine, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne, Paris Cite, France.', 'Inserm U1016, Cnrs UMR8104, Cochin Institute, Paris, 75014, France.', 'Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA. jcsilva@som.umaryland.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA. jcsilva@som.umaryland.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1740-2730', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6790-7166', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1755-2819', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6600-6286', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6502-7026']",['eng'],['T32 AI007540/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200304,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'E2F Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*cytology/*parasitology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Theileria/*physiology']",PMC7055300,,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/11/27 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-60939-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-60939-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Mar 4;10(1):3982. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-60939-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A 25-bed PICU of a tertiary hospital. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated children with leukemia who had been exposed to anthracyclines and exhibited neutropenic septic shock were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to monitor the aortic blood flow before and after fluid administration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After volume expansion, left ventricular stroke volume increased by greater than or equal to 15% in 16 patients (responders) and less than 15% in 14 patients (nonresponders). The performance of respiratory variation in velocity time integral of aortic blood flow and respiratory variation in peak velocity of aortic blood flow for predicting volume responsiveness, as determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.55-0.94; p = 0.025) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.90; p = 0.048), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory variation in velocity time integral of aortic blood flow and respiratory variation in peak velocity of aortic blood flow derived from transthoracic echocardiography showed only a fair reliability in predicting volume responsiveness in ventilated children with leukemia and neutropenic septic shock.","['Sun, Sijuan', 'Ren, Hong', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Li, Biru', 'Ning, Botao', 'Qian, Juan']","['Sun S', 'Ren H', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Li B', 'Ning B', 'Qian J']","[""All authors: Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Crit Care Med,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,100954653,,IM,"['Child', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Respiration, Artificial', '*Shock, Septic/complications/therapy', 'Stroke Volume']",,,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PCC.0000000000002260 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2020 May;21(5):e247-e252. doi: 10.1097/PCC.0000000000002260.,,,['Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2020 May;21(5):507-508.

Its structure was established based on an analysis of spectroscopic data, including 1D NMR, 2D NMR and HRESIMS, and the configurations of the chiral C atoms were determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The single-crystal structure reveals that the cyclopenta[c]pyran scaffold is formed from a five-membered ring and a chair-like six-membered ring connected through two bridgehead chiral C atoms. In the solid state, the glucose group of (1) plays an important role in constructing an unusual supramolecular motif. The structure analysis revealed adjacent molecules linked together through intermolecular O-H...O hydrogen bonds to generate a banded structure. Furthermore, the banded structures are linked into a three-dimensional network by interesting hydrogen bonds.

METHODS: We sought to quantify and assess heterogeneity of the preferences of AML patients for treatment outcomes. An AML-specific discrete choice experiment (DCE) was developed involving multiple stakeholders. Attributes included in the DCE were event-free survival (EFS), complete remission (CR), time in the hospital, short-term side effects, and long-term side effects. Continuously coded conditional, stratified, and latent-class logistic regressions were used to model preferences of 294 patients with AML. RESULTS: Most patients were white (89.4%) and in remission (95.0%). A 10% improvement in the chance of CR was the most meaningful offered benefit (P < 0.001). Patients were willing to trade up to 22 months of EFS or endure 8.7 months in the hospital or a two-step increase in long-term side effects to gain a 10% increase in chance of CR. Patients diagnosed at 60 years or older (21.6%) more strongly preferred to avoid short-term side effects (P = 0.03). Latent class analysis showed significant differences of preferences across gender and insurance status. CONCLUSIONS: In this national sample of mostly AML survivors, patients preferred treatments that maximized chance at remission; however, significant preference heterogeneity for outcomes was identified. Age and gender may affect patients' preferences. IMPACT: Survivor preferences for outcomes can inform patient-focused drug development and shared decision-making. Further studies are necessary to investigate the use of DCEs to guide treatment for individual patients.","['Richardson, Daniel R', 'Crossnohere, Norah L', 'Seo, Jaein', 'Estey, Elihu', ""O'Donoghue, Bernadette"", 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Bridges, John F P']","['Richardson DR', 'Crossnohere NL', 'Seo J', 'Estey E', ""O'Donoghue B"", 'Smith BD', 'Bridges JFP']","['UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. richardson@unc.edu.', 'The Cecil G.

Routine karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques lack sensitivity for smaller genomic alternations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays are being increasingly utilized for assessment of these various lesions. However, standard NGS lacks quantitative sensitivity for minimal residual disease (MRD) surveillance due to an inherently high error rate. METHODS: Primary bone marrow samples from pediatric leukemia (n = 32) and adult leukemia subjects (n = 5), cell line MV4-11, and an umbilical cord sample were utilized for this study. Samples were sequenced using molecular barcoding with targeted DNA and RNA library enrichment techniques based on anchored multiplexed PCR (AMP(R)) technology, amplicon based error-corrected sequencing (ECS) or a human cancer transcriptome assay. Computational analyses were performed to quantitatively assess limit of detection (LOD) for various DNA and RNA lesions, which could be systematically used for MRD assays. RESULTS: Matched leukemia patient samples were analyzed at three time points; diagnosis, end of induction (EOI), and relapse. Similar to flow cytometry for ALL MRD, the LOD for point mutations by these sequencing strategies was >/=0.001. For DNA structural variants, FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) positive cell line and patient samples showed a LOD of >/=0.001 in addition to previously unknown copy number losses in leukemia genes. ECS in RNA identified multiple novel gene fusions, including a SPANT-ABL gene fusion in an ALL patient, which could have been used to alter therapy. Collectively, ECS for RNA demonstrated a quantitative and complex landscape of RNA molecules with 12% of the molecules representing gene fusions, 12% exon duplications, 8% exon deletions, and 68% with retained introns. Droplet digital PCR validation of ECS-RNA confirmed results to single mRNA molecule quantities. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these assays enable a highly sensitive, comprehensive, and simultaneous analysis of various clonal leukemic mutations, which can be tracked across disease states (diagnosis, EOI, and relapse) with a high degree of sensitivity. The approaches and results presented here highlight the ability to use NGS for MRD tracking.","['Crowgey, Erin L', 'Mahajan, Nitin', 'Wong, Wing Hing', 'Gopalakrishnapillai, Anilkumar', 'Barwe, Sonali P', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Druley, Todd E']","['Crowgey EL', 'Mahajan N', 'Wong WH', 'Gopalakrishnapillai A', 'Barwe SP', 'Kolb EA', 'Druley TE']","[""Biomedical Research Department, Nemours / A.I.

CK2 is frequently upregulated in acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and can be targeted by the ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor CX-4945. While reduced proliferation of tumor entities including B-ALL after CX-4945 incubation has been shown in vitro and in vivo, the detailed way of action is unknown. Here, we investigated the influence on the PI3K/AKT and apoptosis cascades in vivo and in vitro for further clarification. METHODS: A B-ALL xenograft model in NSG mice was used to perform in vivo longitudinal bioluminescence imaging during six day CX-4945 treatment. CX-4945 serum levels were determined at various time points. Flow cytometry of bone marrow and spleen cells was performed to analyze CX-4945-induced effects on tumor cell proliferation and distribution in B-ALL engrafted mice. ALL cells were enriched and characterized by targeted RNA sequencing. In vitro, B-ALL cell lines SEM, RS4;11 and NALM-6 were incubated with CX-4945 and gene expression of apoptosis regulators BCL6 and BACH2 was determined. RESULTS: In B-ALL-engrafted mice, overall tumor cell proliferation and distribution was not significantly influenced by CK2 inhibition. CX-4945 was detectable in serum during therapy and serum levels declined rapidly after cessation of CX-4945. While overall proliferation was not affected, early bone marrow and spleen blast frequencies seemed reduced after CK2 inhibition. Gene expression analyses revealed reduced expression of anti-apoptotic oncogene BCL6 in bone marrow blasts of CX-4945-treated animals. Further, BCL6 protein expression decreased in B-ALL cell lines exposed to CX-4945 in vitro. Surprisingly, levels of BCL6 opponent and tumor suppressor BACH2 also declined after prolonged incubation. Simultaneously, increased phosphorylation of direct CK2 target and tumor initiator AKT was detected at respective time points, even in initially pAKT-negative cell line NALM-6. CONCLUSIONS: The CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 has limited clinical effects in an in vivo B-ALL xenograft model when applied as a single drug over a six day period.

Chronic inflammation does not seem to be the only contributing factor. Mutations and epigenetic alterations in the CFTR gene may alter susceptibility to develop cancer. Lung cancer is up to now not frequently observed in CF patients. In lung cancer patients without CF low CFTR expression is significantly associated with advanced staging, lymph node metastasis. As the management and life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis have improved substantially in recent years, we expect an increased number of these patients diagnosed with lung cancer. In addition, it is possible that they, as a result of CFTR-dysfunction, will present with more aggressive lung tumors. Treating cancer in CF patients is a challenge because of multi-organ involvement and chronic colonization by resistant pathogens. The effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy in this population needs to be further evaluated.","['Vekens, K', 'Vincken, S', 'Hanon, S', 'Demuynck, K', 'Stylemans, D', 'Vanderhelst, E']","['Vekens K', 'Vincken S', 'Hanon S', 'Demuynck K', 'Stylemans D', 'Vanderhelst E']","['Respiratory Division, University Hospital UZ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Respiratory Division, University Hospital UZ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Respiratory Division, University Hospital UZ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Respiratory Division, University Hospital UZ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Respiratory Division, University Hospital UZ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Respiratory Division, University Hospital UZ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8320-8805'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200305,England,Acta Clin Belg,Acta clinica Belgica,0370306,['126880-72-6 (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)'],IM,"['*Cystic Fibrosis/genetics', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/genetics', 'Humans', '*Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Mutation']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['CFTR', 'immunotherapy', 'lung cancer']",2020/03/07 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17843286.2020.1737780 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Clin Belg. 2021 Oct;76(5):379-380. doi: 10.1080/17843286.2020.1737780.

In this study, we show that NTP-treated solutions (NTS) can induce death in various leukemia cells through mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) ubiquitination. Previously, we manufactured and demonstrated the efficacy of NTS in solid cancers. NTS did not exhibit any deleterious side effects, such as acute death or weight loss in nude mice. In the present study, NTS induced cell death in myeloid leukemia cells, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We found that mTOR was downregulated in NTS-treated cells via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). We also identified 'really interesting new gene' finger protein 126 (RNF126) as a novel binding protein for mTOR through protein arrays and determined the role of E3 ligase in NTS-induced mTOR ubiquitination. NTS-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) affected RNF126 expression and lysosomal dysfunction. These findings suggest that NTS has potential antileukemic effects through RNF126-mediated mTOR ubiquitination with no deleterious side effects. Thus, NTS may represent a new therapeutic method for chemotherapy-resistant leukemia.","['Kim, Sun-Yong', 'Kim, Hyo Jeong', 'Kim, Haeng Jun', 'Kim, Chul-Ho']","['Kim SY', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim CH']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Oncoprotein Modification and Regulation Research Center, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Oncoprotein Modification and Regulation Research Center, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Oncoprotein Modification and Regulation Research Center, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Oncoprotein Modification and Regulation Research Center, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon 16499, Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Plasma Gases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF126 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Plasma Gases/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",PMC7140413,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Non-thermal plasma', '*RNF126', '*leukemia', '*lysosome', '*mTOR', '*ubiquitination']",2020/03/07 06:00,2021/03/12 06:00,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9030595 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9030595 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Mar 2;9(3). pii: cells9030595. doi: 10.3390/cells9030595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein family members are sentinel molecules that regulate the mitochondrial apoptosis machinery and arbitrate cell fate through a delicate balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. The recognition of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 gene as an oncogenic driver in hematological malignancies has directed attention toward unraveling the biological significance of each of the BCL-2 superfamily members in cancer progression and garnered interest in the targeting of apoptosis in cancer therapy. Accordingly, the approval of venetoclax (ABT-199), a small molecule BCL-2 inhibitor, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia has become the proverbial torchbearer for novel candidate drug approaches selectively targeting the BCL-2 superfamily. Despite the inspiring advances in this field, much remains to be learned regarding the optimal therapeutic context for BCL-2 targeting. Functional assays, such as through BH3 profiling, may facilitate prediction of treatment response, development of drug resistance and shed light on rational combinations of BCL-2 inhibitors with other branches of cancer therapy. This review summarizes the pathological roles of the BCL-2 family members in cancer, discusses the current landscape of their targeting in clinical practice, and highlights the potential for future therapeutic inroads in this important area.","['Ngoi, Natalie Yan Li', 'Choong, Clarice', 'Lee, Joanne', 'Bellot, Gregory', 'Wong, Andrea Li Ann', 'Goh, Boon Cher', 'Pervaiz, Shazib']","['Ngoi NYL', 'Choong C', 'Lee J', 'Bellot G', 'Wong ALA', 'Goh BC', 'Pervaiz S']","['Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, Singapore 119228, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, Singapore 119228, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, Singapore 119228, Singapore.', 'Department of Hand & Reconstructive Microsurgery, University Orthopedic, Hand & Reconstructive Microsurgery Cluster, National University Health System, Singapore 119228, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, Singapore 119228, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, Singapore 119228, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117593, Singapore.', 'NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119077, Singapore.', 'National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, Singapore 119228, Singapore.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2071-0715'],['eng'],"['MOH-FLWSHP19may-0006/National Medical Research Council', 'NMRC/TA17nov003/National Medical Research Council', 'NMRC/CSA-SI/0006/2016/National Medical Research Council', 'NMRC CIRG/1433/2015/National Medical Research Council', 'OFIRG/0041/2017/National Medical Research Council']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200302,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7139457,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'BCL-xL', 'MCL-1', 'apoptosis', 'cancer therapeutics', 'targeted therapy']",2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:01,['2020/03/06 06:00'],"['2020/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12030574 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12030574 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Mar 2;12(3). pii: cancers12030574. doi: 10.3390/cancers12030574.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the therapeutic potential of targeting these kinases is understudied due to a lack of potent, specific small molecules available. Here, we present the discovery and characterization of a pan-PI5P4K inhibitor, THZ-P1-2, that covalently targets cysteines on a disordered loop in PI5P4Kalpha/beta/gamma. THZ-P1-2 demonstrates cellular on-target engagement with limited off-targets across the kinome. AML/ALL cell lines were sensitive to THZ-P1-2, consistent with PI5P4K's reported role in leukemogenesis. THZ-P1-2 causes autophagosome clearance defects and upregulation in TFEB nuclear localization and target genes, disrupting autophagy in a covalent-dependent manner and phenocopying the effects of PI5P4K genetic deletion. Our studies demonstrate that PI5P4Ks are tractable targets, with THZ-P1-2 as a useful tool to further interrogate the therapeutic potential of PI5P4K inhibition and inform drug discovery campaigns for these lipid kinases in cancer metabolism and other autophagy-dependent disorders.","['Sivakumaren, Sindhu Carmen', 'Shim, Hyeseok', 'Zhang, Tinghu', 'Ferguson, Fleur M', 'Lundquist, Mark R', 'Browne, Christopher M', 'Seo, Hyuk-Soo', 'Paddock, Marcia N', 'Manz, Theresa D', 'Jiang, Baishan', 'Hao, Ming-Feng', 'Krishnan, Pranav', 'Wang, Diana G', 'Yang, T Jonathan', 'Kwiatkowski, Nicholas P', 'Ficarro, Scott B', 'Cunningham, James M', 'Marto, Jarrod A', 'Dhe-Paganon, Sirano', 'Cantley, Lewis C', 'Gray, Nathanael S']","['Sivakumaren SC', 'Shim H', 'Zhang T', 'Ferguson FM', 'Lundquist MR', 'Browne CM', 'Seo HS', 'Paddock MN', 'Manz TD', 'Jiang B', 'Hao MF', 'Krishnan P', 'Wang DG', 'Yang TJ', 'Kwiatkowski NP', 'Ficarro SB', 'Cunningham JM', 'Marto JA', 'Dhe-Paganon S', 'Cantley LC', 'Gray NS']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', ""Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.', ""Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Blais Proteomics Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA."", ""Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Blais Proteomics Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10065, USA.

Hematopoiesis is the process that drives the formation of new blood cells from a single stem cell. This is a complex, orchestrated and tightly regulated process that occurs within the bone marrow. When such process is faulty or deregulated, leukemia arises, develops and thrives by subverting normal hematopoiesis and availing the supplies of this rich milieu.In this book chapter we will describe and characterize the bone marrow microenvironment and its key importance for leukemia expansion. The several components of the bone marrow niche, their interaction with the leukemic cells and the cellular pathways activated within the malignant cells will be emphasized. Finally, novel therapeutic strategies to target this sibling interaction will also be discussed.","['Cardoso, Bruno Antonio']",['Cardoso BA'],"['Instituto de Medicina Molecular Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal. bcardoso@medicina.ulisboa.pt.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', '*Disease Progression', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche/drug effects', '*Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow', 'Dual-targeting', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia', 'Microenvironment', 'Signaling pathways']",2020/03/05 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2020/03/05 06:00'],"['2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-030-34025-4_14 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2020;1219:259-293. doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-34025-4_14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
